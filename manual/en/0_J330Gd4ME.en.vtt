00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.890
When I finally die, although I don’t believe
it will ever happen, I want my gravestone

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.320
to say: Here lies Ryan.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.790
He loved his wife, he loved his children,
and he loved The Legend of Zelda.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.060
The Legend of Zelda The Minish Cap holds a
very special place in my heart.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.550
It came out right at the end of the Gameboy
Advanced’s lifetime and everyone knew it

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.650
was going to be the last Zelda made from the
classic top down perspective.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.840
And I did not know how to handle that.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.910
I mean, I loved Ocarina of Time and Majora’s
Mask but there was something just, magical,

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.180
something special about top down Zelda.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.970
If it was good enough for A Link to the Past,
than it was good enough for me.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:17.390
But atlas, The Minish Cap was the last ride,
and thankfully it is a memorial one.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.790
The game starts out like most Zelda games
start.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.140
You are a young, cap-less, Link and you are
asked to the Picori Festival by Princess Zelda.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.710
Nothing could go wrong, right?

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:36.530
Well, things do go wrong and Zelda is turned
to stone and it is up to Link to save her.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.470
Link soon meets Ezlo, a minish who got transformed
into a mix between a bird and a cap.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.710
He becomes friends with Link and joins him
on his quest and because he doesn’t have

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.369
legs he rides ontop of Link’s head.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.790
This is where Link first gets that green hat
that will stay with him throughout the series.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.690
Link’s quest requires him to restore power
to the mythical Picori Sword.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.100
You will grow to love Ezlo, with his funny
comments and actions.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:24.810
This is how he quickly became my favorite
of Link’s companions.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.000
Minish Cap introduces some new things to the
Zelda formula.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.989
While A Link to the Past had you go back and
forth between worlds, the Minish Cap has you

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.239
going back and forth between sizes.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.890
There is a new race here, the Minish.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.070
They are a race of small people that are invisible
to humans.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.350
With help of Ezlo, Link can shrink down to
Minish size and see Hyrule from a whole new

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.080
perspective.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.580
This will help you with puzzle solving with
some areas only being accessible when you

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.230
are Minish size.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.580
These moments also look really great, with
objects like raindrops becoming boulders and

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.050
leaves that are bigger than Link.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:14.260
It really makes you feel like you are the
size of a thumb nail.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.440
And this wouldn’t be a Zelda game without
items to help you explore.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.390
Of course some stables like the boomerang
and shield are back but new is the Gust Jar,

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.769
which can be used to suck up enemies or shoot
out gusts of wind.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.910
It comes in handy and you will feel comfortable
with it right away.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.280
Also new are Kinstones, which are broken medallions
you will find throughout your adventure.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.470
Most of the characters in the game has Kinstones
pieces and if you find the other half and

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.419
combine them, you can unlock things in Hyrule,
such as new areas opening up or treasure chests.

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:58.600
It really encourages you to explore everywhere.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.100
The game truly looks amazing.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.480
Link is animated very nicely and the world
of Hyrule really comes to life.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.380
The game is squeezing every little ounce of
power out of the GBA.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.350
But it goes beyond just the graphics.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.070
It’s the little tricks like when Link is
Minish size that really bring you into the

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.590
world.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.250
With the graphics, the characters and classic
gameplay, it makes the game one of the best

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.070
in the series, which is saying a lot.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.570
If this as it seems to be and the last Zelda
game from this perspective, it is great to

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.480
see its last entry be this good.
