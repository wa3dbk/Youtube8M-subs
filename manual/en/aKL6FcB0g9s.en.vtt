00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.780
Welcome to the Preseason Spotlight. In
this video, we're going to introduce

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.620
the biggest changes coming for the
jungle, objectives, and items in the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.300
2015 Preseason. You can think of this
as a high-level overview – if you

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.660
want more details, hit up the preseason
microsite and the patch notes.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.500
Before we get to the krugs and
gromps of what’s changing, let’s

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.340
talk about the big focus for 2015:
strategic diversity. In other

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.340
words, it's giving you more paths
to victory so your in-game

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.848
decisions matter just as much
as the champions that you pick.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.760
Alright, jungle. Important thing here is
jungle diversity. Sounds an awful lot

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.420
like last year’s preseason, but we’re
taking a different approach for 2015.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.540
We've got new item paths, Smite’s got
some shiny upgrades, and we're making

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.000
monsters tougher to better differentiate
between your Warwicks and your Rammi.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.400
Also there's a crab.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.480
First, spirit items are gone.
Hunter’s Machete now upgrades

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.975
into four new items, each changing
Smite in a different way.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.976
Stalker’s Blade is
gank-focused, letting you

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:13.975
smite enemy champions
for damage and a slow.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.640
Poacher’s Knife is for the
counterjunglers, giving you bonuses

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.740
when Smiting down camps on the
enemy side of the jungle.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.180
Skirmisher’s Sabre is a dueling upgrade.
Smite an opponent

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.560
and gain a combat buff against
them for a few seconds.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.240
Finally, Ranger’s Trailblazer is
your farm-focused pickup, turning

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.900
your Smite into an AoE and
restoring health and mana on use.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.980
You can also buy enchantments, ensuring
you get the end-game stats you need.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.780
Be sure to read up on those because
we’re not explaining them here.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.180
We’re also adding bonuses for smiting monsters.
Smite the raptors

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.920
to get a true-sight buff when you’re spotted by a ward.
Murkwolves recruit a ghost that provides

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:10.060
vision, Gromp hooks you up with a poisonous thornmail,
Krugs let you stun monsters every few attacks,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.340
and smiting red or blue restores health or mana.
You can probably figure out which is which.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.000
Finally, under the jungle category
we’ve got your new favorite camp:

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.380
the Rift Scuttler. This tanky
crustacean actively avoids combat,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.100
but if you bring him down he gives
vision of either the Baron or

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.760
Dragon pit and a speed shrine for
all of your teammates. Thanks crab.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.260
Next up, let’s talk about objectives.
They’re changing. Strategically.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.000
First, turrets. There are new
regenerating shields on the inner turret

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.400
which spread to nearby allies, providing
extra safety against sieging.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.720
And yes, what you’re seeing,
that’s a laser. This is

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.140
a new change for the inhibitor
turret, and it slows

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.400
and causes whoever it hits
to deal less damage to

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.980
help deal with those pesky
split-pushing Jaxes.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.920
Baron's a badass now instead of
a lategame snack. Not only will

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.580
you have to actually pay attention
when taking down Baron but,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.620
when you finally do, Baron buff
now lets you recall twice as

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.820
fast while also giving your
nearby minions super siege power.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.960
Dragon and turrets have always had similar rewards -- gold. To create strategic differences,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.180
Dragon now no longer gives gold but grants a
permanent stacking buff on kill. The buffs go up as

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.840
your team secures more Dragons, adding up to the
giga stack bonus. Kill five dragons for your team

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.820
and you’re going to hit like a monster truck
wearing a suit of larger, cooler monster trucks.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.780
This year we focused on strategic
items that benefit your

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.260
team more than just giving you
an individual pile of stats.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.320
First, there are new Elixirs. Ruin gives
bonus damage to towers and boosts your split

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:58.580
pushing, Sorcery gives ability power and true
damage on hit, Iron buffs your size, and boosts

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.440
the movement speed of any ally who follows you, and
Wrath gives attack damage and some life steal.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.600
Each of these is tailored to your
specific needs at any point in the game.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.280
Second, meet Righteous Glory. Stats aside,
Righteous Glory’s active gives a big

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.960
movement speed bonus when running toward
those those super annoying disengage teams.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.240
After a few seconds, you’ll
emit a massive slowing

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.560
pulse that hits all
nearby enemy champions.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.600
Sadly, the movement speed
bonus does not scale

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.740
up with how annoying the enemy team is.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.560
In short, the philosophy we’re pursuing is around the ways you look to win

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.560
and the paths to victory your team can take.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.320
And this is just the beginning.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.080
Preseason is a time when we can experiment heavily with League to bring it to a better place, 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.780
and there are a lot of changes we haven’t mentioned in the video.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.600
Be sure to check out the microsite and the patch notes for more details but, for now,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.260
this is your Preseason spotlight signing off.
