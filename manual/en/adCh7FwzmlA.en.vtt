Welcome back to Expert Village. I'm DJ Shy
and I want to go in to further detail about

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:17.040
turn tables. Now a turn table looks like this.
You basically would like to get Techniques.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.220
They are definitely industry standard. There
is also different brands such as Vestech turn

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.750
tables, Nu-mark, Stanton I believe are turn
tables. But the industry standard is Techniques.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.550
Techniques 1200 but however I have the 1210's.
Basically when you purchase a set of turn

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.829
tables, Techniques comes with three wires.
A lot of turn tables do not come with half

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:52.030
of these wires so you would have to purchase
them separately. This is actually the ground

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:59.690
wire. This is your RCA cord, and of course
your power cord right here. Techniques also

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:08.520
comes with a rubber mat which goes on first,
a plastic slip mat, and then your regular

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.359
slip mat. The plastic slip mat is here so
that whenever you want to scratch, it's a

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:22.049
little bit more smooth. Right here, as you
can see is a power button, you just slip it

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.639
off or on. Right now this one isn't plugged.
Let's go into this one right here since it's

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:34.609
already has electricity inside, so off/on.
In order to start your record you just press

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:42.740
start/stop. Also sometimes, it gets really
dark at the night clubs so you want some light,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.270
that's what this if for, just press that button
and out comes the light. Now this contraption

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.689
here is where you want to insert the needle.
The needle is placed on here in order to spin

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:07.240
your record. This is called the pitch adjustment.
If you slide the pitch down so that it's negative

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.420
it will slow the record. If you increase it,
it will speed the record. If you put it on

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.319
zero, that's the normal speed of your song.
This is basically what a turn table looks

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.659
like for vinyl records.
