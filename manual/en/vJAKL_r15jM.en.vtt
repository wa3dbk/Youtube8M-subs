00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:08.180
 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.500
My name is Tamara, I'm 35 years old and I chose the Volkswagen T1

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.519
because I dreamt of owning a mobile home for quite some time

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.800
We'd found a van in the US and decided to have it shipped to The Netherlands

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810
 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.800
but the owner changed his mind at the last moment so the plan fell through

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.000
We continued our online search and that same night we were lucky enough to find the exact same version in the UK

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We booked a couple of one-way tickets, flew over there and checked out the van

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.500
We ended up liking it so much we drove it all the way back to The Netherlands

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.040
and that alone turned out to be a fun and special trip in itself

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.300
We drove back via Dunkirk and once back in The Netherlands we started working mainly on the van's technical aspects

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:04.320
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.400
the bottom has been painted and although it was covered in flush rust it's completely original and non-welded

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.100
In April of this year we've had it taken apart and painted in these particular colours

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.200
since it is an original colour used in 1965 and I liked it somewhat better

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.200
When it rolled off the production belt it was evenly white, but I personally wasn't entirely happy with that colour

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.800
The bicolour suits this particular model very well so that's why these colours were chosen

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.880
 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.200
About a Month ago the restoration was, more or less, completed

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.900
The ceiling and the rubbers have been replaced and we've searched for the authentic, original parts

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.000
like for example the aluminium cups in the little cupboard

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.780
Additionally I keep looking out for items from the same time frame

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:09.200
which match in order to form a unity. Even with the china and everything else used with it

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:18.000
I recently found the original fitted stove which goes into the cabinet. These are the little things that complete the image

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.069
 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:26.800
and I believe our family knows how to enjoy its style and ethos when we take it on a trip

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.600
I'd never driven one before, its steering is quite different

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.000
When in the UK we had to drive on the left hand side, quite exciting at times

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.549
but fun at the same time. Definitely a very special experience

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.959
And the response you get from people when driving the van is amazing

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.700
everyone greets you with an enthusiastic wave and films you

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.700
which is such a fun and uplifting experience

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:05.100
The van feels like driving around on your living room couch, there're no separate seats so it does feel like sitting on a couch

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.109
 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:11.200
You do tend to lean on the wheel while driving

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.269
 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.500
And since it is quite low you lean forward a little which causes you to assume a somewhat strange posture

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.800
It took a while to get used to but once you get the hang of it you'll love the way it drives

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.200
We sometimes take the van to a nearby lake and go for a swim

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.200
By now people know us so we're allowed to park the van right at the lakeside. Simply amazing

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.600
We park right on the shore so we can enjoy its view all day while we have a good time

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.800
and at night it's parked in the garage

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.800
Another reason for choosing a van is going on camping trips when we had kids

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.889
 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.179
it's something you can enjoy doing as a family, I think

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:56.100
And it truly is something we can share and enjoy together

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.700
this was yet another reason for me to own a T1

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.099
 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:14.200
What I love about this van is the look and feel of the '50s and '60's that comes with it

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.779
when first produced

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:24.700
That is something I'm trying to establish with the van, by using details

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.400
combined with the colours of both tent and van

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:39.100
I am striving to revive the idea from times past, the way it was used back then

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110
 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:48.100
Not just the snug feeling, but also the style, the colours, the shape and a little conventionality  is really appealing

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.129
 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:55.100
To top it all off is the camping, it feels very homely yet very free at the same time

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.300
setting up camp randomly, anywhere you like is a combination of things I love

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.500
This is an experience I want to bestow on my children and have them take part in it

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.800
and so far they absolutely enjoy it so I think we can call it a success

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.700
The nostalgic feeling that comes with the van and its era is what I wanted to create

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.700
and absolutely love

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:28.700
