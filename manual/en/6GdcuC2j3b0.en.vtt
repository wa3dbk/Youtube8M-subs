00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.310
Hillyard, the leader in floor coatings
technology for the away-from-home market,

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.570
is changing the game and floor finish
application. The Multi-Flo XP floor

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.929
finish applicator delivers improved
productivity and better results with

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.119
minimal training. The Multi-Flo XP is
fast! Apply floor finish at rates up to

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.050
10,000 square feet per hour in open
areas like hallways, gymnasiums, and

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.789
multi-purpose rooms. In smaller rooms,
productivity rates of 6000 square feet

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.109
per hour are common. That's a typical 900
square foot classroom in less than 10

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.370
minutes. Multi-Flo XP can be used on
many surfaces, including resilient and

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.710
vinyl tile, wood, terrazzo, and smooth
concrete. Our 100+ years of floor

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.520
care experience have led to a design that
consistently delivers better results

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.020
with minimal operator training. Four
independent swivel casters allow for

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.520
maximum maneuverability. It's easy for an
operator to get the Multi-Flo XP into

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:02.879
tight corners, around pillars, or moving
in a straight line. The articulating

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.270
handle gives the operator complete
control and the freedom to perfectly

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.680
position the Multi-Flo XP in the
tightest spots. The battery-operated pump

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.640
system quickly dispenses finish. At the
touch of a button, saturate the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.540
application head and keep a consistent
well of finish to maintain a wet edge, a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.860
key to avoiding streaks and achieving
better results. Testing has shown that

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.490
Multi-Flo XP will run for about 100,000 square feet on a single charge.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.450
When it's time to recharge the battery,
simply plug the charger into an easy

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.430
accessible and protected charger port.
Looking at traditional methods, it's just

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.180
not natural to push and pull a heavily
saturated finish mop across the floor.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.890
The upper body is constantly moving,
stretching, and reaching. Multi-Flo XP

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.240
offers better ergonomic design to improve
operator health and safety. When applying

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.500
finish with a Multi-Flo XP, the operator
uses a natural upright walking position,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.030
and all the finish weight is distributed
over four large casters, making it easier

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.380
to position the applicator. Multi-Flo XP
can use multiple container options

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.299
including bag-in-box,
five-gallon buckets, or 2 &amp; a half gallon

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.160
containers. Unlike traditional systems,
Multi-Flo XP is easy to clean,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.970
finishes use right out of its own
container, no buckets reservoirs or

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.940
special backpacks to fill, clean, or pour
leftover finish from.
