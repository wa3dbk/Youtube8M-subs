Hi, I'm James and I'm from SpyCameraCCTV

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.700
In today's video we're going to be looking
at some quick hints and tips for how to set-up

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.139
your Digital Wireless CCTV system

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.869
When initially setting up your Digital Wireless
CCTV system we strongly recommend having a

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.660
thorough read-through the manual

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.490
Sit down, grab a cup of tea, read through
it thoroughly and make sure you understand

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.380
exactly how the system works

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.470
This is the opportunity to practice using
your system making sure the cameras are paired

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.000
correctly and the system is working correctly

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.280
The most important element with the Digital
Wireless systems when setting them up is to

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.220
make sure that the SD card is inserted into
the device

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.500
If the SD card isn't inserted to begin with
the device won't pick up the SD card

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.620
It's really simple: you just have your SD card
and it goes into the SD card slot

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.260
Now it is time to power the system and check
that your cameras are working before you screw

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:57.860
them into place

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.799
As you can see we've set the system up on
our table here

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.239
We recommend that you do the same: set it
up on your kitchen table, plug in the power

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.200
adaptors, they're all labelled and make sure
the cameras are paired with the screen

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.850
It's a very good idea to do this on your kitchen
table before you screw them into place

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.270
If you have any cameras that aren't paired
with the recorder you can pair them with the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.280
screen very easily

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.189
All you do is go into the system menus, select
pairing and press OK

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.920
You then have 2 minutes to pair the camera
with the recorder

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.869
On the back of the camera there is a pair
button

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.329
Again if you do this on a kitchen table you
can just press the pair button and the camera

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:36.069
will pair with the screen

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.030
Now that you know that the cameras are working
with the receiver you can now place them where

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.509
you want to

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.469
Although the digital wireless CCTV system
has a range of 150 metres this is in clear

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:47.539
line-of-sight

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.939
Other objects, such as walls, windows, buildings
and trees can impact on the signal strength

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.719
Bear that in mind when you are placing your
cameras

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.520
There are various ways that you can do to
improve the wireless performance and range

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.499
The main option is to use one of our 7dB aerials

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:09.420
These aerials will increase the range and
improve the signal strength of your camera

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.980
Crucially they also come with a 1.5 metre
cable

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.770
This cable will allow you to move the aerial
further away from the camera to do different

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.790
locations

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.630
As much as 3 or 4 centimetres either side
of where the camera sits could make a massive

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.410
difference to your signal strength

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.020
It's worth playing around with these aerials
and placing them in the best location for

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.460
your particular scenario

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.180
You can also wire this aerial through a wall
so that the camera doesn't have to transmit

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.830
through it

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.140
Once you are happy that the camera will talk
to the receiver you can now fix it in place

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.750
To capture a detailed image of a subject it's
important to get the camera as close as possible

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.030
to the subject

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.250
Only mount the cameras as high as it needs
to be to be out-of-reach of vandals

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.890
Another tip is to position the camera so that
the subject walks towards the camera, not

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.900
across the camera's field-of-view

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.100
The final point is to do with Wi-Fi interference

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.350
These Digital Wireless CCTV kits operate on
the 2.4GHz spectrum

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.320
This means they are shared with a lot of Wi-Fi
devices. If you are in an area with high Wi-Fi

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.370
usage you might find it difficult to get a
clear channel with the camera

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.700
The solution to this is to re-pair the camera
to a different channel

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.140
For example if your camera is on channel 1
and you're not getting a very good signal

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.130
you could try moving it to channel 4 or channel
3

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.180
The further away you get from the interference
the better the signal strength will be

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.280
In a 4-camera set-up you could find that camera
1 is suffering from interference but camera

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.970
4 isn't. If you swap those channel around
you might find that your 4 cameras will work

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.390
fine because channel 1 will be in a different
location

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.770
It's worth playing around with the channel
pairing to make sure that you get the best

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.330
signal strength possible

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.490
Some of Digital Wireless systems also have
mobile access. To find out how to set this

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.480
up please see our separate video

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.200
Finally just a point on system check-up. This
system will run quite happily for months at

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.730
a time but it's a really good idea to check
up on it every couple of days, every week,

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:03.620
every month

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.430
Maybe consider setting up something in your
diary so that every week you go back and check

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.430
the system to make sure that it is working
properly

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.820
