00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.130
Now I'll show you how to install our strap
to our bag. You want to choose the bag that's

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:16.099
going to be on the outside, and I'm going
to place my strap just on the waistband here

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:27.279
and beside the belt loop, and then we'll sew
those on. And again, over here so that it

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:34.950
overlaps down on the waistband so that we
can do some good reinforcing sewing to attach

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:45.629
it. You're going to be sewing one to the front
like this, and then also in the back. So to

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:54.730
have them match, you can lay it like that
and then place it in the same position on

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:04.330
the back. And then we'll go to the sewing
machine and sew them on. Okay, put your pants

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.330
on the machine. There's the straps. And we're
going to sew. We want to sew a little box

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.370
with a criss cross in it to make sure that
this is sewed on really well. So go right

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.220
across the top, put your needle down and lift
the pressure foot and pivot the material around,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:33.000
and then sew down almost to the bottom of
the waistband making sure that you're catching

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:44.350
the strap underneath. Put the needle down
again, and we're going to sew a little box.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:53.670
And before you go off the strap again, put
the needle down and pivot the material. When

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.160
you get to the corner, again, put the needle
down and we'll pivot the machine, pivot the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.450
fabric, and we'll sew from this corner to
this corner. We're going to make an X inside

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:19.360
the box. And lift, go back up to this top
edge and put the needle in, turn the material,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.260
and we're going to be sewing from this corner
to this corner. Now we have a nicely sewn

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.230
on strap. It'll be nice and strong. And make
sure you back, back and forth a little to

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.200
secure that. You want to sew all the straps
on like this.
