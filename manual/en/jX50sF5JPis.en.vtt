00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.290
Carlie: Well for a couple of weeks I’d been
getting really tired. A couple times at the

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.219
dance I would have to sit down because I’d
be getting too dizzy and too tired. Even like

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.550
climbing the stairs at school was a lot of
work. You’re thinking, you’re like, ‘What’s

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.560
wrong with me? This isn’t me. I’m in good
shape.’

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.270
And then March 19th was the day that I went
to go to the doctors and get blood work done.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.690
Jeannie, Parent: That’s when he told me
that they think that it was cancer.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.430
Carlie: When Dr. Kolb came in, I just remember
him saying, you know, ‘You have leukemia.’

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.699
That really shocked me. I was a normal teenager
who thought, you know, ‘I’m invincible,

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.640
I don’t get illnesses, this only happens
to other people.’ And then I became the

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.079
other person.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.720
Dr. Kolb: So, a patient like Carlie, as soon
as they come in, we start to talk to them

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:54.670
about clinical research – what it means
to participate in a trail and the opportunities

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.219
that that gives the patients, both in terms
of new access to care and also offer them

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.030
access to drugs that they wouldn’t otherwise
have access to. Each of the sites within the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.020
Nemours Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders
are members of the Children’s Oncology Group,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.140
the only National Cancer Institute Cooperative
Group to do cancer clinical trials in children.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.090
Dr. Sandler: Because we have the four practices
we have in Wilmington, in Orlando, in Pensacola

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.270
and here in Jacksonville, together when we’re
all pooling our resources and putting the

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.390
patients on the same studies, we really have
one of the largest programs in the country now.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.979
“Dr. Naga”: The National Cancer Institute,
or the NCI, has developed a network of Community

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.079
Oncology Research Programs, called NCORP.
Nemours has been designated as one of only

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.939
two pediatric programs in the nation. There
aren’t as many pediatric programs that come

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.229
together to combine research efforts and to
bring to the community.

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.079
Dr. Schwartz: It’s really a way to really
bring together the four campuses on a research

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:53.670
platform.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.159
Dr. Sandler: Children are only one percent
of all the cancers that occur in the U.S.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.369
And so if we didn’t all work together we’d
never get those answers and know how to improve

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.179
the care we’re giving. And so every patient
is offered to participate in research studies.

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.540
Barb Plummer, RN: When we explain clinical
trials to families, usually we offer what’s

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.860
the best available treatment or the best available
treatment with a tiny change. So we do clinical

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.280
trials for lots of reasons, but overall to
improve the quality of care and the outcomes

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.360
for our families.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.320
Dr. Kolb: Doctors, nurses, all of our support
staff – everybody within the Nemours Center

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.480
for Cancer and Blood Disorders – is part
of the research team. We’re all very much

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.900
involved in the mission of improving the care
of these children. One of our focuses is to

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.160
maximize the quality of life of that child
during treatment and for many many years to come.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.950
Jeannie: When Dr. Kolb asked us to participate
in research, he just explained to us, you

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.470
know, like the pros of everything for it.
And it was good because, you know, if she

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.630
got chosen for certain things it’s kind
of like another set of eyes. It’s just that

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.330
it’s – eventually it will help some other
child.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.250
Dr. Napper: At a very fundamental level, at
a genetic level, on a biochemical level, childhood

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.090
cancer is different from adult cancer. It
arises through different mechanisms. And as

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.470
a result, it’s not always well treated by
current cancer drugs that were designed for

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.920
adults. So our goal is to come up with targeted
drugs that are specifically designed for kids.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.580
Barb Plummer, RN: Chemo therapies are very
very harsh drugs. With these harsh drugs comes

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.680
the killing of normal cells and these normal
cells are blood cells and cells that grow

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.890
fast, the cells in your mouth, your hair cells.
And these cause a lot of side effects.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.880
Carlie: The tough days were mostly with this
round. And I couldn’t take care of myself,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.780
like with just daily things that you know
normal people can do. I didn’t have energy

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.220
to get up by myself or, you know, even talk
sometimes.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.760
Barb Plummer, RN: And we do everything that
we can to make sure that those side effects

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.830
are alleviated as much as possible.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.670
Carlie: But I’ve been pretty grateful. And
I’ve been doing well, 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.400
even when I’ve been doing not so great.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.190
Mary Newman, RN: At Nemours, we have an institutional review board that really oversees the safe

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.930
and effective application of those clinical
trials. Nurses are involved in monitoring

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.560
those patients and reporting out any negative
side effects. And at any time we could stop

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.500
those clinical trials if there were concerns.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.640
Dr. Kolb: On the clinical side, we’ve identified
genes and mutations that exist in leukemia

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.830
cells so a drug can be used to treat it. And
Dr. Napper is working specifically in his

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.270
lab to find a drug that fits just that cancer.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.100
Dr. Napper: It’s really, I mean a very small
number of labs nationwide or even worldwide that have

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.100
that focus, the high throughput screening technology that we have on pediatric disease.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.100
Dr. Kolb: I think that this represents our
mission, which is a mission to bring clinical

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.470
research to the community, to bring the best
quality of care to the community, and to use

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.570
the patient experience to drive progress in
cancer research.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.210
Joe, Parent: Carlie is always taken care of.
We’re always asked do we need this, do we

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.060
need that. It just made everything easy.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.220
“Dr. Naga”: The child comes first. The
family comes first. We will do whatever it

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.060
takes to get them the care they need the way
they want it.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.820
Dr. Schwartz: I love what I do. You know,
when I see a new family, when I walk in the

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.560
room, that’s all I care about.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.960
Dr. Sandler: In my career, we’ve gone from
50 percent of children with cancer being cured

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.639
to 80 percent. We need to go to that hundred
percent.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.190
Carlie: I am looking forward to being home
with my parents and my family. Everybody has

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.910
been really taking care of me and watching
over me and making sure that I do stay in

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.820
remission and that I do stay cancer free.
