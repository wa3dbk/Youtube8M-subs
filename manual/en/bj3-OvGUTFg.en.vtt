We're only hearing a small

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.869
little piece of the tip of an iceberg Wayne State
University. I've been here for many

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.669
years at the University and I had

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.880
no idea of the broad

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.530
range of research that is going on in all of
these different areas,

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.760
and it's really nice to hear all of this
coming together.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.200
I want to begin by telling you that
Wayne State University

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.280
is on of the only universities actually in this
country

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.800
that houses an intermural program

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.450
of NIH at the Perinatology Research Branch.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.640
There is a window of opportunity

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.340
that we're not condemned to have Cerebral Palsy

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.379
and that we can identify

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.990
at the time of birth, with molecular technique

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.090
who is effected.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.070
Wayne is actually one of only three

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.140
programs in

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.640
the United States

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.410
in which American students are permitted, are
invited to train on an annual

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.490
basis in Moscow.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.289
Research,

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.780
creativity, I think, just absolutely go hand-in-hand.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.190
There isn't really much of a distinction between

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.610
the two of them.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.510
But the notion of creativity and freedom, and there 
was a question about creativity in how it

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.300
can be sustained in children.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.560
One of the ways it seems to me is that
the best advice for anything is a good example

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.819
Two areas

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.010
where my lab is interested in is

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.280
contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging.
So we use the magnetic properties of the Lanthanides

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.950
to try and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.860
do things like

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.790
diagnose tumors in an early stage
or diagnose diseases.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.050
There's a lot of different stories that
I could have chosen to tell and there's

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.460
a lot of great research. You could pick anybody here

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.210
and tell a great story.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.970
Because Wayne State

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.230
is the only pediatrics center in the country

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.080
with both MRI

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.509
and PET scanning capability

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.539
in a pediatrics center.

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:14.689
And it's one of the reasons

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:18.419
the children and their families come to
Detroit from all over the country

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.650
because you're not going to find it in
New York,

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.350
you're not going to find it in Boston,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.149
you're not gonna find in Los Angeles.
The only place you're going to find it

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:27.439
is here

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:31.539
in Detroit at Wayne State, the Detroit Medical
Center in the Children's Hospital of

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:32.779
Michigan.
