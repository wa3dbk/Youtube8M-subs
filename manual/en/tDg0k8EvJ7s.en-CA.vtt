00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:03.866
Well, the shed is all done now.
Including this nice door latch.

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:17.183
I added these door stopper
sticks so that the wind couldn't

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:20.253
slam the doors back and forth.

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:22.522
With double doors, it's always
a challenge of how to lock

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:25.224
both doors.
And usually you take one door

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.527
and its attached at the
top and bottom, although on

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:29.929
this one it's just on the top.
And the other door

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.199
attaches to that. But I had
this idea of making, sort of

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.970
a combination latch that is
almost like a barricade bar

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.907
that goes across both doors
and really locks them in place.

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:43.776
I designed the rack and pinion
for that door latch using my

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:46.345
gear generator program.
And then print it out

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.781
and cut that out on the
bandsaw and tried it out.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.620
And it worked really nicely.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.015
To be on the safe side I added
some wood preserving sealant

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.418
to the handle of my door
latch, even though I actually

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.371
made it out of exotic
hardwood.

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:43.035
I used some old scraps of
pressure treated 2 by 6

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:45.004
as sort of a wooden floor
in the shed.

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:47.073
They're just laid flat on
the ground.

00:01:47.074 --> 00:01:50.877
They might rot eventually but it
should be fairly dry in here.

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:53.212
And in here I've got my
car trailer parked.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:57.483
And I made some hooks for
hanging bicycles in there.

00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:00.286
And a shelf for storing
more stuff.

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:03.923
And I've already put lots
of wood up between the rafters.

00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:07.159
Its a really great storage
space for long stuff.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.295
So its worked out really
well, the way I made the walls

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:11.931
because using 2 by 6's
and 2 by 4's

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:13.933
to screw the sheet metal
into.

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:16.702
The screws are too short
to make it all the way through.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:19.539
Whereas if I had used boards
I would have the very sharp points

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.108
from all these screws
sticking in and I'd be

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.210
getting scratched a lot.

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:28.281
And with the studs closer
together and far apart

00:02:28.282 --> 00:02:30.616
I can get a lot of stuff
in between them.

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:33.052
So here, between the
studs, I have a shelf for

00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:35.555
my weedwacker and
my chainsaw.

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:39.425
Now that's an irrefutable
proof of manliness if there ever was one.

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:41.994
And if that's not enough

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.829
Well...
And a bunch of you teenagers

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.798
are probably thinking
I'm gonna make a really

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.867
dirty comment on this video
right now.

00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:49.836
But don't bother because
I always delete those

00:02:49.837 --> 00:03:08.021
as soon as I see them.
