00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.269
We're going to talk about the sewing guide
reference chart that is stored right underneath

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:11.290
the ruler. You just pull that out, this attached
and it's right here. This&nbsp;is like having

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.970
your own little sewing manual and sewing teacher
right at your fingertips. Let me show you

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.820
how you're going to read it.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.010
First off, Viking is known to always give
you recommendations for different fabrics.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.609
Right up here, we have a symbol for woven
fabrics. If you're working with anything like

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.329
denim fabric, cottons, linens that type of
thing, we're going to look at the column first.

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.649
This second column has a picture up here for
stretch fabrics, knits, anything that has

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.699
give in it, sweatshirt fabrics, fleeces too.
That's going to be the second column. Then,

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.190
this little symbol at the top is for leather
or vinyl, suede that type of thing. It always

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.310
looks like road kill to me so that's how I
remember it. That's the third column.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.769
Also at the top is a notation of pressure,
how much firmness the foot needs to sit on

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.110
the fabric for ideal sewing. For the regular
fabrics, you're going to leave it on three.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.900
Those stretchy fabrics,&nbsp;when that pressure
is really, really sitting hard on your fabric,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.060
it stretches it out. Have you ever seen it
kind of come out a little wavy. Well, they

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.510
have you adjust the pressure to one. That's
going to be on the side of your machine,&nbsp;on

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.001
the left side. Above your needle, you'll see
a dial there and we'll talk about it. That

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:27.830
is going to have you reduce it to one. Then,
two for your leather and suede-ish fabrics.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.280
Then, the symbols down on the side here are
going to reference different techniques. The

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.160
very first one would be if you're doing a
seam on woven fabric. Here are the settings

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.710
that you'll need. The second one is overcast.
Third one, seam and overcast, where it kind

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.200
of does it all at once&nbsp;kind of like a serger.
Love this setting right here. The fourth one

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.571
is baste. For&nbsp;longer stitches that are used
in some of the fabrics like the leather. That

00:01:56.571 --> 00:02:04.250
way it doesn't leave marks and doesn't perforate
your fabric. The next one is a blind hem.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.080
The next one is a hem that would be visible.
This is great for stretch fabrics too.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.350
The last one is a button hole. As you look
across, it's going&nbsp;to give you a couple symbols

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.380
more, the one by the stitch. The orange and
gray stitches are showing you which stitches

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.930
you're picking. The next one is the foot letter
that you're going to use. The next one is

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.790
tension settings for that stitch. Then, it
will say an "L" and a "W." The first one is

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.510
"L" for length. The&nbsp;second one is "W" for
width. This will really get you set up and

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.590
in the right ballpark for any of your projects.
