hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:24.720
Today I'm going to show you shrewbury cookies. For this recipe just take aorund 70 grams of butter. This is unsalted butter

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:34.680
So, you know in all the cookies we need to add a pinch of salt to give it a nice flavor. If it's salted butter it's fine but if you have unsalted butter, add pinch of salt

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:50.600
In this add 20 grams of sugar; powdered sugar, caster sugar anything will do and pinch of nutmeg. You know nutmeg, do not add too much, just add a pinch and also add lemon essence

00:00:50.600 --> 00:01:05.140
Now just mix this to a nice creamy texture. Now, you know if you don't have lemon essence, no problem just add some extra lemon rind that will do and this will be nice flavorful cookies

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:16.240
In this after you cream it add half a beaten egg, just do not add full, just add half an egg and then mix this, till this is nicely creamed.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:26.280
Now after this is nicely mixed add 150 grams of all purpose flour and mix this to a soft dough

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:35.820
You know, get the rolling pin out and before this rolling pin never used to rotate so good but making all these bakery products this is rotating crazy

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:45.120
So let's take this dough, look at this dough; this is nice and soft. So what we're going to do, we're going to roll this into thin sheet

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:53.180
Just take the help of some flour, you know this is still little bit fragile, so handle it with care

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:07.740
and roll it into thin sheet. Now after you roll this just top it up with some you know chopped cherries. This will gve a nice color and wow!

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:19.120
You know take around 10 grams of cherry, just spread on top of these cookies evenly, so every cookie gets a piece of cherry, piece of me and cherry

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:34.760
Look at this. Good. Distribution is taking little long. Now they all look even and then just rub the rolling pin with some flour and just rotate it

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:46.020
Ok. That should be good enough. Good. Now take a cutter and cut round cookies. Just arrange these cookies on a tray

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.260
and we're going to bake them at 180 degrees centigrade for around 15 minutes

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:01.060
Look at these shrebury cookies, the content of sugar in this is very less but the cherries little bit will give that bite and sweetness to these cookies

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.040
Dear friends, very very good looking as well as very tasty cookies

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.080
