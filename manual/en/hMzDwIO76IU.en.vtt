00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:05.324
Hello, my name is Jacob Gurman

00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:08.899
I'm married to Shiri and the father
of four wonderful children. 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:10.181
Nine months ago

00:00:10.332 --> 00:00:12.277
I founded a non profit organization
called "Back to Balance". 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.328
Our vision is to enable good health,

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:17.527
accessible and sustainable for everyone.

00:00:18.224 --> 00:00:20.100
I believe that it is possible
to live healthy

00:00:20.267 --> 00:00:22.777
without any need for medications. 

00:00:22.992 --> 00:00:25.547
I believe that proper nutrition
and the right lifestyle,

00:00:25.698 --> 00:00:29.254
our body can be energized,
strongly and sturdy, 

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:31.831
and the quality of our life
can be very high.

00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:34.338
yes, even geting older gracefully.

00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:35.738
Today, the medical establishment

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.070
defines many situations
as chronic diseases:

00:00:38.226 --> 00:00:40.587
diabetes, high blood pressure,
cholesterol,

00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:43.801
thyroid imbalance and many others. 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.504
Anyone suffering from
one of these diseases 

00:00:47.687 --> 00:00:49.380
must have heard his doctor
saying the following sentence: 

00:00:49.547 --> 00:00:52.683
"You must take this pill or medicine,

00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:54.600
"from now on,
for the rest of your life."

00:00:54.813 --> 00:00:56.769
 I do not accept this solution!

00:00:56.921 --> 00:00:58.328
 I believe and understand

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.078
that there is another way.

00:01:00.244 --> 00:01:04.007
There is a genuine and realistic option,
to balance the body.

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:06.361
and here is where I need your help.

00:01:06.846 --> 00:01:10.327
If you, or any of your relatives
or friends, 

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:12.179
was suffering from some problem
defined by the establishment

00:01:12.342 --> 00:01:13.798
as "chronic",

00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:15.902
and succeeded to overcome it

00:01:16.078 --> 00:01:19.311
through dietary changes and
change in your lifestyle,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.398
we want to hear your story.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.815
I think this is not only a privilege
to share your story, 

00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.740
I believe that this is a duty.

00:01:27.907 --> 00:01:30.301
There are hundreds of thousands
of people in our country, 

00:01:30.468 --> 00:01:34.119
and millions around the world that
can also change their life, 

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:37.303
and be inspired by you
to choose a different way.

00:01:37.642 --> 00:01:40.952
I ask you to make a short clip,
in which you describe

00:01:41.324 --> 00:01:43.607
What was the process
you went through.

00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:46.022
I invite you to record
a 2 minute clip, and describe 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.856
what was the problem
that you have suffered from,

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:51.241
and how did you manage
to overcome it, to be free

00:01:51.408 --> 00:01:53.419
and get back to healthy
and balanced life.

00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:56.841
We shall edit and
distribute your films

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.451
in order to make
this important voice echo.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.427
The voice that says that it's
possible to live without pain, 

00:02:03.598 --> 00:02:07.745
digestive problems, breathing problems
and recurring infections;

00:02:07.953 --> 00:02:11.827
that it is possible to live
in balance and in good health.

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:14.339
We have named this project:
"Sprouts of Change".

00:02:14.482 --> 00:02:18.250
 I invite you to submit
your own story

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.969
 to this green field of sprouts.

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:22.591
I thank you in advance

00:02:22.754 --> 00:02:25.195
for your willingness
to take part and germinate...

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.683
Sprouts of change.

00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:29.314
Thank you.
