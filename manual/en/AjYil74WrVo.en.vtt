00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.110
In the United States, 13 out
of every 20 cans are recycled.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.330
What percent of
cans are recycled?

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.305
So 13 out of every
20 are recycled.

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:17.625
So 13/20, or 13
over 20, could also

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:27.930
be viewed as 13 divided
20, or 13 divided by 20.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.679
And if we do this,
we'll get a decimal,

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.970
and it's fairly straightforward
to convert that decimal

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.670
into a percentage.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.060
So 13 divided 20.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.260
We have the smaller
number in this case being

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.050
divided by the larger number.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.805
So we're going to get
a value less than 1.

00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:44.680
Since we're going to
get a value less than 1,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.580
let's put a decimal
right over here.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.250
And let's add a
couple of zeroes,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.970
as many zeroes as we would need.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.590
And we could say, hey, look,
20 goes into 13 zero times.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.980
0 times 20 is 0.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.340
And then 13 minus 0 is 13.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.030
Now you bring down a 0.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.660
20 goes into 130.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.280
Let's see, it goes
in-- 5 times 20 is 100.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.730
So 6 times 20 is 120.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.430
So it's going to six times.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.950
6 times 20 is 120.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.280
You subtract.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.590
You get a 10.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.600
Let's bring down another 0.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.780
20 goes into 100 five times.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.830
5 times 20 is 100.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.140
And we are done.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.400
So this, written as
a decimal, is 0.65.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.980
So as a decimal, it's 0.65.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.910
And if you want to
write it as a percentage

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.920
you essentially multiply
this number by 100.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.490
Or another way you could say
is you shift the decimal point

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.540
over two spots to the right.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.930
So this is going
to be equal to 65%.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.890
Now, there's another way
you could have done it.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.240
You could have said,
look, percent literally

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.770
means per hundred.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:08.060
So 13 out of 20 is going to
be equal to what over 100?

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.970
Well, to go from 20 to a
100-- forget the denominator.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.870
To go from 20 to 100,
you would multiply by 5.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.880
So let's multiply the
numerator by 5 as well.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.360
And 13 times 5, let's see,
that's 15 plus 50, which is 65.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.519
So this would have
been a faster way

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.060
to do it, especially
if you recognize

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.100
it's pretty easy to
go from 20 to 100.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.420
You multiply it by 5.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.575
So we would do the
same thing with the 13.

00:02:32.575 --> 00:02:34.580
And so you would
get 65/100, which

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.572
is the same thing
as 65 per-- let

00:02:37.572 --> 00:02:40.290
me write this
percent symbol-- 65%.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.450
And just a reminder,
percent literally

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.080
means per hundred,
65 per hundred, 65%.
