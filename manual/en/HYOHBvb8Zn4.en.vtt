Hello everyone this is Breanna Rutter author
of one of my most popular books the natural

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:19.439
hair Bible and founder of howtoblackhair.com
and for these videos I answer the questions

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.800
you all send me via email so any one of you
have any questions you like for me to answer

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.449
check out the description box below for more
information so this video is all because of

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.180
an email Joanne sent me Joanne says that she
loves doing sew ins shes so happy just like

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.479
the entire technical process of doing them
but she needs some more tips as far as how

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:45.540
to bring out better results with her sewins
that she is doing so Joanne I'm gonna give

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.299
you some couple of things that is going to
help you achieve the look and also preserving

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:55.480
the health of the person's hair when doing
sewins so the very first thing I'm going to

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.380
talk about is weaving nets weaving nets are
great and best for people who have been a

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.850
weak hairline or weak edges week what the
weaving net does is it provides a more of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.580
a base on their entire head so that way the
weight of the extensions is not reliant on

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.220
the strength of the hair but the strength
of the weaving net so depending on how thin

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.220
or how much help or support someone hair needs
when you are doing a sew in will depend on

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.440
the type of weaving net you use so if you
use a weaving net that is very flexible and

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.360
flimsy that you can move around very easily
that the help for someone who has thin hair

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.130
but doesn't really have a weak hairline and
then for people who also have a weak hairline

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.740
with thinning hair line you want to use a
weaving that that is stiff because it can

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.270
hold more weight if they do decide to add
more extensions onto their hair so that way

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.810
the weight of the extensions isnt further
receding their hairline or thinning out their

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.840
edges any more than what has already been
done now also a weaving net for my next tip

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.840
that I am goint to suggest is that a weaving
net is perfect for people who are suffering

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.780
from alopecia or bald spots so if you create
if you have bald spots in your head from tight

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.920
braids or just naturally your losing hair
then when you use a little bit of weaving

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.340
net over the area's thats missing hair you
can easily continue to sew your extensions

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.569
onto their braid pattern w braiding over that
piece of weaving net that you had to add in

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.590
those areas well so in a specific case you
wont need a weaving net to cover their entire

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.690
head you only needed to cover the areas that
are that are missing and then also for someone

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.550
with alopecia the varying effects of what
alopecia does to you it varies from person

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.599
to person so if you're on losing hair around
your hair line thing hair in different areas

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.380
or have bald spots throughout your head if
you use just a bit of weaving net to fill

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.840
those areas you dont have to apply weaving
net to your entire head just the areas that

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.780
need be and then also when using an actual
spandex cap just a regular wig cap That you

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.850
would use to cover up your hair you are going
to wear a wig these are the type of caps you

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.280
should use if you have very healthy thick
hair so if you want to make sure that your

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.420
installs are allowing your real hair to come
out through the style then I will suggest

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.560
that if your hair is in pristine condition
that you use as a regular spandex wig cap

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.130
To sew down onto the braid pattern most people
do not like to sew there extensions onto their

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.209
braids by themselves because they want an
extra barrier protection to stop there braids

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.200
from kind of unloosening or any loose hairs
they may have had from the scalp peeking through

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.110
their style so that's why a spandex wig cap
Would be helpful for someone who has very

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.980
healthy hair in good condition but they want
to make sure that all of the hair stand contained

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.000
underneath the wig cap so that way is not
intermingling with the weft of their extensions

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.129
and then for my final tip that I'm going to
suggest when you're doing sewins is do you

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.470
want to create removable units if you want
to create removable units then you want to

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:10.269
use a dome wig cap or a nylon wig cap To help
you to create the effect that you want a spandex

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:16.180
wig cap Is very thin and you can really see
it was almost like the same makeup of a pantyhose

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.280
but a on nylon wig cap or a dome wig cap is
very thick and sturdy and sometimes depending

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.409
on the kind you use it will have a little
bit off holes throughout the If you want more

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:31.819
if you want to make sure that there is more
circulation onto the scalp as well but it

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:36.389
really doesn't matter the specific type of
wig making cap you use You use just want to

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:42.509
make sure this is a nylon wig cap Or it's
an actual dome wig cap Because the thicker

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.150
and more sturdier it is will allow it to last
throughout multiple installs if you want to

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.059
create a removable unit so I've given you
so much information on how to better your

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:56.460
sew ins and now that I've hit all the points
you are ever wondering about the different

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.479
type of weaving caps what situations they
will be necessary for and even as far as creating

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.990
removable units if that's something you want
to get into so thanks JoAnn for your email
