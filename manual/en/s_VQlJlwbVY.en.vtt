00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.620
I'm sick and tired of this stuff

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.880
Every day I have the same dang fit

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.940
I have no friends, I'm not funny

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.260
Why do I put this pressure on me?

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.920
I try and try to forget this stuff

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.800
But the next day I call my bluff

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.520
The same process starts over again

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.440
It seems as though I will never win

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.860
Why do I worry about dumb things like this?

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.160
All it does is cause less and less bliss

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.440
I don't need this drama to go on

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.480
I wish this feeling would just be gone

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.740
I'm alone in my sorrow

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.760
It'll be this way again tomorrow

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.420
It seems as though I'm alone

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.560
Sit in my room, unplug the phone

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.420
Don't wanna eat or watch TV

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.060
I'm the only one who feels sorry for me

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.940
Why do I worry about dumb things like this?

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.800
All it does is cause less and less bliss

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.840
I don't need this drama to go on

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.780
I wish this feeling would just be gone

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.040
Why do I worry about dumb things like this?

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.680
All it does is cause less and less bliss

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.200
I don't need this drama to go on

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.740
I wish this feeling would just be gone
