In common with most

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.530
Urologists, a good deal of our time is
spent dealing with male voiding problems

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.820
the symptoms of these are urgency,
frequency, painful

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.889
passing of urine, passing blood
in urine; these are often due to

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.210
prostatic problems, strictures or
narrowing in the water pipe

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.150
and infections in the urinary tract.
Female

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.329
voiding problems tend to be
rather neglected

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.439
these include recurrent urinary tract
infections and painful bladder syndromes,

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.609
they are very common in general practice and are rather poorly treated;

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:37.230
I have a special interest in this area.
As Chairman of

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.219
the North London Cancer Network
responsible for cancer standards and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.829
cancer care in North London,

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.960
I am in a unique position to provide
excellent advice to patients with

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.420
urological malignancies,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.359
in particular I can help them decide
what form of treatment

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.210
take; this is often difficult and I can
give an independent view on this.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.800
I treat many of the straightforward cancers
in minimally invasive techniques

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.820
together with the team of Oncologists
and other Urological Surgeons who

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.770
specialise in particular operations for
particular cancers.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.050
The latest development in my clinical
practice is our integrated urological pain

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.680
service, which I run together

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.990
with my psychological colleague,
Dr Riva Miller.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.900
In this service we are able to provide
treatment for patients with chronic testicular pain,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.520
pain from prostatitis and ladies with
painful bladder syndromes.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.300
We have many novel treatments and
together, Riva and I are able to produce results

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.030
which are difficult to replicate. 
Many urological problems are chronic

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.770
and they cause major disruption in
people's home and private life, as well

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.640
as their work-life,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.970
my aim is to restore them to them back
to their home environment

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.020
in the best possible condition and also
to get them back to work as soon as possible

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.470
with minimum inconvenience. 
We have a vast array of treatments here, many of which are novel.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.360
I'm pleased to tell you, the vast
majority of patients are extremely happy

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.810
with the outcome of their treatment.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.540
I'm very much look forward to seeing you
in the future.
