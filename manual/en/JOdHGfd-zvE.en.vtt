Hi! I'm David Kaynor on behalf of expertvillage.com.
I have a website www.davidkaynor.com and you

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:17.010
can visit it to find out more about me. I'm
going to talk very briefly about vibrato,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:27.710
left hand vibrato in fiddle music. Violinists
learn general vibrato in several different

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:35.579
techniques. We fiddlers, we soft talking fiddlers
learn all of this by watching and leaping

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:45.659
to sometimes inaccurate conclusions, but basically
vibrato—it sounds like the word vibrate

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:54.429
and it involves the change of the pitch of
the note. Fiddlers use vibrato in waltzes

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:00.489
and slow airs; they don’t use them in fast
tunes, they just use them in reel time. But

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:13.469
if I were playing a waltz, the difference
between a note without vibrato is it is just

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:22.710
a simple a single tone. With vibrato the pitch
goes up and down a little bit, and I change

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.970
the amount it goes up and down on how far
I roll my finger tips to sharp to flat. And

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:41.960
also I can change the speed in which I rotate
my fingers tips. Or, in the context of a waltz,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.170
it sounds like this.
