00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.900
Hi there everybody! Today I'm gonna teach you

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.040
how to recover data from a deleted, lost, or damaged hard drive.

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.910
You can recover the hard drive completely or

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.650
select partitions including NTFS and FAT.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.119
Now, despite the fact that you can't see

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.009
the data on the hard drive, it is still

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.300
there and you can recover it.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.269
This is because data is stored on the lower

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.699
levels of your memory. The filenames that

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.650
point to it are gone, but the memory does

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.960
remain there, at least temporarily.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.970
The only possible way to access it is to use

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.400
specialized software. Now the catch is

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.020
that it can be overwritten at any time

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.500
because there's no protection for it.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.800
So if you have files you would like recovered,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.600
I would recommend you act as quickly as possible.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.060
So what we're gonna do is

00:00:48.060 --> 00:01:02.000
go to the website www.recovering-deleted-files.net

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.250
and here we are! On this website,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.170
you will get a free download and scan with

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.000
what's called data recovery software.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.939
Through here, now just save the file and install it.

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.640
I'm not gonna do these  steps right now because I already have

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.400
the file installed but just follow the instructions.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.140
And here's the program.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.780
Here, as you can see, there's a few features.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.159
We have the Quick Scan if you want to

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.490
quickly search for a specific file.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.350
We have the Full System Scan which will

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.630
scan everything for any recoverable

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.359
files you have as well a Guided Scan.

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.889
If you click here on the Advanced tab,

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:48.780
under this option, if you wanted to

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.869
search for certain reformatted

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.509
partitions, corrupt hard drive sectors,

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.249
there's also recycle bin and other files

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:01.409
so you just click those and then click

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.420
"Start Scan" and here we have the results!

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.600
As you can see, it finds a whole bunch of

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.860
different types of files with other

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.270
images, Word documents, audio, mp3s, video, MPEG, AVI, text files, HTML files.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.240
A lot of those are like bookmarks and web browser

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.600
files like that and it shows you

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.030
how many of each they find so you just

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.320
basically run your cursor over and click

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.990
on the one you want and then go down

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.400
here to recover and there it is!

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.730
As you can see, it recovers a file then puts it

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.700
in a unique folder that kind of neatly

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.400
stores all data that you've recovered.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.900
So to recap, once again, if you're looking to

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.400
recover, restore, undelete any files,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.300
data that you may have lost, accidentally deleted,

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.800
or just plain old went missing,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.300
the best way to do it is through file recovery software.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.100
And on the website www.recovering-deleted-files.net,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.300
you can get a free scan and see if it finds anything.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.170
So visit the site or just click the link

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.400
there in the description box and see if it can help.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.390
All right, good luck!
