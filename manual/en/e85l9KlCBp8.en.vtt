This might have been how I first fell in love with Laura

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.419
I was just a spectator sitting in a room
full of strangers

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.330
if I think about it nothing has ever
felt so intimate

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.750
and probably

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.559
so inaccurate

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.360
Rebecca you've been cut down by a pretty face

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:17.980
that at best

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.130
is emotionally unavailable at worst knows exactly what she's doing.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.920
 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.140
 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.970
While others move through this world I
imagine another. There's a certain

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.090
comfort to complicating

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.130
imaginary lives. It gives you a false sense

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.740
of personal maturity

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.920
But then you realize that you're able to
write about these complications because

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.810
they're yours

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:48.210
Oh, you were suppose to have something for me to read.
Juliet: Ahh, forgot to bring it.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.030
I really wanna read his new play that you
always have an excuse not to give me

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.920
If you want to work things out with Henry you probably shouldn't keep him waiting.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.440
 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.610
It's locked from the inside so that we're forced to live with our decisions

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.830
the theatre's a strict disciplinarian.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.640
plays over you you've left the building

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.900
but here you are intruding on someone else's moment of self loathing.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.580
ah yes, simple words from a stranger get us to the truth everytime.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.990
People love your play

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.340
yes they did five years ago as well but they
haven't given anything I've written since then

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.680
a second look

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.720
So I know I'm just Joe public who sits at a desk all day

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.920
knows absolutely nothing about writing, but I'd like to read your new play.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.820
I read your play I loved it, and you may think I'm crazy but I want

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.690
to produce it.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.710
parting is such sweet sorrow
