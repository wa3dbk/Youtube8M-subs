00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:09.267
There is only one reason military pilots envy civil ones: stewardesses.

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:12.300
We are Luke and Billy and this is “Follow the Leader”.

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:26.267
So let’s review the previous task. It turned out to be pretty tricky.

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:29.233
And the gold was divided between the winners like this.

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.867
You will find the replays of the fastest contestants in the description.

00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:35.267
Well, you fell with much more enthusiasm.

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:38.567
These pilots get their well-deserved 1000 gold.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.733
The new task was prepared by a pilot call-signed KorbenDallas90.

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:52.000
He gets 6000 gold and we jump into our Bristol Type 146 and take-off for the skies above the Plateau.

00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:33.300
Complete the task as precisely as possible and make sure to check out the list in the description. Good luck!

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.300
That’s all for today. The email is the same - tryrepeat@wargaming.net.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.067
Make sure to mention the episode number of “Follow the Leader”, your call-sign, region – NA or EU,

00:01:43.167 --> 00:01:45.700
the time you completed the route or the fail mark.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.700
You have until Tuesday to make it!

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.033
We await your replays and comments about the new show format.

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:52.033
See you!
