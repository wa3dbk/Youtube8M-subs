00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.009
Macan in Indonesian means tiger, so Porsche has grasped the

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.119
spirit creating a compact SUV ready to attack the road since the

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.699
first appearance... A leap forward that turns a normal SUV into a kind of a "raised" 911,

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.640
muscular and redrawn in every little detail, according to specific sport features

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.600
to get the right feeling between the curves...

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.180
The result is what you see. 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.410
This agility combines the considerable talents of roadholding and the impressive

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.160
engine thrust that always characterized the sportcars badged Porsche...

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.700
Even the Diesel is not far behind, with the V6 250 HP that manages

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.730
to maintain fuel consumption sufficiently low, withoute penalize more than

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.890
necessary the sporting spirit.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.200
The Macan S has a decidedly sporty trim and various specific accessories,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.689
such as electronically controlled shock absorbers

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.529
or the suspensions with pneumatic control, to raise the bottom of 4

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:17.430
centimeters,

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.360
reaching a height from the ground of 23 cm.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.820
The same air system lowers the car by 4 cm to

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.320
facilitate the loading of the trunk, or 1 cm when

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.410
lowering in Sport Plus mode,

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.050
which also changes the tuning of the engine, dual clutch transmission

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.740
and 4x4 traction.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.869
The particular all wheel drive system has made possible the use

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.370
of Michelin tires of different sizes in front and behind.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.960
Not only beautiful to look at but also at ease in off-road, on the side bumps

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.460
Macan can tilt up to 45Â° and the maximum depth of the surmountable

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.560
fords is 30 cm.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.439
And even in the snow, our "ice tiger" sinks its claws

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.739
calmly overpay...
