&gt;&gt; IFI MAJID: Hi.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.799
So, I’m super thrilled to talk to you about
Lumia 822 today.

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.109
Today, we announced it with Verizon.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.970
It’s going to be available around the Q4
timeframe.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.380
Here’s the device itself.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.580
You can first of all see, it’s beautiful,
it’s glossy white.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.970
I have got the wireless charging cover on
the back here, which basically means that

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.640
I’m able to just put it on any of our wireless
charging accessories over there and it instantly

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.640
starts charging.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.380
Let me tell you a little bit about the phone.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.220
First thing about the phone is, it’s a 4.3
inch wide VGA 800x480 display.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.469
It’s a ClearBlack display as well.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.170
So basically, when you’re outside, you’re
going to be able to see it really, really

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.170
well.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.370
So, I‘ll take you through a little bit of
my phone.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.110
So, first of all, you can see Verizon, so
happy that they are one of our partners on

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.110
board Windows Phone.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.980
I got my Nokia email there.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.280
You can see my PeopleHub, the people that
are important to me, my wife and myself, so

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.280
I can see.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.289
Then we have Nokia Music which is really cool,
because it’s completely ad free, subscription

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.070
free music service.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.890
And what you are able to do here is be able
to stream music for our massive catalogue

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.210
of music tracks.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.100
And here what I’ve done is I’ve actually
got a mix that I actually have downloaded

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.480
offline, and I’ve pinned it to my home screen
and also in Xbox Music, you can do some podcasts,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.479
so you can see some podcasts that I’ve actually
put on my home screen as well.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.540
I’ll take you through the apps in a second.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.210
Then I have like my Nokia Drive, which is
completely free turn-by-turn navigation.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.290
We have also got street names on that as well.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.969
One of the other big improvements that we’ve
made to it as well.

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.340
You can see my calendar, you can see the photos.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.530
Actually with Windows 8, it actually goes
into the full screen here as well.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.020
And you can see the different live titles
and the different apps that I have here.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.869
One cool thing that we have and Steve was
talking about it on stage is Data Sense, so

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.560
you can see how much you’re actually using.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.409
So, here we are using 151 megabytes of cellular
and WiFi, so you can make sure that you’re

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.039
always in time in terms of the amount of content
that you are using.

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:04.310
So, let me quickly take you through one of
the key applications that I really like, which

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.280
is Nokia City Lens.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.060
I think it’s a really cool lens, let’s
see if it’s going to work there.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.230
So, first of all, it’s an application that
is going to be integrated into Map soon and

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.560
you’re able to see all around the different
areas.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.300
So, first of all, it knows I’m in San Francisco,
and it knows that I’m – I just need to

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.319
calibrate the compass, there you go, because
we are inside – so then I can instantly

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.370
see what’s nearby.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.620
So, here I can see that close by a Sang Kee
restaurant or Rainbow Star or whatever it

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.620
is nearby.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.240
So, I can see that one for example.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.099
It brings up the Map screen.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.239
And it’s using the dual-core 1.5 gig processor
on the device over LTE.

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.280
It brings up the restaurant or whatever it
is.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.280
I can see photos, reviews, what’s nearby,
what’s it about, et cetera.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.350
So, that’s really cool, and then I go back
to the City Lens view.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.629
And actually when I’m like this and I’m
looking for places, that’s when I’m out

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.629
and about, I can do that.

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.850
But actually then, when I’m actually walking,
I want to have it in the palm of my hand,

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.709
so I can see what’s nearby as well.

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.690
And actually then, when I put it flat what
it should do, when I put it absolutely flat,

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.840
it’s going to the Map’s mode.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.280
So, that was quickly around City Lens, a really
cool feature that we’ve got on the Lumia

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.830
822 with Verizon.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:24.239
Yeah, it was actually said on stage that it’s
actually $99 with a rate plan with Verizon

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.120
and they will come up and tell you what the
rate plan actually is involved.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.200
Timing and availability: we’re aiming to
get it out around November time.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.840
We want to get it out in time for Black Friday.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.510
We know you guys are going to love it.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.280
And we can’t wait for you guys to use it.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.510
Tell us how much you like it.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.510
We are super proud of that.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.510
&gt;&gt; MARK GUIM: Awesome.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.510
Thanks a lot.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.514
&gt;&gt; IFI MAJID: Thank you.
