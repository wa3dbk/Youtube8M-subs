Hi, this is Josh with JHE’s Log Furniture Place.  You can find us online at www.logfurnitureplace.com.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.300
www.logfurnitureplace.com.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.889
Today we will be looking at our

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.630
Contoured Comfort Log Picnic Table.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.630
As you can see it is a very sturdy design and is all one unit, table and benches.

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.079
It is probably the strongest 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.470
cedar log picnic table you can buy.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.750
We designed this to be very sturdy and comfortable as well.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.420
The table is put on with lag bolts.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.620
They are secured underneath

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.130
in predrilled holes.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.220
The legs are put on with lag bolts as well.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.340
We have these angle braces on here so it makes it extremely sturdy.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.760
The logs are northern white cedar

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.320
and the  tabletop and the benches

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.940
are made out of pine.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:16.800
All the hardware that comes with this is zinc dichromate.  Which means it won’t rust.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.770
This particular unit

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.160
is very strong,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.460
very heavy,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.610
so it will not blow away.  It will last for a very long time.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.700
This unit probably took me a half hour to 45
minutes to assemble.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.980
Really wasn’t too bad to do.  All the holes are predrilled

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.619
and instructions are very easy to follow.

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.619
This does have our cedar town finish on it.  You can get it natural as well.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.680
