Hi, I'm Jessica Smith, and I work for Bland's
Nursery in West Jordan, Utah, and today, we're

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.290
talking all about planting bulbs. Right now,
we're going to discuss how to plant paper

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:19.710
whites in water. Now, this is done with rocks
is your normal thing, and you do not want

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.340
a drainage hole on your, on your pot. Otherwise,
your water will run right out. Place your

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.629
rock, fill your pot with rocks up to where
you have a few inches left for the bulb itself.

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.510
What you'll do with the paper white; point
it end up as always with any type of a bulb

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.839
that has the point to the top, and you'll
get it just nestled down into the rocks. You

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:51.109
could go a little higher if you wanted to,
but you kind of want those rocks to hold up

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:58.649
the bulb and put just a few around it. You
can also do rocks on the bottom just to help

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.769
fill up the pot, but what you could do is
also like the little marbles, or the little

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.730
glass beads and that all around it for a nice
little accent. Now, we're going to go ahead

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.450
and give it some water. What you want to do
is put it towards the side. Don't hit the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.720
water bulb with the water. And just fill it
up. Now, you're only going to fill up to where

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.810
it just barely comes to the top of the rocks,
and kinda' watch, because you don't want the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.671
water to touch the bulb but it needs to come
up close enough to the, to the bulb itself

00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:40.251
so that it could actually get the water. You
can see right down here we just stop the water

00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:47.170
right there. Now, I actually started forcing
these about a week ago. At this point, what

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.940
you're going to do is you're going to take
this this container and put it in a darkened

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.370
area. Here in about a few weeks or so you're
going to actually start to get some growth

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.820
off of this, and it's going to be yellow right
at first. This is the time that you're able

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.520
to take it out of its cold dormant stage basically.
It's not really a cold dormant stage, but

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.840
you're just putting it in a lower light. At
this point, when it begins to have these small

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.930
little yellow nubs come up out of it then
you can go ahead and move it into where you're

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.870
going to be storing it, and then in a few
days with about four to five days that little

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.579
part will turn green. I started this one about
a week ago or so, and you can see; it's already

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.120
pushing out the roots. Those roots'll work
down through the rocks and actually help stabilize

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.150
the bulb also. In time though it, they do
get a little top-heavy when they begin to

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.790
bloom, so some support around it. You could
even tie like a ribbon around that too. A

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.040
nice little red ribbon around the Christmas
holidays is nice.
