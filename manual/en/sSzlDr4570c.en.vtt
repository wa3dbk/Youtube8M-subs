Hi, I'm Ann Kennedy on behalf of Expert Village
and I'll be teaching you some steps to teach

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.910
a child to read. Reading book covers, part
one. Traditional book cover. What will you

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:24.920
show your child? Another book cover. Another
book cover. Another book cover? Another book

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.620
cover. First book cover, when you first introduce
your child to reading, you're introducing

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:39.899
them to colors. This looks like a fun book.
And this is a light orange color with a little

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:48.879
girl and hmmm, it looks like a dolly on it.
Second book cover. You're not even telling

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:55.640
them the title at this point. When you look,
you're looking at the picture. Isn't that

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:04.330
a cute picture? It looks like, hmmm, pigs,
wow there seems to be a wolf in the background.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.130
I wonder if this book might be scary but it
has such beautiful colors, the blue sky and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.369
the green meadows. This book cover looks silly.
That's a silly creature and it looks like

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:27.189
something very silly that's on a plate. And
this particular book cover, we have white

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:36.140
and orange and creatures jumping on top of
somebody with a pretty green. And this book

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:45.679
cover, it looks like a lot of photos. It seems
silly, it seems as if why are we just breaking

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:52.130
it down into such a small step? Because first
a child sees colors. A child will choose books

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.390
even on colors and it's very important to
introduce one thing. This is a book and here

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:06.530
is the colors and it looks like it's happening
somewhere or it looks like this is the outdoor

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.440
or these could be the characters. That simple.
Start with the very very basics and you'll

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.439
be happy you did. Book covers, part one.
