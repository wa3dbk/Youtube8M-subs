00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.499
Today is February 14, the day of love,

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.989
Valentine's Day.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.449
I love him so much and he loves me a lot too.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.300
I want to get a gift.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.680
I don't know if I get him a watch

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.280
or something for the computer.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.500
At the hardware shop, they sell many things for the house,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.640
such as hangers,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.620
screwdrivers...

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.460
I can buy a drill...

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.800
but I'm not sure if he likes it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.380
Besides, it's not a very romantic gift.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.570
A jewelry watch.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.780
And why not buying him a watch as a gift? I'll go and see how they are.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.040
I don't like them, I find them old-fashioned.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.780
A computer shop

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.560
And shall I buy something for computer?

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.820
Ah...but I don't understand computers and don't know if he needs something.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.500
There are lots of cheap things in the chinese market.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.550
But I don't think he likes any of the things here.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.820
I know! I'll buy him a book.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.960
But there are many, I don't know which one to buy him.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.820
Let's see... let's see...I already know what I'll buy him.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.580
They say that 'The Catherdral of the Sea' is very nice.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.700
I'm sure he'll like it.

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:12.799
Yes, I'm going to buy it and will wrap it with wrapping paper.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.219
I hope he'll like it.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.980
I want to see his face when I give it to him.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.199
And him? Will he remember which day it is today?

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:25.419
Will he get me something?

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.720
Yes, I'm sure he'll remember it.

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:30.849
I hope he'll buy me something.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.140
I'd like a necklace...

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.900
Maybe he'll give me a ring.

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.939
These earings aren't bad at all.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.380
I love getting gifts and being surprised.

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.119
Perhaps, he'll give me a bag.

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:56.319
I like brown which is in the middle, between the green and black one.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.029
It's not bad at all.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.960
He might buy me a perfume.

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.289
He'd better buy me a bouquet of flowers.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.980
He knows well that I like flowers.

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.049
Hope he'll remember what day it is today and will give me a gift.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.280
