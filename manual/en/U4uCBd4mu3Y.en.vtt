00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.030
Scientists have discovered the secret to immortality!

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.149
Turns out, all you have to do is be a jellyfish.

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:16.300
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - with yet more
reason to be terrified of the ocean and its

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.300
mysterious, creepy inhabitants.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.670
In 1988, scientists uncovered a species of
jellyfish called Turritopsis dohrnii, that

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.140
can reverse its aging process, effectively
making it immortal.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.380
Researchers are now studying it - to see how
it can do this, in hopes that someday - humans

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.050
will be able to do the same.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.450
The "immortal jellyfish" - as people call
it - stays alive by regenerating into a polyp—which

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.040
is its earliest stage of life—as it ages,
or whenever it experiences illness or trauma.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.140
It spends 3 days doing that, after which it
eventually becomes an adult again.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.730
This is one of the only known animals on earth
capable of evading death in this manner, but

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.370
they're notoriously hard to study in captivity.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.870
To keep them alive in a laboratory environment,
they have to be continuously monitored - which

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.810
is exactly what one scientist at Kyoto University
is doing.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.090
Shin Kubota has devoted his life to studying
these creatures, and has managed to keep an

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.140
entire colony of them alive in his lab - which
requires intense dedication.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.030
He frequently changes their water, feeds them
tiny shrimp by hand, and the best part - "He

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.259
even writes karaoke songs about the jellyfish,
which he performs wearing a jellyfish hat,

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.829
after he's done with his research for the
day."

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.439
He's become so famous for his quirky songs,
that he's basically become the Japanese equivalent

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:27.789
of Bill Nye the Science Guy.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.909
He regularly appears on national television,
and his songs are available in karaoke machines

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:33.909
all over Japan.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.600
Fame aside, though, his primary concern is
still the immortal jellyfish.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.020
He says, "Out of all the animals in the world,
only they are able to reverse the aging process

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.229
instead of dying."

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.500
And as such, it's impossible to determine
their lifespan.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.859
According to him, "They might live forever."

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.929
What's interesting is that even though the
jellyfish are extremely primitive, they share

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.640
more genetic data with humans than they do
with insects or worms.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.950
Which means if we can figure out how they're
able to reverse their aging process, then

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.970
theoretically - that knowledge could be applied
to humans.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.499
Naturally, some scientists are skeptical about
that - but at the very least, Kubota hopes

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:11.280
to be able to extend our fixed lifespan by
closely studying these creatures.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.330
And he says it's only a matter of time - a
few years, maybe a decade or two - before

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.660
we solve the mystery of its immortality.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.600
And hey - if you wanna see more weird facts
about animals, go check out Animalist's new

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600
show, Best Breed Ever!

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.080
It tells you everything you wanna know - and
some stuff you didn't - about your favorite

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.110
types of dogs.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.470
FOR EXAMPLE: Did you know that two Pomeranians
are called a puff?

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.960
And three are called a tuft?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.870
I didn't think they could get any more adorable,
but they have.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.730
There are new episodes are every Wednesday
and Friday, so go check those out.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.870
And in the meantime, if you have questions,
comments, anything you wanna say about this
