Hello there! My name is Aaron Moon and I am
here today on behalf of expertvillage.com.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:14.570
Today I am discussing the acoustic steel string
guitar and I have gone over two tuning techniques

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:23.390
for just your standard tuning. I like to go
over two alternative tunings and they are

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.460
both related. The first is drop D. Drop D
refers to dropping your low E string down

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:51.550
to a D. After you do this a few times, you
will be able to do it just by ear. Just take

00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:00.000
a second to sink the A up with the E. That
is all you really need. That is not that instructional

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:11.770
so I will show you how to do it using a piano.
If you don’t have a great ear, just pick

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:36.960
a D out on the piano. Play it a few times,
get it in your head; there you go and ultimately

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.600
you want it to be in tune with your other
strings. So if it is perfectly in tune with

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.140
the piano but not in tune with your strings
maybe if the piano is out of tune take the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:02:03.210
time to tune it up with the rest of your strings.
This just gives it a different feel. It kind

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.190
of opens the guitar up a little. You can write
in a different manner and you can kind of

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:38.140
explore different avenues with the drop D
tuning; that’s drop D. Next I will explain

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.240
how to keep that drop D and tune the rest
of the strings to an alternative tuning called

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.819
dad gab. So come on back and join us.
