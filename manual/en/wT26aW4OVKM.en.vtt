Hi Paparazzi! I'm here with Lead Stylist Kasidee,
who many of you know from convention and most

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.840
recently "Empower Me Pink." We are so excited
to show you the different ways that you can accessorize

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.110
our new Scarf Necklace. Here are just a few
of our favorites.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.280
This is called an open layer, which means
you literally just take the necklace as one

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.670
long piece, set it around your neck and let
the tassels fall down. This is a great elongator

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.950
it gives you length through the center and
it also allows you to layer up that center

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.420
portion. You could put a short necklace, a
short and a long, then add this to the outside.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.420
It's very, very versatile. But again, this
open layer.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.179
Another way you can wear it we call the loop
through, which means you just literally fold

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:53.579
the necklace in half, have a loop at the top,
the tassels at the end. Place it around your

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.579
neck and simply slide the loose ends through
the knot. This allows you to tighten it up

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.740
just by simply pulling the tassels that loop
will come up higher around the neck. Or if

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.610
you want it a little bit longer, you just
pull it down. It gives you a lot of versatility

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.320
just within this one look. Another way that
you can wear this, is called the traditional

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.430
wrap. This is going to mimic very much how
you would wear a winter scarf.You're simply

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.140
going to take the necklace around your neck
and crisscross the long pieces down and let

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.610
them fall down on the front. Now, with this
you can also adjust the length simply pull

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.280
the edges to give it a tighter look.
You can loosen it to make that loop have a

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.740
little bit of longer hang to it. The ends
do not have to be even if you don't want.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.180
That gives kind of a more funky, fun, industrial
look. If you would like the ends even to give

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.420
it more of a classic look, you can even those
up, so that the tassels are more symmetrical

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.940
across the body. Again, that versatility just
within this look is amazing.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.409
Okay, this next look is called the double
knot. If you just take both ends, and simply

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:14.409
tie one knot and then below it, tie another.
This gives you that elongated look again.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.290
It's just really streamline and classy, very
pretty. The next look is similar and you're

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.800
going to do it a similar way but it changes
the look up a bit, it's called the nautical

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.770
knot. You take both chains together and tie
a bigger knot. In this one the knot becomes

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.700
the focal point and it gives you a "chunkier"
look.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.780
We absolutely adore this necklace and we know
you and your customers will too. Take the time

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.200
to show your customers the different ways
that you can accessories this necklace. It

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.060
is so versatile they are going to love it.
It allows you to cater to all styles of people,

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.500
it will be a hit at your parties. We adore
you Paparazzi!
