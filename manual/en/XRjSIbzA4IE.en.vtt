One of the hottest companies on Wall Street
went up in flames yesterday.

a Tesla dude!" (via Youtube / Aj Gill)

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.820
It was the perfect storm Wednesday when this
video...

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.960
along with an investment analyst's downgrade
sent Tesla's stock price plummeting.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.960
(via Forbes)

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:27.339
Shares of Tesla Motors Inc. fell 12 points
to $180.95, a whopping 6 percent drop or a

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.890
600 million dollar hit to its market cap.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.890

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.180
Although the Tesla S in the video is burned
beyond repair there is good news for the car

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.180
company.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.590
The fire never made it to the passenger cabin
and the Tesla warned the passenger to pull

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.080
over in plenty of time.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.850
According to the Fire Department the driver
"struck some kind of object on the freeway."

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.140
So why would a car fire, that left no one
dead or injured affect stock prices?

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.540
Well there's a few reasons.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.710
For one, according to the Los Angeles Times,
"safety officials have been tracking fires

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.530
in electric cars ... out of concern that the
lithium-ion battery systems might be fire-prone."

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.530
(via Los Angeles Times)

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.999
Earlier this year Boeing's 787 Dreamliners,
which also use lithium-ion batteries, were

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:10.780
grounded for four months after one plane caught
fire and another over-heated.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.780
(via Boeing)

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.090
Also, Tesla has a reputation to uphold.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.049
"The headline release says it all.

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.790
Tesla Model S achieves best safety rating
of any car ever tested."

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.790
(via MSNBC)

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.380
"The model S scored so well, the NSTHA doesn't
have a star rating high enough to award it's

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.939
correct number of 5.4 stars."

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.009
(via Tech Feed)

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.289
After being dubbed the "safest car in America"
you try to avoid viral videos of your car

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:35.469
on fire.

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.079
But Tesla released a statement on the fire
and says the car's design kept the driver

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.079
safe.

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.959
"... a fire caused by the substantial damage
sustained during the collision was contained

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.600
to the front of the vehicle thanks to the
design and construction of the vehicle and

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.600
battery pack."

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.600
(via CNN)

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.759
This is the biggest one day drop in share
price for Tesla since July but, to be clear,

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.049
the company is by no means reeling â€” shares
for the company are up 400 percent this year.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.280
And as a Yahoo writer points, the Model S
may still be the safest car on the road.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.510
"Lithium-ion batteries can pose a new kind
of risk, but for now there's nothing in this

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.900
case to suggest there anywhere near as flammable
as the gallons of gasoline millions of drivers

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.170
rely on daily."
