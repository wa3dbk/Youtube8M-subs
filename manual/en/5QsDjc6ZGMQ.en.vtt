00:00:03.874 --> 00:00:04.540
Hey, everybody.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.373
So I'm actually not in
the studio this week.

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:09.050
I'm in Seattle, Washington,
for my brother's wedding.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.620
So graduations,
Justin and Angel.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.690
I'm very happy for you.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.460
But I was also in
Los Angeles this week

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.511
at E3, that giant
video game conference

00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:17.510
that you've probably heard
a thing or two about.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.020
So I wanted to give you a
list of some of the things

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.320
that I was really excited
about that I saw at E3.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.042
And I hope you'll agree as well.

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:24.500
We'll be back next
week, obviously,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.450
with a regular episode, double
comments, the whole deal.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.500
And we'll be looking
forward to hearing from you.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.750
All right, let's jump into it.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.700
So first up is Hello
Games's new title,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.800
"No Man's Sky," which looks
absolutely incredible.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.850
It has this really,
really bright palette.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.830
The art direction is phenomenal.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.180
It creates a world so big.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.670
They're all
procedurally generated.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.295
In fact, the worlds
are so big that you

00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:47.360
won't run into other people even
if you're on the same planet.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.462
And there are dinosaurs,
which is incredible.

00:00:49.462 --> 00:00:50.920
Really looking
forward to that one.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.003
So I really didn't want
to like "The Order," which

00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.410
is the new title from Ready
at Dawn, which a Sony studio.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.160
You might know them
for some of their work

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.390
on "God of War" series.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.370
But I spent an hour talking
to their art director

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.860
specifically about the fog
and, like, light particles

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.780
and how they built a 3D scanner
to import dozens and dozens

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.940
of different textures.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.915
I mean, this game
definitely has a patina,

00:01:13.915 --> 00:01:15.850
like, a real look and feel.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.710
And it takes place
in central London.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.830
All this belies the fact
that it does kind of deal

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.200
with some of the same kind
of old, like, werewolf, like,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.210
and stuff that you
might have seen

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.376
in movies like "Underworld."

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:25.550
But the look, man.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.722
That look.

00:01:26.722 --> 00:01:27.430
It's pretty good.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.388
So one of the titles I
was really excited about

00:01:29.388 --> 00:01:30.120
is called "Abzu."

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.270
It's from a studio
called Giant Squid.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.650
One of the members
of Giant Squid

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.714
is this guy named Matt
Nava, who actually

00:01:35.714 --> 00:01:36.880
worked at that game company.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.200
And "Abzu" absolutely
has that feel.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.980
It's this giant kind of
like underwater exploration

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.610
sort of game.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.920
It's got a really cool look
to it in terms of the way

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.980
the light means through
the water and whatnot.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.420
During super early stages.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.910
They're still trying to figure
out what the game will be.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.669
But from an art
direction standpoint,

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:52.960
they're really on point so far.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.289
David O'Reilly is probably
someone that you don't know.

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:56.580
He's new to the world of games.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.900
But in a weird way,
he's made games before.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.254
He made the video games for
Spike Jonze's movie "Her."

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:03.920
And he has a new title
that's coming out

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.050
called "Mountain," which
he's describing as sort

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.410
of like a mountain simulator.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.762
And again, not too
much is known about it,

00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:12.220
but it'll be out
in a couple weeks.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.050
One of the things I
really like about David

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.940
is that he has a filmmaker
background and a really

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.240
cinematic sensibility.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.222
So I'm really looking for to
kind of experiencing this world

00:02:21.222 --> 00:02:22.180
that he'll be creating.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.540
Last but not least, I
definitely spent, like, 15,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.270
20 minutes just watching people
play the new "Super Smash

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.450
Bros." for the Wii U.
I spent a lot of time

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.440
in college playing "Super Smash
Bros." for the Nintendo 64.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.100
So it's a game and
a franchise that's

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.440
near and dear to my heart.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.250
And you can play as, like, the
people from "Animal Crossing,"

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.900
the "Wii Fit" trainer, Pac-Man.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.840
Everybody's in this game.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.360
I'm not.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.567
But everybody else is.

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:47.400
So that's it for me.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.775
Those are the five games that
I was really excited about.

00:02:49.775 --> 00:02:51.490
And last time we did
this, some people

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.657
seemed to confuse their favorite
games with my favorite games.

00:02:54.657 --> 00:02:55.990
There's no right answer to this.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.510
There's no definitive list
of the best games of E3.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.415
I just mentioned
some of the things

00:02:59.415 --> 00:03:00.460
that I was excited about.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.250
And I'm really looking forward
to seeing the things that you

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.440
all were excited about.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.302
So please hash it
out in the comments.

00:03:05.302 --> 00:03:07.260
And if you like what you
saw, please subscribe.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.710
I'll see you all next week.
