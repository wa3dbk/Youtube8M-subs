00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.319
Polarity is an OUYA-Exclusive first person
puzzle platformer by Bluebutton Games.

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.960
You get to try out one level for free, and
it's about $5 to unlock the rest of the levels.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.530
Currently, there are only ten total levels,
but there are more coming soon and what is

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.760
currently available is completely worth the
five dollars.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.450
The story is somewhat inconsequential - you're
a hacker, and you need to collect green "data

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.800
fragment" crystals.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.900
There are three in each level, and you need
to collect every single one to get the game's

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.900
ending.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.540
The visuals in Polarity are very clean and
sharp.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.760
The levels mix up the theme here and there,
and for the most part it's really great to

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.789
look at.

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.600
The only issue I have here is sometimes the
tops of platforms appear black because of

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.510
the dark setting, so in these cases it's hard
to know if you can step or need to jump.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.379
The gameplay is great.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.609
Some puzzles may stump you for a while but
nothing is unmanagable, you'll figure it out

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:51.609
eventually.

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.920
Solving the game's levels requires switching
your polarity to get through gates and walk

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.960
on paths, using colored cubes to activate
or power platforms, doors, and other things,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.460
flipping switches that may open doors or even
rotate the world, and some other things.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.480
The green data fragments are somewhat hidden
in each level, so it takes a bit of exploration

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.670
to get those extra bits.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.650
There is some platforming in the game, which
for the most part doesn't have a timed component

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.260
and you can go at your own pace.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.940
Close to the end of the game, there are a
few timed platforming sections that may cause

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.940
you to die a few times until you figure out
what to do, but for the most part the platforming

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.360
is a lot more fun than frustrating.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.310
Death in the game is also not a big deal - you're
just respawned immediately with no penalties.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.450
There isn't much music in the game, but it
is quite mellow and nice, and all the sound

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.870
effects add to the ambience.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.600
I wasn't able to really properly record the
audio here because I'm being lazy and cheap

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.140
by recording my television with a video camera
and not buying an HDMI capture cable.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.910
All-in-all, I think Polarity is a great game,
and completely worth checking out if you have

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.980
an OUYA and like puzzle games.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.080
Try out the free demo - and if you like it,
give the one-person developer Bluebutton Games

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.549
some support!
