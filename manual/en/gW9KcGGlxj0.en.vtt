00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.710
BlackBerry Pearl 3G (9100 and 9105)

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.980
Expected May 2010.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.490
We haven't seen much from RIM in the past
year or so, although handset sales have been

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:26.539
very strong despite our misgivings about the
BlackBerry manufacturer's current direction.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.590
The BlackBerry Pearl 3G is the first new Pearl
"candy bar" phone since the 8110 announced

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.730
over two years ago, and it's the first Pearl
handset to support 3G. It's amazing to think

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.340
that the Pearl has come all this way without
3G support, but in fact standard messaging

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.000
operations really don't need anything more
than plain old GPRS.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.790
This is more than the old version of the Pearl
with 3G support slapped on, the Pearl 3G comes

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.150
with a very high resolution 360 x 400 pixel
display, a 3.2 megapixel camera with flash

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.910
and autofocus, support for 802.11 b, g and
n WiFi (one of the few phones that supports

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:16.370
the new, faster 802.11n protocol). Inside
is a 624Mhz processor (twice as fast as the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:24.530
8110) and 256MB memory. The Pearl 3G has GPS
support built in, and it supports Bluetooth

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.840
2.1 and microSD memory cards up to 32GB as
well.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.950
The operating system and user interface has
been upgraded to version 5.0 of the BlackBerry

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.750
OS, and it now supports synching with iTunes
and Windows Media Player. From what we can

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.800
see of the user interface, the whole thing
has been tidied up from the previous version

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.860
which looked rather cluttered.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.510
One key feature is that the Pearl 3G has dropped
the trackball on the front and has replaced

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.200
it with a small optical trackpad. In our experience
the trackpad is much easier to use than the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.590
old trackball, and it should be more resilient
too. There are dedicated media keys on the

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.700
very top of the Pearl 3G to make music playback
easier.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.230
There are two different versions of the Pearl
3G, the 9100 comes with a familiar version

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.069
of the SureType keyboard, the 9105 uses a
traditional mobile phone layout for the keypad

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.070
which may well appeal to new customers. The
overall design is much smarter and more conventional

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.440
than previous versions of the Pearl, and it's
nice to see a capable messaging smartphone

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.510
in a such a pocket friendly design.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:43.790
The large 1150 mAh battery is quoted as giving
up to 5.5 hours talktime on 3G networks, and

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:52.490
overall the Pearl 3G weighs just 93 grams
and measures 108 x 50 x 13mm. This is a tri-band

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.590
UMTS/HSDPA device with support for quad-band
GSM, so we expect this to turn up on lots

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.680
of different carriers worldwide.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.680
RIM say that the Pearl 3G should be available
from May 2010 onwards, although at the moment

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.640
we have no guidance on pricing or networks.
