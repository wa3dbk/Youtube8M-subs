[Dan Dan Kokoro Hikareteku plays]
Even when it seems that I don't need you

00:00:14.388 --> 00:00:18.335
Just know that I am in love, can't wait to...

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.037
Leave this endless darkness

00:00:21.072 --> 00:00:24.139
Won't you come along with me?

00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:28.151
Hold my hand!

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.501
Now where could our ship be?

00:00:52.502 --> 00:00:54.291
Ooo, I know!

00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:57.310
Well it's somewhere in here.... but where?

00:00:57.345 --> 00:00:58.591
Goku:  Hey guys!

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:00.522
It could take us days!

00:01:00.523 --> 00:01:03.017
It's right there.

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:08.689
How did you find it so quickly?

00:01:08.724 --> 00:01:11.220
I read the script in advance!

00:01:17.606 --> 00:01:19.283
Weeee!

00:01:20.175 --> 00:01:23.534
They said I couldn't get a cameo, they were wrong!

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.597
Heh, you showed them!

[Guards shouting random commands]

00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:49.444
What the heck Pan, you can take beatings at the budokai

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.039
but you can't handle a sodacan to the head?

00:02:08.453 --> 00:02:10.586
[screaming and panicing]

00:02:14.215 --> 00:02:15.717
Hey assholes, GET ON!!!

[Trunks and Goku screaming]

00:02:25.454 --> 00:02:28.192
Geez Pan, you need to play more Grand Theft Auto.

00:02:32.432 --> 00:02:34.416
All 3:  Yay!

00:02:36.898 --> 00:02:41.040
[Random merchant banter]

00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:43.940
Pan:  So we need new parts huh?  Which ones?

00:02:43.975 --> 00:02:46.783
Trunks:  It'd be easier to tell you which parts we don't need.

00:02:46.784 --> 00:02:48.025
Pan:  Do you sell ship parts?

00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:49.026
Why yes we....

00:02:51.396 --> 00:02:52.779
I-I mean "no" bye!

00:02:55.414 --> 00:03:03.389

00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:31.989
Trunks:  Forget it pan!

00:03:32.024 --> 00:03:35.008
Pan:  But I have a huge crush in him, you know that!

00:03:35.043 --> 00:03:37.355
Trunks:  Yeah you and every other fangirl!

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.575
Nyaa!

00:03:39.576 --> 00:03:42.274
I love money!

00:03:43.585 --> 00:03:45.260
Ahhhhh!

00:03:48.831 --> 00:03:52.040
Hey "Ass!"  Guess who's guards are dead?

00:03:52.075 --> 00:03:59.010
Excuse me!  My name is Don-Key.  DON-KEY!

00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:01.265
Like I said... "Ass."

00:04:01.266 --> 00:04:04.333
At least I wasn't named after a style of underware...

00:04:04.368 --> 00:04:06.120
Or a loaf of bread!

00:04:07.324 --> 00:04:09.689
I am not a loaf of bread!

00:04:11.014 --> 00:04:15.102
Ahhhhh!

00:04:15.103 --> 00:04:17.457
[thinking] Why isn't anyone saving me!?!

00:04:17.492 --> 00:04:19.921
Eat lead!

00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:35.508
Trunks:  Fail!

00:04:35.955 --> 00:04:39.188
Guns do not work in the Dragonball universe

00:04:39.223 --> 00:04:41.648
Unless they're used against somebody weak.

00:04:41.683 --> 00:04:43.347
Like the farmer.

00:04:48.183 --> 00:04:50.537
L-le-let me give it another shot!

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:56.017
One more time!

00:04:58.637 --> 00:05:00.627
He-he's all yours.

00:05:01.993 --> 00:05:04.407
Who do you think you are?

00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:08.096
My name is Ledgic

00:05:08.097 --> 00:05:10.302
I kill things...

00:05:10.337 --> 00:05:12.009
Yeah.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.865
[slowly] Okay.

00:05:31.537 --> 00:05:34.839
Ledgic:  Incredible.  You may take a while to defeat.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.916
Guess what?  I'm holding back!

00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:38.987
N-No your not!

00:05:39.022 --> 00:05:39.603
Goku:  Yes I am

00:05:39.638 --> 00:05:42.607
Ledic:  Lalalala, I can't hear you lalalala.....

00:05:44.061 --> 00:05:44.835
[beep]

00:05:54.735 --> 00:05:56.893
Get up and kill them Ledgic!

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:03.827
I hate being ordered.... Ass.

00:06:08.698 --> 00:06:10.790
Pan:  Alright, let's get outta here!

00:06:12.565 --> 00:06:14.780
But our radar ran away...

00:06:19.738 --> 00:06:21.161
Not so fast!

00:06:23.384 --> 00:06:24.173
What the...?

00:06:25.925 --> 00:06:28.610
Either cough up the radar or I'll tear you apart!

00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:34.724
Hey, what's the big idea?

00:06:34.725 --> 00:06:35.725
Shut up Pan!

00:06:37.142 --> 00:06:39.439
Giru, Giru.  Radar on my back!

00:06:39.474 --> 00:06:41.383
Haha!  Win!

00:06:45.332 --> 00:06:48.183
Narrator:  And now they have finally finished their useless trip to Imekia

00:06:48.437 --> 00:06:49.702
Goku Pan and Trunks-

00:06:49.737 --> 00:06:51.794
Pilaf:  Hey, Can I be in this episode?

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:52.171
Narrator:  No!

00:06:52.206 --> 00:06:53.658
Pilaf:  Please!

00:06:53.693 --> 00:06:54.486
Narrator:  NO!

00:06:54.521 --> 00:06:56.056
Pilaf:  Awww...

00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:59.195
Narrator:  Where was I?  You know what?  Forget it.  I'm outta here.  Bye!
