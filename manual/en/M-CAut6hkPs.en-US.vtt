00:00:15.444 --> 00:00:20.025
Let's open this thing up!
It's the first Apple Store in Latin America,

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:22.761
and Brazil was chosen to it, here in Rio de Janeiro, at Village Mall.

00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:32.584
Open it up! It's a historical date, February 15th 2014.
The doors of the first apple here in Brazil are open. Wonderful!

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:40.229
Now we will have an "Apple style support" for every user.
That's what we are hoping for, what I hope for, in fact.

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:49.748
One of the biggest storefronts in the world. A triple size, as they say.

00:00:49.748 --> 00:00:56.030
Here we have the front where you can try out
the products, and in the back there's the Genius bar,

00:00:56.313 --> 00:01:02.062
and the employees are doing the usual 
routine in Apple Store openings.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:09.260
The workers stimulate people in line,
cheer with people, they clap hands, interact,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.365
you can see that every employee have 
their own style, and screaming "Brazil!",

00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:23.862
the name of the country, the first nation to receive
an Apple Store in Latin America, and the 15th in the world.

00:01:24.244 --> 00:01:30.881
The store is beautiful, and let's see it from the inside. 
It's a celebration, Apple Store in Brazil!

00:01:32.262 --> 00:01:35.976
Sis, Five, The countdown begins!

00:01:35.976 --> 00:01:44.078
Three, Two, One. Welcome to the
Apple Store, welcome to Brazil!

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.384
We're going in. It's our turn now.

00:01:54.827 --> 00:02:01.973
The line is moving a little fast, huh? But it's all well organized.

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:08.934
People are entering calmly. This is the first Apple Store
in Brazil, as I mentioned, the first in Latin America.

00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:15.780
It's the 15h country to have an Apple Store - a retail
store with the Apple standard of quality - that's what we expect.

00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:21.010
It's time! We're going in! It's a historical moment here in Brazil!

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.478
I know there's people saying a lot of things
 over there, but you don't know the half!

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:32.932
I've been through this - not store opening, 
but in product launches in London and Sydney.

00:02:33.174 --> 00:02:41.846
We're entering here in the Apple Store Village Mall
here in Rio de Janeiro. That's it, let's go people!

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.655
You're in the biggest YouTube
channel about Apple in Brazil! Thanks.

00:02:46.858 --> 00:02:49.480
YEAH, Let's work, let's go in!

00:02:49.744 --> 00:02:51.044
Where's my shirt? Thanks!

00:02:58.147 --> 00:03:03.358
We're inside the store. Now let's go around and get to know this
first part with the products for the customers to try.

00:03:06.198 --> 00:03:14.837
The furniture is an Apple pattern, made of ivory, everything
as we already know, here you can try out the products,

00:03:15.106 --> 00:03:23.217
you can use it freely, the Wi-Fi should be nice,
and usually the electrical cables stay under the table.

00:03:26.154 --> 00:03:28.726
Let's discover the back section, the Genius Bar. Let's go!

00:03:31.381 --> 00:03:38.699
Now we're in the back section, that we couldn't see from the outside,
because we were out there, and here's the Genius Bar,

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:49.643
where the scheduled attendance happens, you can ask questions to
the employees, fix any device and also sit for the workshops.

00:03:49.643 --> 00:03:56.376
By the way, this table is the workshop place,
where they offer training about Apple systems and services.

00:03:56.376 --> 00:04:03.623
It can be from the Mac environment, the computers,
to mobile as well, like smartphones, iPad, iPod, etc.

00:04:03.623 --> 00:04:13.075
And here the group trainings, and if you look
around here, all over the store you can find accessories,

00:04:13.075 --> 00:04:15.859
where they sell it, and also to apply it for you.

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:21.955
For example, if you buy a protective cover, the put it
in your product's screen, do it for you very calmly.

00:04:21.955 --> 00:04:26.041
Worked this way for me in Sydney, 
and I expect like this in Brazil, right?

00:04:26.692 --> 00:04:32.513
Those were our first impressions of Village Mall's Apple Store in Brazil, the first one in Latin America.

00:04:32.513 --> 00:04:38.294
We spoke about the front, where customers
try out the products, the back where's the Genius Bar,

00:04:38.294 --> 00:04:43.814
Workshops and Group Training are located
and all the accessories 'around the store'.

00:04:43.814 --> 00:04:47.565
Let's see if this store will be cool. We'll look around
with attention and tell you more about it later.

00:04:47.565 --> 00:04:49.203
See you around. Loop Infinito!
