00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.530
Today on BRStv we are going to do something
fun and do an in-depth review of the Kessil

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.620
LED lights.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:15.180
Hi, I'm Ryan host of BRStv where each week
we discuss a new topic related to reefing.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.690
This week we are going to review the Kessil
LED lights.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.150
While they have a variety of models we are
going to focus on the 360's . We will touch

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.980
on Kessil as a company first, then we will
hit on external appeal, internal appeal, controllability,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.529
cost per led, build quality, warranty support
and finally finish we'll finish with a few

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.949
details on how many you would need for your
tank and which model to get.

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:41.039
Kessil is actually a brand produced by Dicon
industries which is not your typical aquarium

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:42.039
company.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.031
These guys have been in lighting and optics
for over 27 years and their facility in the

00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:48.280
San Francisco area is absolutely state of
the art.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.799
They are the only company in our industry
capable of designing and producing their own

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.539
LED's based on their actual use rather than
just purchasing them from larger vendors like

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.109
Cree and assembling them.

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.059
The ability to control the technology from
beginning to end with a specific purpose in

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.380
mind is what really sets them apart from everyone
else in our industry and I think you will

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.160
see this in the results with their product.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.070
The single small source of light, uniform
spread, uniform color blending and small form

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.080
factor results in something a typical reefer
can get excited about.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.550
We have been so happy with their aquarium
lights we actually ventured out and purchased

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.980
their studio lights under the Felix brand
for our photo machine that produces the 360

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.450
degree images on our site as well in a ton
of our videos.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.900
They are absolutely better than any other
studio lighting we have used here at BRS.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.230
Ok so what about Kessil and reefing?

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.450
First thing we will hit on is external appeal.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.100
People often overlook this but honestly who
cares what the inside of the tank looks like

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.130
if the outside is an eyesore?

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.970
Anyone who has seen one of these knows they
look absolutely stunning on the smaller cube

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.760
and rectangular tanks like the Nuvos from
Innovative Marine.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.070
Honestly the Kessil is on a very short list
of lights I would consider for tanks like

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.650
this and they have become super popular for
everyone here at the office.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.360
I honestly wasn't sure if they would be as
stunning on larger tanks but after putting

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.400
two on my office tank I think I would be comfortable
using them on basically any size tank.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.830
The things that make them look sharp on smaller
tanks seem to apply on basically any size.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.569
For mounting them you have two options.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.499
You can hang them from the supplied hardware
or you can use the more popular option which

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:16.890
is the Gooseneck.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.090
These things are ideal for the person who
doesn't want to spend all day trying to drill

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.700
holes in their ceiling and mounting their
light.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.810
This thing just screws right on to the side
of the tank.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.239
The bracket works on rimmed and rimless tanks
as well as even mounted sideways for acrylic

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.239
tanks with euro bracing.

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.889
They also just came out with a unique little
accessory which makes the goose neck even

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:34.950
more low profile.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.319
It does raise the lights a bit but rather
than have the gooseneck arch down you can

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.239
have it go straight out, something I think
a lot of people will appreciate.

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.299
My only complaint would be the lack of a really
good cord management option which is something

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.230
I think a lot of people would pay for if it
existed.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.129
Over all I think the Kessil 360 comes in really
high in external aesthetic appeal.

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.319
Ok so most of you care more about what it
looks like inside the tank.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.529
If you have seen any of the other videos we
have done on these you already know we are

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:02.599
in love with the shimmer.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:08.010
I have never been able to achieve natural-looking
shimmer lines like these with any other light

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.630
source, including metal halides.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.099
I will say getting lines like that is a mix
of using a single source of light combined

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.749
with low agitation on the surface of the tank
but even if you can't achieve that the shimmer

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:23.319
is always very natural looking and nothing
like the disco ball effect found on most wide

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.120
array LED light sources.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.730
The color blending is what I'd call perfect
as well.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.859
With many LED's you end up seeing red and
green specs of light floating all over or

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.310
the back of the tank looks like it is on fire.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.480
With the 360 you don't see that because all
of the LED's are all packed so tightly together

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.019
under a single lens.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.079
I have to say I am also impressed with the
color in a way I didn't think I would be.

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.959
so it is obvious that the color spectrum is
much wider when we put the Kessils over the

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:48.959
tank .

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.669
In fact if you look at the edge of where the
light lands you can see some of the different

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:55.549
colors within the light which have been separated
out in a prism like effect.

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.689
I can see red, deep violets, yellow and purple.

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:05.059
One of the things I also really like to look
at is price per LED and at $450 with 45 LED's

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:10.120
these come out to just over $10 per diode
which is less than half some of the more expensive

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.120
options.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.840
In fact the Kessil 360 comes in amongst the
lowest cost retail options out there when

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.919
cost per LED is considered.

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.209
Moving on I think controllability is going
to be one of those things that either makes

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.660
or breaks this light for you.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.310
There is pretty limited controllability.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.720
Basically two knobs on top.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.140
One controls the intensity and other controls
the color spectrum from white to blue.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.330
I will say that there is something pretty
satisfying about turning a knob and finding

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.550
the color you like in seconds.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.670
This of course doesn't allow you to plot fancy
graphs and control each individual spectrum

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.930
like you can with some of their competitors
and while that is cool not everyone wants

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.480
that level of control or has the desire to
hook up their computer to the light to program

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.480
it.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.030
There is absolutely something to be said for
simplicity and the ease of use these two knobs

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.030
provide.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.432
Normally I am a gear junky and naturally like
all the fancy programing options but I have

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:04.010
to be honest I really like the simplicity
here and I know a lot of people I would recommend

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.240
this light to based on this alone.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.890
I know this is going to be attractive to a
lot of you who don't want to spend hours programing.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.630
That's not to say that it doesn't have any
fancy programing options because you can hook

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.920
it up to controllers like the Neptune to change
the intensity of the light throughout the

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.520
day as well as the color spectrum.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.401
If you own a controller like this and a Kessil
it is almost certainly something you will

00:05:25.401 --> 00:05:26.680
end up doing at some point.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.710
When I am looking at a LED fixture's build
quality I am really looking at the fixtures

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.310
ability to cool the LED's properly.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.710
The Kessil comes in a really compact form
factor with a fan and heat sink mounted directly

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.460
to the LED's . We took this one apart so you
could get a better view of how it functions.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.340
You can see the large volume of thin fins
on the heat sink which do get warm to the

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.240
touch but I wouldn't call them hot.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.240
The base plate does get warm up a bit if left
on long enough.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.220
The fan is dead silent and while it doesn't
move an enormous amount of air it does seem

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.870
well optimized for the heat sink because the
fins are only warm even after being left on

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.530
for a long period of time.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.840
I know low profile absolutely silent operation
is critical for many reefers.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.750
Overall I think the cooling system and overall
build quality for such a small form factor

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.320
present an excellent value, especially at
this price point.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.941
To back that up they do come with a one year
warranty and since they are located here in

00:06:15.941 --> 00:06:19.110
the US getting parts or service should be
pretty easy.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.000
The 360 comes on two sizes narrow and wide.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.430
I think most people will be best served with
the wide version which spreads light out 140

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.590
degrees and covers a two foot area down to
30".

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.310
The wider angle also allows you to place them
closer to the water in tight environments

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.930
like a lower profile hood.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.630
The narrow version has a reflector on the
pendent which focuses the light to a much

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.430
sharper 60 degrees spread and covers a 18"
area.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.600
The focused light increases the PAR and ideal
for tanks over 30" deep.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.440
If you are looking to have a SPS dominant
tank you may also appreciate the higher overall

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.660
PAR numbers by selecting the narrow version
and spacing them 18 inches apart.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.470
However for the most common tanks which is
generally a mixed tank less than 24" deep

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.300
we suggest one 360 wide for every two feet
of tank space.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.460
Only time I would suggest going against that
is if euro bracing or cross bracing get in

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.680
the way like it would on a 5 foot tank.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.250
Three foot tanks or odd ball sizes like this
40" one here will likely need two as well.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.981
One last think to note if you are thinking
about picking two of these don't forget to

00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:23.540
get the data link cable which allows you to
link multiple units together that all operate

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.510
off the master units controls so they all
match intensity and spectrum perfectly.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.060
