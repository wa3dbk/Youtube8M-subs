00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:11.320
A recent commenter on our videos pointed out
that often a game falls under the category

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.340
of evolution and not revolution - put another
more personal context, while new and unique

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.630
games are praise-worthy, there's no reason
why a game can't take something we know and

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.910
build upon it.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.089
Kids vs Goblins by Stolen Couch Games and
Crescent Moon Games does just this, giving

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.449
the Battleheart formula a story-driven tweaking.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.159
This isn't the first time the publisher has
pushed something like this through, with Raid

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:40.290
Leader doing a decent job of capturing the
essence of online MMO combats, however Kids

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.489
vs Goblins is something entirely else - waves
upon waves of enemies are the order of the

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.800
day and how you approach each challenge depends
on the mode you play.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.129
From the outset you're given the quest of
rescuing the little baby brother of three

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.510
children stranded on a magical island.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.930
After being granted magical powers they find
themselves fighting a literal uphill battle

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.430
to fight the Goblin King in his lofty mountain
castle.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.420
One thing the game can't be accused of is
throwing the player in to the deep end without

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.420
a paddle.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.090
At almost every turn the game is ready and
willing to explain itself, be it introducing

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.270
how to move and attack to how a newly unlocked
mode works.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.630
This is fortunate as the game itself isn't
as intuitive as you'd expect.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.590
Despite the familiar drag to move/attack/assign
target style of manipulating the trio, their

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.600
ultimate response to your input is often not
what you may have intended.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.280
Dragging a movement line away from a hero
may result in no movement until you also tap

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.509
the location, but it may also cancel the movement.

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.259
Double-tapping results in a hodge-podge attempt
to either move to a location or attack an

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.820
enemy, but one of the children may also wander
off in an entirely separate direction.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.009
With this in mind, taking on the game's varied
stages and challenges takes on a whole new

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.090
level of difficulty that may not have been
intended.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.229
This is a shame as the game makes excellent
use of a limited skill system to provide unique

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.790
scenarios for the player to overcome.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.670
Each character can take on one of three stances
(attack, support, and heal), each with their

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.780
own set of spells to define their style of
play.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.580
Levels occasionally lock you in to a specific
stance, forcing you to spread your resources

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.920
and unlock a variety of skills to survive
challenges such as needing to live for a set

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.820
time without heals.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.040
For a game that has already limited its audience
to those with either an iPhone 4S or iPad

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.060
2, it's a shame it's so difficult to come
to grips with the controls in Kids vs Goblins.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.110
What should be a fun romp for all ages feels
too unstable to recommend without additional

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:39.860
tweaking.
