Red Kite Media

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.000
presents

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.300
Nature in the Eastern part
of the Netherlands

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.600
with Carl Derks

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.700
episode 1: The Black Grouse

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.900
Today we go to the National Park 
"The Sallandse Heuvelrug"

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.500
in the central part of the province Overijssel

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.300
It covers an area of 35 square km...

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.000
...with heath lands, surrounded by deciduous forests

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.000
It is managed by Staatsbosbeheer, Natuurmonumenten 
and some private land owners

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.000
Because the main road is blocked until 
9:00 o'clock in the morning...

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.100
...we park our car at the visitor center

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.800
From here it is a 2 km walk to the area 
where a very special species can be seen

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.600
This is the last population of the Black Grouse
in the Netherlands

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.600
To see Black Grouse 
you'll have to start early...

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.500
..between April and May

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.700
From sunrise the male begins 
with the so-called "Lekking"

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.100
Parkhost Arend Spijker passionately 
explains how that works

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.400
At this time of year, 
with first light in the morning...

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.600
up until about 9 o'clock

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.300
...there are several places 
where you can admire the birds

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.200
It is really spectacular, I would say

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.900
The cocks display their superb tail...

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.700
...beautiful white rumps...

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.400
...their red head wattles swell

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.300
they jump up in the air

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.100
sometimes they fly a bit and
make hissing and grunting noises

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.100
if you have seen this once,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.600
you're guaranteed to come back each year 
to experience it again

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.600
This is the Haarlerberg and
there are several lek places here

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.200
there is a fine male lekking at the moment

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.600
He is quite a distance away but with the spotting scope 
you can get good views

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.600
In this way, many visitors can enjoy watching 
without disturbing the grouse

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.900
Often one male, sits on one of the stumps closer by

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
then you'll get some amazing views

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.000
oh so beautiful

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.100
we just had a good view of the male
sitting on that stump

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.100
I've taken some great photo's

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.900
At the moment we've seen 4 males, 
singing and courting

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.500
and we had just 4 females in a tree

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.400
Makes today's total 8 Black Grouse

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.400
Stonechat

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.200
This unique experience will be
 carefully accompanied by

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.400
helpful volunteers from IVN

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I am a member of the IVN 
Nijverdal/Hellendoorn and

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.100
we are here to assist people who 
come to see Black Grouse

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.300
and we provide the spotting scope 
for the visitors to use

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.000
but it's not only the Black Grouse,

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.400
there are several other 
interesting bird species

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.600
although most people are really here 
for the Black Grouse

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.000
The spectacle is finished now

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.500
In a few moments the road becomes 
open for cars

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.400
It was a beautiful morning
