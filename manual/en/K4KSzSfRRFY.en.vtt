bjbjLULU Hey Guys this is Naudi at Functionalpatterns.com
and this is part two of how to fix your running

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.400
biomechanics.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.520
Last week we focused on the Anterior Oblique
Systems working on the front side of the body,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.850
this time were going to work on the Posterior
Oblique systems working on the back side of

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.850
the body.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.529
That's going to consist of your Lats and your
contralateral Glutes working along together

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.060
at the same time going through your gait cycle.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.329
So if you watch me here doing the sprint,
you will notice as my right arm kicks back,

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.510
my left glute kicks back simultaneously.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.820
As my left arm kicks back my right glute kicks
back simultaneously.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.789
So its extension of the arm and extension
of the opposite hip that normally propels

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.789
you into gait.

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.850
If we can master that correctly and get those
muscles working like they're supposed to,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.859
then you're really going to get an efficient
sprint.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.989
The exercise we're going to use to activate
the Posterior Oblique System and improve your

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.629
running dynamics is going to be a contra-lateral
stepping pull.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.480
We're going to use a cable machine for this,
so right here I'm going to grab with my right

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.060
hand and step back with my left leg.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.180
So this is really going to be the exact opposite
of the movement that I did last week.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.060
One thing I want you being conscientious of
is that your posture is completely set in

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.869
line your thoracic spine is completely extended,
my spine is neutral so I'm not hunching forward.

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.460
If you start from an improper position it's
more than likely that you're going to end

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.130
in an improper position.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.800
So again, find that center of gravity.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.950
Also, keep in mind that this is not a sagittal
plane movement, if its sagittal plane when

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.759
I come back I'm not going to get full efficiency
remember, running is a rotational movement,

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.340
it's not really sagittal plane.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.590
So when we come back and do this exercise,
notice that my body rotates as I come back

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.170
and that I'm not just stepping to come back
in this direction.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.909
Notice how my trunk rotates notice how my
center of gravity is completely set in line.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.909
So we rotate, I inhale as I come back, exhale
as I come forward.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.030
Notice as I come forward I don't lean forward
that's a common mistake people will make when

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.050
they let their thoracic lean forward from
there.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.880
Keep the weight slightly back, let the trunk
rotate and explode backwards.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:25.120
Again using that reciprocity fire that left
hand forward.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.340
Ok we'll switch sides.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.209
I grab with my left hand, step back with my
left leg.

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:36.030
I rotate my body I keep my thoracic engage.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.190
Breathing was wrong on that one I inhale as
I come back.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:54.010
Again, center of gravity is nice and strong
using that reciprocity with my right hand,

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:03.890
I extend with that right hip from here, that
left lat pulls back.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.780
And there it is, that is how we work the posterior
oblique system for improving running dynamics.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.660
