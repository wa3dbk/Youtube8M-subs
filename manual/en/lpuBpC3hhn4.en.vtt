00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.319
Candles, lights and decorations are an essential
part of the holiday season, but they also

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.190
increase the risk of fire and injury.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.759
Here are some tips from the Insurance Information
Institute to help you have a safe holiday

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:14.900
season.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.050
Pick out a freshly cut Christmas tree.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.070
Trim at least one inch from the bottom of
the tree to allow it to easily absorb water.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.330
Place the tree in a secure stand designed
to hold the weight of the tree and check the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.150
water level often.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.949
If you buy an artificial tree, make sure that
itâ€™s made of fire resistant material.

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.710
Never place your tree near a heat source such
as a fireplace or a radiator and be sure to

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.210
keep all open flames such as candles and matches
away from your tree.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.440
Dispose of the tree when it becomes dry or
when the needles begin to fall off.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.969
Never burn an old tree; take it to a recycling
center or have it removed by a community pick-up

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.110
service instead.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.649
Do not overload electrical sockets and always
unplug holiday lights when no one is home

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.840
or when you go to bed.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.820
Use only Underwriters Laboratories (UL) approved
lights.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.129
Inspect old light strands for any cracks,
frayed edges or bare spots and throw out damaged

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.580
cords.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.570
Never use indoor lights outside.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.270
Remove outdoor lighting as soon as the season
is over as even specially created outdoor

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.140
decorations are not designed to withstand
prolonged exposure to the elements.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.350
Don't block exit paths or fire escapes with
Christmas trees or other decorations.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.670
Place all ornaments and candles out of reach
of small children and pets.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.350
Small or breakable ornaments can be easily
knocked down and result in cuts or choking.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.310
Curious children and playful pets can topple
a tree in seconds.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.579
Check candles frequently to make sure they
do not burn down too far or drip hot wax.

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.479
Keep them away from decorations and other
combustible materials.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.450
Never leave a burning candle unattended!

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.630
Give you family the priceless gift of safety
this holiday season.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.700
Happy Holidays from all of us at the Central
Insurance Companies.
