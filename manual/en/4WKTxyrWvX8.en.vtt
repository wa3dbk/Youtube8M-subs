00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Now we will place each yellow in its own spot

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:07.001
Move the yellow face down

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:09.702
and look for two identical corners

00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:11.003
none here

00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.004
none here either

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.005
here there are two blue corners

00:00:16.506 --> 00:00:21.006
The yellow face becomes the down face

00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:25.007
and move the blue corners on the back side

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:28.008
Here's the algorithm :

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:42.509
R+ F- R+ B2 R- F+ R+ B2 R2

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.010
So here are two new identical corners

00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:50.011
I match all corners with their appropriate sides

00:00:50.012 --> 00:00:51.012
red

00:00:51.013 --> 00:00:52.013
blue

00:00:52.014 --> 00:00:53.014
orange

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:55.015
green

00:00:56.016 --> 00:01:02.516
Last step now is to place the yellows of the cross

00:01:03.017 --> 00:01:09.017
Most frequently, one yellow edge is in place

00:01:09.018 --> 00:01:14.018
and three misplaced

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:21.019
Hold the cube with the well-placed yellow on the back side

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.020
and perform this algorithm :

00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:27.021
F2 D- L- R+ F2 R- L+ D- F2

00:01:27.322 --> 00:01:30.022
If none of the edges are in place

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:34.023
do the algorithm one time

00:01:34.024 --> 00:01:36.024
and then one yellow will get in place

00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:40.025
Hold the cube with this yellow on the back side and go on :

00:01:40.026 --> 00:01:54.026
F2 D- L- R+ F2 R- L+ D- F2

00:01:54.527 --> 00:01:58.027
There you are !!!!

00:01:58.528 --> 00:02:02.628
You may have to do this algorithm twice to finalize the cube

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:06.029
So it's over

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.030
Congratulations

00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:15.031
Thanks for your attention

00:02:16.032 --> 00:02:21.032
You can e-mail me for any question

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:26.033
or any commentary about these videos

00:02:27.034 --> 00:02:30.034
Thank you... bye !!!
