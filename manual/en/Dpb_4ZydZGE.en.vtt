welcome back to my channel, kids

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.014
so today i have a tube dress

00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:17.538
an asymmetric tube dress DIY

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:19.317
if you wanna see how to make it keep watching

00:00:19.326 --> 00:00:20.800
it's like a little bandana, honestly

00:00:21.806 --> 00:00:23.114
so, let's get started

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:26.559
measure that beautiful body

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:29.481
so, you're just gonna measure your bust, waist, and  hips

00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:33.744
and then take 1/4th of (each) measurement to make the pattern

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.010
as you can see i'm ashy, um, don't judge me!

00:00:37.098 --> 00:00:40.218
y'know? like, it happens to the very best of us.

00:00:48.753 --> 00:00:52.273
so like, yeah. i'm definitely just measuring my body

00:00:52.273 --> 00:00:55.702
writing it down and then drawing a pattern that's just like

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.500
what half of my body would be if i put it up to me

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.440
as you can see, it's gonna look like a lil' curvy lava lamp or something

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.520
you're gonna cut the pattern out twice on folded fabric

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.092
so that you'll have two pieces that were (both) cut on fold

00:01:18.468 --> 00:01:20.788
so they're perfectly symmetrical

00:01:20.788 --> 00:01:21.984
um and then you're done

00:01:26.828 --> 00:01:30.188
then you're gonna place them right sides together

00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:31.973
and like, sew them down the length of them

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:37.025
then you're gonna make a beautiful diagonal line with chalk

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:40.081
or whatever you have, in your satin bonnet and your glasses!

00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:43.624
and then you're going to cut that so that it can be asymmetric!

00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:45.545
you don't have to do this, it can be a tube if you want

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.360
finish the top edge by folding over and top stitching it

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.335
close to the edge, and you're done!

00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:52.694
alright, so that's the end of the video

00:01:53.178 --> 00:01:56.538
as always check the description for blogs, music,

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.499
magazines, art, artists, whatever-- that i've been into lately!

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:01.974
(and) have a great day! bye!
