00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:04.533
The President:
I just wanted to give a quick statement about the kids tobacco

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:08.800
legislation that passed
the Senate yesterday.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.667
This bill has obviously
been a long time coming.

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:15.967
We've known for years, even
decades, about the harmful,

00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:19.667
addictive, and often deadly
effects of tobacco products.

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:24.233
Each year Americans pay nearly
$100 billion in added health

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.734
care costs due to smoking.

00:00:26.734 --> 00:00:30.867
Each day about a thousand young
people under the age of 18

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:33.333
become regular smokers.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.800
For over a decade, leaders of
both parties have fought to

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.967
prevent tobacco companies from
marketing their products to

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:43.600
children, and provide the public
with the information they need

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.500
to understand what a
dangerous habit this is.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.600
And after a decade
of opposition,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.233
all of us are finally about to
achieve the victory with this

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:58.200
bill, a bill that truly
defines change in Washington.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.800
I'm proud that the House and the
Senate have acted swiftly and in

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.300
an overwhelmingly bipartisan
fashion to pass this legislation

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.867
that will protect our kids and
improve our public health.

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:11.600
Along with legislation to
protect credit card owners from

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.734
unfair rate hikes, homeowners
from mortgage fraud and abuse,

00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:18.867
and taxpayers from
wasteful defense spending,

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:22.033
this kids tobacco bill would be
the fourth piece of bipartisan

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:25.667
legislation that I've signed
into law over the last month

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:27.934
that protects the
American consumer,

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:32.133
and changes the way Washington
works and who Washington works for.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.600
So I look forward to signing it.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.233
I want to thank all the people
in the House and the Senate for

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:40.667
working so hard to pass this
bill in a bipartisan way.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:44.433
And I want to give a special
shout-out to my legislative

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:46.300
director, Phil Schiliro.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.233
He and his team have just
done an outstanding job.

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:51.400
They've been working on
this for a long time,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.500
even before they joined
the administration.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.700
I'm really proud of them.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.433
All right.

00:01:55.433 --> 00:01:56.300
Thanks, guys.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.300
Have a great weekend.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.300
The Press:
Mr. President, how closely
are you watching the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.300
Iranian elections?

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.000
How critical is it to change?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.567
The President:
We are excited to see what appears to be a robust debate

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:10.033
taking place in Iran.

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:14.967
And obviously, after the
speech that I made in Cairo,

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:19.333
we tried to send a clear message
that we think there is the

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:21.667
possibility of change.

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:27.633
And ultimately, the election
is for the Iranians to decide,

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:32.667
but just as has been
true in Lebanon,

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:38.266
what can be true in Iran as well
is that you're seeing people

00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:41.166
looking at new possibilities.

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:46.000
And whoever ends up winning
the election in Iran,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.133
the fact that there's been a
robust debate hopefully will

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:53.367
help advance our ability to
engage them in new ways.

00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:54.367
All right?

00:02:54.367 --> 00:02:55.367
Thank you, guys.
