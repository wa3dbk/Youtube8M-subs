00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[A skipjack under sail]

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.040
Since the mid 1800s

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.120
tens of thousands of commercial fishermen

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.540
in Maryland and Virginia

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.420
have hauled hundreds of millions of bushels

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:21.420
of oysters out of Chesapeake Bay

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.419
They were fishing on oyster bars that probably
once

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.650
looked like this

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.560
dense clumps of large oysters crammed together
over time

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.790
into vast underwater reefs

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.149
The historic oyster reefs of the Chesapeake

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.829
like the coral reefs of the Caribbean

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.859
formed huge living underwater structures

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.379
[A research boat heads out on the Bay]

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.219
[Biologist Ken Paynter is in the cabin]

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.800
After a century and a half of heavy harvesting

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.510
and after four decades of oyster disease

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.039
what's happened to these great reefs?

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.830
We wanted to find out

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.119
We wanted to show other people

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.479
what the bottom of the Bay looks like now

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:21.479
Now the only people who see it are scuba divers

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:29.210
And they only get to see it on fairly calm
days

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.490
We began experimenting

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.240
with a variety of underwater cameras

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.750
We started by sending scuba divers down

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.750
to observe these historic bars and videotape
them

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.229
We found most of the reefs broken down

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.619
and scattered by fishing

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.990
And many of the oysters dead from diseases

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.369
like Dermo and MSX

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.360
There's one clump

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.369
They are dead oysters, oysters that have died

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.260
and they are stuck together

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.260
but there is no living tissue inside

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.110
This is what most of Maryland's historic oyster
bars look like now

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.110
A few worms, some scattered shells

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.360
Compared to the rich community that was once
here

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.680
little is left

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.769
Today the oyster population is about 2%

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.769
of what it was 100 years ago

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.140
The great reefs have been broken down

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.360
and scattered by heavy fishing

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.390
Thousands of acres have been buried by sediments

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.650
And then diseases have killed many

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.609
of the remaining oysters
