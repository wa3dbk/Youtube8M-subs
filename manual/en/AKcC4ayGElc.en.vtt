Dogashima, over time, has become hugely popular among both Japanese and foreign tourists.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It is most famous for its dramatic stone formations and gorgeous landscape shaped by the lava flow from nearby volcanoes that erupted many centuries ago. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000
While most people tend to limit their visit to Dogahima itself, with its many restaurants and onsens,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.000
the place offers many different attractions to the more curious.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.000
These include some very scenic hiking routes that will allow you to enjoy Dogashima magmatic dikes and stone beach,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.000
as well as enjoying a 25-minute boat ride that briefly enters one of Dogashimaâ€™s many gigantic caves.
