Voiceover: Hey guys, [friction pin].

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.183
Thought I'd do a quick video

00:00:04.183 --> 00:00:07.638
on my Lego super hero collection.

00:00:08.187 --> 00:00:12.586
I was adding the new figures
that I just got recently.

00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:15.826
And I thought well I'll just
take em all out of the cases

00:00:15.826 --> 00:00:19.548
and kinda put em all together
and give you a group shot.

00:00:19.548 --> 00:00:23.456
So sorry the camera's
shaky but I'm holding it

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:26.652
cause it doesn't, I can't
get the right angle on em

00:00:26.652 --> 00:00:32.390
in the tripod so there
they all are except for

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.016
some of the minor goons,
policemen, things like that.

00:00:36.016 --> 00:00:37.720
And I have a few of those things in there

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.349
but mainly it's just the super heroes.

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:44.831
Got the new ones and the old ones.

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:50.981
DC and Marvel are all in
there all mixed together.

00:00:55.263 --> 00:01:01.792
I got some of the giveaway
ones from SDCC, Comic-Con,

00:01:03.445 --> 00:01:06.720
both New York and the SDCC.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.720
Also the Toy Fair figures
are in there somewhere.

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:15.482
I can say I kind of just mixed em all up

00:01:15.482 --> 00:01:18.247
just kinda did it random.

00:01:18.247 --> 00:01:20.116
Kinda give you an idea.

00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:24.218
Thought it would be neat to
get this group shot done.

00:01:24.218 --> 00:01:27.582
So I took a couple pictures,
posted it on Instagram

00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:31.382
but it's pretty small, kinda hard to see.

00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:33.673
So I thought well I'll
just do this quick video,

00:01:33.673 --> 00:01:38.879
kinda run through there
and kinda give you an idea

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:42.636
of the figures that I
have in my collection.

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:44.505
I'll get these put back in the case.

00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:49.612
And I'll do a little bit more
substantial video probably two;

00:01:49.612 --> 00:01:51.902
one for the Marvel figures

00:01:51.902 --> 00:01:55.704
and one for the DC figures here soon.

00:01:55.704 --> 00:01:59.869
But while I had em all out I
thought I'd do this group shot.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.528
Kind of see what you
guys thought about that.

00:02:02.528 --> 00:02:07.737
So let me know if you liked
it, thought it was interesting,

00:02:07.737 --> 00:02:11.908
put comments on the which
figure is your favorite.

00:02:11.908 --> 00:02:14.239
Just anything that you wanna let me know.

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.799
So thanks for watching and
we'll see you next time.
