00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.610
 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.180
 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.559
You know the plow seems to be symbolic
of that can-do spirit that you find in

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.608
American farmers

00:00:12.608 --> 00:00:16.707
and so when you say that there may be 
better alternatives to tillage for

00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:18.516
compaction relief, that seems

00:00:18.516 --> 00:00:23.505
somehow counter-intuitive and almost 
un-American

00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:26.834
I met two guys from Ohio State who
use science

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:33.502
to put conventional wisdom on its head.
"Were trying to tell farmers that

00:00:33.502 --> 00:00:37.080
you cannot solve your problems with
steel you know steel

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.690
is shiny you can put your hand on it you
can spend a lot of money on steel

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.838
and even with the subsoiler that may
have minimal surface disturbance

00:00:45.838 --> 00:00:49.537
it's really not solving the problem.  You
know we're seeing

00:00:49.537 --> 00:00:53.576
that soil structure can be better
solved by using natural

00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:58.074
rooting systems through our cover crops or
continuous no-till from the cropping

00:00:58.074 --> 00:00:58.944
systems.

00:00:58.944 --> 00:01:02.844
We have some other experiments here that
are proving that.  We have some compaction

00:01:02.844 --> 00:01:03.594
plots

00:01:03.594 --> 00:01:06.653
comparing subsoil - steel

00:01:06.653 --> 00:01:10.932
versus living cover crops...  We're
purposely compacting these plots in the

00:01:10.932 --> 00:01:11.532
fall

00:01:11.532 --> 00:01:14.691
under moist soil conditions by using a
grain cart

00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:18.589
in going back and forth over the plots
and forcing their compaction

00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:22.319
and then the cover crops are planted and 
we're comparing that to using a

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:23.297
subsoiler

00:01:23.297 --> 00:01:28.277
and our yields are showing better
results with the cover crops. And of course

00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:29.167
when you get some

00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:32.386
heavy rains you can see standing water
problems

00:01:32.386 --> 00:01:35.764
you know that show up between the
compaction levels with the plots also

00:01:35.764 --> 00:01:36.355
that way

00:01:36.355 --> 00:01:42.313
And the cover crops are out doing the
steel."  So what's the explanation for

00:01:42.313 --> 00:01:44.292
these rather surprising results?

00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:48.050
When you look at soil, you have to
look at the components

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.570
and the the major component most soil

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.199
is sand, silt and clay, now that makes up
about 45 percent

00:01:56.199 --> 00:02:00.778
a really good soil.  The other part of the
soil what we tend to forget about as it

00:02:00.778 --> 00:02:04.856
should be pore-space.  Almost 50 percent
of a really good soil

00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:08.726
is pore-space, but then the most important
part the soil

00:02:08.726 --> 00:02:12.995
is organic matter.  That's like your head
and your brains that controls most

00:02:12.995 --> 00:02:14.523
chemical reactions

00:02:14.523 --> 00:02:17.573
and most the life is with that organic
matter.

00:02:17.573 --> 00:02:20.622
You know when you when you start to till
a soil what you do is you

00:02:20.622 --> 00:02:25.371
burn up the organic matter so in the
last 100 to 150 years through tillage

00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:29.730
we've lost probably at least sixty
percent of our orgnic matter - some studies

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.560
say as much as

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.099
80 percent the organic matter is going
right up in the atmosphere and this is a

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.518
good

00:02:34.518 --> 00:02:37.848
area because this was a Black Swamp 

00:02:37.848 --> 00:02:42.456
in in Northwest Ohio when the first
settlers came here they said our soil

00:02:42.456 --> 00:02:44.306
was as black as midnight

00:02:44.306 --> 00:02:48.104
and when you look at the soil now, you'll
see that it's not as

00:02:48.104 --> 00:02:52.424
black it actually kind of a brown- it's
lost its color so it's lost a lot of its

00:02:52.424 --> 00:02:52.883
organic matter.

00:02:52.883 --> 00:02:56.392
I like to tell farmers that the

00:02:56.392 --> 00:03:00.710
a lot of times when you till the soil you
turn it into cement mix OK, so the soil

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.400
gets very hard and dense

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.730
and one of the things that we've learned
is that if I was going to drill into

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.348
cement

00:03:07.348 --> 00:03:11.117
I would start with the small drill and
then use a bigger drill to go through it

00:03:11.117 --> 00:03:13.088
and so that's what we do with the cover
crops

00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:16.256
the cover crops actually have very fine
roots and they

00:03:16.256 --> 00:03:21.065
form a small hole and then we follow
that with corn and soybeans

00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:25.045
and and those corn and soybeans will
follow those same channels down through

00:03:25.045 --> 00:03:25.874
the soil

00:03:25.874 --> 00:03:30.193
and and they also follow earthworm holes
because earthworms are fairly big in there

00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:30.793
also

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:35.302
enriched with nutrients and so those
roots just really proliferate

00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:38.711
around those earthworm holes and that's
how we

00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:41.770
then can actually loosen the soil
because it's 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.149
the roots that loosen the soil and give
that carbon to the soil

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:49.758
and also is a storehouse for all the
nutrients and the water.

00:03:49.758 --> 00:03:55.055
So a lot innovation is happening is
really an exciting time because

00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:58.375
farmers are seeing that he there's
different ways we can

00:03:58.375 --> 00:04:03.214
improve our soils by adding cover crops,
by not going to steel, by reducing

00:04:03.214 --> 00:04:05.463
your tillage - a lot of good innovative
thinking

00:04:05.463 --> 00:04:09.992
I think is happening

00:04:09.992 --> 00:04:16.992
 

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:21.809
