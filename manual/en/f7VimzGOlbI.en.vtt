00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.740
a newly released study shows that
regular drinkers are less likely to die

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.890
prematurely

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.299
then people who have never indulged in
alcohol

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.369
time reports that abstaining from
alcohol

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:17.060
altogether seems to correlate to a
shorter life then consistent but

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.440
moderate drinking

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.710
this was a tightly controlled study it
look at individuals who are between 55

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.300
and 65 years old

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.860
and it spanned a twenty year period
accounting for variables ranging from

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.140
socioeconomic status to level a physical
activity

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.810
it found that mortality rates were
highest for those who never

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.260
drank at all lower for heavy drinkers

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.890
and low west for moderate drinkers who
enjoyed one to three drinks

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.880
per day above the 1824 participants in
the study

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.730
41 percent of the moderate drinkers died
prematurely

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.649
compared to 69 percent %uh non-drinkers

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.750
heavy drinkers were in the middle at
sixty percent mortality rate

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.150
despite the increased risks for
cirrhosis

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.920
and several types of cancer not to
mention alcohol dependency

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.409
car accident in poor judgment overall
associated with heavy drinking

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.650
those who drink are less likely to die

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.690
than those who do not drink at all so

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.479
the possible explanation that the study
puts out is that

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.830
alcohol can be a social lubricant right
and that

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.680
those with friends and who have an
active social life

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.290
tend to have I longer life right strong
social network to do correlate with a

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.150
longer life

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.580
and if we look at that I would

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.799
not be immediately drawn to that is the
explanation I would say

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.990
the question I would want answered is
this what else

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.170
are those who don't drink at all doing

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.259
or not doing that differs from those who
drink moderately

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.500
and those who drink too much so

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.890
their is maybe something that those the
moderate drinkers and the heavy drinkers

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.910
also do or don't do

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.030
other than just being more social
because they're drinking

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.709
that is actually the cause over the
longer life versus the alcoholic itself

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.340
it doesn't seem like the study is
suggesting that it is the alcohol

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.630
consumption consumption

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.340
itself there is leading to a longer life
right

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.020
I we know that they can have some
benefits lowering stress

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.080
and you know even arm a heart benefits

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.610
in small amounts by at I don't think
that would be a leader I would say to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.200
people

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.910
think about the people you know refused
to drink who have never drank

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.520
I am and just I don't know ito analyze
that type a person maybe there's some

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.040
trend

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.629
yeah I don't know I mean if I think
about the people I know who absolutely

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:52.950
never drink

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.860
their definitely in general people who
are

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.980
a little bit more uptight but at the
same time

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.440
I'm uptight and I drink is so I don't
know that that really

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.489
is the exact thing but most of the
people I know who don't drink at all

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.400
actually don't drink because they know
they have a family history of alcoholism

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.610
and they don't even want to open up that
door which actually seems like a very

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.370
responsible thing to be doing

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.519
right add think that perhaps something

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.410
we should be bought at the equation we
both the lottery question because that

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.590
makes perfect sense right there

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.860
yeah I i'm opening this to the audience
what do you think what would you point

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.430
to

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.569
do you buy the idea that it is simply
the social lubrication aspect

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.900
up consuming alcohol that is correlating
with longer life is there something

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.720
about non-drinkers that maybe
correlating but shorter life for causing

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.550
shorter life

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.840
I'm really open to all ideas on this one
