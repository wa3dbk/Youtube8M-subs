Hi.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.050
I'm the YouTube Deal Guy Matt Granite.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.510
First of all, if you're subscribed, thank
you so much, you're the reason I have a job

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.220
and you are now signed up to get deals before
anyone who watches me on your local TV station

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.220
or USA Today.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.240
Today's two huge printer price drops, are
located right under this video window.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.220
The first that I want to show you is a laser
printer.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.130
The second one is an all-in-one that I bought
and unboxed and I'll take you through the

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.429
process because I get so many questions about
what's the best wireless all in one.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.770
Keep in mind that none of these are paid products
- all I really want to do is save you money

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.500
and if you're looking to get more of my big
deals moving forward, or if you're new to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.390
me, I'll show you how to do all of that at
the end of this video.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.260
So let's start with this awesome laser printer.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.940
Now keep in mind these are very limited time
deals.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.750
The one that I'm flagging for you right now
is part of this video recording from May 7th.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.089
It's available through May 9th.

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:57.089
It will probably sell out but I've been told
there is a lot of stock on it.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.170
It's at it's lowest recorded price!

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.040
$50 ... free shipping... wireless printing
and USB.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.210
Absolutely awesome.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.400
If you're looking for a printer with scanning
and other all in one capabilities, the one

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.230
that I want to show you right now is my favorite
pixma.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.720
The one that you see on your screen right
now is around $77.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.280
Its sales price will fluctuate.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.770
But this will stay reduced over the next few
months.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.461
If you were to buy it from ebay without ink,
you're looking at around $54 with free shipping

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:40.380
but of course if you can get the cartridges
included, that's where you will save the most.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.860
I bought this printer and I want to show you
right now how it works.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.960
This is the new printer that I will now unbox.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.330
I've purchased this for my in-laws to replace
their old printer which is about 10 years

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.230
old and has stopped working.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.860
Here are the included cartridges which go
in here easily.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.920
Simple set-up.I didn't even need to use the
software CD.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.070
The printer drivers were immediately located
when I flagged the printer through its wireless

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.890
connection from my computer.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.890
Now let's do a quick color print test.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.230
This is my wife and my sister - two separate
people.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:27.070
Using the wireless connection, we are now
going to time a color print.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.610
This is not photo paper but a beautiful print.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.440
It took around 15 seconds to print and obviously
if you're using the wireless printing option,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.750
it's going to be a slower print job.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.800
Now let's time a black and white printing
job.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.740
This is some packing last from my wife's laptop.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:59.260
We're going to transmit this print job to
the other room and see how long it takes.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.310
So with the exception of the transmission
of data which slowed this down, I'd say it

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.140
printed that page in 4 -5 seconds.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.630
So that was the printer.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.060
Now back to me unfortunately but if you are
looking for any of the savings I just showed

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.080
you, they're located right under this video
window.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.760
