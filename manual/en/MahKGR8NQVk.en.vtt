00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.100
No more draught if SIGA's Fentrim is used

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.140
Fentrim comes in different widths. With or without perforations.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.980
Clean away al dust and rubbish.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.180
A good brush will do the job!

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.300
Mark the thickness of the boarding

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.700
This way Fentrim wil stay out of sight afterwards.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.240
Apply tape with the sticky side to the window.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.700
Remove backing strip and press firmly. 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.720
And also the backing strip from the perforated zone

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.980
The result is amazing. Plaster can be applied.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.780
All sides of the window are done in the same way.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.980
Neatly clean all the backing strips in te correct way.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.080
Plaster will stick astonishing.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.540
Your windows don't cause draught and energy loss is reduced enormously. Comfort is all around. 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.440
