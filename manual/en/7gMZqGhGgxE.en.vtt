00:00:11.831 --> 00:00:13.265
HEY, LISTEN TO ME.

00:00:13.265 --> 00:00:14.832
YOU CAN'T BE SUCH
A BAD GUY, OKAY? 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.834
JEEZ, THE INTERNET
WAS RIGHT.

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:20.870
( McConaughey as Batman )
I MADE A PROMISE ON THE GRAVE

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.303
OF MY PARENTS
THAT I WOULD 

00:00:22.303 --> 00:00:25.572
RID THIS CITY OF THE EVIL
THAT TOOK THEIR LIVES.

00:00:25.572 --> 00:00:27.539
BY DAY, I'M BRUCE WAYNE.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.908

00:00:29.908 --> 00:00:32.476
AND WE'RE ALL JUST
BREATHING PARTICLES, MAN,

00:00:32.476 --> 00:00:35.544
JUST SPINNING AROUND
ON THE EDGE OF AN ORB--

00:00:35.544 --> 00:00:38.079
DO YOU EVER STOP TALKING?

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.014

00:00:45.916 --> 00:00:48.385
WHO HAS TURNED
TO A LIFE OF CRIME.

00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:50.852
SHOULD I TELL
CITY HALL?  NO.

00:00:50.852 --> 00:00:52.553
THEY'LL WONDER
WHY I DIDN'T KNOW,

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:54.588
WHICH MAKES ME
LOOK UNINFORMED.

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:56.890
I DO NOT ENJOY SURPRISES,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.757
BUT I DO ENJOY
FREDDY'S DELICIOUS RIBS.

00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:03.093
TWO-FACE, WHAT'S UP?
I'M BATMAN.

00:01:03.093 --> 00:01:04.460
WHY YOU GOT TWO FACES?

MY BATMAN FACE.

00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:08.896
I GOT ONE BRUCE WAYNE FACE.
THAT'S TWO FACES TOTAL.

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:10.463
BUT I ONLY USE
ONE FACE AT A TIME.

00:01:10.463 --> 00:01:12.731
SO YOU'RE TWO-FACE.
I GOT TWO ONE-FACES.

00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:14.132
