00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200
NIGEL: Hello and welcome to a new Dota 2 Report.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.100
I'm on my way to the top lane.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.700
to deliver Bristleback's items.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.000
Hopefully he's doing okay up here.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.200
BRISTLEBACK: Nothing crazy... and don't die.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.200
CREEP: Hey get out of the way, short stuff!

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.700
Yeah, beat it!

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.100
BRISTLEBACK: We've got ourselves a try-hard lane up here.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.600
NIGEL: You mean a tri-lane?

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.700
BRISTLEBACK: A what?

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.000
NIGEL: So who is the third hero up here? 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.800
BUT SERIOUSLY

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.500
INVOKER: Goodness, I barely made it.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.700
This Pudge is becoming a problem.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.800
Perhaps a different approach...

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.500
Exort Wex Wex! Um...

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.600
Exort! Exort! Exort! Exort!?

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.500
Wex! Wexort! Wexorty... uh...

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.300
Onto the um... Wex... Exort...

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.400
Okay!

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.500
Wex! Exort! Exort! 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.700
Take this!

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.700
BRISTLEBACK: Get out of my way!

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.300
CREEP: Oh yeah, how do you think it feels?

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.300
Huh yeah? Oh! Oh! You like that?
