00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.750
Teenage Kara Zor-El survived Krypton's destruction
in suspended animation on a craft following

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.610
her cousin, Kal-El.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.539
After a longer-than-intended journey to Earth,
Kara woke to a series of shocking discoveries:

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.880
She had incredible yet dangerous new powers,
her baby cousin was a grown man, and the two

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.640
were Krypton's only survivors.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.960
While Kara still grieves for Krypton, she
fights to protect family, friends, and her

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.020
new home as Supergirl.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.510
An agile Bruiser, Supergirl charges into fights
and clobbers vulnerable enemies.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.180
Her passive is Solar Furnace.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.010
With every basic attack Supergirl gains a
stack of Solar Furnace, up to a maximum of

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.070
4 stacks.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.970
At four stacks of Solar Furnance, Supergirl
gains bonus True Damage with her basic attacks

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.720
and the skill Worldbreaker.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.940
Worldbreaker gives her next basic attack additional
Attack Damage and will strike enemies in a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.510
cone behind her target.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.080
Supergirl dashes in a target direction with
Bounding Strike, dealing Attack Damage and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.300
moving through drones.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.060
Bounding Strike will end at the first jungle
creature or enemy champion hit, knocking the

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.310
target down.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.920
Activate Determination for a brief boost to
Attack Armor and Move Speed.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.190
While active, her next four basic attacks
will reduce the current cooldown of Worldbreaker

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.140
and Bounding Strike.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.590
Her ultimate is Comet.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.060
Supergirl grabs her target and dashes forward,
dealing Attack Damage and knocking her target

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.060
down.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.710
While dashing with her grabbed target, enemies
caught in her path are knocked up.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.130
Supergirl will shine brighter the longer she
stays in a fight.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.210
For a strong initiate, open with Bounding
Strike to knock your enemy down, and then

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.050
follow with Worldbreaker.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.270
Next, use Determination so you can stick to
the enemy with basic attacks and reduce Worldbreaker's

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.820
cooldown.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.360
While Bounding Strike followed by Determination
is great for chasing enemies, it's also good

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.080
for escaping risky situations.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.729
And remember: using Determination before Bounding
Strike sacrifices the free cooldown reduction

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.010
granted by Determination.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.409
Comet can be used to knock targets through
walls, removing them from a fight and isolating

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:18.720
a vulnerable enemy.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.189
And, when flanking a vulnerable enemy, you
can use Comet to carry them into your team

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.560
for an easy kill.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.269
Supergirl excels when forging artifacts with
high-damage and partial defense.

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.989
Joe Chill's Revolver, Velocity 9 Implants,
and Deathstroke's Claymore are all strong

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.939
offensive choices.

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.709
If building a more durable Supergirl, Spear
of Destiny and Sword of Beowulf help defend

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.459
against Power Damage.

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.430
And for defense against Attack Damage try
Claw of Horus or Suit of Sorrows.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.650
Supergirl's Invulnerability provides extra
Attack Damage while her shield is active.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.030
Used at the right time, this will reduce damage
from enemy champion skills and can swing a

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.700
team fight in your favor.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.599
Make the world a better place one punch at
a time as Supergirl, the Last Daughter of

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.920
Krypton.
