00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:09.059
Okay, what we have here, are some more suburban
survival tools you should have. We have the

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:19.949
emergency tablets for drinking water. Now
what you want to do with this is open it up.

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.070
You want to use two tablets for every one
quart of water. And it needs to sit in the

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.460
water, one quart, two tablets for 30 minutes
before you can drink it. If you're going downstream

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.020
and you pick up some water out of the creek,
you can use these tablets. There's, remember,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.030
there's two tablets for every one quart. Wait
30 minutes before you drink the water. Everybody

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:56.120
should have this, in their suburban survival
kit.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:05.600
Okay, what I have here is half a quart, so
I'm going to use one pill. I'm going to fill

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:16.790
this up.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:26.100
Remember this is half a quart, so I only need
to use, I'm going to put it right here, I

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:41.490
only need to use one of these. And if you
want, try not to touch, you can see them,

00:01:41.490 --> 00:02:02.290
very tiny, very tiny pills, just use one.
Pop it in and close this up

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:11.330
and let's shake it up. And now you need to
wait 30 minutes for this to, to take effect

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:19.920
and kill the germs. So you need to wait and
this is, will be ready in 30 minutes.
