00:00:13.452 --> 00:00:16.480
So, Francis and I
are both classical architects,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.314
and when we tell people that,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.490
they often ask us
quite familiar questions,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.431
so we've called this talk
"Six Frequently Asked Questions,"

00:00:24.431 --> 00:00:26.741
and I'm going to try
and answer three of them

00:00:26.756 --> 00:00:28.660
and then Francis will answer the others.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.753
So, the first question, very simply, is:
what is classical architecture?

00:00:32.753 --> 00:00:38.180
Well, it's a kind of architecture
which started in ancient Greece and Rome,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.056
which has its own set of rules.

00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:45.379
And those rules are based
around five different kinds of column,

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.460
which are called the five orders.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.177
For about two thousand years,

00:00:50.203 --> 00:00:53.382
the five orders were the basis
of all architecture.

00:00:53.382 --> 00:00:56.415
But about fifty years ago,
they stopped being taught,

00:00:56.415 --> 00:00:59.688
and most architects
now don't know much about them,

00:00:59.688 --> 00:01:03.148
and would dismiss them
as being irrelevant.

00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:07.248
This is a picture of me measuring
and drawing a classical building.

00:01:07.248 --> 00:01:11.490
And it's my belief that,
because it's not taught any more,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.627
the only way you can really find out about
the grammar and language of buildings

00:01:16.627 --> 00:01:22.299
is by measuring and drawing them yourself,
and that's what I do

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.681
and also what we're doing outside today.

00:01:24.924 --> 00:01:26.287
So the next question is:

00:01:26.313 --> 00:01:29.026
why is classical architecture
relevant now?

00:01:30.092 --> 00:01:35.626
Architecture has always been dictated
and influenced by fashion and taste.

00:01:35.626 --> 00:01:40.458
But recently, fashions and tastes
have been moving much more quickly.

00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:42.633
The fashion at the moment

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.791
is for funny-shaped buildings
made of glass.

00:01:44.997 --> 00:01:47.680
(Laughter)

00:01:47.956 --> 00:01:52.331
And they're being built in cities
all around the world

00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:56.913
with the result that a lot of cities
are now beginning to look rather the same.

00:01:56.913 --> 00:01:59.577
But things are changing a little bit.

00:01:59.603 --> 00:02:02.782
For one thing, glass buildings
are not very sustainable.

00:02:03.394 --> 00:02:07.082
They involve a lot of energy and cost

00:02:07.108 --> 00:02:10.389
in their construction
and maintenance and use,

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.201
and they don't last very long.

00:02:13.185 --> 00:02:16.839
For another thing, people are concerned
that cities are beginning to lose

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.152
their individual identities.

00:02:19.152 --> 00:02:21.247
And so for that reason, I think,

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:24.134
a lot of people are now starting to look
at local traditions

00:02:24.134 --> 00:02:28.825
and ways of building buildings
which are going to last longer.

00:02:28.825 --> 00:02:32.254
And we think that's why
classical architecture is relevant now.

00:02:32.254 --> 00:02:33.754
And as an illustration,

00:02:33.806 --> 00:02:37.164
this is a photograph of a building
which I designed

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.949
and which was built recently
in the middle of London.

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.235
It's built of natural stone,
it has sculpture on it.

00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:45.004
It uses the classical language.

00:02:45.004 --> 00:02:49.997
But it's for a modern art gallery,
and a very modern purpose.

00:02:51.135 --> 00:02:52.489
So, the last question is:

00:02:52.515 --> 00:02:54.761
would you ever design a classical airport?

00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:57.477
(Laughter)

00:02:57.477 --> 00:03:00.606
Actually a while ago, a magazine asked me

00:03:00.606 --> 00:03:05.913
to redesign Heathrow Terminal 5
as if it was a classical building.

00:03:05.913 --> 00:03:09.670
And I think that they were asking it
as a slightly tongue-in-cheek question.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.849
But actually, when you think about it,
it's maybe not that ridiculous after all.

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.102
If you think of a building like
Grand Central Station, in New York,

00:03:19.142 --> 00:03:23.990
it's a wonderful building designed
as a grand classical space,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.278
and when you arrive there,

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:29.200
you have a tremendous sense
of the place that you're arriving in.

00:03:29.252 --> 00:03:32.853
And, arguably,
modern airports don't do that.

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.827
And, I think that it's the power
to be uplifting

00:03:37.854 --> 00:03:41.241
which is one of the most exciting things
about classical architecture.

00:03:43.994 --> 00:03:48.822
Hi, I'm Francis. My three questions.

00:03:48.822 --> 00:03:52.217
Is classical architecture appropriate
for a modern city?

00:03:52.217 --> 00:03:53.955
Well, I believe it is.

00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:56.092
I mean, particular cities, like London,

00:03:56.092 --> 00:03:58.989
have these beautiful
historic buildings in them

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.083
and a lot of architects
are just putting up, as George suggested,

00:04:03.083 --> 00:04:04.967
these rather hideous glass buildings

00:04:04.993 --> 00:04:07.501
which could be anywhere,
Taipei, Kuala Lumpur.

00:04:07.501 --> 00:04:12.090
And I get very sad to see
these sort of fragmented streets.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.245
We were called in recently
to stitch together

00:04:16.382 --> 00:04:21.329
this small bit of classical architecture
in Tottemham Court Road,

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.751
and our building in the middle

00:04:22.777 --> 00:04:25.819
takes the same language,
follows the same materials

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:27.447
and stitches together.

00:04:27.447 --> 00:04:30.863
Obviously, there are other times
when a modern building is appropriate.

00:04:32.662 --> 00:04:35.710
Some people criticize
classical architecture

00:04:35.736 --> 00:04:38.388
because it looks too easy,
you're just copying.

00:04:38.388 --> 00:04:46.050
And I don't really see a problem
with things being good if they're easy.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.989
That's great.

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:54.267
But I think that one of the problems
with architecture

00:04:54.267 --> 00:04:57.899
is it's very closely aligned
to painting and sculpture,

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:03.118
where being cutting-edge and new
is how you make your name.

00:05:03.118 --> 00:05:04.552
But I think that architecture

00:05:04.578 --> 00:05:07.427
should more correctly
be associated with cooking,

00:05:07.427 --> 00:05:09.211
which is a domestic art.

00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:12.814
And when you cook, you follow a recipe,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.933
and a recipe is just a form of copying

00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:20.345
and no one would deny the amount
of creativity you need when you cook,

00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:28.200
because you have to interpret recipes,
particularly Nigella Lawson's ones.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.998
(Laughter)

00:05:32.376 --> 00:05:34.030
That's the example of a house.

00:05:34.056 --> 00:05:36.417
If I see a nice window, I copy it,

00:05:36.417 --> 00:05:38.450
and I just try and get it
as close as I can.

00:05:38.476 --> 00:05:41.600
It's actually very difficult
to copy things well.

00:05:42.557 --> 00:05:46.028
And the last question is:
what's the purpose of drawing?

00:05:46.028 --> 00:05:48.745
One of the rather frustrating things

00:05:48.771 --> 00:05:53.762
about the visual creative industry,
or world,

00:05:53.762 --> 00:05:59.005
is that people don't take
these traditional skills seriously.

00:05:59.005 --> 00:06:02.417
If you were to study music,
and you went to a music school,

00:06:02.417 --> 00:06:05.055
you would learn to play
the piano beautifully,

00:06:05.055 --> 00:06:10.549
irrespective of whether you went on
to play Schopenhauer or AC/DC

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:12.001
or whatever you taste is.

00:06:12.001 --> 00:06:17.853
But with architecture and arts,

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:20.119
you're not taught to draw well
at architecture.

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:22.244
At school, they don't value it.

00:06:22.244 --> 00:06:29.386
And I think our drawing is an attempt
to breathe new life into drawing,

00:06:29.386 --> 00:06:32.747
which both me and George
think is an incredibly important skill,

00:06:32.747 --> 00:06:37.880
and I hope that we can transfer
some of that passion to you.
