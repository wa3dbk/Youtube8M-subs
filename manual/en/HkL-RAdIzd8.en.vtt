00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.900
[Guard] Intruder, get em!

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.080
[Insurrectionist Leader] Stand down.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.660
[CT] You didn't wait for me to start?

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.800
I'm hurt.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.720
[IL] I was worried about you, didn't think you would be able to get away.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.780
[CT] You don't know the half of it, they stepped up production.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.880
Here.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.220
This ship was captured by the enemy, I'm surprised there's anything left in the data banks.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.580
[IL] Heh, not everyone follows protocol. You should know that better than anyone.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.420
[CT] You really think they discovered another artifact? How could nobody have discovered that when they were processing the wreckage?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.660
[IL] They didn't know where to look and they didn't have what you have.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.220
[Guard] Sir! We are in position. Awaiting your signal.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.280
[Carolina] Wash, take that right side!

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.220
[Wash] Where's everyone else?

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.280
[Carolina] Working on an extraction plan. They should be here right about...

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.520
[Grif] Woo hoo!

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.220
[Carolina] Now.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.360
[Grif] Sup?

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.900
[Sarge] Damn you Private Grif,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.300
you took out those two soldiers before I could administer my lethal brand of red justice!

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.520
Now where is Simmons?

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.240
[Grif] I don't know. We found another Warthog and he was right behind me.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.840
[Simmons] Present.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.680
[Grif] Wow... Nice entrance dude. Very thrilling.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.940
[Simmons] Hey, I don't need all that flash. Some of us have respect for the fundamentals

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.500
[Grif] Hey, what did I tell you before?

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.000
You know you're not allowed to use words that have the term fun in them.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.780
[Tucker] I'm riding with you next time. He actually stopped at the train tracks.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.700
[Simmons] That's the law!

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.920
[Tucker] We were under fire!

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.160
[Simmons] *Grumbling* It's still the law.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.580
[Sarge] Simmons, only you could manage to make a high speed chase boring.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.580
[Simmons] Thank you, sir.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.400
[Grif] What is that song?

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.820
[Simmons] Uh, it's a Bolivian orchestral mash up.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.780
Obviously you haven't heard of them yet.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.800
[Grif] Thank god for that.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.320
[Epsilon] I still don't understand, why did you guys rescue me?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.520
[Sarge] Don't blame us. Blame Mrs. Fussy Britches.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.020
[Caboose] Yeah um. Actually it's Miss Fussy Britches.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.260
She gets really mad when you say it wrong.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.340
[Sarge] She wanted to get you out of that memory whatsit.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.800
Something about you being the genetic-ified mental imprint-acallit of that professor what's-his-puss.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.060
[Epsilon] Can somebody translate that? I don't speak Huckleberry.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.680
[Caboose] Yeah the mean lady wants to find the director and since you have all his memories, you might know he went.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.360
[Epsilon] Wow.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.480
That actually seemed too correct for you Caboose.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.200
There must be some part of that you didn't understa—

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.600
[Caboose] ...And, when she finds him we're going to throw him a very big surprise party.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.400
[Epsilon] Ah, there we go.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.100
[Sarge] Sure, as long as surprise party means shooting him in the face and walking away in slow motion.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.740
[Chuckles]

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.620
[Caboose] Surprise!

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.340
[Epsilon] Well I hate to break it to you, but I don't know how much help I'm gonna be.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.760
I mean, I may have the directors memories, but that doesn't mean I remember... them.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.660
[Caboose] Yeah I have the same problem. I barely remember any of my own memories.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.960
And none of anyone else's.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.280
[Sarge] Well you better start remembering blue. I had to watch Grif nearly die three times today.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.580
It's like fate was laughing at me.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.780
Why don't you just take him already!

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.440
[Epsilon] I gotta say, I'm pretty surprised to see you taking orders from a Blue...

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.580
Sarge.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.360
[Sarge] Under duress.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.340
[Epsilon] What, you didn't want to come?

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.400
[Sarge] Lets just say you seem to know a lot of women with quick tempers.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.000
You got a fetish or somethin'?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.200
[Epsilon] I guess you could say.. yeah apparently.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.860
[Sarge] Wanna talk about it?

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.380
[Epsilon] No.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.980
[Caboose] Wanna talk about it wi—

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.480
[Epsilon] NO.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.580
[Carolina] Okay, everyone load up.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.500
NAV points are in your HUDs. Alternative NAVs uploaded to your secondary objectives.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.560
Sync?

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.600
Sync?!

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.540
[Wash] Oh uh, right. Everyone just say "sync" whenever she says that.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.120
[Tucker] Oh... Sync?

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.980
[Caboose] Refrigerator.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.720
[Carolina] You guys not used to getting orders?

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.220
[Grif] Oh, we're used to getting 'em alright.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.000
We just aren't used to doing much with 'em.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.340
[Carolina] We're retreating.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.400
[Simmons] Oh, okay yeah.That's usually step one in most of our plans.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.100
Sync.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.080
[Caboose] Easy-Bake oven.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.120
[Carolina] Let's just go...

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.420
[Carolina] What do you mean the leaders not here?

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.620
[South Dakota] Exactly what I said.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.900
His last check in is upstairs on the main deck, but his call sign just appeared in their internal frequencies.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.900
He's broadcasting from out in Bone Valley.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.200
[Carolina] Meaning he's not here.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.880
[South] Gee, you're starting to sound like a broken record.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.880
[Carolina] Fine, change of plans everyone.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.520
We're heading into the junkyard.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.920
[Carolina] This is beginning to feel more and more like a setup.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.260
[York] Ah... woah.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.800
You would not believe the time I had getting back.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.220
It's nuts out there.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.400
[Carolina] Let's go people.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.440
[York] What? No welcome back?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.280
[North Dakota] Alright, welcome back.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.940
[York] Where are they off to in such a hurry?

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.980
[Wash] Found the leader. He's hiding out in Bone Valley.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.760
[York] We're going all the way over there?

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.980
After what happened to Georgia?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.560
[Wash] Would someone please tell me what happened to Georgia?

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.440
[York] Dude, you do not wanna know.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.620
[Wash] I really do, though!

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.100
[Insurrectionist Leader] Time to get outta here.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.140
You too.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.420
[CT] I can't. Not yet.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.460
[IL] If they weren't onto you before. They definitely will be now.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.500
Come with us, Connie. I'm not gonna lose you over this.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.340
[Over radio] All forces we are go. I repeat we are go.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.020
[Caboose] Where am I?

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.000
Oh, that looks nice.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.200
Oh my god! A giant person!
