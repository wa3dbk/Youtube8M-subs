Now-- Now switch it back to the video.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:41.000
This Nidalee is a very poor quality player and unable to kill me, very bad player

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.860
If we could just turn the music down a notch it's overwhelming my voice, if you could just turn it down

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.360
 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.640
Aha look everybody, Malphite didn't bring a trinket, you fucking amateur, you goddamn doofus!

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.880
Look everybody, look how stupid this Zac is, look at it, idiot!

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.340
With my stealth activated, I'll be able to slip past them undetected, hehehe

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.180

Hey everybody look at Nasus! He didn't bring a trinket either

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.760

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.560
Bah! Boom!

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.560

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.220

To our right you can see our Lee Sin exhibit

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.400
For a quarter you can feed and pet him

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.360
Uhh, he'll have to ult me better than that, though.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.100
If he wants to defeat the master

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.000

For advanced twitch players, a nice place to back is behind the dragon

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.800
Unless some rat bastard shoots the goddamn dragon and fucks everything up

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.620
Oh he got away. Ehhh he's back. Okay.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.900
Hoeoaoew, he doesn't know. He doesn't know. *tisk* He doesn't know.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.860
He doesn't know. I'm convinced that he doesn't know.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.860
He doesn't know.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.080
Look at Kingpin Twitch, all they did... *hehe*

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.040
