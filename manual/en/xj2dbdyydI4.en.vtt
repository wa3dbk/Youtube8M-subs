00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:04.894
- Now we're going to look
at what epithelial tissues do.

00:00:04.918 --> 00:00:05.975
What are their functions?

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:09.727
Why do we have
these things lining a space?

00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:12.518
And, in typical Wendy style,

00:00:12.542 --> 00:00:18.101
we must begin with a picture.
Ready?

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:21.810
First, I'm going to draw you
a picture of a human.

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:24.810
I'm not even going
to make you guess

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:27.351
because we're
in an anatomy class.

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:44.975
We're in an an-na-na-na-atomy
class.

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:47.518
We'll add some eyeballs on there
just for your perspective.

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:50.059
Might as well add
some limbs on as well.

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:54.975
There you are.
That's you.

00:00:54.999 --> 00:01:00.226
Does that look like you?

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.810
Perhaps we need
some explanation here.

00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:07.810
So, this is a human body.
This is, like--

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:09.975
okay.
Highly simplified.

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:12.143
Perhaps it looks a little
more like a crab.

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:14.975
If we were playing Pictionary,
I might lose,

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:19.975
but let me tell you why I am
justifying this as a human body.

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:24.975
First of all, what is this tube
down the middle of you?

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:27.059
What?
That's your digestive tube.

00:01:27.083 --> 00:01:31.018
This is your mouth. I could
throw a couple of lips on here.

00:01:31.042 --> 00:01:33.351
Right?
Oh, look at that,

00:01:33.375 --> 00:01:36.975
and a smile just
for the heck of it. So nice.

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:41.560
And, if you open your mouth
like that, then there's a hole,

00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:44.310
and there's a hole
for food to go down and,

00:01:44.334 --> 00:01:48.560
check it out, it's
all in this tube.

00:01:48.584 --> 00:01:54.185
This is the lumen of my tube,
right,

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.975
and stuff can travel right
on out to the opening

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:01.477
on the other end
between your legs.

00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:03.435
That's your anus,
dog pound.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:10.518
I drew your mouth and your anus
on my human and there it is.

00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:16.975
Really, anything that is in
that tube never is inside you.

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:21.768
It's inside you
but it isn't inside you.

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:24.975
Like, if you had a donut--
oh, the donut analogy.

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.975
If you had a donut
and I stuck my finger

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:32.975
in the hole of the donut,
am I really inside the donut?

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:33.976
Not so much.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.518
I'm actually-- whatever.

00:02:35.542 --> 00:02:37.602
However you want
to think about that,

00:02:37.626 --> 00:02:42.310
this lumen is actually
outside of the body.

00:02:42.334 --> 00:02:47.643
Where are you going to expect
to see epithelial tissue?

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.975
Dude, lining the lumen.

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:53.268
Look at my lining.

00:02:53.292 --> 00:02:56.852
This is epithelial tissue.

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.226
That makes perfect sense,
doesn't it?

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.975
Where else are you going
to see epithelial tissue

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:07.477
in my little fantastic drawing?

00:03:07.501 --> 00:03:12.685
Yes, and that's the worst color
I've ever picked, ever.

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.810
This is also lining a space.

00:03:14.834 --> 00:03:18.975
What is that?
It's not that bad.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.810
Just wasn't quite as
bright as I expected.

00:03:22.834 --> 00:03:24.685
That's your skin,

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.894
and then all your guts,
all your heart,

00:03:27.918 --> 00:03:29.852
your lungs, your muscles,

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:33.894
everything is all
in here in between--

00:03:33.918 --> 00:03:38.185
basically it's
like you're a tube within a tube

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.351
and all of your stuff

00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:46.143
is in between the tube part
of your tube.

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:51.435
We can get crazy but that's
like your basic body form.

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.768
And we can look at the functions
of epithelial tissue--

00:03:55.792 --> 00:03:57.143
I feel like I'm
running out of color.

00:03:57.167 --> 00:04:03.518
How is that possible?--
by using this little buddy,

00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:06.185
crab man here.
We can see--

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.685
okay, what are the functions
of epithelium?

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.975
Well, first of all,

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:15.894
what's the function
of this epithelium out here?

00:04:15.918 --> 00:04:17.727
Protection.

00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:21.685
And lots of epithelia function
in protection.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.435
We're actually going to,
in the next section,

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:27.226
talk about different
types of epithelium

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.975
and in that one we'll
see the specific type

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:33.351
of epithelium that is really
good at protection,

00:04:33.375 --> 00:04:35.602
and we'll see why the structure

00:04:35.626 --> 00:04:38.393
enables the function
of protection.

00:04:38.417 --> 00:04:42.477
All right, we also have a couple
of things that happen--

00:04:42.501 --> 00:04:46.518
a couple of functions
that happen here.

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:49.768
So, first of all,
lubrication.

00:04:49.792 --> 00:04:51.727
Really?
Yeah.

00:04:51.751 --> 00:04:56.975
Basically we can secrete stuff.

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:02.975
Epithelial cells make stuff
so they can secrete mucus,

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:04.560
they can secrete hormones,

00:05:04.584 --> 00:05:07.059
they can secrete
digestive enzymes.

00:05:07.083 --> 00:05:10.975
They are going to make
things-- sweat.

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:16.059
They can secrete sweat,
and they just squirt it out.

00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:17.727
So, secretion is the act

00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:22.852
of producing substances and,
excuse me,

00:05:22.876 --> 00:05:25.976
barfing them into a space.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.975
That's secretion.
Makes perfect sense.

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:32.643
They also play a role

00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:41.894
in another really important
process which is absorption.

00:05:41.918 --> 00:05:42.975
Now absorption,

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:45.727
we think about it and we go,
oh,

00:05:45.751 --> 00:05:49.310
we've got to absorb
the ice cream cone

00:05:49.334 --> 00:05:52.727
that I really wish I
was eating right now.

00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:55.975
That's the cherry
on top of my ice cream cone.

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:58.975
We've got to absorb
all of those nutrients.

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:00.975
Sometimes we wish there were
parts of the nutrients

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:03.310
that we didn't absorb but,
you know, we do.

00:06:03.334 --> 00:06:04.975
Our bodies are very good at it.

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:09.602
Epithelial tissues are very
good absorbing the stuff

00:06:09.626 --> 00:06:13.852
in the lumen that we need
and bringing it into your body

00:06:13.876 --> 00:06:15.975
so that it can go to the rest
of your cells because,

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:19.351
look, here's Joe cell sitting
in there starving to death.

00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:21.894
He needs an ice cream cone,
like, right now.

00:06:21.918 --> 00:06:27.351
So epithelial cells play
a role in that absorption.

00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:28.727
That's it.

00:06:28.751 --> 00:06:30.727
That's where we're going
with our functions

00:06:30.751 --> 00:06:33.935
and now we're going to look
at the different classifications

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:35.351
of epithelial tissues

00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:37.501
and kind of what we're going
to see in lab.
