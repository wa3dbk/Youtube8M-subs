00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.440
What you’re looking at is the world’s
rarest cat. This is a leopard subspecies that

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.350
lives in Eastern Russia and a 2007 study counted
only about 30 individuals in total.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.900
This footage comes to us from a camera trap,
which is a camera that's triggered by heat and motion

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.519
and can be left in the wilderness for weeks
at a time. Using thousands of photos from

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.329
cameras like these, scientists recently found
that the Amur leopards have actually doubled in number

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.579
in less than a decade.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.879
Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring
rare and elusive animals whose habitat is

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.870
difficult to survey, such as the Snow Leopard,
which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.370
in the mountains of central Asia. Or the rare
Andean Mountain Cat, which lives even higher

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.780
in the Andes in South America.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.780
The endangered Bay Cat had never been filmed
before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.500
short clip. Scientists know next to nothing
about the biology of this animal, which lives

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.190
only on the island of Borneo in Southeast
Asia.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.990
And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first
known video footage of the African Golden

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.200
Cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever
seen in person. And then earlier this year, a

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.060
camera trap caught this incredible clip of
a   Golden Cat in action.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:31.120
The idea of photographing animals remotely
has been around for a while. The first camera

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.260
traps used trip wire and loud powder flash
guns, which must have terrified the animals,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.860
but the images were captivating. When National
Geographic published these images in 1906,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.360
they were the first wildlife photos to ever
appear in the magazine.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.509
But it just wasn’t practical for widespread
use until the technology caught up. It was

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.680
actually demand from hunters that really spurred
the commercial market and with the switch

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.540
from film to digital, the number of scientific
studies using camera traps has increased year after year.

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.159
Most camera traps today have what’s called
a passive infrared sensor, which detects the

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.530
sudden changes in temperature when an animal
walks into frame. For nighttime, they’re

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.170
equipped with either a regular flash, or an
infrared flash, which provides less clarity

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.319
but won’t startle the animals.

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.670
Camera traps really showed their scientific
value starting in the 1990s when scientists

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.040
studying Bengal tigers in India began combining
camera trap images with statistical software.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.560
This let them produce measurements of things
like tiger abundance and density, which are

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.840
necessary for any conservation plan.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.540
Tigers and many other cat species essentially
wear their fingerprints on the sides of their

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.580
bodies with these unique markings. So if you
want to estimate the total population in an

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.769
area, you set cameras out and get a sample
of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again. The number of cats

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.730
photographed twice gives you enough information
to approximate what the total population is.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.849
It’s an adaptation of an older method that
involved actually capturing and tagging animals,

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.739
but instead of tagging them, you just photograph
them.

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.190
This was the method used in a recent study
of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria which found

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.400
that this critically endangered subspecies
is living at extremely low densities.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.400
Camera traps also have some law enforcement
applications. Conservation groups are starting

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.360
to use cameras to catch poachers and they
can send the images in instantly over cell

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.670
phone networks. Right now about 80% of wild cat
species are believed to be declining, and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.510
several are critically endangered, like the
tiger. Just a century ago there were 100,000

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.610
tigers in the world, and now there are around 3200.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.409
The population of Sumatran Tigers in Indonesia
is down to 450. And this video from a camera

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:44.409
trap in what was supposed to be a protected
area, shows part of the reason why.
