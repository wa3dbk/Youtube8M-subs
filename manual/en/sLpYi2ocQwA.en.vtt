00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.549
Hello. My name is Jeff Fiffie. Today I'll
be showing you how to remove and replace a

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:11.920
water pump on a Mazda 626. Okay now we're
going to replace our timing belt cover back

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:23.250
in its position. Same way it came out we want
to slip it back up in there. Affix it firmly

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:42.690
against the engine block. Okay now we want
to replace our bolts back in the timing chain

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:54.330
cover.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:08.710
And tighten them at first. That size there's
going to be a 10 millimeter wrench. Tighten

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:19.710
it up nice and tight.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.030
Take our harmonic bouncer. We have a keyway
here. LIke a little square indenture in the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.062
pulley itself. And then on the crank shaft
we have the same there. It's called a keyway.

00:01:33.062 --> 00:01:53.070
We want to line up those two there. Let's
put it nice and snug. Okay now it should go

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:00.939
on there nice and smooth. And now that we've
got it started and looking at it our keyway

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:11.870
and our indenture are aligned up. Now we want
to get our bolt. Put our bolt back in there

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:20.110
making sure that it's going in there nice
and straight. And we'll tighten it up. Of

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:42.390
course you want to go clockwise to tighten
this up.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.569
Okay now we want to take our center bolt,
put it nice and firmly in there. Make sure

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:56.560
it's seated in there well. We want to turn
it clockwise. We've got a good start. It's

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.270
going in there nice and easy. And that's a
good sign. Always a good sign. Hand tighten

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:17.020
it. Okay. Check our pulley. Alright. Okay
you're not going to be able to hand tighten

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.120
this but that's when we're going to need our
impact wrench that we had earlier. And we're

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.450
going to put it on reverse to tighten it up
nice and tight.
