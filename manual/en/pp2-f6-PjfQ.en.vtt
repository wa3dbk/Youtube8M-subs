00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.009
Hi, my name is Lauren and in behalf of Expert
Village I'm here to show you how to achieve

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.630
various styles through using regular braids.
As you continue to learn more about the French

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.953
braid you will find that you can use it for
a lot of different things. What I'm going

00:00:11.953 --> 00:00:16.870
to show you now is actually the French braid
headband, which is a good way to keep your

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.720
hair off of your face. It's a little bit more
challenging because your positioning of your

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.100
arms is going to be a little bit more awkward
while you are doing it. I definitely recommend

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.770
that you practice doing your French braid
just on its own going straight back before

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.420
you move up to the headband. In order to start
the headband what you are going to do is you're

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.210
actually going to section your hair out. You
are going to use your tail comb. You are going

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.989
to go straight down but this time you're going
to swerve a little bit behind the ear. You

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:54.820
want your parting to almost around the scalp.
So you are going to bring it slightly behind

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:02.350
the ear and as you can see, it kind of slightly
U's following the shape of the head. You can

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.720
then move this section out of the way, push
that forward. You are going to do the same

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:15.400
exact thing with that other side, with that
U. What I suggest then is the hair that is

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.060
not going to be used within the braid, just
get rid of it. Put it in a jaw clip, use a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.070
ponytail holder, use something in order to
get that hair out of your way so you are not

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:31.890
grabbing that hair and that way your part
stays. Now, in order to start this, you are

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:44.950
going to bring your hair all the way over
to the side in order to get that smoothness.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.020
Smooth it down. You may want to put a little
bit of product in it, so that way it's easier.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.800
It's a little bit more awkward because your
hair isn't used to going from one side to

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:01.480
the other. Put your little product in. When
you're doing this yourself you're going to

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.070
kind of want to tilt your head and even when
someone else does it. You are going to tilt

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:14.849
your head over. You are going to grab the
beginning section, separate that out. Use

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:23.999
your P sign, go in and start your braiding.
You see that you get that triangular sensation

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:29.129
on this side which is good, because as you
work your way around, what's its going to

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:34.849
enable you to do is to hide the rest of that
braid and let it rest underneath your hair.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.590
Again, you are going to grab your sections.
The one good thing about this is that your

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.040
sections are going to be smaller so it?s going
to be a little bit easier to use. You're not

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.280
going to have to pull as long; the smoothness
is going to be there a little bit easier.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:03:02.389
Grab your other
section. Now also, since this is a bit of

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:07.629
a smaller braid, you're going to want to grab
smaller sections in diameter. Otherwise you

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:21.040
are going to run out of hair to pick up by
the time you make it to the other side. Just

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.330
section that out. This is where your complications
come, because your hair is not going to want

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:45.599
to lay on that side. Combine them, bring that
over, take your small section, and combine

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.670
it. Continue to do this from one side of your
scalp all the way to the other. What it's

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.452
going to do is just create that headband look,
and keep your hair away from your face, buts?

00:03:55.452 --> 00:04:04.269
it's going to be something a little bit more
stylish and little bit trendier. As you can

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.249
see yourself the actual braid itself is a
lot smaller. The sections aren't going to

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:14.159
be as big. This is one of those scenarios
that it will pay off to use one of those smaller

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:19.340
rubber bands that we discussed earlier, so
that it holds the braid nicely and it doesn't

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:33.800
fall out. Connect the pieces. You can also
use the upside down French braid, which we

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.090
just learned. Once you kind of master that
which will give it a little bit more flair

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:48.590
if you want for that front section. Now if
you do find that some of your hairs over here

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.250
are being a little unruly, what you can do
is take little bobby pins and kind of actually

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.800
push them in. Spray will also work. Because
you do have your hairline hair here which

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.520
is also smaller, you may want to just as you
go, spray that hairline really kind of mat

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.890
it down a little bit. It will give you that
softer and sleeker look in the front. And

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.119
that is how you do the French braid headband.
