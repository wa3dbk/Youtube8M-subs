00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:03.302
Hi. In this video, I'll show
you how to work up the size

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:05.781
for a tenon template
on the Pantorouter.

00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:08.174
And this time around, I'll
try to do it without using

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:09.858
a whole lot
of equations.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.574
The Pantorouter cuts rounded
tenons by guiding the router bit

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.483
around the piece of
stock to be cut.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:21.254
And it needs to guide that
router bit in a circular motion

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:24.890
around the edges, in an
arc shown roughly here.

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:28.895
So, I want to cut a tenon
for this particular shelf

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:30.463
that's half an
inch thick.

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:34.467
And I'm using a 5/8th
inch diameter router bit

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:37.470
to guide this around here and
leave half an inch, I need

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.773
to add half of 5/8th
inch on each side.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:44.510
Or 5/8th inch total. So that,
coming from a half inch tenon

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:48.481
I get to 1 and 1/8th
inch of an arc size

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:50.550
that I need to cut.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:53.352
Now the Pantograph, on the
Pantorouter, will double the

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:57.223
size for the template. So the
template needs to guide that

00:00:57.224 --> 00:01:00.826
guide bearing around a
path that is now twice

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:04.163
the 1 and 1/8th or or 2
and a quarter inches.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:07.333
So I need to guide
it around like this.

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:10.736
The bearing here
is 1 inch in size.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.372
So, the template needs
to be that much smaller

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:17.243
on each side, so a
total of 1 inch less.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:20.613
So, the template essentially
needs to be1 and a quarter

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:24.150
inches thick. And that's
all there is to the math.

00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:25.895
So, you take the
tenon thickness,

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:27.621
add the router
bit size,

00:01:28.222 --> 00:01:30.790
double that, and then
subtract the bearing size

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:33.025
and that tells you how
thick that needs to be.

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:36.229
And for the width here, you do
exactly the same operation.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.966
This width plus the router
bit size, double it,

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:41.559
subtract the bearing
size and that

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.969
gives you this
dimension here.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.971
So it's that simple to
work out the dimensions

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:46.964
for a Pantorouter
template.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.345
To mount the half-round on
the end, I set my compass to

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:55.348
half the width of the
wood and now I'm just

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:58.784
using that to figure out where
I need to put the center.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:02.154
I'm gonna go a little
bit in from the end.

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:07.012
And in the middle here and
just draw a semi-circle.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:12.297
And now the width
that I need for

00:02:12.318 --> 00:02:14.411
the template is
in the caliper.

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:20.193
So I need to go to here, come
in by one radius from here.

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:24.510
And find the center of that
again with the compass.

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:28.315
And now going to center here
and marking the second arc.

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:46.465
I'm pretty happy with the
shape I got out of this thing

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:49.468
straight off the bandsaw.
And I'm gonna mount it on

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.338
another template. And I'm
just gonna put this one

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.277
on with screws,
instead of gluing it,

00:02:54.298 --> 00:02:55.975
just in case I
need to make

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.864
a minor adjustment
to the fit.

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:08.287
Now to align this template
so that it produces a

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:11.991
tenon thatâ€™s vertically
here centered in the stock.

00:03:11.992 --> 00:03:15.494
I'm just gonna check this
by moving the bit so

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:19.732
that it's centered right
about where my stock is.

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:23.636
And my guide bearing should
be centered on the template.

00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:26.090
Looks like I need to
lower it just a bit.

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:32.578
For the horizontal alignment I
actually don't want it centered.

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.015
I want the tenon to extend
just to the edge of the

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:39.185
piece of wood, so I put
the guide bearing here.

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:40.987
And make sure that I'm
on the edge of the

00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:42.955
piece of
wood, here.

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:46.709
So that tells me, I can
put my fence here.

00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:05.344
Well, that tenon came out
a lot smaller than it was

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.980
supposed to. And I was
puzzling over my math,

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:10.149
where I could have gone
wrong, maybe the templates

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.818
the wrong size. And then
I realized I still had a

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.321
3/4 inch guide
bearing on there.

00:04:15.322 --> 00:04:17.823
Whereas I made this template to
work with this guide bearing.

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:20.239
So, I'll just have to
put this one on now.

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:44.884
I could cut the corresponding
mortise on the Pantorouter

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:48.072
as well, but my slot mortiser
is much more convenient.

00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:57.902
So, let's see how
those fit together.

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:02.602
Close enough.

00:05:02.603 --> 00:05:05.238
I labeled my template so
next time I need a tenon in

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:08.383
that size, I'll know exactly
which template to use.
