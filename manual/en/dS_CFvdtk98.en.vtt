00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.430
Okay, you remember from before we did the
turnaround progression of one, minor six,

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:13.860
minor two, five, and then back to one. Well,
we can apply the seventh chords to that same

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.490
theory, and we can outline the chords even
further. Hear the difference, also, listen

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.590
for the difference in the chords, play it
on a guitar in this example, or play it on

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.550
a piano, where the seventh scale degrees added.
Gives it more of a jazzy, sometimes more filled

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.879
out feeling to the chords. So let's try in
the key of C major, where C is our one. Going

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:57.389
to start with C. One, two, three, four, one,
two, three, four, A minor seven, D, now G

00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:23.240
dominant, F, try it again. D...you might want
to try working on the triads first if that

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:47.290
proves difficult.
Then moving your way up. Try applying that

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.681
same principle, maybe with chords or without,
in the key of F major. For example, F major,

00:01:53.681 --> 00:02:10.539
the six chord is D minor, the two chord minor
is G, then the dominant is C. Try to remember

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.599
to keep alternating these fingers over here.
Now you've been introduced to outlining chords

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.459
in major keys.
