Act of Abandonment to Divine Providence 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.271
Princess Elizabeth of France, sister of King Louis XVI 

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:18.306
Brothers / Sisters: It's amazing this little act of abandonment 

00:00:18.574 --> 00:00:29.161
this Princess, dipped in the folklore of so many distractions and a royal court. Let us imitate her! 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:38.335
"My God, I do not know fully what will happen to me this day! 

00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:49.102
All I know is that nothing will happen to me that there has been provided by You for all eternity. 

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:56.510
This is enough for me, O my God, for peace and quiet of my heart, 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.762
for I know that everything will be in accordance with your Omnipotence 

00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:08.545
and the infinite Love which I dedicated myself as Father, 

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:17.636
My lovely as friends, the most faithful, as the Husband of the soul, the richest. 

00:01:19.258 --> 00:01:25.372
I am a helpless child that nothing can, nor the order of nature, 

00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:33.293
no grace I can not even have a good thought without You. 

00:01:33.918 --> 00:01:37.958
I abandon myself entirely to Thy fatherly love, 

00:01:38.462 --> 00:01:46.341
knowing that as the mother leads only to the good son who takes in his arms 

00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:57.894
You well and better than her, only I will be able to give what is best for my salvation and sanctification. 

00:01:58.269 --> 00:02:06.615
I love your designs eternal and impenetrable and I obey them with all my soul; 

00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:13.736
I want everything, accept everything, all I Vos sacrifice; 

00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:20.141
this sacrifice to one of Thy dear Son, my Savior, 

00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:30.040
asking you, by Your Sacred Heart, for His infinite merits, patience in suffering 

00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:41.762
and perfect submission to Thee is due for all that you want and lets. - Amen. " 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.739
Brother, what peace and strength we have in our soul, 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.855
when we practice this "act of abandonment to Providence!"
