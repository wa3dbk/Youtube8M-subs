00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.870
Hi, I'm Tim Coombs, co-pastor of Trinity Presbyterian
Church in Scotia, NY and a member of the network

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.900
of biblical storytellers.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:19.090
To learn more about its mission, go to nbsint.org.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.449
The question is: ""Who wrote the Bible?""

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.470
Well, that question is kind of a misnomer.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.740
Even though the word ""bible"" means book
and Scriptures means writings, no one actually

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.949
sat down and wrote it out from the very beginning.

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:45.500
Almost everything that we read in the Bible
occurred first as an oral story and was experienced

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.059
as an oral performance by listeners.

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.000
Only later on did someone eventually write
it down.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.460
In the Hebrew Scriptures, they were scribes,
who took those oral stories and wrote them

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.370
down for various reasons.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.500
The other thing about particularly the Hebrew
Scriptures, it's a very layered document even

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.380
within certain books.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.220
You have different traditions of writers adding
on top of each other.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.540
For its credit and its reliability, sometimes
these stories are laid side-by-side so you

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.060
can read the different traditions at the time.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.540
Now, in the New Testament, we have the gospels
that were written by different evangelists:

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.210
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.610
But these stories existed orally for upwards
of 40 years before they got put down on paper.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.750
Mark is the earliest who wrote somewhere around
70 AD.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.030
Well that's about 40 years after Jesus was
crucified, so these stories existed orally

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.390
in different communities for a long time before
they got put down on paper.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.690
Even the letters of Paul were often delivered
orally rather than just read.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.970
Very few people could read.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.890
Maybe 5 percent of people could actually read.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.500
And when they did read, they did it out loud
for people to hear.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.239
So, who wrote the Bible?

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.290
Hard to say.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.700
Many people.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:26.040
But before they put it on paper, many people
told these stories orally as inspired by God.
