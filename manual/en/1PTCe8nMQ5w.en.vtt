00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.250
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.680
Oh, hello there.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.941
This is THE Tough Mudder Obstacle
Training Program powered by Cellucor.

00:00:16.941 --> 00:00:18.732
I'm going to bring you
three exercises that

00:00:18.732 --> 00:00:28.360
are going to help you conquer the Funky
Monkey 2.0: bar hangs, bicycle abs,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.940
and side to side pull ups.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.443
Bar hang-- what we're
going to do is we're

00:00:36.443 --> 00:00:41.940
going to come over here and hang from
an object, activate those shoulders.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.330
This object can be anything.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
It can be found at your local park.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.580
It can be a door jam at home.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.090
And we just hang out--

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.060
right?

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.160
We can start playing around
with releasing our grip,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.500
because, ultimately, that's going to
have to happen in the Funky Monkey.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.560
Side to side pull ups--

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.270
for our side to side pull ups, we're
going to look down the pull up bar,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.520
and we're going to bring
our head from either side,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.791
really activating those lats,
coming down, and then bringing it up

00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:12.540
to the other side.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.720
Fantastic.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.820
Bicycle ab-- I'm going
to lay flat on my back,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.640
bringing my fingertips to my temples.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.740
And I'm going to bring
my leg up at a 90-degree,

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.930
crunching my elbow in to touch
my knee, alternating sides here.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.430
But it's also going to
help with that rhythm

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.944
as I start working my way
across the Funky Monkey.

00:01:41.944 --> 00:01:44.390
Funky Monkey 2.0.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.901
Activate those shoulders.

00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:46.863
Oh, shoot!

00:01:46.863 --> 00:01:50.211
[SCREAMS]

00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:50.711
Yeah!

00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:53.116
[CHEERING]

00:01:53.116 --> 00:01:53.617
Yes!

00:01:53.617 --> 00:01:55.407
If we didn't make it
this year, we're going

00:01:55.407 --> 00:01:58.390
to go back, keep training, and
tackle this thing again next year.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.020
Good job, team.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.895
You guys are awesome.

00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:01.560
Let's go.
