00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.080
So now we have the valve box here

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.649
pretty well buttoned up.

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:13.460
We've got the two valves installed, all the
connections are made

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.689
and the extra ID wire is looped
around here on the inside of the valve

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:18.419
box.

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.210
The decoder is mounted to a mounting stake with its base in the upright

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.759
direction

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.130
and that leaves a little bit exposed for
the handheld

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.970
programmer.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.000
The ICD-HP

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.450
allows you to connect to the decoder

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.190
and gives you a variety of functions

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.860
right in the programmer.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.930
You'll want to utilize this while
you've got the two-wire path energized.  So

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.200
right now this decoder is attached to the two-wire path and the controller is turned on

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.440
and the two-wire path is energized.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.490
The bottom of the decoder

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.840
is where the receiver is built-in through
it.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.200
So we don't have to break any splices once
again this is through something called

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.140
Induction. You simply insert the cup,
the programming cup right on top

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.040
of the decoder

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.490
and from there you can

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.480
talk to that decoder and do your
diagnostics.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.760
So here we have the ICD-HP or handheld
programmer

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.710
hooked up out in the field and the 6' ft.
lead,

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.530
the programming cup is attached to a
decoder.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.760
I've got the screen lit up and this is the main
menu.  The first

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.180
line shows Decoder Programming.  We can
also work with Decoder Firmware.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.790
There's a Diagnostics feature which
allows us to check the current

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.439
on the line and other functions

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.509
as well as i see the ICD-HP Setup.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.920
In the Setup section it allows you to
set this

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.159
in six different languages just like the
I-Core controller.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.840
But what we'll be doing first is
programming a decoder.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.000
So I have this hooked up to a brand new
decoder just installed in a valve box

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.520
out in the field.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.119
We'll select Decoder Programming

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.320
and we'll use the down arrow to select
Program A Decoder.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.759
It will show Checking For Decoder and it will
come back with that decoder's information.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.649
So it shows who we're hooked up to a 2-station decoder which is correct.

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:16.939
The Power Factor is set at 2 and the In
rush is set to 5.

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.680
Those are factory settings for that the
decoder that in the majority of cases

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.669
will never need to be changed.

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:25.250
There are instances however on

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.710
unusually heavy loads or if they are far
away from the controller that those can

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.940
be adjusted, but for the vast majority of
systems you'll never make any changes

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.249
there.

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:36.330
So what we'll do is your going to press

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.659
the Forward arrow to continue

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.909
and it shows us that Output 1
is set at 000.  So this decoder

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.909
has not been programmed yet.

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.859
I'll make that first station output be
Station 15 by typing in

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.499
15 on the keypad.

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:56.700
Then I'll use the Down Arrow to select
Output 2 and we'll make him be

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.089
Station

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:00.239
35.

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.480
So you can program these in any order,
however you wish, based on how your

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.400
valves are set up in the field.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.529
Once you have the two stations programmed,

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:12.579
use the Forward arrow to program

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.010
and then we'll come back showing Programming
Complete and give you instructions to proceed

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.189
with another Decoder if you wish.

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.949
The Back arrow brings you back through
the screens.

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:26.759
And under Get Decoder Information, if you
hit the Forward arrow, it'll check for

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:29.019
that decoders information.

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.669
And it comes back saying that that the
decoder is found on the path, it's a 2-Station

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.059
decoder

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:37.209
and it shows the first output is Station 15.

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.379
It shows the Serial number and all the
other decoder information.

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:43.450
Once completed

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.230
and you've done what you're looking for,

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.029
simply remove the programming cup

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:50.059
and you've got your

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:51.619
decoder mounted on the stake.

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:58.619
You can pull it out for easier access or you can leave it as is.

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.639
 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:01.889
