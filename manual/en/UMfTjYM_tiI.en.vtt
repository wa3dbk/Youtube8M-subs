Hi! I am Debbie with expertvillage.com. We
are talking about having hermit crabs for

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.340
pets and what we are going to talk about right
now is how to clean out your habitat. We talked

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.480
about earlier you need to change out their
food and water every other day religiously.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:32.800
While you are doing that, it is a good idea
to take all our toys out and food dish and

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.129
water dish and you are going to put your little
crabs in a container that they cannot get

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.040
out of. Now, you donâ€™t want anything that
they can climb up on and that has holes on

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.899
it because they are very climbers you need
something with a smooth side, that they cannot

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.730
get out of because believe me if you walk
away from them, they are going to escape.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:01:01.230
So, something like a bowl, a smooth sided
box with a pretty high side that is something

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.720
that would work well. Then you can buy these
along with the hermit crabs supply area in

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.780
the pet store or you could just use a little
common little kitchen sieve anything would

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.890
work. You are going to use your little sieve
to get all the debris out and any food that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:26.530
is rotten, any little crab poop that you want
to get that out, make it nice and clean. Once

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.530
a month you are going to need to clean out
the whole aquarium or the whole habitat. So,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.520
you will go, you will very carefully take
out your sand and your gravel and it might

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.750
be even a good time to buy some fresh sand,
have some fresh sand on hand to add to your

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.590
habitat. Put the container in the sink. No
soap, no cleaners, just warm water, get it

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.310
nice and clean and dry, make sure it is dried
thoroughly before you start adding every thing

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.950
back to your aquarium and before you start
adding your crabs back and they are thinking

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.799
they are going to get out of the bowl, but
they are not.
