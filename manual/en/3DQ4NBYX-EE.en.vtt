00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.140
So I'm going to go to the think chair and I want you to pay attention to what I'm doing

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.160
in the think chair to calm myself down.
So the teacher has just told me to go to the think chair.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.350
(deep breathing sounds)

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.870
What did you notice that I did when I was there?
What did I do?

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.910
Fanna?
Sit quietly.
Okay. What else?

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.700
Deborah?
You didn't talk to anybody but yourself.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.130
So what did I do?
You took a deep breath

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.260
and you felt like you were in deep comfort.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.360
Maraki?
You were inhaling and exhaling

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.430
to make you calm.
Okay. Same idea?

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.490
Angel?
You weren't running.
What did I do instead?

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.660
You walked and you . . . sat down quietly,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.710
and you stopped talking.
Okay, and one more â€” Fanna?

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.780
You didn't go, "Aww . . ."

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.970
Okay what did I do?
Stayed quiet.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.960
So I need someone who can go over there

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.000
and show us three, quiet deep breaths to calm yourself down.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.780
Three quiet deep breaths. Marcus show us that.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.280
Let's watch Marcus and see what we notice.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.510
What did you notice?

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.530
What did he do well? Kidus?

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.590
He sat down quietly

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.980
and he came back quietly.
What did he do while he was in the chair?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.230
What did you notice? Taylor?

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:15.490
He was relaxing, not looking toward anyone instead of looking towards the people who . . . you were talking to, he looked up at the sky.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.940
I need someone else to show . . .
go into the think chair and three, deep quiet breaths

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.360
Madisyn, go show us that.
Let's watch Madisyn

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.050
and see what she does while she's in the think chair.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.640
During the day today, I might come over to you and I might say, "Hey, Catherine, I want you to go to the think chair

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.750
and practce the three deep breaths."
Okay? So today if I tell you that

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.820
it's not because you were doing something that I need to send you to the think chair for,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.490
if I say, "I want you to go practice," then I want you to practice

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.830
what we just learned today.
