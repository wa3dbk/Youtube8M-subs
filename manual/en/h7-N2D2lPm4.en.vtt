00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.379
Okay, so, you have flat-ironed your hair,
you've put on a headband, you've got the simple

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.630
makeup, you've got a nice outfit on that's
tasteful, but still fun. What are the last

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.620
things that you add to it? You want to add
some accessories. The first thing I want to

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.310
talk about is shoes. Like everything else,
you don't want to be extreme with your shoes

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.009
when you're putting together a preppy look,
so I'd say keep heels under two and a half,

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.330
three inches. The shoes should be in a neutral
colors, similar to the sandals that I'm wearing

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:38.489
right now. A normal, small heel. Espadrilles
are okay, wedges are okay, but in general,

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:47.219
no towering heels, no grungy shoes either.
While flip-flops are considered to be a staple

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.949
of the preppy wardrobe, they tend to be nice
flip-flops or nice versions of flats, like

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.250
these sandals that I'm showing you right here.
These are some nice flat Grecian sandals,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.070
and they're in a neutral, there's not much
of a heel, they're a very nice leather, I

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.729
mean these are actually - these are pretty
worn in and they still look really nice. These

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.619
would go great with a summer outfit of maybe
Polo shirts and shorts. The other piece that

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.829
you want to add that's very popular are ribbon
belts, or gross grain belts, and you could

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:22.490
put these over almost anything. I could belt
the jacket if I wanted to add some color in

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.310
it. It's usually in a stripe, maybe in a polka
dot pattern or a nautical theme like we talked

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.270
about. These belts are very popular with a
general preppy look in the summer. And the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.880
last thing would be bags. Now similar to the
jewelry when I talked about sort of status

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.840
jewelry, you'd like maybe a summer bag in
a light color, this is very subtle, it has

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.630
a logo, but it's not an obvious logo, because
like everything else in dressing preppy, you

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.430
don't want to be too showy. But I would say
that most of the time a bag like this is a

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.039
lot more similar to what someone preppy might
carry. This is in a dark red, but you could

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.400
have it in a brown or in a tan, it's a nice
leather, it's a crocodile which means it's

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:19.370
a great, reliable leather for a bag. And it's
a classic cut and a classic shape, which would

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.280
really complement the clothes for a preppy
style.
