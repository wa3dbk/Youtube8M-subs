00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.100
Hey, what's up GG (guys and girls)? CouilleBleu's back today to play...

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.800
Here are the runes, masteries, skill distribution and items that you'll need to surprise everyone with your pornstar power.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.800
In the laning phase, you have to use your Suicidal Bird whenever it's available to wreck your opponent like a bitch from the stripclub.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.800
If you manage to hit him with your Tornado, that person will cry like a baby all day all night.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.950
Combine these two skills into a combo and Warwick's tiny fuckfriend will hug her tower until his night partner comes to her rescue.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.650
If you also add a Bubble Tea to your combo, you can be sure that this noob will report you for dominating the lane with an OP champion.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:54.900
That technique is also excellent to boost your attack damage, so you have no excuses to give if you do not manage to last hit a minion or if you can't destroy a turret before your enemy.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.600
Are you ready to say ''ciao ciao bye bye'' to your sworn enemy? Then use a simple Suicidal Bird-Tornado combo to reduce his health a bit, 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.000
shield yourself with a Bubble Tea and follow him until you can use a Suicidal Bird-Ignite combo for the win.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:15.550
If your victim is already low enough because you kept on pissing him off, you have to surprise him with a Flash-Tornado-Suicidal Bird-Ignite combo before he has a chance to fight back.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.800
Is someone trying to surprise this mother fucker sexy lady?

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.070
You don't have to worry about anything because your Tornado and your Suicidal Bird offer you the magic damage and CC necessary to keep that asshole at bay

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.200
and your Bubble Tea is here to keep you safe from the killing blowjob of your aggressor.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.100
Everytime you see an easy pipi kill, you should not hesitate to towerdive a bit to keep on being fed like a que...

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.300
Thanks to your Pushy Windy skill, you can tell someone to get the fuck off from your sexy body and, of course,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.000
to push back a reckless cow desperately trying to steal some pocket change from your ward.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.550
Come on bro! If you wanna swim in drug money, that's what you gotta do.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.700
Or KS your team every single time by sending your 20th bird to death.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.900
Thanks to all your AP items, you will move faster than Sonic The Hedgehog, so no one will ever be able to beat you in a race

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:07.750
and if you combine that speed advantage with all your skills, you'll become an untouchable deity that will bring down the toughest wannabe gangsters in town.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.300
Most random (GOT NOTHING TO SAY)!

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:19.600
Late game, you'll have an easy time defending your base all alone against these scary champions since you just have to spam all your skills to keep them away from your perfect body

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.030
and to proc your Lich Bane to deal tons of damage like baby Phreak.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.250
If your squad joins you later on, the enemy team will be deleted from the game because your CC kit is way too powerful for them.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.100
If you don't like being the defensive type of player, you can easily switch to an offense mode by diving right in the enemy's formation

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.850
to party with the boys until they pass out.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.000
When you're done on your end, use a little Pushy Windy to get away from these beasts in lust, no problem!

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:51.400
Even if you're on your deathbed, staying here to bait that greedy fuckabish with your Bubble Tea to make him rage harder than the angry german kid is easier than playing Barbie Online.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.350
A real AP Janna will always save his teammates just before they die.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.900
Why, you ask? The answer is simple!

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.100
You do that on purpose to give the enemy some false hope and when he sees you do that, that is rescuing your allies just when they're about to get killed like Superman,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.150
he will smash his keyboard out of frustration.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.900
Why does that work, you ask?

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.450
Pfft because your AP items will boost the power of your shield, your slow and your heal like a boss.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.900
Since it's impossible for you to die, you have to lead your team to victory like a general in the warring state period.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.200
I'll leave you with a clip where greedy boys try to taint Janna's figure and as always, thanks for watching.
