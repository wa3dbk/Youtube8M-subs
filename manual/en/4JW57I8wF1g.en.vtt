00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.670
Yet another follow-up that no one asked for,
this action comedy film from director Dean

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.219
Parisot somehow managed to gross $148 million
when it was released on July 19, 2013.

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.360
Produced on a budget of $84 million, this
PG-13 rated film reunites most of the cast

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.460
of the 2010 original in an even more swollen
and self-serving plot.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.550
We pick up the story three years later, where
retired CIA agent Bruce Willis and his weirdo

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.410
friends are called back into action to track
down a missing portable nuclear device hidden

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.410
inside Russia.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.020
The 116-minute film has no carry-over from
the first installment, without so much of

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.230
a mention about Ernest Borgnine or Morgan
Freeman.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.700
The laboriously paced experience is convoluted
and boring, often with repetitious dialogue....

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.690
in fact, the exact same line of exposition
is uttered twice in a three minute span.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.280
Besides the sloppily edited and uninspired
action sequences, the main draw here is clearly

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.440
the A-list cast, led by Willis.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.350
Once a capable and charismatic action star,
he's been reduced to a sarcastic and bullet-proof

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.920
caricature in recent years.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.310
When reminded that he hasn't killed anybody
in months, Willis quickly retorts, "That is

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.340
not a bad thing.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.340
Okay?

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.340
That's a positive thing for a lot of people."

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.060
At 50 years old, Mary-Louise Parker is absolutely
stunning, and definitely the picture's lone

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.010
highlight in terms of comedic relief, but
she's sadly given little to do, except make-out

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.430
with numerous ugly people.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.200
John Malkovich and Helen Mirren return with
similar, if even more exaggerated performances,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.140
but are also relegated to mugging for the
camera and making dumb, inappropriately timed

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.140
jokes.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.320
The forced narrative literally spends the
entire first hour introducing us to - and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.010
I'm not even joking here - eleven separate
characters in one lame scene after another.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.460
Once the aforementioned core players are established,
we also meet Neal McDonough, Catherine Zeta-Jones,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.230
David Thewlis, Titus Welliver, Brian Cox,
and Anthony Hopkins.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.030
McDonough is great as one of the picture's
three (!) bad guys, executing a Military General

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.720
with his bare hands while holding a normal
conversation - but everyone else in this bloated

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.100
cast of geriatrics is utterly wasted.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.130
By the time they're all introduced, there's
only 40 minutes left to actually do anything,

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.860
and by then, it's far too late to unravel
the messy story.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.860
The rag-tag group of heroes globetrot around
poorly-utilized European locations in the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.920
blink-of-an-eye, and with little purpose.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.551
Lee enjoys one of the more exciting action-oriented
scenes, when he takes out a store full of

00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:08.940
cops with a glass door handcuffed to his wrist...
but unbelievably, the Asian assassin is unable

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:46.879
to kill some old guy collecting social security.

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.290
The minimalist and light-hearted score from
accomplished composer Alan Silvestri sounds

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.489
like a low-rent discotheque, but thankfully,
isn't featured much.

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.249
The widescreen cinematography manages to keep
all the players in focus, but is rather inconsistent,

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:02.170
cutting away to disorienting wide-shots, and
back to stylized close-ups that feel out of

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.170
place.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.230
Between the infrequently used scene-transitions
that remind us , that yes, this was originally

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.389
an adaptation of a comic book - the visual
effects and bloodless gunplay are rarely realistic.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:15.029
Although never stylized as one, the title
is an acronym for "Retired, extremely dangerous"...

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:17.980
but this tepid experience is anything but,
and is one sequel that should never have come

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.980
out of retirement.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.069
"RED 2" has a detrimentally undernourished
cast with awful action.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:36.290
Here's what you had to say about it.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.949
Far less harsh than I was, you criticized
the unoriginal story, but still had fun, scoring

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:41.680
this a FIVE out of ten.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.139
With this group of people, a movie this unenjoyable
and disjointed is inexcusable.

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.360
I thought it was BAD.
