00:00:10.073 --> 00:00:13.225
Single ended dreads can be used on incredibly short hair.

00:00:13.225 --> 00:00:19.695
This hair is about an inch and a half long, and I'm gonna 
 show you my method for making dreads stay on super short hair.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:25.098
The first step is to make sure that your section is nice and 
 clean, and you have the other hair clipped out of the way.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.570
Next, 

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:31.504
put your latch hook tool through your dreadlock.

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:39.956
Then carve this section into two, a top and a bottom half.

00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:47.133
Holding on to the top section, 

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:51.660
take your latch hook tool, and pull it into your dreadlock.

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:59.443
Now, 

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:03.380
take the hair,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.892
position your dreadlock in an upward direction.

00:01:07.882 --> 00:01:10.838
Combine the two sections, and band it off.

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:48.300
Be careful to avoid too much tension at the root base.

00:01:48.837 --> 00:01:55.630
Take your dread, and your ponytail, combine them in 
 two and then band this entire piece together.

00:02:09.928 --> 00:02:14.690
This completes your first dreadlock. Repeat this process for your entire style.
