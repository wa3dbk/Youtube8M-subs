00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.220
Hi guys,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.710
Chewy, flaky savory green onion pancakes can
be found at many Chinese restaurants but they

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.330
are also very easy to make at home.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.560
I make mine a bit less salty and less greasy
than the ones I've had at restaurants but

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.539
they are still absolutely delicious.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.260
Start with a cup of all-purpose flour. If
you choose whole wheat flour, only use 3 quarters

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.320
of a cup.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.859
If you like, add garlic and onion powder and
salt for extra seasoning. But that's completely

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.529
optional.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.180
Stir everything together, then add a half
cup of hot, just boiled water.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.000
Use chopsticks to stir the flour together
and quickly it will clump up into dough.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.230
Go in with clean hands and gather the dough
bits so you can make a cohesive dough ball.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.650
Knead it for about a minute. It may be easier
to do this on a floured surface but you can

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.430
also just knead in the bowl. Just go ahead
and do it how you want.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.400
Kneading is a simple action; just press down
with the heel of your hand, fold the dough

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.100
over on itself, press down again and repeat.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.770
The dough may not get completely smooth after
a minute but that's ok.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.360
Put it back in the bowl and cover it with
a plate while we prepare the green onions.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.420
This large green onion stalk will be plenty
for our pancakes. Most of you will know that

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.500
green onions, scallions and spring onions
are all different names for the same thing.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.790
I usually say scallions but for some reason,
for these cakes, I always say green onion

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.720
cakes. Let me know what you call them in the
comments below. Maybe add where you're from

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.600
too so we can see if its a regional thing.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.530
Once that's done, set the onions aside for
now.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.960
This dough has rested a few minutes which
will make rolling out easier.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:42.520
Divide up the dough into 8 even pieces.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:52.190
Dust the dough and your work surface with
flour as needed and simply roll out each piece

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.960
into a circle shape.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.630
Don't worry about making them perfect.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.010
Now with a pastry brush, I'm adding just the
tiniest amount of oil on to the discs. This

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.320
part is important to make the pancakes flaky.
If you don't have a pastry brush you can dab

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.750
a little oil on to the tips of your fingers
and pat the oil onto the surface of the dough.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.370
After you've done all the discs sprinkle on
some green onion. How much is up to you.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.690
Now we roll them up. Try to roll them tightly
but again, it doesn't have to be perfect.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.970
Pinch the ends.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.599
Once those are done, we're going to coil up
these log shapes and turn them into cute little

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.130
snail shapes. Pinch the end in to keep the
shape, then flatten with your palm.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.890
Repeat with the rest.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.540
Finally, we're rolling these flat for the
last time.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.140
You want these pretty thin. Sprinkle on a
little flour if you need to.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.350
The dough is soft so this is easy and quick
to do.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.160
Finally once these are all done, get a non-stick
pan on the stove and heat it up over medium

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.459
high heat.

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.660
Brush the topside of one pancake with a teeny
bit of oil, then put it on the hot pan, oiled

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.250
side down.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.390
As it cooks, you will see it change color.
It's a bit hard to see on camera but it will

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.060
turn white. You will also see some bubbles
developing under the surface.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.290
After about a minute, flip it over.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.180
That's the golden colouring we're looking
for.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.270
If yours isn't this color when you flip it,
that's ok. Just cook this other side for a

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.290
while, then flip it back over to finish it.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.890
There's one done!

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.769
For a variation, you can add a little sea
salt to the pan before you place the oiled

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.599
pancake in. Just a little salt will bring
out the flavour of the scallions and any other

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.870
seasonings that you've used.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.430
Keep going with the rest of the pancakes.
Each pancake will take between a minute and

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.800
a half to two minutes to cook depending on
the heat of your stove. You may need to adjust

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.010
the heat as you go a little to allow the pancakes
to cook through without burning. Just pay

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.599
attention and try to notice how the color
of the pancake changes as it cooks.

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.099
Also you don't need to use a lot of oil. In
this entire recipe, I used a total of one

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:12.920
teaspoon of oil. Using a silicone pastry brush
really helps with using just enough.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.540
Before long, you'll have a stack of beautiful,
delicious green onion pancakes.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.780
Notice there are only seven there because
I already ate one while the rest were cooking...for

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.510
quality control purposes of course.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.310
As you can see, they are nice and flaky and
just perfect. Use them to wrap up some savory

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.600
fillings or just dip them in spicy peanut
sauce.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.470
Click here for my spicy peanut sauce recipe.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.780
Or use hoisin sauce, soy sauce, or any kind
you like.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.000
