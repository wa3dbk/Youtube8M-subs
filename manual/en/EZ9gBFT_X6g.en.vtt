My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today I am going to show you how

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:14.599
to make whole wheat bread. Alright so let's
open up our oven here and let's our two different,

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:21.470
one's here let's put it on the middle rack.
In a 400 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.220
I am going to check them I know my oven is
kind of weird like this so I am going to check

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.800
on them in about 35 minutes or so just to
make sure they are not getting too brown and

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.070
we will come back and check on them then and
see how they look. Alright so my breads are

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:46.280
done. You will see the twisted loaf I did
and let me get the other one out of the oven.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:56.050
Its a split top loaf. Both of them look absolutely
fantastic. You will see that they are nice

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.620
and brown on top and do not be too concerned
about the tops being a little brown because

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.579
it is wheat bread after all. It is going to
be brown anyway. So what I am going to do

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:11.170
now I am going to brush the tops of these
with that olive oil that I had out earlier.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:19.710
Just to give them a little more sheen on the
outside. And then what we are going to do

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.200
we are going transfer these to a rack and
let them sit for a little bit and cool off

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.010
because if you were to slice these now the
insides probably would still be a little gummy.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:46.780
That would not be what you were looking for
probably. So that one is nicely done.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:55.100
And the split top loaf came out with a nice,
nice, nice like really good really crusty

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.110
outside on it. Looks fantastic. And when you
are brushing the split loaf make sure you

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:10.729
brush down inside the split part that you
did and lucky for us the split proved to not

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.129
be like an erupting point. That is why you
do it though. You do it to make sure that

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.810
you are not going to have like a big eruption
or if you do it controls it a little better

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.020
it keeps it from going all over the place
and getting this huge off to one side or whatever.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.879
It actually will expands outward and upward
like this. Ours kept it nice and controlled

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.260
and tight so now what we are going to do is
we are going to transfer these to a cool rack.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.010
So let's do that.
