00:00:04.869 --> 00:00:05.915
Honey.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.552
Jesus, where were you?

00:00:09.553 --> 00:00:13.546
-I died, Mary, and resuscitated.
-What?

00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:16.110
I died on Friday,
and resuscitated today.

00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:19.829
I are telling me
you were out all weekend

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.317
-because you had died?
-Yes.

00:00:22.318 --> 00:00:23.846
And by coincidence

00:00:23.847 --> 00:00:27.425
-you resuscitated Sunday evening?
-Yes.

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.910
-Am I stupid, Jesus?
-No.

00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:32.394
-Do you think I'll buy it?
-Don't.

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:37.392
No, no. By coincidence,
you "died" on Friday,

00:00:37.393 --> 00:00:40.680
and "resuscitated"
on Sunday!

00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:41.787
Look, Jesus!

00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:44.673
It's the perfect timing.

00:00:44.674 --> 00:00:46.812
Now tell me when is
your next death.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.085
-In Carnival?
-Magdalene, I have proofs.

00:00:49.086 --> 00:00:52.232
-I have ulcers.
-Get out. Get them out of me.

00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:53.409
Disgusting.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.840
This is fight.

00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:57.190
-Are you fighting on streets?
-I'm not.

00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:59.077
I was nailed to a cross,
Mary.

00:00:59.078 --> 00:01:01.541
Oh, yeah.
Because you weren't doing good.

00:01:01.542 --> 00:01:03.465
Nobody nails someone
who is quiet.

00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.772
What did you steal now?

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:06.683
-I didn't.
-I am tired.

00:01:06.684 --> 00:01:08.022
You come smelling wine,

00:01:08.023 --> 00:01:10.486
go out with that bunch
of useless friends,

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:11.622
unemployed.

00:01:11.623 --> 00:01:13.368
You have to start moving,
Jesus.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.875
-They are apostles.
-Are they paid?

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:18.001
-No.
-So they are vagabonds.

00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:19.329
Like you.

00:01:20.757 --> 00:01:24.673
You should be happy
that I am back.

00:01:24.674 --> 00:01:26.228
Fine. Listen.

00:01:26.972 --> 00:01:28.255
Go inside.

00:01:28.256 --> 00:01:30.158
Clean your ulcers.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.497
I will cook your food.
Take a shower.

00:01:32.498 --> 00:01:34.477
Go there.
I don't want it again.

00:01:34.478 --> 00:01:35.906
-Ok?
-Honey.

00:01:35.907 --> 00:01:37.098
Just one thing.

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:40.272
I kind of came back.
I did not come back to stay.

00:01:40.273 --> 00:01:42.025
I need to go back up.

00:01:42.026 --> 00:01:44.962
So tell me who's
the bitch thatâ€™s with you.

00:01:52.787 --> 00:01:54.408
Hi, Peter.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.505
Do you know where
Jesus was on the weekend?

00:01:57.945 --> 00:01:59.395
No.

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:01.601
Are you sure
you don't know?

00:02:02.098 --> 00:02:03.132
No.

00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:05.090
Peter, you're always
with him.

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:06.168
You don't know?

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.775
No.

00:02:07.776 --> 00:02:09.047
Listen.

00:02:09.643 --> 00:02:10.791
Now that you said it.

00:02:10.792 --> 00:02:14.232
I think I saw him
getting out of the tavern

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:15.830
with Samila

00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:17.483
Saturday night.

00:02:17.484 --> 00:02:18.798
I think.

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.330
-Thank you, Judah.
-Welcome.

00:02:22.186 --> 00:02:23.885
I tell.

00:02:23.886 --> 00:02:26.067
I see it, I tell.
