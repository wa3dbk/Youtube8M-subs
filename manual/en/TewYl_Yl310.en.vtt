"Pistachio Nuts for Erectile Dysfunction"

00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:11.622
Erectile dysfunction is 
considered an important cause

00:00:11.622 --> 00:00:13.853
of decreased quality 
of life in men,

00:00:13.853 --> 00:00:16.377
in fact, so much so that 
one early theory suggested

00:00:16.377 --> 00:00:17.879
that this may 
explain the link

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:20.932
between impotence 
and heart attacks.

00:00:20.932 --> 00:00:23.736
Depression is a risk factor 
for coronary heart disease,

00:00:23.736 --> 00:00:25.530
and the thought was that 
men who couldn't get it up

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.246
become so depressed that they 
like "die" of a broken heart.

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:32.354
But now we know that erectile 
dysfunction and heart disease

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:34.044
can be two different 
manifestations

00:00:34.044 --> 00:00:36.539
of the exact same 
root problem,

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.362
DISEASED ARTERIES—

00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:41.268
inflamed, oxidized, cholesterol-clogged 
blood vessels.

00:00:41.268 --> 00:00:44.350
So, no wonder a diet chock 
full of anti-inflammatory,

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.452
antioxidant, cholesterol-
lowering plant foods

00:00:46.452 --> 00:00:48.730
would improve sexual functioning

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.754
in both men and women

00:00:50.754 --> 00:00:54.099
as well as reduce risk 
of heart disease.

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:58.062
But why go LOW risk when 
you can shoot for NO risk?

00:00:58.062 --> 00:00:59.667
A totally 
plant-based diet

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:05.045
can even stop and reverse 
our number one killer.

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:07.908
Of all the plant foods 
individually examined so far,

00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:10.635
nuts are among those 
most tied to longevity.

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:13.640
Just two handfuls a week 
may extend a woman's life

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.651
as much as jogging 
4 hours a week.

00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:20.011
So, if nuts reduce 
the risk of heart disease,

00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:22.350
might they also help 
with sexual function?

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.818
Well, men eating 3 to 4 handfuls 
of pistachios a day

00:01:26.818 --> 00:01:29.582
for just 3 weeks experienced 
a significant improvement

00:01:29.582 --> 00:01:31.199
in blood flow 
through the penis

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:34.953
accompanied by significantly 
firmer erections.

00:01:34.953 --> 00:01:36.785
This may not 
be surprising.

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:39.051
Remember how antioxidant-rich foods

00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:40.990
have a Viagra-like effect

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.280
of boosting nitric oxide production?

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.870
Well, pistachios are certainly 
rich sources of antioxidants.

00:01:46.874 --> 00:01:49.880
And remember how the 
citruline in watermelons

00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:51.220
helped with erection firmness

00:01:51.225 --> 00:01:52.810
by boosting arginine,

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:55.660
which is what our body makes 
nitric oxide out of?

00:01:55.661 --> 00:01:57.850
Well, pistachios have 
a bunch of arginine,

00:01:57.853 --> 00:02:01.200
which may help explain the 
improvement in blood flow.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
And we know that cholesterol 
is an important predictor

00:02:04.206 --> 00:02:07.400
of sexual dysfunction 
in both men and women,

00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:10.400
and after just 3 weeks 
on all those pistachios

00:02:10.406 --> 00:02:12.350
there were significant 
improvements in cholesterol.

00:02:12.356 --> 00:02:15.350
And like other studies 
that piled on

00:02:15.357 --> 00:02:18.760
hundreds of calories of nuts 
a day there was no weight gain.

00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:21.360
Conclusion: just 3 weeks 
of pistachios

00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:24.210
resulted in a significant 
improvement in erectile function

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.010
with additional improvement 
in cholesterol

00:02:26.017 --> 00:02:28.420
without any side effects.

00:02:28.424 --> 00:02:30.450
Note the 2 important differences

00:02:30.456 --> 00:02:31.810
between diet and drugs.

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:35.410
Just taking drugs like Viagra 
to poison this enzyme

00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:38.040
and artificially boost 
nitric oxide signaling

00:02:38.043 --> 00:02:40.210
is just covering 
up the symptoms

00:02:40.214 --> 00:02:42.970
of the underlying problem: 
UNHEALTHY ARTERIES.

00:02:42.976 --> 00:02:45.480
Whereas eating whole healthy 
plant foods like nuts

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.740
actually helps attack 
the root cause—

00:02:47.743 --> 00:02:50.160
cholesterol, oxidation, 
and inflammation—

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.400
and only has good 
side effects.

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.680
This enzyme that Viagra-like 
drugs muck with

00:02:57.687 --> 00:03:00.570
is primarily found in 
2 places in the body:

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.540
the erectile tissue of the penis

00:03:02.543 --> 00:03:05.650
and the retina of the eye.

00:03:05.653 --> 00:03:08.350
That's why the FDA 
encourages people

00:03:08.353 --> 00:03:10.580
to stop taking 
drugs like viagra,

00:03:10.583 --> 00:03:12.100
and call a doctor right away

00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:14.720
if you experience sudden 
loss of vision,

00:03:14.726 --> 00:03:17.260
if of course you can 
still find your phone.

00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:21.330
Though the harms tend to be 
self-limited and reversible,

00:03:21.338 --> 00:03:25.360
such as cyanopsia in 
which your vision

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.610
suddenly becomes tinted blue.

00:03:27.618 --> 00:03:30.120
Why risk side-effects at all,

00:03:30.124 --> 00:03:33.090
when the problem can be reversed, 
cured in the first place,

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.950
improving the quality and 
quantity of our lives?

00:03:37.953 --> 00:03:40.560
"Improvement of sexual 
function in men (and women)"

00:03:40.564 --> 00:03:44.000
"should be added to the growing 
list of clinical benefits"

00:03:44.005 --> 00:03:50.750
"brought about by healthy 
lifestyles in human beings."
