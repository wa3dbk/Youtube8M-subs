Hi, this is Laura Turner and today I'm going
to talk with you about how I can become a

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:12.550
better writer. My first piece of advice for
becoming a better writer is to read if you

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.999
haven't read as much as you can in the genre
in which you're going to be writing then you're

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:25.800
not going to know how, really to write in
it. So go to other authors for inspiration.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.420
Go to them for filling your head with words
that you can use, and even take some time

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.560
to actually you know look in the thesaurus,
look in your dictionary to find out what words

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.580
mean. Take language classes and things like
this that are going to help you to sort build

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.020
a vocabulary from which you are going to draw
on writing because without language and without

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.740
reading, you won't be able to write. Number
two, obviously is to get down in there and

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.320
start writing. And once you have started writing
you're going to want to sort of look back

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.710
at your writing and say you know, what am
I well and what can I... do I think I work

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:13.350
on. And you should also think about taking
notes on good writing and bad writing and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.870
sort of comparing, what do I want to do, and
what do I not want to do. What did I read?

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.550
You know step one, that I did not like, versus
what did I read in step one that I did like

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.780
and how can I sort of take away the bad stuff
and put in the good stuff. Next you're going

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.850
to write from your heart not from your head.
So many writers write from their head, and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.130
the truly great writers are the ones that
just... that write from a place that they

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:50.830
cannot get out of them. You know they always
have this instinct. So find that place that

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.130
drives you to write. You ever notice whenever
you write from your head, you know even great

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.330
writers do this, whenever you write from your
head you're going to come up with something

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.930
that is so below the caliber of things that
you've written from your heart with your passion

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.190
and all the things that you need to get out,
versus things that you want to tell people,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.340
you know, ideas that you have that you think
would be cool. So think about what you really

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:25.180
need to write versus what you think you want
to write. Finally go back and rewrite your

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.380
stuff until it is in your estimation perfect,
which will of course not ever happen, so this

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.480
is going to force you to rewrite and rewrite
and rewrite all the days of your life. Because

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.580
you're always going to look back at your play,
or your short story, or your novel and you're

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.320
going to say gosh I could go back and change
that, you know that's not as good as it could

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.240
be. There is no perfect writing because it's
very subjective. So this will keep you writing

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.820
and rewriting and therefore getting better.
So those are some tips on how to become a

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.840
better writer.
