VERONICA BASS: I'm Veronica Bass from Veronica's
Color Salon and Day Spa. In behalf of Expert

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:09.880
Village, we are going to learn about hairstyles.
There are different brands of irons too. The

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.960
original which was the CHI and they have come
out with every other brand just like anything

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:21.140
else. They're all pretty good but, you know,
usually the price tells you the quality of

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.570
each kind, it's however much you want to spend
that's how you'll know. The more you spend

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.190
the better the quality. From the professional
parts as far as us professionals we like to

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.340
use the best. Of course, they're a little
bit more expensive but they last a lot longer

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:50.080
as well. Yeah, there is different flat irons.
They have different plates like for crimping,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.730
for wave, like a finger wave. Those are just
to give you different dimension if somebody

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.700
has straight hair and they want waves then
the plates are there to change the texture

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:12.740
of the hair. They have the ceramic and the
metal ones which was the traditional. The

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.850
ceramics are the latest and they're just better
on the hair. They have a coating to protect

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.810
the hair from the heat. They still would abuse,
you know, damage the hair but they are the

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:33.280
best--the latest in technology, the ceramic
type. Anything you use and abuse like everything

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.730
else, it doesn't matter how good they are
they still damage but they're better for the

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.590
hair. It's just how you use it and what you
use along with it that's going to make it

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.000
work the best.
