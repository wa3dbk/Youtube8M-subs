Hi my name is Carol and I am a registered
dental hygienist and I am speaking on behalf

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.690
of Expert Village.com and in this segment
we will be talking about rinsing. There are

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.720
several different choices when choosing your
rinse and it is important that whenever rinsing

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.590
to do it after brushing and flossing and also
remember that rinsing does not replace flossing.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.250
Flossing manually gets between the teeth to
remove plaque. The main thing that rinsing

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.150
does is to help freshen breath and there are
different choices. Make sure whenever you

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.420
buy a rinse to read on the back about the
directions and how to use it and if you need

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.160
to dilute it with water because there are
some brands such as this one that are more

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.150
concentrated that you want to dilute with
water so that there is not so much burning

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.010
when you do rinse. There are other medicated
brands such as this one right here that are

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.960
specifically designed for bleeding and inflammation
of the gums. Like I said before it doesn’t

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.890
replace flossing but it does help remove the
plaque between the teeth after brushing and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.770
flossing has been done. Some other products
that are very good with rinses and the main

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.110
ones that I would choose as far as better
than other ones would be the ones without

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.010
alcohol because the rinses with alcohol tend
to dry out the tissues and the ones without

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.330
the alcohol don’t do that and they also
don’t have the same burning as the ones

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.200
with alcohol. There are some rinses that are
specifically designed for patients with dry

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.420
mouth. There are some patients that have dry
mouth due to radiation treatment or due to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.229
the medications that they are on cause’s
dry mouth. So these can help promote saliva

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.670
production in the mouth and help keep the
mouth more lubricated. This one is just another

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.090
example of a mouth rinse without any alcohol
in it. When rinsing you want to make sure

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.900
to rinse about once or twice a day after you
brush and floss thoroughly and in rinsing

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.920
what you do, is you just use a small amount
and you rinse for about 30 seconds and then

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.319
after the 30 seconds, make sure to spit it
out into the sink and then if you choose to,

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.510
you can rinse your mouth out with water or
if the directions say otherwise like on the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.420
medicated rinse, then don’t rinse your mouth
out with water afterwards and don’t eat

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.809
or drink for 30 minutes afterwards.
