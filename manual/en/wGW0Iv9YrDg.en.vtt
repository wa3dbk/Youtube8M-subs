00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.510
Hi I'm Nita Gill, and I'm going to show you
several things you can make with this

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.150
large vegetable curler.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.679
It's like a big pencil sharpener. All you
need to do is put your vegetable in,

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.919
twist, it's going to shave off

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.480
a  curled

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.869
strip like this. Now you can do it

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.650
short, or you can do it long like I'm
doing here, but when you've got enough

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.679
just break it off. And then you take the
remaining piece

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:36.679
and roll it up

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.570
And you end up with the really lovely
vegetable flower,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.260
this one from yellow squash.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.940
Now I'll peel this with the wavy peeler.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:57.520
It has a wavy edged peeling surface.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.720
And it will look like this...

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.520
Now, I'll peel. The first few are just gonna
come off

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.680
As we go a little deeper

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.860
it stays as one

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.380
long strip with the pointy edges

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.000
And again, you can make this short or you can make it long. The longer you make it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.780
the more layers of flower you'll have. So
once you've got it,

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.780
that piece broke off. Let's just work with the one continuous piece

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.000
There it is. Now we could put a cherry
tomato in the center of this because

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.900
it's large enough

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.180
or I could take one of the flowers that I
had carved previously

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.350
using the carrot curler and put that in
center.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.020
Let's see how a zucchini will look. I love
the contrast

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.750
of the light and dark green. Really pretty.
And again, we can make this really long

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.170
or we could make it short, whatever you
like.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.040
When you get to where you want to finish,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.950
just break it.  I like to start with the
small end

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.940
and wrap it up.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.360
and there it is. Isn't that pretty? Here's
the straight peeled version

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.650
and here's how it looks after peeling
with the wavy peeler.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.840
Again a very pretty and very simple

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.280
flower garnish made using the vegetable
curler.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.920
Now I'm going to try peeling a yam see
what we get.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.600
There it is.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.760
It actually looks kinda pretty with those edges.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.440
Now I've taken a zucchini and I've
scored

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.260
the sides by cutting these slits and
let's take a look and see what happens

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.780
when we curl this.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:26.330
We want the center to be curled a little
bit tighter and outside curled a little

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.520
bit looser

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.020
There.....  so there we go

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.600
another variation of a zucchini flower.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.240
Now you've seen how easily and quickly you can make pretty vegetable flowers  using the large

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.340
vegetable curler

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.390
We've done it using yellow squash, we've added carrot in the center,

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.870
we've got several different looks with zucchini, and we experimented

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.800
with yams unpeeled and peeled with the
wavy peeler.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.260
Now you might notice that there are some
larger holes. We could fill those holes

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.500
with a melon ball of a fruit or
vegetable

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.720
or a cherry tomato or we can take

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.920
and drop in the smaller flowers that we
made

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.820
using the carrot curler.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.100
They're so
easy and yet so pretty! Aren't they?

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.360
I hope you'll have fun making
these on your own.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.600
You can get your large vegetable curler
in the tools and knives section of our

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.960
online shop

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.960
at www.VegetableFruitCarving.com/shop

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.000
Okay I can't resist. There we go.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.220
Pretty, isn't it?
