00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.929
so are you ready for these devastating
numbers between 10 a.m.

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.269
and midnight that day quote Fox News had
nine mentions of the shooting

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.630
while MSNBC talked about shooting just
five times

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.960
CNN's coverage was more regular they
mentioned the shooting 19 times

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.590
the Apple event got more coverage than
the spark shooting

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.449
on all three channels CNN mention the
Apple event twenty three times

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.179
but parties mentioned at 12 and MSNBC
mentioned in nine times

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.349
now look man

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.640
we always talk about the different bias
he's in the media Fox News bias toward

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.850
the Republican Party

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.410
MSNBC the Democratic Party CNN is biased
towards

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.450
neutrality so false equivalence and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.469
sensationalism and the

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.980
the lack of coverage on the shooting
isn't really explained by any of those

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.829
biases

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.399
so white wire may not covering him or
why did they

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.579
actually cover the fuckin iPad the iPad

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.090
more than a gun game shooting and all I
can come up with is that

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.880
we are all just legitimately jaded by
all the gun violence and we just can

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.729
expect it now

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.150
so whenever something happens in less
atop Sandy Hook where the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.180
who little children toddlers got killed
man

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.400
howlers got killed and want to talk to
that

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.520
in quantity right then they don't really
know again

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.710
shooting happened anyway move on what
was the score the Rangers game a truly

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.729
depressing man

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.020
and by the way this this brings me to
the democrats because

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.470
where are you on this look the democrats
at least in this respect don't even

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.189
have up financial conflict of interest
so they're not corrupt in this regard on

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.189
the issue of guns

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.229
because they don't really take much
money from the NRA some other

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.590
you know the rest they want to do but
they're very very few of them so where

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.579
are you on as

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.210
you know the right policy you propose
the right policies in the past the

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.670
assault weapons ban high-capacity
magazines and universal background check

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.860
but see this is typical Democrat what do
they do

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.700
they go a yet will propose it all look
you've got to got shut down it didn't

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.459
pass anyway we will shut up now

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.120
you idiots the republicans tried to
repeal Obamacare

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.090
was talkin impossible to do know trying
to 143 times

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.450
they're in the minority in the drive-in
or forty three times

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.530
you're in the majority on an issue or 91
percent of the American people agree

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.160
with you

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.080
and you can propose a bill more than
once you run away with your tail between

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.150
your legs

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.500
after one dime a dozen passed by the way
in all ten best

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.489
know you propose it enduring promos
enduring propose it and you call press

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.150
conferences

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.709
and you say hey ninety-one percent of
the American people on paper background

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.830
check you dumbass fucking republicans
you are more intensified

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.239
I make your morning is this forty three
times I like them apples

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.170
go ahead forget this forty three times
and no one edge everything when you're

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.530
done their districts

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.709
saying that you're in favor of getting
killed and you're fine with it

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.260
am i clear enough on this

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.620
the democrats need to propose

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.629
gone legislation

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.900
time and time again don't stop keep
opposing you ever beat that 43 number

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.069
but the writing going twice because
there are little bitches

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.620
propose it proposes MN even if you don't
have the numbers

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.379
that stopped the republicans when they
were trying to repeal Obamacare no

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.430
they said we're doing this at a
principal it was a dome principal what

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.510
they were doing and principal

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.379
why can't you promote gun legislation on
principle and you try to get it bro

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.930
and we're not political pressure on the
republicans when I think I might lose my

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.930
scene was liable for the background
check

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.909
which by the way they will but the
second that you actually got some

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.129
pressure put on them

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.040
and you lost more than you backed off
and said well we lost once show you my

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.580
when the second time for the third time
for the 10th time

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.790
you gotta do what you gotta try to pass
it and/or you don't do it

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.480
the more innocent people are getting
killed all across the United States of

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.080
America

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.780
because we have gone anarchy in the
United States and not even some sane

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.950
moderate regulations
