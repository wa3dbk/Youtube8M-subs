00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:04.889
welcome back to the david package for
joining me is weak and comedian and

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:09.190
author of lead camps moment of clarity
the ranting about the rantings of a

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.360
stark raving sane man

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.789
uh... we great to see the community of
nations tell me about the the book

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.970
i have the book is uh... it's ninety
transcripts from my video grants that

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.489
have become all of the popular and
people are asking for the transcripts i

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:27.420
figured why not put them in a book and

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.859
enough they chatted sudha dot ninety
different topics and uh...

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.710
you know similar to live my ransom i
stand up and every ang it's angry

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.079
dependent aidid it's it's about what's
going on in the world the allot of a lot

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.339
of bad words in there so don't shut the
kids and i was not coloring pictures and

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:45.470
then so

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.000
uh... might might be a bad idea for them
but our people simply liking it so it's

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.210
been doing really well problema querida
yeah i was reading the book me that's

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.500
number five on amazon's political humor
category which is actually

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.059
head of where bill mars book was at one
point so i'm sure you'll be making like

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.520
a million dollar donation to obama's

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.060
any minute now i'm going to take the
thirty seven dollars that made from the

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.450
book and i'm a democrat

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.510
nellie there was a lot of great value
that the law permitted it was the still

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.410
local and back but i was just really
excited to see that he is now considered

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.990
political humor

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.220
no that's fine is

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.440
what is glenn beck a book intended to be
political humor was it just put on that

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.010
category by amazon uh... kind of as a
group

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.210
i have no idea brothers i haven't read
it

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.009
incredible

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.609
so what do you what are you thinking
about the twenty twelve election i mean

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.030
and i've read a little bit about your
thoughts and we're just seeing so much

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.220
bizarre stuff come out about now we've
got

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.060
the run the campaign thing the semantic
game about well we do you need to

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.580
further explain the difference between

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.810
outsourcing to another country and
offshoring to really make a criticism of

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.190
what being capital data with it dot

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.680
but i think that's a p_r_ trek there
like what you can do that terminology

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.330
and a lot a lot better you get her

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.400
it's insane but

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.229
but in my opinion is that there are
certain smaller issues that these

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.590
parties are very different on like gay
marriage like you can't act valley

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.370
immigration to some extent but

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.619
but there is this is there like that

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:22.099
but i think in the larger picture in
terms of the economy in terms of like

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.540
we're doing anything about wall street
stopping this in this e-mail baba bus

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.239
system that we we've created stopping
the product goes on wall street stopping

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:31.639
that

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.790
military industrial complex

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.320
between the two parties i don't see a
lot of different send and i think it

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.619
needs to be talked about more because

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:45.579
i don't think that pretending these two
parties are polar opposites uh... does

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.629
bus justice and at the end of the larger
scope but then something i can

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.379
understand what you're saying but so
this kind of end to places you can go

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.559
from that and and i'm curious which when
you get into one is

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:01.539
let's get all bomb at out and put in
romney because then it'll maybe open the

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:04.789
door for some kind of more significant
and progressive

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:08.019
move after romney and then there's the
people who say wait a second we kind of

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.349
already tried that we had george w_ bush
for eight years

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.320
and the last three and

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.740
half president obama has just been
trying to undo

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.060
that damage so that's a so there's not
really anything to this idea of what's

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.140
good for the right

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.909
to then go further to the left later on
in which camp you fall into

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.649
well and instead go to the right in
order to go to the last time i don't buy

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:33.650
landed up on the either those camps i
think there is more than that i don't

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.790
by i did alone about four although i'm
also not a slave states that certain

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.569
less than that

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.959
pressing matter but would feel guilty of
the problem

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.409
but that would you consider voting for
mit romney there is a good mail bomber

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.109
and someone else or a no vote

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.680
right there would be permitted to bring
a bottle of whether whether all right

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.049
you know well eternally writes about for
obama or sum up third-party it's only

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.169
i think there's a lot to be done

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:06.059
uh... running a lot to be done for third
party candidates whether they win or not

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:08.859
at least just it injuring the discussion

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.039
also take a lot of things that are not
beside the political spectrum very

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:14.790
important like occupy not try to be very

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.209
uh... the uh... connected to uh... that
movement i mean just how about in the

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.889
way that i'm able to help out i mean i
understand it is a comedian but

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.309
you know a lot lately and it's still a
lot of uh... interviewer message isn't

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:28.560
getting out there and

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.130
you know i'd make is acting but people
seem to be turning to comedy for their

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.319
new so i guess that gives us an even
greater obligation

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.960
yet what did you think of the occupy
uh...

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.340
and i delegate should i guess that was
that netmums nation when we were there

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.190
in providence a couple of weeks ago i i
was a little disappointed it was a

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.169
little bit week i think it was like
fifteen or twenty people

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.189
and the how do you know i was concerned
that

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:54.789
between that movement being not too well
represented in providence

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.610
and then the guys from the conservative
blogs trying to get uh... gotcha

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.850
interviews on their hand-held cameras
outside

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.390
i was a little concerned that the the in
that particular instance the movement

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.020
was doing itself a disservice

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.300
well when you send it back to back in
ten days talking about the guide camping

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.340
outside of the guys on the panel

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.850
that has kept the the the of the people
outside yet not not within the

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.729
conference but from the front outer
point of view

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:20.999
yet on a date

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:24.830
at times occupy depending on the city in
the head of a kind of thing yeah i can

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.229
look at a week but

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.460
and did say it's gonna be at the
long-term battle and i think that people

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.270
are given enough credit for

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.039
what he did cheat in only two to three
months in a change in the entire

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.900
discussion in this country from

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.870
austerity measures to in equality into
di to the idea that this system is

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.529
unsustainable and that that is getting
top area and you have to get here

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:51.080
uh... yeah uh... brilliant scientists
really the top heavy things collapse

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.449
here you just picture

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.990
joel seymour hoffman riding on the
shoulders of natalie portman it done and

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.699
well

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:59.999
so when all the wealth is in the top one
percent it's got a it's gonna collapse

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:04.439
worse than we've ever seen that uh... i
think most people know that i think you

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:07.800
talk to people on wall street and
they'll say yeah this is going to go on

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.529
forever prominent steal as much money
from the burning building lilac and

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:15.400
before it collapses do you think at some
point the occupy movement would be well

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.139
served to have some kind of a and i
don't know that leaders really the right

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:19.440
way

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.000
earth spokespersons the right word but

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.080
the there's been this resistance to
saying that it's a movement that is

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.300
headed or

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.930
directed by any one person at some point
do you think there will be some benefit

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.539
to that

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:36.309
divided embedded systems are leadership
not only

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:37.019
i_d_

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:38.560
i don't really see it

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.439
playing a think that most people that
dead are

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:43.729
involve all the ministers

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:47.810
and safety intimate in in occupy meaning
the committees in the voting in stafford

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.689
very opposed to any top-down leadership

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:51.770
uh...

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.289
that you know

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:56.710
and i think that there are a lot of
benefits to it as well i'm not saying

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.250
that a needs to remain that way forever
but i think there's a lot of benefits

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.620
like you can't just you can't is not the
legs out from under modified by taking

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.289
down one man like you know they've done
with julian assigns you you can

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:11.670
when you have what one leader or

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.360
few leaders it's very easy to put them
in jail are arrest them or

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.800
you don't want their character whatever
and destroy a movement whereas there's

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.460
nobody there's nobody to talk to destroy
it so i think it's actually

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.110
i think it's heading the forces against
occupy right now it's actually survived

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.719
longer without that leadership

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:35.069
i read the book isley camps moment of
clarity been speaking with comedian and

providence and i'm glad to have you on
