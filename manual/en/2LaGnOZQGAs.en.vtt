00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.009
Probably one of the most up and coming markets
in our sunglass collection is going to be

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:13.240
for those individuals that want athletic sunglasses.
What are athletic sunglasses? Well, this pair

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.410
of sunglasses right here, I don't know if
the camera picks it up, hopefully it does,

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:25.310
but it's ventilated. This particular pair
of sunglasses is designed for those who ride

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.809
bikes a lot like Lance Armstrong. Riding at
high rates of speed, sweat, air is cutting

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.039
through there to kind of reduce the amount
of steam that builds up behind the eyes. I'll

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.920
try these on. You can kind of see that these
are wrapped. If these don't have this ventilation

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.749
here on the side, you'll probably, when you're
doing a lot of exercising, riding a bike,

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:55.370
you're going to get a lot of buildup of the
steam behind the glasses just from your body

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.271
temperature in relation to the outside. This
prevents the glasses from steaming up. Again,

00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:07.750
the tint in here, we'll go over tints a little
bit later but this is again so that this type

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.950
of tint is amber, kind of orange color allows
the rider to pick up things on the road a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.680
little bit easier. So again, athletic eye
wear is really, you know, coming into its

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.000
own. There are glasses for golfers, which
have a certain distinct tint that helps them

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.660
pick up the ball a little bit better on their
swing. For everything, volleyball, all types

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.680
of different. I'll show you one other one.
This is one of my favorites for those of you

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.780
who might do some motorbiking or motor sports.
You can kind of see in here, we have a foam

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.520
padded. This is so, when a motorcycle rider
puts on his helmet, it doesn't squeeze the

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.870
glasses into the person's face. They have
this foam padding so that it doesn't go all

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.850
the way back. I'll try this on. I'm not a
motorcycle rider but I'll illustrate. So,

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:10.450
really good coverage here. It's really not
hitting on my face. It's actually very comfortable.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:19.790
Total wrap, nothing is getting into these.
It should be very comfortable for a bike rider.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.530
You can actually put lenses into these by
putting an insert into the glasses. So, you

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.530
can make these prescription even though they
don't look like they could be done but they

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.790
can be. So again, recreational glasses, ask
your optician. If you have a particular sport

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.870
that you like, that you participate in, there's
probably something out there for you that's

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.480
going to work.
