00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.720
Sarah Honigfeld

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.079
My name is Sarah, I'm 20 years old. I'm from Connecticut and I was born Deaf.

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:29.840
I'm a third year at Northeastern University I'm studying Human Services and I'm getting

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.819
a minor in Sociology. I know I want to work with children

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:45.640
and I want to help kids who have disabilities to grow up and do anything they want to do.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.569
When I was a kid I did ballet...soccer, basketball, cheerleading,

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.780
girl scouts, everything! [ laughs ] 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.890
It was kind of nice to...

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.450
be able to prove to my school that just because I can't hear

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:10.220
doesn't mean I can't participate. 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.990
One of the biggest challenges that I've had

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.590
is living on my own. Something might happen,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.780
so I've definitely had to

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.980
teach myself to become more careful

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.070
and more aware since I live on my own. 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.760
One of the things that I've had to become

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.980
more aware of is fire safety. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.120
Cooking fire is one of the leading causes

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.630
of home fires in the nation. When I'm cooking I have to be careful of what

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.720
I wear so if I'm wearing a scarf or have my hair

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.930
down it could catch on fire, so I have to 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:55.010
make sure I'm wearing the right clothes. 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.990
Another thing that I learned about cooking

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.750
is never leave my cooking alone

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:08.300
never walk away or go into another room. Always stay with whatever I'm making.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.880
If there's a grease fire, if you put water on it

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.650
it's going to expand and explode so never put water on a grease fire.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.410
Put a lid on a fire. 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.579
Another thing about fire safety are the things

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.780
that keep me safe such as smoke alarms and fire equipment.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.579
Because I can't hear I live in a dorm that has a special fire alarm.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.449
So, if the fire alarm ends up going off there's a flashing light that will get my attention

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:51.169
and then I can get up and get out of the dorm.

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.980
You should always have a sprinkler where you live.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:06.879
Automatic fire sprinklers will put out fires and give you time to get out of the building.

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:10.449
If the fire alarm goes off I should always know two ways to get

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:14.070
out of the building in case there's a fire. You want to make sure you have a second way

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.949
out in case the first way, the way you came in,

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:17.479
is blocked. No matter where you are,

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:22.089
if you're at your dorm, classroom, movie theatre restaurant, anywhere you are

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:34.979
you should know two ways to get out. You should practice getting out your second

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.049
exit because you want to make sure it's not blocked

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:47.810
by bicycles or trash cans or anything else. 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.579
It's very important that I prepare for a fire

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.969
emergency regardless of where I am

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.829
school, my dorm, classroom, movie theatre anywhere.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.759
You can always talk to a fire safety official or someone from the fire department

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:29.180
to learn more about fire safety. Remember, fire safety is part of living.
