00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.960
Samsung Monte S5620. Expected February 2010.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.789
Tbe Samsung Monte, or Samsung GT-S5620 is
a 3.5G GPS enabled touchscreen phone with

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:27.020
WiFi. It is similar in specification to the
B7300 (but without Windows) and the Blue Earth

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.090
(but without a solar panel), meaning tha the
Monte fits into a very small gap in Samsung's

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.770
current product range.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.829
The S5620 Monte does look quite stylish and
interesting, but some of the other features

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:49.059
can best be regarded as being mundane but
useful. The 3" 240 x 400 pixel touchscreen

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.620
display is a fairly standard TFT panel that
is similar to many others on the market. On

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.989
the back is a 3.2 megapixel camera with support
for geo-tagging, which is again useful but

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.339
not extraordinary.

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:10.890
This is a 3.5G device with maximum HSDPA download
speeds of up to 3.6 Mbps, and the Monte also

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.240
supports WiFi connectivity.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.790
Social networking support is built in, with
applications for Facebook and MySpace plus

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.670
support for Bebo and Twitter, which we guess
is kind of inevitable these days. The Monte

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:33.000
runs the TouchWiz 2.0 Plus interface on top
of Samsung's own proprietary OS.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.560
Multimedia support is decent enough, with
a multimedia player that can cope with MP3,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:44.600
AAC and WMA audio plus others, and H.263,
H.264 and MPEG4 video. There's no mention

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.300
of support for WMV video so we guess it doesn't
have it. There is a 3.5mm audio socket though,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.280
and the Monte supports stereo Bluetooth.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:01.409
The built-in GPS supports Google Maps 3.0
and Google Latitude. Again, this is useful

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.840
but just about every other handset we see
at the moment can do the same thing.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.890
All the usual software features are here such
as a web browser and email client, and the

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:18.359
S5620 also supports Exchange ActiveSync. Again,
these features are hardly uncommon.

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:23.139
But add all these features together and it
does seem that the S5620 Monte does seem to

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:27.599
have almost everything you need. Yes, there
are phones with better displays and cameras

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.790
and cleverer operating systems and gimmicks,
but we have to admit that the Monte does seem

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.650
to be pretty well specced.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.909
It manages to avoid the dreaded black slab
effect somewhat, and it is available in black

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.579
 / silver or graphite / orange colour combinations.

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:50.120
A suggested SIM-free retail price of about
â‚¬260 marks this out as a midrange handset.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.709
Samsung say that the Monte should be available
in February in Germany and will be supported

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.500
with a multi-million pound advertising campaign
in April in the UK.
