Hi, my name is Larry Landis and I’ve been
involved in the farmer’s markets here in

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:13.440
Corvallis for about 20 years. Within a month
or so we were involved in the establishment

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.400
of the Corvallis Saturday Farmers’ Market,
which started in June of 1991. Well, the Saturday

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.689
farmer’s market is located—actually, both
farmer’s markets in Corvallis—are located

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:32.739
on the riverfront on First Street. The market
is important as a major marketing outlet for

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:33.930
many small farmers.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:55.800
[music]

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.430
So, I got into this with beekeeping originally
when I was nine years old. This is our blackberry

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.439
honey. There’s probably actually a little
bit of maple in it also, which is very common

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:16.729
local honey. We direct market most of our
products to farmer’s markets, restaurants,

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:45.569
buying clubs up in Portland, the restaurants
in Corvallis, Albany, and Portland.

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.459
[music]

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:56.229
Our farm is called the Mushroomery and we’re
an organic mushroom farm and we grow mushrooms

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:04.109
year round and we also wildcraft mushrooms
in Oregon year round. Today, we have truffles,

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:14.890
and cauliflower, coral, chanterelles, hedgehog,
fried chicken, winter chanterelles. And so,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.490
we spend half our week mushroom hunting and
half our week working at the farm. And it’s

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.560
a family run farm.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.780
[sound of peppers roasting]

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:43.269
So, we have acorn squash. We have about 60
varieties of pumpkin and squash in the field

00:02:43.269 --> 00:03:17.800
right now. We have some kiwis and watermelon
growing down on Kiger Island drive. A whole

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:31.120
heck of a lot of pumpkin and squash.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.360
[music]

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.650
The market is important as a major marketing
outlet for many small farmers. A lot of the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.810
small farms in this area have multiple marketing
outlets, but the markets give them contact

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:55.689
with anywhere from three to six thousand potential
customers each market day. So, even if they

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:00.620
don’t sell to everybody, there’s certainly
the high visibility, which can translate into

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.890
sales through other venues.
