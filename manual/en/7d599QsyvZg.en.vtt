00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.019
Over time, that spark; that special something;
that novelty, if you will, of a Kairosoft

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.500
'sim' game started to wear off, even despite
refinement of the genre from its rough beginnings

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.420
on the iOS with Game Dev Story.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.550
Seeing the same elements again and again brought
an ugly sense of deja vu, but Epic Astro Story

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.390
breaks the cycle, daring to re-purpose ideas
we've seen before to create something novel

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.210
once again.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.579
At first the player is greeted, almost like
an old friend, to the familiar layout of a

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.320
town-management sim from Kairosoft, complete
with townsfolk that work in fields; carry

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.640
resources to the docks; and end the day in
a cosy home.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.370
The cute, miniaturized sprites and familiar
touch-based menu interfaces have also returned,

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.469
so fans will find themselves jumping in with
little prompting required.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.699
However, aside from the basic setup, things
quickly evolve in to something very unique.

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.430
For starters you're limited in how much space
you have available because you've just colonized

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.620
a new planet.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.130
You also have friendly aliens popping in to
check out the quaint humans who have just

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.160
settled, kicking off a tourism industry as
well.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.090
In order to expand in to a true metropolis,
you'll need to explore the lands around you

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.549
by forming groups of colonists, sending them
off to automatically explore and encounter

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.210
random events... including automatically resolved
battles.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.659
Exploration rewards the player with money
as well as 'research' points, both of which

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.040
can be used to develop new technologies that
extend either the trade, tourism, or exploration

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.700
gameplay elements.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.590
The more you explore, the harder it becomes
without better equipment and more experienced

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.049
colonists and you'll soon find yourself being
crushed by 'boss' creatures if you expand

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.250
too quickly.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.250
Thankfully more recruits can be found by exploring
other planets, simultaneously improving relations

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.950
with the other races.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.680
Unlike some prior releases, you will encounter
one new colonist at a time, making the decision

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.450
to hire them and return back to your planet,
or stay and explore some more - potentially

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.289
unlocking a new technology - a pivotal choice
that can determine the success or failure

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.930
of your colony.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.760
Being stuffed with sci-fi and generally geeky
references doesn't hurt the game either, making

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.590
it an amusing experience on top of everything
else.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.930
If you've been hesitant to jump back in to
a Kairosoft title - hesitate no longer; this

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:33.680
one 
is a keeper.
