00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
If I wanted to say 'You are a Samurai',
I´d say あなたはサムライだ

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.429
 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.250
This movie is based on a legend that is very famous in Japan.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.380
but here, not a lot of people know it. Would you share that legend with us?

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.990
Okay, the quick version of the 47 Ronin.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.290
I haven't done this in a while.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.900
Basically it's a
story about sacrifice.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.550
It's a story about sacrifice

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.160
to reclaim honor, to correct wrong.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.840
And it starts between two Lords

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.240
and basically in the short form one lord
insults another, strikes another

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.380
insult striking

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.470
in-midst of the Shogun. You can't do that.
Lord has to die.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.000
Commits seppuku which is honorable, but
the man with the lord

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.800
who would commit seppuku

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.720
feels that there's an injustice done,
that there wasn't the right

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.930
retribution and

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.030
the Shogun says you can't take revenge
but then a year later they all go away

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.750
and then 47 come back

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.990
and take the head of Lord Asano.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.170
I'm sorry, of Lord Kira,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:30.100
and by that they reclaim their place, their home, their name.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.690
 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.940
Whatever happens in there,

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.990
whatever you see, don't draw your weapon.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.500
Wait here.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.549
You are playing Kai. What is his story?

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.490
My character Kai is not in the
historical record.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.040
This is part of the adaptation.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.400
I play an orphan in a way, a half breed of

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.490
 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.180
english father, japanese mother;

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.090
mother abandons the child out of shame and disgrace,

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.319
probably being forced to you. I'm raised
by these mysterious monks and I escape

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.500
as a young man and I go to a place called Ako, which is Lord Asaon.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.600
He accepts me to a certain
extent, I fall in love with the princess,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.190
princess falls in love with me as
children, we grow up but apart, we can't

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.220
be together it's kind of like

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.540
Romeo and Juliet. But then the evil
Lord Kira takes her away,

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.959
takes the lands of Ako. 
The 47 Ronin

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.000
and Kai seek revenge to reclaim Ako

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.959
and the princess, and the name

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.200
of Lord Asano.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.000
I was amazed by how forgiving Kai is. Would you consider yourself

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
as a forgiving person? Do you forgive easily?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.519
Thank you very much for feeling that and seeing that.

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.500
It was my hope and ambition that there would be
something about the compassion

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.650
of the character that

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.400
even as he's ostracized he has a respect.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.700
I liked that part of the
character, so thank you for that.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.459
 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.280
What was the other part of the question?
If you consider yourself -

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.840
If I'm forgiving? 
No, I'm not as good as Kai.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.959
But it was nice to play him. It was nice to
be that good a guy.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.800
I will search for you through a thousand worlds.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.850
 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.900
And 10-thousand life times until I find you.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.500
 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.280
In the movie there is this line that 'this life

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.400
is just a preparation for what comes next'.
How do you feel about that?

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.800
I feel like it- because I can't know- but I feel like that

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.760
is probably true. You know I feel like
that there's something about-

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.300
That sentiment has such wonderful

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.190
impact if we think about it and act upon it.
You know that if we wanted to have a

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.600
good experience in our -

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.650
after we close our eyes you know that
how we would

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.780
behave in the present you know.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.340
And yes, I feel like you know those things 
like they die a happy death,

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.840
a hard death or how people pass

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:30.100
or the formations of culture that
you live with going into the other world

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.140
 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.300
or passing you know. I think that it
speaks to our present,

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.390
speaks to those around us, and I think
it can speak to

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:44.090
what is inherited and transmitted.
Did you learn Japanese for this movie?

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.690
That was a beautiful answer, by the way.
Oh no, it was too long.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.090
I don't learn any Japanese, I learned a
little Japanese.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.400
The director Carl Rinsch would ask the Japanese cast

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.470
 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.080
while we were doing the film in
English

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.110
but to do it in Japanese in

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.400
to get a different connection to the lines

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.940
in spirit of that I tried to do the japanese lines

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.980
which was really fun. There's a Japanese
version of this movie if you want to make

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.900
which is really cool.
Can you teach us something in Japanese?

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:33.200
Oh gosh you know, I learned the lines,
I know some typical greetings -

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.260
 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.720
始めまして 
which means nice to meet you.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.440
It's afternoon, so こんにちは

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.030
Thank you for this interview-
このインタビューをありがとうございました

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.400
and if I wanted to say you are
Samurai I'd say - あなたはサムライだ

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.800
Thank you so much for this interview.
