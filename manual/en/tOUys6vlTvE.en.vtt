00:00:02.164 --> 00:00:03.847
Voiceover: With
non-cyanotic heart dieseae,

00:00:03.847 --> 00:00:06.597
you have some type of a congenital defect.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:10.271
Congenital just means that the
individual is born with it,

00:00:10.271 --> 00:00:14.025
but what happens as a
result is that blood moves

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:17.641
from the left side of the heart
to the right side of the heart.

00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:21.531
In this example, you see that
we have a little hole here in

00:00:21.531 --> 00:00:24.513
the wall between the left
ventricle and the right ventricle.

00:00:24.513 --> 00:00:28.213
Since the pressure is
higher on this left side

00:00:28.213 --> 00:00:30.828
that's sending the blood
throughout the entire body,

00:00:30.828 --> 00:00:34.301
that is going to cause
blood to go from the left

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:36.608
to the right ventricle.

00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:40.652
Now, my question is, how
does the doctor diagnose

00:00:40.652 --> 00:00:44.366
that an individual has some
non-cyanotic heart defect?

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:48.400
Well, one of the first things
is that you can hear it.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.181
So, let's draw a little ear here.

00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:54.018
You'll be able to hear it,

00:00:54.018 --> 00:00:57.752
and also, you should be able see it.

00:00:58.736 --> 00:01:01.817
We'll talk about how you
can do those things ...

00:01:02.047 --> 00:01:04.209
let's put a little pupil here.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.387
All right, so, you'll be able to hear it,

00:01:05.387 --> 00:01:06.649
and you'll be able to see it.

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.668
Now for the hearing, well,
just think about it this way.

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:11.941
Let's say you have a garden hose.

00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:13.404
This is my garden hose,

00:01:13.404 --> 00:01:17.448
and we have water that's flowing
through that garden hose,

00:01:17.448 --> 00:01:19.531
and all of a sudden, we decide

00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:25.061
"Hey we're going to put a
little tiny hole in the hose."

00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:27.932
So, right here we have a little hole.

00:01:27.932 --> 00:01:28.841
What's going to happen?

00:01:28.841 --> 00:01:31.533
Well, of course, you're going
to have water flying out

00:01:31.918 --> 00:01:33.917
in places that you don't want it to go,

00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:36.119
and it's going to kind of
squirt in this direction.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.922
If you come closely here,
you'll be able to hear that.

00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:40.781
Right? Yeah! Of course, that makes sense.

00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:42.167
Well, how does a doctor do that?

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:44.131
Well, the doctor can't go in and

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:47.075
put his ear right by that hole.

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:50.859
What he can do is take
this little handy device

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.749
that we're all so familiar with,

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:54.304
that's called a stethoscope,

00:01:54.627 --> 00:01:56.915
and this end, it's going in his ears.

00:01:56.915 --> 00:01:58.355
Then, you have this tube,

00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:01.338
and then, you have this chest piece,

00:02:01.338 --> 00:02:04.882
and where you can listen
to the sounds of the heart.

00:02:05.144 --> 00:02:08.277
Depending on the type of
non-cyanotic heart disease

00:02:08.876 --> 00:02:10.668
that individual might have,

00:02:10.668 --> 00:02:13.577
he'll be able to hear the squirting or

00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:17.262
some type of a characteristic sound that's

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.360
the result of that defect.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.689
This process, I'll give
you a fancy name for it,

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.302
it called auscultation.

00:02:25.794 --> 00:02:28.231
All right, so, that is
when the doctor comes with

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:31.453
the stethoscope and since
this is a congenital defect,

00:02:31.453 --> 00:02:33.142
when the baby is just born,

00:02:33.142 --> 00:02:35.014
he listens to the sound of the heart,

00:02:35.014 --> 00:02:37.748
and say, "Hey. I'm
hearing something that's

00:02:37.748 --> 00:02:39.998
it's not exactly what
I would like to hear."

00:02:39.998 --> 00:02:43.668
So, that is one way, by
listening to the heart.

00:02:43.668 --> 00:02:45.495
Then, you can see the heart.

00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:46.567
How do you see the heart?

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:47.975
Well, by taking a picture.

00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:51.720
Unfortunately, you can't
just take a regular camera.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.739
You need a more expensive machine,

00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:58.377
and that expensive machine
is going to allow you

00:02:58.377 --> 00:03:02.680
to be able to visualize the chest area,

00:03:02.927 --> 00:03:06.628
and with that, it's just
like we're taking a picture.

00:03:06.628 --> 00:03:08.115
It's just a little different.

00:03:08.115 --> 00:03:10.584
It's not going to have
all the nice fancy colors,

00:03:11.306 --> 00:03:13.963
and you'll be able to see the heart.

00:03:13.963 --> 00:03:15.736
All right, so, this is my heart.

00:03:16.336 --> 00:03:20.661
This is called a chest x-ray.

00:03:20.661 --> 00:03:23.538
All right. You going x-ray machine.

00:03:23.538 --> 00:03:25.159
You put the baby in the x-ray machine.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.317
You take a picture, and you look to see,

00:03:27.317 --> 00:03:29.896
all right, is there some
type of a structural defect

00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:31.565
that's not suppose to be there?

00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:34.828
That's one way to visualize the heart.

00:03:34.828 --> 00:03:38.174
There's a second way to visualize
the heart that's even better.

00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:39.498
Yeah, you can take a picture,

00:03:39.498 --> 00:03:41.883
or you can take a video. Right?

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.296
With a fetal or postnatal ...

00:03:49.218 --> 00:03:55.640
so, fetal is while the fetus is
still inside the mother's womb,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.740
and postnatal, once that baby is born,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.696
you take an echocardiogram.

00:04:02.696 --> 00:04:05.110
So, echo ... ooh, that doesn't look right.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.539
Echocardiogram.

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.527
What that does is you're
using sound waves,

00:04:12.527 --> 00:04:14.632
and you're projecting it onto a screen,

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.013
so, that you can see the heart.

00:04:17.013 --> 00:04:18.743
You see the heart as it's beating.

00:04:18.743 --> 00:04:21.480
You see it contracting.
You see the valves closing.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.926
You can also see in real time if there are

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.393
defects that should not be there.

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:29.589
So, that's number two.

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:32.532
We can visualize the heart by either using

00:04:32.532 --> 00:04:37.911
a chest x-ray or a fetal or
postnatal echocardiogram.

00:04:38.203 --> 00:04:41.419
There are some other
issues that we might notice

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.887
with non-cyanotic heart disease.

00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:46.191
We said that blood is
going from the left side

00:04:46.191 --> 00:04:49.271
to the right side, and
if you have more and more

00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:52.272
blood going to the right side where it's

00:04:52.272 --> 00:04:55.122
ultimately going to your lungs,

00:04:56.198 --> 00:04:58.417
so, you have more gong to your lungs

00:04:58.417 --> 00:05:01.686
some coming back but not
going as much to the body,

00:05:01.686 --> 00:05:03.874
eventually, you're going to get buildup

00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:07.939
in pressure in your lungs.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.525
If you get a buildup in
pressure in your lungs,

00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:13.571
that can feed back to the right side

00:05:13.971 --> 00:05:19.269
causing buildup in pressure over here too.

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:21.351
If we have that buildup
in pressure over here,

00:05:21.351 --> 00:05:23.936
the ventricle has to do much more work.

00:05:23.936 --> 00:05:26.493
Now, if you go to the gym,
and you're exercising,

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:28.026
and you're doing a lot of work,

00:05:28.026 --> 00:05:29.370
what's going to happen to your muscles?

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.634
Well, their going to get larger.

00:05:30.634 --> 00:05:32.556
Their going to get significantly stronger.

00:05:32.556 --> 00:05:35.591
That's going to start to happen on

00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:40.566
the right side where you
have a larger heart muscle.

00:05:40.566 --> 00:05:43.449
If you have larger heart muscle,

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.487
you will notice this when a doctor

00:05:46.487 --> 00:05:49.003
comes and does an

00:05:49.003 --> 00:05:53.424
electrocardiogram.

00:05:53.424 --> 00:05:55.891
So, we take an electrocardiogram.

00:05:55.891 --> 00:05:59.362
Cardiogram where we are looking at the

00:05:59.362 --> 00:06:02.270
electrical signals throughout the heart.

00:06:02.608 --> 00:06:05.435
With that, I'm going
to just sketch one out.

00:06:05.435 --> 00:06:07.981
Right now we have our P wave,

00:06:07.981 --> 00:06:12.002
and then, our QRS complex,

00:06:12.002 --> 00:06:14.582
and then, we have our T wave.

00:06:15.858 --> 00:06:18.528
If I look at that, so, this P wave,

00:06:19.127 --> 00:06:23.844
our QRS complex, and
then, we have our T wave.

00:06:23.844 --> 00:06:29.813
The P wave gives me the
electrical activity of the atria.

00:06:30.506 --> 00:06:33.462
The QRS complex is
given you the electrical

00:06:33.462 --> 00:06:37.689
activity of the ventricles. All right.

00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:39.856
I'm not going to go into all the details.

00:06:39.856 --> 00:06:41.331
I'm just going to kind of make it

00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:42.989
just that simple for now.

00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:46.533
If you have enlargement of the ventricles,

00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:48.095
or the right ventricle,

00:06:48.095 --> 00:06:49.652
what's that going to do to the signal?

00:06:49.652 --> 00:06:51.662
Do you expect to see the same signal,

00:06:51.662 --> 00:06:54.065
a larger signal, a smaller signal?

00:06:54.065 --> 00:06:55.705
Well, if you have a bigger muscle,

00:06:55.705 --> 00:06:59.011
I would expect to see a significantly

00:06:59.011 --> 00:07:04.204
larger signal here with the ventricles.

00:07:04.204 --> 00:07:06.554
If that feeds back to your atria,

00:07:06.708 --> 00:07:09.701
and you have a larger right atrium,

00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:11.930
well, you might see this being a larger,

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.001
a little broader, a little wider.

00:07:15.216 --> 00:07:17.867
There are characteristics
features that you can

00:07:17.867 --> 00:07:20.339
see in the electrocardiogram,

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:24.979
the ECG or EKG,

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:26.536
depending on where you are in the world.

00:07:27.612 --> 00:07:29.835
That can give you an indication

00:07:29.835 --> 00:07:32.675
as to whether there is some type of a

00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:36.490
dysfunction in the
heart, as a result of the

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.580
load that's placed on the right ventricle,

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.321
and the right atrium, and
enlargement of those structures.

00:07:44.321 --> 00:07:46.781
So, you can hear it. You can see it.

00:07:46.781 --> 00:07:49.736
There are some functional
things that you can

00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:53.184
notice in the electrocardiogram to help

00:07:53.184 --> 00:07:56.666
diagnose a non-cyanotic heart defect.
