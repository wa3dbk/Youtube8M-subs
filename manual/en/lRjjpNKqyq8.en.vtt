Hi, I'm Mark Middlebrook and I'm here in the
Paul Marcus Wines Cantina. And in this segment

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.440
I'm going to talk about Barbera. The tangy,
all purpose, wonderful red wine from the Piemonte

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.780
Region of Northwest Italy. Barbera is a grape
variety. It's indigenous to this part of Italy.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.610
Although it's grown in other areas of Italy
too. And even in the United States a little

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.180
bit. And some other places. But Barbera is
kind of the everyday wine that Piemonte is

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.950
known for. It's typically if you just have
an ordinary glass of red wine when you're

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:35.620
there, it's often going to be Barbera. There
are several different appellations or what

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.580
the Italians call DOCs for Barbera. And that's
simply a named wine type. The most common

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.120
one that you'll see, at least in the United
States is Barbera D'Alba. And so Barbera is

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.220
a grape variety again. Alba is the town around
which the vineyards are located. And there

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.410
are many, many, many different producers of
it. This particular one is the Felipe Galino

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.739
Barbera D'Alba. He's just north of, about
a half an hour north of Alba itself. This

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.310
is a fresh fruity version. Done in, aged entirely
in stainless steel. So, relatively modestly

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.820
priced. Thirteen, fourteen dollars. And I
drink a lot of this with pizza, pasta, lasagna.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.240
It's just, it's tangy, bright acidity, makes
it go really well with anything that has tomatoes

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.690
in it, but also other sorts of food. Chicken,
Bar-B-Que, things like that. This is another

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.890
Barbera D'Alba from a different producer,
Cascina Ca'Rossa. Not too far from Felipo's

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.450
vineyards as a matter of fact. Felipo Galino.
This is done in a little different style where

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.450
the wine is aged in barrique, in smaller wooden
barrels for some time to give it a little

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.659
more texture, a little more complexity. Also
the vineyards are a little bit older for this

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.080
particular wine. Which gives more complexity
to it. So it's a little more ambitious style

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.140
of Barbera. Would cost more like twenty five
or thirty dollars retail. You might have that

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.750
with a heartier sorts of food or cheeses.
It's a slightly more special occasion wine.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.250
And then another DOC another appellation for
Barbera is called Barbera D'Asti. So Asti

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.470
is another Village town in Piemonte, about
forty minute drive from Alba itself. Traditionally

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.730
Asti style Barberas have been a little brighter,
a little lighter, a little livelier, sometimes

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.620
a little simpler. But nowadays I don't think
there's such a big distinction. It really

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.549
depends more on the producer or where the
vineyards are located. How they've worked

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.189
in vineyards. And how they've made the wine.
This particular Barbera D'Asti is from a producer,

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.499
a wonderful producer called Vietti and this
is his bottle and called Tre Vigne. Which

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:39.559
simply means three vineyards. So he blends
fruit from three different vineyards in the

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:44.319
Asti Region. Barbera is probably my favorite
everyday Italian wine. Again any time I'm

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.489
having those stereotypical Italian foods that
have tomatoes or tomato sauce in them I drink

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.929
it. But it goes well with anything that's
not super protein heavy.
