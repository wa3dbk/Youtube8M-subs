"stupendous" Stupendous.  Here's what
I love about Pringles.....

made to take bites out of.....

you gotta put one in your mouth

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.790
Sometime I like to take like 3 and put
them into my mouth like that.....

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.820
every once in a while I like to take
quite a few like this and just....

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.480
