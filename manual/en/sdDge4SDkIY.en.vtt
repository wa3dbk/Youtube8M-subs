00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:24.310
Well, there's good news and bad news, as it
pertains to Turbo for the Wii U.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.060
The bad news is...this is another port that
doesn't actually do anything interesting with

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.359
the GamePad.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.829
And being a movie game, it's not even all
that good in the first place.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.809
The good news is...I mean, it's not as bad
as the DS version.

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.559
Then again, colonoscopy...isn't as bad as
the DS version.

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:53.340
So if you saw our review of the DS game, you're
probably expecting the worst from Turbo: Super

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.030
Stunt Squad for the Wii U.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.300
You're also a good person, for watching our
reviews.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.000
Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.789
Especially when the games are as godawful
as Turbo was on the DS.

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:10.850
Fortunately, it's a whole different game on
the Wii U.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.450
So once again, you get to play as five snails
from the movie.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.921
Only this time, there's actually a functional
video game to play them in.

00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:23.290
Now, it doesn't take the obvious path and
just go for a kart-style racing game.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.990
The console version borrows less from Mario
Kart than Tony Hawk.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.310
Turbo is basically a skateboarding game on
the Wii U.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.479
Only...with, like...trade the skateboards
for snails.

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:43.119
Wait, that's actually kind of a brilliant
idea.

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.119
So it works like this.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.990
Each level is basically set up like a skate
park.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.920
There are ramps, jumps, rails, all the stuff
you'd expect from the old Tony Hawk games.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.290
They also have a bunch of different objectives.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.049
Pulling off point combos, collecting power-ups,
making a certain jump, things like that.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.009
So you actually have to play them several
times to accomplish all the objectives, which

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.259
unlocks more courses.

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.010
And you know, I really do like the concept.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.760
I mean, the racing game would've been obvious,
so at the very least...doing this kind of

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.930
game shows some creativity.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.940
But the thing is...the gameplay seems to be
at odds with the genre.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.980
Which is to say...it plays more like a racing
game trying to be a Tony Hawk game.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.590
And not quite pulling it off.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.590
So what does that mean?

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.440
Well, the snails control like they're in a
racing game.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.760
It's like they only want to move forward,
so turning is a bit tough.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.720
And in a game predicated on turning and freedom
of movement...that's kind of an issue.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.400
It doesn't ruin the game or anything.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.280
But it does make navigating the courses really
difficult at times.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.840
That also means it can be tough to pull off
tricks.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.370
You're going to miss jumps, slam yourself
into walls...the controls just aren't ideal.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.430
And another problem is that...your snails
don't seem to know many tricks.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.870
You just keep doing the same ones, which obviously
gets boring pretty quickly.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.819
The game doesn't offer much in terms of variety
or content, either.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.440
The objectives are generally the same kind
of thing, and with only six courses, it doesn't

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.850
feel like there's a lot to do.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.800
I mean, there is two-player co-op, which is
always nice.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.630
And you can design your own co-op courses,
but...it's really just a matter of picking

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.220
a few obstacles.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.569
Still, this version of Turbo is at least functional,
and coherent.

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.951
It's not great, but it's an okay movie tie-in.

00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:37.590
Or at least, as okay as an okay movie tie-in
gets.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.489
And really, that's a huge step up from the
DS version.

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.849
For younger gamers who really dig Turbo, you
can buy them this game without feeling completely

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.170
awful about it.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:59.530
And for a game like this, that's all you can
really ask for.
