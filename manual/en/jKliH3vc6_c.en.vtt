00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.429
Hi guys!

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:16.920
I'm Laura Vitale.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.119
On this episode of 'Laura In The Kitchen'
I am going to show you how to make Angle Food

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.119
Cake.

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.369
It is absolutely delicious; it is relatively
simple to make.

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.050
It is really easy, and I am going to show
you exactly how to do it.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.399
The first thing you need to do is go over
the ingredients so that we can get started.

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:36.430
You are going to need some cake flour, egg
whites, regular granulated sugar, vanilla

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.850
extract, almond extract, cream of tartar,
and salt.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.290
Those are your ingredients.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.170
Angel Food Cake is great; there is no butter
in it, there is no oil in it, there is very

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.990
little flour in it, and it is made with egg
whites, so it is kind of 'figure friendly'.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.830
There is sugar in it, but you can't win them
all, can you?!

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.760
So, before we get started, let me give you
a few pointers on Angel Food Cake, because

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.420
I do know that a lot of people that have been
e-mailing me requesting the recipe, have been

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.840
telling me that they feel intimidated about
making Angel Food Cake.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.030
There's a few steps, a few things that you
need to know before you start.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.009
The first thing you need to do, of course,
get your oven preheated, but that's like always.

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.409
But, the key things to this is, if you are
going to make it in a standing mixer, like

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.710
I am doing it, you want to make sure that
your bowl, and your whisk is really, really,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.630
clean; there's to be no residue of anything
in there, because otherwise, the egg whites

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.360
will not get that beautiful, glossy color.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.610
Second thing is you must use cake flour.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.840
It's much, much finer than regular all purpose
flour, giving you that light, soft, airy inside,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.350
that makes the Angel Food Cake so special.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.710
The second thing is that you need to have
egg whites, and make sure that when you are

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.360
separating your egg whites that no yolks go
into your egg whites; otherwise, they are

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.630
not going to get nice and stiff peaks, and
beautiful like they should.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.270
And third thing is you have to have an angel
food pan, like so, and it cannot be greased.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.090
This is nonstick, you want nonstick, but you
do not want to grease it at all.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.619
You don't want any grease in this recipe,
whatsoever.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.250
Okay, now that the oven is preheated, let's
get started.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.329
The first thing we need to do is sift the
flour.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.780
Now, you guys already know that I am not a
big fan of sifting, just because it takes

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.720
time, but this time, you need to sift, and
you don't only have to sift once, but you

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.269
have to sift this three times.

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:21.439
You want to make sure that this is lump-free
and by sifting, it gets nice and airy and

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.680
just delicious, and gives you that perfect,
perfect consistency.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.439
So all I am going to do is sift this three
times, going from this bowl, to this bowl,

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.409
to this bowl.

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:32.700
See those little lumps there?

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.849
You don't want any of those.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.389
So now I am going to do exactly the same thing,
and sift it to this bowl.

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:41.389
Last time to sift.

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:42.389
Perfect.

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.569
Now, I am going to set this aside.

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.809
Another really key point to this is that your
egg whites must be at room temperature.

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:55.449
Now, it is much easier to separate your eggs
when they are cold, so separate the eggs from

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:56.760
the whites and the yolks, put the yolks into
the refrigerator.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.900
It makes for a fantastic ice cream.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.680
You can make custard with it.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.680
Don't throw them away.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.379
But, keep the egg whites at room temperature
for about a half an hour, and now I am just

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.249
going to put these into my mixer, along with
the cream of tartar, and the salt.

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:16.620
And, the cream of tartar stabilizes the egg
whites, and makes them kind of hold their

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.239
shape better, so all I am going to do is mix
this until it is nice and frothy.

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.340
Now that my egg whites are nice and frothy,
I am going to start adding in my sugar, one

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.389
tablespoon at a time.

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:34.169
I am going to add in my vanilla, and my almond
extract.

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:39.859
And now, I am just going to crank the speed
up to high.

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.049
That's a little too high.

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:49.059
And, let those whip up until the egg whites
become nice and stiff peaks, and glossy.

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:55.920
That looks exactly how I want it to look,
so now I am going to get rid of this, put

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.230
this in my sink, get my bowl, and now it is
time to fold in your cake flour.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.140
And, I am going to do this just a third at
a time, and just folding it like so.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.519
You don't want to deflate the egg whites;
that is why we do this by hand instead of

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.870
putting it in - instead of doing it with the
mixer running.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.100
That is good, just folded in the last of my
flour.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.590
Now I am just going to put this in my ungreased
tube pan.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.240
Just trying to get this to be as even as you
can manage.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.360
Make this as level as possible.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.360
That looks fabulous.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.000
Now you are going to take a butter knife,
and I just do little swirls, and this just

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.960
kind of gets the air bubbles out if there
are any.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.139
You don't want air bubbles.

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.910
So, that looks perfect.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.440
It looks like a big cloud; I guess that is
why they call it Angel Food Cake, right?

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.490
Now this is going to go into your preheated
oven, at 350F, for about forty to forty-five

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.490
minutes.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.050
You will see that the outside is like, light
brown, and cracked on top, and I will show

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.199
you what to do the minute it comes out of
the oven.

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:17.210
My Angel Food Cake was in the oven for forty
minutes, and it is exactly how it should look.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.990
Now this is extremely important.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.090
This cake has to cool upside down.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.240
It just has to, otherwise, it is going to
fall on itself, and become very heavy.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.002
And, you want to put the pan on something
that is going to hold it upside down, and

00:05:29.002 --> 00:05:31.620
I use a heat-proof wine bottle.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.370
It works every single time; just make sure
there is actually liquid in it that holds

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.120
it nice and steady, and this is going to cool
like this, for about an hour-and-a-half, or

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.889
until it is fully, fully, fully cooled, and
like I said, this step is crucial.

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.020
It has to happen.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.750
So, I am just going to set this aside, for
about an hour-and-a-half, and then I will

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.100
show you what it looks like once it is cooled.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:58.229
My Angel Food Cake is completely cooled, so
now I can take it off the bottle.

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:07.139
Take a knife; I am just going to run it, right
on the edge, the center, as well.

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:18.389
Now you just lift it out, and I just take
my knife, run it right along the bottom.

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:24.550
Dun Dun dah!!

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.889
Put it on a cake plate!

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.340
Ah, it's so beautiful!

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.270
Smells fantastic!

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.499
I just want to stare at it for just a second,
because it looks so beautiful.

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:37.819
Now we are going to go right into it, and
get a nice slice, but I am going to clean

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:38.819
up first.

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:42.110
Let's give this a slice.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.199
It's so soft.

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:48.979
Just cutting it is like - make sure you cut
it with a serrated knife so that you don't

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:50.020
damage it.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.610
Look at that, oh, that is beautiful!

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:01.060
Ah, take some berries, put that alongside
for a good contrast in colors and, of course,

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.060
taste.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.779
I just really want to give this cake a taste.

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:10.150
Ah, you can see it is so beautiful and light.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.169
It's delicious!

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:25.539
Mmmm, it is the softest, most fluffiest cake
you will ever put in your mouth.

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:26.669
It's so so good.

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:32.169
It's not heavy, at all, and this recipe is
totally fool proof if you just follow this

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:37.159
recipe, and follow the key steps I told you
about, you will have perfect Angel Food cake,

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:41.610
on your table, any time, whenever you are
ready, whenever you want it, whenever you

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.330
have company over, just you want to make yourself
some Angel Food Cake.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.330
You know what I am saying?!

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.949

Bye bye!
