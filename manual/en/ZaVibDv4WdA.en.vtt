00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.100
Now we are going to talk about using our legs.
Helping us shot, bending our knees and obviously

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.009
that is why we bend out knees. So we got that
good ready position and what it allows us

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:16.770
to do is coil our muscles so that if we do
decide to shoot, we can spring up and I will

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.410
get a nice jump shoot off. Depending on how
our defenders ability might be or how tall

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.530
they might be. They might be taller than what
we are. So it is important to be able to jump

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.080
well and we would get into all the ways that
you could increase your jumping ability in

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.730
another series. What we want to talk about
again is keeping our legs bent and what I

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:44.749
like to do and what I teach for position shoulder
width stance. Some people will completely

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:50.359
square up so if we are on the line here you
can see that both of my feet are in line with

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.690
each other on a parallel line. But what works
best for me and what I teach for most of my

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.190
kids is a little bit of a off stance. By that
I mean just having one foot a little bit further

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.160
back than the other one. It might be either
one for me it is either or. For most kids

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.830
it is either or, they do feel a little bit
more comfortable. More comfortable having

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:22.560
that off stagger sort of a position. Depending
if you are right or left handed and which

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.720
direction you are going on the court will
vary your stance but we want to use our legs

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:39.070
to really push off. To get a really nice rhythmic
shoot going a nice flow and it is important

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.590
to follow this condition with your legs. If
you have ever played an amount of basketball

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.510
or watched basketball you will, commontaters
always talking about oh you know their legs

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.370
are gone they got tired legs. Well your legs
are the first thing to go it really throws

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.270
off your shoot. So you have to be in shape
and in condition and use your leg effectively.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:10.950
So I will just give you a couple of shoots
right here. Okay so we are using our legs

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.200
to push up whether we are in the ready position
and we got to pull up the foot.
