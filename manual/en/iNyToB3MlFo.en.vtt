00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.600
NIGEL: Hello and welcome to a new Dota 2 Report!

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.150
It's a fresh new game and we are about to
meet some of the team members!

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.980
Let's see what heroes end up being picked

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.300
???: 'allo!

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.500
NIGEL: Oh hey. You're... Bristleback, aren't you?

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.899
BRISTLEBACK: That's me!

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:26.250
They call me Bristleback 'cuz I got bristles...

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.640
On me back!

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.770
NIGEL: Thank you for clearing that up for me.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.399
BRISTLEBACK: Now if you'll excuse me I've got a middle
lane to own.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.100
NIGEL: Oh, middle lane, huh? Well, see ya later.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.700
INVOKER: Invoker!

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.400
NIGEL: Whoa nice! I love the way you announced yourself
in third person.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.760
INVOKER: Thank you!

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.900
Now, I must choose the color of my floaty-sphere-balls.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.200
NIGEL: Wat.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.340
INVOKER: I have made my decision!

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.310
I have chosen pink because pink reminds me
of cotton candy...

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.910
Cotton candy is my favorite.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.920
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a middle
lane to own.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.079
NIGEL: Well I think somebody already w-

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:07.540
INVOKER: Wex wex wex!

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.170
NIGEL: I can already tell that we've got a roster
of intelligent, dedicated heroes.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.970
GYROCOPTER: I don't even know how I got here!

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.450
Who are you?

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.500
NIGEL: The name's Nigel

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.450
and I'm here to learn more about the wonderful
world of Dota.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.990
I'll be serving as your courier as well, and
I look forward to help-

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.590
GYROCOPTER: Now if you'll excuse me I've got a middle
lane to own!

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.320
NIGEL: Hey guys...

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.659
You see the rest of your team?

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.729
ENIGMA: Unfortunately, I did.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.310
RUBICK: Hey maybe they're not so bad! If we work together
we-

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.909
ENIGMA: I don't care how optimistic you are Rubick,
you have to admit that you're wrong this time.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.850
The middle lane belongs to me!

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.080
BRISTLEBACK: I was here first!

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.170
GYROCOPTER: I was here third!

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.310
INVOKER: Surrender the middle lane to me or I will
give food to the opposing team.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.220
BRISTLEBACK: That don't make no sense at all, mate.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.720
GYROCOPTER: I was here third!

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.700
RUBICK: Yeah...

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.900
ENIGMA: So I was thinking there could be one positive
about being on this team.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.060
RUBICK: What's that?

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.580
ENIGMA: At least they're not Pudge.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.560
Hey by the way are we gonna address the end
of the last game we were just playing?

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.900
NIGEL: No, I mean you guys had the barracks destroyed,
you were pretty much winning I'd say.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.000
Not much more to add to the um...

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.000
Story?

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.560
You're just gonna have to live with this and
carry on.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.500
ENIGMA: Eh, you tried.
