00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.580
So... this is the secret room in Ascension?

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:07.760
Awesome!

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.400
Interesting...

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.420
Do you guys see this teleporter?

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.480
It's german!

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.580
So what?

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.200
We are in Rusia!

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.860
Really? I thought we were on some german theatre just a minute ago...

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.580
...and all of a sudden we're in this russian...

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.780
...rocket place?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.400
Patience, my dear boy!

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.120
All will be explained very soon!

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.680
How about now!?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.060
You do know friendly-fire is off, right?

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.500
Well I'm not your friend!

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.660
Now you better tell me now why I can't remember anything...

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.700
Why you know more stuff than any of us...

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.060
And who the hell that demonic girl is!

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.140
I know you're busy and everything...

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.320
...but shut the f@$&amp; up and help me!

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.800
Dempsey, I seriously think we should talk later, or we'll die.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.400
I rather be dead than spending my entire life killing those freak-bags.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.660
Now you tell me!

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.440
Ok, ok!

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.540
It all started when Dr. Maxis and his daughter...

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.620
S#!%!

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.120
Not again!

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.580
Richtofen, american... it was an honor fighting with you.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.040
Oh fu...

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.680
Has anyone noticed we haven't rehearsed in, like, fifteen months?

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.900
Do you mind? We're watching TV!

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.720
(Sound from the TV)

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.660
Ha-ha! Gets me everytime!

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.180
Hey, guys!

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.160
Wow...

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.260
I guess the sugar wasn't sugar if you know what I mean.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.920
Well, that was a horrible dream.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.440
I was on a zombie apocalypse with an american, a german, and some chinese guy.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.100
I am japanese, you russian dog!

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.500
Damn it!

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.660
What the...? Where are we?

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.820
What is this, place?

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.260
Is this... the future?

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.740
This is wrong!

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.260
My entire plan ruined by the stupid Kassimir Mechanism!

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.060
I have found you!

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.080
She found us! We are doomed!

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.840
In moments like this, I miss my second wife.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.020
She always gave me vodka!

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.580
Perfect! Now we're in the future with a couple of teenagers watching TV!

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.920
Ok, people, it's been real nice meeting you, but you're starting to creep us out, so...!

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.600
Quick! Pick up your weapons and prepare to fight for your lives!

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.880
Let's play a game!

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.120
Another day, another dollar!

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.680
Bring it, scumbags!

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.300
Where did the kids go?

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.860
This Halloween night it's either live... or... DIE!

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.020
Tonight!

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.440
It's the night of the dead alive!

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.600
But Tank Dempsey and his gang...

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.560
...will kick their pale white ass!

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.320
Look, they are coming from the roof...

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.100
...they're coming from above!

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.380
They're hungry for some brains,
they don't have blood in their veins!

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.520
Because tonight is the night of the dead alive!

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.380
Because tonight to survive you'll have to come and fight!

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.680
Because tonight!

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.560
Is the night!

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.140
Of the dead alive!

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.180
I'll see you soon, Sam!

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.020
What?

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.780
Hey guys, look!

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.740
It's the Ray-Gun!

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.100
Get it?

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.400
Ray...

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.800
Gun...?

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.340
Ugh, screw you!

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.320
Hey listen.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.760
Sorry if I got a little harsh back in Ascension.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.620
Don't apologize Dempsey.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.780
It doesn't suit you.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.860
Yeah, I know.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.220
Guys, not trying to sound rude...

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.880
...but when are you leaving!?

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.340
Yeah, I'm asking myself the same thing!

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.620
We need a time machine to get out of here!

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.340
Do you know anybody that has something familiar?

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.460
Yeah, I have a time machine!

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.960
It was my last year's science project!

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.840
May I look at it?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.620
Hold on!

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.520
This will cost you some money, fellas!

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.060
Who do you think I am? Some stupid kid that just lets strange people take a look at his time machine, and...?

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.880
What? He talked too much!

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.580
I agree with you, Nikolai.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.240
Thanks, Takeo, but you still suck!

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.720
This might do the trick!

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.560
I don't know who you are baby, but you're the first chick I've seen in sixty years, so...

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.360
The machine is ready!

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.500
You complete me!

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.200
Hey, strange people from the past, uh... I think we need to talk.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.680
Thanks for the help, kids!

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.880
Too bad I'll kill your parents so you won't exist!

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.200
What did you just say!?

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.920
Oh, I'm just kidding! Ha-ha-ha!

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.340
Do you think this will create some sort of... alternative reality?

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.700
Don't be an idiot! Those things don't exist!

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.380
Don't... even... say it!

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.060
Game over!

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.180
Man, this day was boring.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.660
Just perfect!

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.680
We're in a dark room with no vodka!

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.720
This is bu...!
