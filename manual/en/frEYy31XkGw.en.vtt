00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.810
The 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup will be the 13th
edition of the CONCACAF Gold Cup competition

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.060
and 23rd CONCACAF regional championship overall
in CONCACAF's fifty years of existence.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.070
The champion of the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup
will qualify for a play-off match against

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.050
the United States, the champion of the 2013
CONCACAF Gold Cup, to decide which team will

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.189
represent CONCACAF in the 2017 FIFA Confederations
Cup.

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.460
The play-off will be played as a single game
in 2015 at a venue to be determined.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.650
If the United States wins the 2015 tournament,
they will qualify directly to the Confederations

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.860
Cup.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.430
In addition, the top four teams will qualify
for play-offs which will determine the final

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.870
two places of the 2016 Copa América Centenario.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.220
Participating nations
For the first time, the two overall fifth-placed

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.470
teams of the Caribbean zone and the Central
America zone will compete to qualify for the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.000
CONCACAF Gold Cup.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.030
Previously, five teams from Central America
and four from the Caribbean have qualified

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.850
for the Confederation's competition.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.960
Bold indicates that the corresponding team
was hosting the event.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.360
Gold Cup and Copa America
Mexico and possibly Jamaica, pending qualification

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.780
to 2015 Gold Cup through the 2014 Caribbean
Cup, will have representative teams at both

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.430
the 2015 Gold Cup and the 2015 Copa América
simultaneously.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.290
Mexico and Jamaica were invited to the South
American competition as a guest nation by

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.330
CONMEBOL.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.680
In March 2010, then CONCACAF general secretary
Chuck Blazer restricted Mexico and Costa Rica

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.870
with fielding an under-22 team in Copa America.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.570
An agreement was made with the Mexico Football
Federation that CONCACAF competitions will

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.080
remain top priority to play with their senior
team, in exchange CONCACAF gave permission

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.640
for the Mexican Football Federation to have
representatives in the CONMEBOL-organised

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.080
Copa Libertadores.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.670
However, CONCACAF has yet to decide which
team Mexico and Jamaica can take to 2015 Copa

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.050
America hoping to have the best representation
possible in the tournament.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.250
CONCACAF President Jeffrey Webb said he is
still considering the possibility that Mexico

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.610
can compete in the Copa America 2015 with
a team without age restriction The final of

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.380
the 2015 Copa America takes place July 4 2015,
three days before the comencement of 2015

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.170
Gold Cup creating the possibility of having
Mexico and Jamaica play with their same squads

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.520
back to back in both tournaments.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.360
However, because Mexico and Jamaica are not
official CONMEBOL members, FIFA will not require

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.770
clubs to release players for Copa America.
