Hi! This is Aaron Phillips with Expert Village
and this is choosing the right bike for you.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.940
Standing here with my friend the cyclecross
bike. Say it with me, cyclecross. This bike

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:20.910
is basically a hybrid or a cross between a
mountain bike and a road bike. The term cyclecross

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.810
originated when a bunch of European racers
wanted something to do during the off season

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.460
in the Fall when it was muddy, rainy, cold
and nasty in places like Belgium and France.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.490
Especially in Belgium, they got on their road
bikes, put on some fat tires and started screaming

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.820
around the race courses and called it cyclecross.
There is a lot of mud, lot of cold and lot

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.129
of fun. But what we did as just typical people
as an outgrowth of that sport, is this nice

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.521
little bike. Like I said it is a cross between
a mountain bike and a road bike. If you are

00:00:55.521 --> 00:01:02.329
buying one bike and want a performance edge,
you want to have some speed and also want

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.390
to be able to take on some light trails, this
is the bike for you. I am very fond of cyclecross

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.260
bike. They are very great. One of the distinctive
features of a cyclecross bike is at least

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.990
out of the shop, is they come with some pretty
heavy rubber. You've got a knobby tire here

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.720
with kind of an aggressive tread pattern,
got side knobs like you've got on a mountain

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.570
bike so that you can corner in mud and maybe
in snow and in dirt. So you've got that going

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:39.869
for you, that's nice. The fork like I said
is almost over built, it is very strong and

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:48.009
is all aluminum. It soaks up a little bit
of the impact from obstacles you are hitting,

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:55.119
little rocks and things like that but also
rolls very efficiently unlike suspension forks.

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.759
It is a very efficient to kind of dampen some
of the impact. It allows you pretty low gear

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.110
frame so that when you do go out on the trails,
you are able to kind of power up those hills

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.800
and hit the gas and the flats and take off.
So this is actually a mountain bike derailleur

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.099
on this cyclecross bike and it is fairly common
on cyclecross bikes. By the way, the leopard

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.319
skin saddle comes extra. You've got to pay
extra for that. I don't know how I came into

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.620
the saddle but here it is on this bike, leopard
skin. So I guess if I'm not as fast as a cheetah,

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.610
I just look like a dork. But that's the cyclecross
bike.
