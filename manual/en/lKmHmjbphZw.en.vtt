00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.140
[John Clarke] Well I think that a lot of the
things Fred Dagg did weren't jokes, umm, they

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:12.110
were to do with language and the way and the
pace with which things are expressed, and

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.900
only my own culture was ever going to understand
that.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.630
If I'd done Fred Dagg in England, I would
have to have done very much more jokey stuff,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.130
I'd have to have done much broader stuff.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.789
I couldn't have done anything terribly subtle.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.439
I mean I'm not arguing that there was a lot
of Fred Dagg that was infinitely subtle or

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.640
anything, but there were parts of the way
that the talk worked that would only have

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.550
been understood by New Zealand, and I didn't
have to do too much of it, because in all

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.760
of our heads the rest of it was sitting there.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.780
[Kiwi bloke -- actor's voice] I think I've
found a new calling in life - gumboot throwing.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.760
I knew I had to be good at something.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.460
Maybe I'll retire to Taihape to be a full-time
gumboot tosser.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.950
After a few warm-ups, I was handed a pair
of regulation size 8 men's gumboots.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.430
Like golf, this is all about timing.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.980
If you relax, make sure the boot is facing
forwards and release it with a fluid swing

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.780
of your arm, it will fly with the grace of
an eagle.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.570
I am proud to say that my best effort did
just that, sailing past the end of the lane

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.190
to about 28 metres.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.270
[Narrator] Before the 1970s, New Zealanders
tended to be entertained by imported English

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.610
humour.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.619
Then television took hold and American sitcoms
became popular.

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.630
But on a serious weekly television show about
farming called Country Calendar, which is

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.380
still going, a mysterious farmer called Fred
Dagg, appeared.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.130
Wearing a black shearer's singlet, baggy khaki
shorts and gumboots, Fred had a laconic delivery

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.380
and an unmistakable New Zealand accent.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.259
The creation of comedian John Clarke, Fred
Dagg delighted in lampooning rural New Zealand.

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.979
And many of his jokes were at the expense
of Taihape.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.700
Fred Dagg would refer to his time at Taihape's
Gumboot University and labelled the town 'the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.380
gumboot capital of the world'.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.979
A gumboot is the Kiwi term for a pair of rubber
Wellington boots.

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.020
Most New Zealand farmers wear black gumboots
on the farm as they are ideal footwear in

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.840
mud and water.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.040
Though by the 1970s most New Zealanders lived
in cities, Kiwis loved Fred Dagg.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.650
He was the first New Zealand comic to really
use rural life as the wellspring of his humour.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.010
Fred performed on television, and released
records including 'Where would you be without

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.400
your gumboots' and 'We don't know how lucky
we are.'

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.540
Yet before long Fred Dagg disappeared.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.900
John Clarke moved to Australia where he established
a highly successful career as a satirist,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.640
scriptwriter and performer.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.380
And the rural way of life that Fred Dagg portrayed
so amusingly also disappeared.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.420
During the mid 1980s, the Labour government
slashed agricultural subsidies.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.700
Faced with the withdrawal of taxpayer funding,
farmers stopped spending.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.390
This impacted on rural towns that depended
on farmers' chequebooks to survive.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.130
Taihape, a rural service centre, suffered
more than most.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.099
At the same time, the government cut spending
on New Zealand Railways, the other main contributor

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.910
to Taihape's economy.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.060
Thousands of jobs vanished throughout the
country, lines closed and services were reduced.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.840
Taihape, situated on the main trunk line,
faced an uncertain future.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:36.980
The town's population of 3,500 in the 1960s
almost halved to around 1,800 in 1985.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.280
Faced with this crisis, concerned citizens
gathered to brainstorm a solution.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.860
They decided that their town needed a new
identity.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.430
It didn't take them long to realise that Fred
Dagg might have the answer.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.440
Taihape branded itself 'the gumboot capital
of the world', and celebrated with Gumboot

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.440
Day.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.760
Held on Easter Tuesday 1985, the first Gumboot
Day included gumboot-throwing contests, Fred

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.409
Dagg lookalike competitions and gumboot decorating.

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.190
Its success encouraged the organisers to make
it an annual fixture.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.950
The current record for gumboot throwing stands
at just under 37 metres for men and nearly

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.100
25 metres for women.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.870
This is well short of the world record set
in 1996 in Finland by Teppo Luoma, who hurled

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.490
a boot nearly 64 metres.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.300
Taihape has now recovered from the dark days
of the 1980s.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.020
As motorists approach Taihape from the north,
they are greeted by a large corrugated iron

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.850
sculpture of a gumboot, the work of renowned
artist, Jeff Thomson.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.380
Though the rail service is greatly reduced,
motorists frequently stop for a coffee or

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.460
meal at one of the cafes that have sprung
up in the town.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.960
And Gumboot Day continues to attract visitors
from New Zealand and overseas.
