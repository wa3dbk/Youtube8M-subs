Hi

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.000
As I promised I'll show you the basics of two handed tapping on the base of " Hit the road Jack"

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.000
First one must to supress strings

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
because left hand's job is not only playing notes but also supressing unplayed strings

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.000
To supress strings you need to put the first finger on strings not pressing them

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
If you put and press between frets

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.000
the string will ring, that's what we don't need so just put finger slightly

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It's time to start to play the note ,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
in our song it is C - 3rd fret on A string

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Hit the note near the fret, not on the fret

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.010
Hiting near the fret sound will be full and rich

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:22.010
You must remember to also supress the other strings with this finger at the same time

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Now we'll add rest of notes of the song

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Rememmber to supress unplayed strings

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
The right hand we'll play 2 notes

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.000
we will create accompaniment

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Remember to hit the notes near the frets

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.000
The first finger of left hand keeps supressing strings 


00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.000
The important thing is also that the right hand's finger

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
shold be perpedicular to the neck as possible as not to supress the other strings

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
You shouldn't hit with bent fingers as they supress other strings

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.000
but if we play accompaniment using those strings they won't be heard

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:35.000
That's why it's necessary to put fingers perpedicular from the very beginning

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
To make sure the left hand makes good supress let's do an exercise

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
We're gonna be playing accompaniment by left hand ,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and right hand will hit the supressed strings

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
That's all for today

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.800
Next time I'll show you how to play the theme

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
BYE
