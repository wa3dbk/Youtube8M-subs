Hi I am milkyfawn and heard you like unboxing videos, so

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.750
here is another unboxing video. Recently I decided to join bloodbath

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.570
that was the angelic pretty website for loyal rosette release. I managed to get

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.160
JSK, the headbow and the socks and I skipped out on the beret because somebody got it

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.240
before me. So if you have that beret, I will

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.130
find you and I will get that beret or alternatively you can give me your Paypal

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.199
and I can send you the money and you can send me the beret but yeah

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.000
let's start

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I am partly really excited

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.000
um

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
omg, I got an Angelic Pretty

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.000
bag

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.070
but in all seriousness

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.929
here is my invoice. I spent too much money

00:00:54.929 --> 00:01:00.729
and my care instructions, so I know how to clean my clothes

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.170
here is

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.920
the not beret. It's nice, but it is not the beret

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.939
I really like the material that's used

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.159
Oh, it has got wire! Oh, cool

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.490
it's pretty cool...socks

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.819
I decided to get the socks as well

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.959
to make my friends jealous

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:32.700
I got the sticker

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.030
I am going to put it on my laptop, now I will have two!

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.030
So, here is the dress

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.990
I got the navy colourway because I noticed it had a different emblem on the front

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.380
but also I only have one other navy dress, so I thought it might be better

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.000
that get another one...whatever

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.580
So, this is the dress in all its glory

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.930
I like the ribbon panel and I really like
the military style

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.390
of it as well and flower and I like this

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.400
cause it reminds of Cruella de Vil and 101 dalmations

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.150
so that's pretty cool. So the back is half-shirred

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.420
it doesn't seem to have a zip so that
might mean that it has

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.740
Two pockets!

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.900
It's got 2! The only reason why I wanted this dress was because it

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.270
came with the beret and I didn't get the beret

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.550
Compared to Holy Night Story

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.640
it's definitely not as thick and it's kind of like in between

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.019
so maybe like an autumn kind of fabric

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.510
so I reckon it will keep me warm but not too warm that I am gonna die

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.000
in the heat

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.690
Oh, the waist ties are the same as

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.000
all the ribbon detailing

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.090
That's nice! Nice one, AP!

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.320
I also really like how they are working with

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.700
emblems again. I like this one! No, I like this one

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.800
royal pony club, best in speacialty show

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.840
ok, what is this one saying

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.930
Clavem ad ostium

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.030
Somnium

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.950
I think that means super kawaii in
Japanese

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.980
So now I have tried my dress on and I actually like it a bit better

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.950
now that it is worn than when I was just holding it. When I first put it on,

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.000
the bow was a little bit awkward because there is wire in it

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.230
and you have to shape it and fix it from when it came in the mail

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.370
I have got the ivory socks and I put some gold tea parties to highlight all the

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.140
gold accents in the dress and it matches my innocent world jacket

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.230
really well, which is cool. And I put the beret on with my bow

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.280
as the kinda substitute. It is working, I like it

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.120
Thanks for watching and if
you like this video

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.450
I am more than happy to make more because I buy enough, so yeah

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.190
get out of my house

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.060
 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.310
