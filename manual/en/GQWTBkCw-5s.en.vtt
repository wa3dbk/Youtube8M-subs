00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:10.686
&gt;&gt;Woman: Last time we came here,
we were looking at the shapes,

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.546
edges, and the veins of leaves.

00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:18.726
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Vanderburg Elementary
School, students visit this lush,

00:00:18.906 --> 00:00:21.676
tropical rainforest
throughout the school day.

00:00:21.796 --> 00:00:24.766
&gt;&gt;Woman: What is special
about this leaf that is going

00:00:24.806 --> 00:00:26.446
to help it live in the understory?

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:30.966
&gt;&gt;There's just a little bit of
light that will help it survive.

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:34.656
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The rainforest
biosphere is a living learning lab,

00:00:34.936 --> 00:00:38.316
a controlled environment full
of tropical plants and animals

00:00:38.676 --> 00:00:41.036
that students study
and help care for.

00:00:41.396 --> 00:00:42.466
&gt;&gt;Woman: Look at the structure, guys.

00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:43.376
Look at this leaf.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.596
Is this the kind of leaf
that we looked at yesterday?

00:00:45.996 --> 00:00:49.636
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's a million-dollar
oasis designed with student input,

00:00:49.886 --> 00:00:52.776
built and paid for by
community volunteers.

00:00:52.916 --> 00:00:56.476
&gt;&gt;Carolyn: What it took was the
creative minds of many people

00:00:56.476 --> 00:01:01.536
and also getting the
community involved.

00:01:01.646 --> 00:01:04.216
It was not funded by
our school district.

00:01:04.596 --> 00:01:09.306
We were able to get people to
believe in our vision in order

00:01:09.306 --> 00:01:12.236
to make this become a reality,
so what we did, in fact,

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:15.266
we created a rainforest
here in the desert

00:01:15.696 --> 00:01:20.136
so that children can
compare the rainforest biome

00:01:20.376 --> 00:01:21.406
with the desert biome.

00:01:21.756 --> 00:01:25.536
&gt;&gt;Woman: What layer of the rainforest
do we call that really high up?

00:01:26.176 --> 00:01:27.376
&gt;&gt;The canopy?

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:30.856
&gt;&gt;Lisa: We have been working for a
year now on developing curriculum

00:01:30.926 --> 00:01:34.466
for students and teachers
to bring their classes here

00:01:34.816 --> 00:01:37.496
and do lessons within our biosphere.

00:01:37.986 --> 00:01:40.646
Every grade level has
designated a theme

00:01:40.836 --> 00:01:42.216
that runs through the rainforest.

00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:45.816
For example, third grade is teaching
about the peoples of the rainforest,

00:01:45.896 --> 00:01:48.656
and they come in here
and they can do science

00:01:48.746 --> 00:01:50.716
or they can do anything
within the curriculum.

00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:53.146
&gt;&gt;Woman: So now, does anybody
know what an artifact might be?

00:01:53.636 --> 00:01:54.826
&gt;&gt;Student: An artifact is something

00:01:54.826 --> 00:01:56.936
from long ago that
people used to use.

00:01:57.746 --> 00:01:58.826
&gt;&gt;Lisa: Within this environment,

00:01:58.826 --> 00:02:00.616
they're learning how
everything is connected.

00:02:00.616 --> 00:02:02.006
It's not just plants and animals.

00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:04.946
It's how people are interacting with
the plants and animals and the types

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:07.886
of effects that we have
on the environment.

00:02:08.516 --> 00:02:11.516
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The biosphere has
become a field-trip destination

00:02:11.516 --> 00:02:15.716
for other Las Vegas schools, and
that gives Vanderburg fifth-graders a

00:02:15.716 --> 00:02:17.866
chance to act as docents
for the visitors.

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:22.216
&gt;&gt;We're going to go to Rainforests
of the World, Central America,

00:02:22.216 --> 00:02:24.636
to learn more about Guatemala.

00:02:24.636 --> 00:02:27.126
&gt;&gt;This one here is the
open-pit copper mine.

00:02:27.656 --> 00:02:31.416
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Another top field-trip
destination is McCaw Elementary

00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:35.316
School, where visitors can
explore a replica of a silver mine.

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:36.606
&gt;&gt;Man: Howdy, boys and girls.

00:02:36.606 --> 00:02:40.846
Welcome to McCaw School of Mines.

00:02:40.846 --> 00:02:44.226
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Tours in the School of
Mines address curriculum standards

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:45.876
in history and earth science.

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:49.326
&gt;&gt;It has all these
levels called steps.

00:02:49.726 --> 00:02:53.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And in hands-on
activities like panning for gold...

00:02:53.316 --> 00:02:55.586
&gt;&gt;Man: Pick up the pan with
the ripples away from you.

00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:58.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...McCaw students teach
visitors about the science of mining.

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:03.586
&gt;&gt;Over here are some little drills.

00:03:03.906 --> 00:03:09.156
&gt;&gt;Cheyann: It's very interesting
that I get to talk to kids and I get

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:14.086
to teach them what they want to
learn, and they are always looking

00:03:14.086 --> 00:03:17.156
at it and talking about it
and saying how cool it is.

00:03:18.216 --> 00:03:20.226
&gt;&gt;Man: This is a model of our mine.

00:03:20.286 --> 00:03:22.196
You can see a chute going up.

00:03:22.356 --> 00:03:25.626
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Community volunteers
built and financed the School

00:03:25.626 --> 00:03:30.266
of Mines, and local architect Bill
Snyder volunteered to design it.

00:03:30.486 --> 00:03:32.836
&gt;&gt;Snyder: So we went to
Disneyland and we went

00:03:32.836 --> 00:03:36.556
to the Indiana Jones ride, where they
created the illusion of taking people

00:03:36.556 --> 00:03:40.156
down underground and
into a cave situation.

00:03:40.676 --> 00:03:43.786
So we sort of figured
out with the resources

00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:45.346
that we had what we could do.

00:03:45.536 --> 00:03:48.066
And it's kind of funny,
because the company

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:52.636
that built the Indiana Jones ride
actually did the work here for us

00:03:52.636 --> 00:03:54.886
as well, and what we did
to get them to do that,

00:03:54.886 --> 00:03:58.026
we had several kids help us
write pleading letters to them,

00:03:58.426 --> 00:04:01.546
and we took the model that we built
of this and we set it in their lobby

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:04.276
for about a month before they
said, "Okay, we surrender.

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:04.976
How can we help?"

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:10.546
[Bell rings]

00:04:11.046 --> 00:04:13.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Local volunteers
also help out as docents.

00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:16.566
&gt;&gt;Dorothy: Right now, I
have about 35 volunteers,

00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:18.816
and most of them are retired.

00:04:19.136 --> 00:04:22.396
Many of them are in their
late 70s or early 80s

00:04:22.486 --> 00:04:24.676
and they love interacting
with the kids.

00:04:25.136 --> 00:04:27.606
And it's amazing how
they bond with them.

00:04:27.606 --> 00:04:29.016
It's a fun thing, and
it keeps us young.

00:04:29.016 --> 00:04:31.646
&gt;&gt;Man: Somebody has got to
put it here with the hard hat

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:33.856
and pick up all the loose stuff.

00:04:33.996 --> 00:04:37.446
&gt;&gt;James: I like kids, and I try to
make it interesting for the kids.

00:04:38.496 --> 00:04:40.416
And anything that will make
it interesting for the kids,

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:44.666
learn for the kids, learn
about Nevada, I'm for it.

00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:45.696
&gt;&gt;It looks good.

00:04:46.076 --> 00:04:48.076
[ All laugh ]

00:04:48.136 --> 00:04:51.226
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The Mine School
and the biosphere are examples

00:04:51.226 --> 00:04:54.186
of what can happen when
community members, teachers,

00:04:54.186 --> 00:04:58.096
and students come together
to invent new ways to learn.

00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:05.026
&gt;&gt;Carolyn: This is unique, and it is
truly thinking outside of the box,

00:05:05.026 --> 00:05:09.356
moving beyond the status quo,
and doing something for children

00:05:09.356 --> 00:05:12.036
to truly get them excited and turned

00:05:12.036 --> 00:05:15.256
on about education
and about learning.

00:05:15.426 --> 00:05:19.176
&gt;&gt;Lisa: So what's the part underneath
the canopy of the rainforest?

00:05:19.646 --> 00:05:20.856
What's it like?

00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:23.016
&gt;&gt;It has some light, but not much.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:24.076
&gt;&gt;Lisa: That's right.

00:05:25.176 --> 00:05:27.236
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For more
information on what works

00:05:27.236 --> 00:05:31.176
