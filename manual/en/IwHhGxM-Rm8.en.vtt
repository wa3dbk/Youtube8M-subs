00:00:05.454 --> 00:00:07.206
[SHIN FLICK TIPS]

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:10.300
[SIT DOWN SCISSOR KICK]

00:01:01.283 --> 00:01:04.035
My, name is Mike Delaney; I'm a football choreographer.

00:01:04.035 --> 00:01:07.684
Today I am going to go over some of the moves you can do with the shins.

00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:12.216
So some freestylers, a lot of freestylers nowadays do tricks using the shins.

00:01:12.216 --> 00:01:19.517
Basic way is to try and get a good contact, bringing the foot quite high, bringing the leg high, a bit like with the toe kick ups.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:25.601
So you can see I am trying to get a good contact, so the leg has got to come up to there. 

00:01:33.047 --> 00:01:39.859
I know that some freestylers like to try and do both legs, so it's not easy but you are trying to get both legs quite high.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.568
You can do a few. Another one that I do, kicking around. I canâ€™t always do it in my routine because it is a high risk one.

00:01:49.568 --> 00:01:55.917
It is where you flick the ball off the shin on to the foot and the ball comes up. 

00:01:55.917 --> 00:01:58.385
So if I show you that one.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:12.267
If I put a little bit of spin it helps me. You can see there is a little bit of spin away and I try to get those two touches. 

00:02:13.787 --> 00:02:20.041
So there is different ways there of using the shins, like with any of the freestyle moves they just need lots of practice. 

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:24.191
Once you have mastered those it might be possible to get it in to a little routine.
