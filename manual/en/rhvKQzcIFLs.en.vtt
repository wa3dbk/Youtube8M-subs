00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.500
I want to turn our attention
to another big announcement

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.740
that we're making today, and
it involves family plans.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.620
And family plans are probably the
most popular phenomenon, the biggest

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.960
phenomenon in the history of wireless.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.570
They're a big deal
and for a good reason.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.720
They give a really important
and valuable discount

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.359
when families come together, pool
their lines, and get a big discount.

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:32.650
Take Simple Choice for example.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.960
Second lines are only $30--

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.970
unlimited talks, text, and web.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.860
Each additional line are just $10.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.730
It's been hugely popular.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.160
But here's the issue.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.330
In this industry, a group of
people has been left behind.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.530
Nearly one third of
families are boxed out

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.650
of this most popular phenomenon
in the history of wireless.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.140
Why?

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.220
Credit.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.630
One third of US families don't
qualify for this important discount,

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.330
and it is important.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.209
Think about it.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.800
These are the very
families who probably could

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.110
benefit from these discounts the most.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.400
It's not right.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.860
We're ending it all on
Sunday with the introduction

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.830
of Simple Choice for all families.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.600
It's no contract family plans and, for
the first time among the major carriers

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.000
for family plans, no credit checks.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.660
And this is an incredible deal.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.840
Four lines, unlimited talk,
text, and web for $100.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.110
Each line comes with its
own bucket of 500 megs

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.070
of high speed 4G LTE
data where available.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.920
Simply pay an amount equal
to one month's service.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.690
For four lines, that'd be $100 and
you're out the door and good to go.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.550
That's $100 a month in savings
versus comparable plans from AT&amp;T

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.810
without a credit check.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.390
$100 a month.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.660
That's $2,400 over two years.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.650
This is savings that an entire
segment of the population

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.410
has been totally left out of, and we're
delighted to be the only major carrier

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.340
to offer family plans without
contracts, without credit checks.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.600
It's that simple, and that really is
what the "un-carrier" is all about--

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.610
big breakthroughs that address
the pain points in this industry.
