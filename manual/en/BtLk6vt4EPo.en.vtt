Fixing Bubbles and Wrinkles

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.980
As we install vinyl, all of us get the
odd bubble and wrinkle.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.360
But here are some techniques to make your bubbles and wrinkles go away.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.720
First let's talk about how not to get bubbles and wrinkles in the first place.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.220
To start, I'm holding the vinyl loosely in my hands letting it find the curve of the vehicle.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.860
With firm pressure and the correct angle on your squeegee you can easily install the

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.620
vinyl all the way to the bottom of the
panel.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.420
Sometimes the vinyl touches the vehicle

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.760
before your squeegee places it
there which results in bubbles.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.280
Here we have a really long bubble and here we have something that could turn into a wrinkle.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.660
And here as well.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.660
Let's get started with the long bubble.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.520
Ideally you would like the bubble to be this size because if it were you could just touch

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.540
it and it would disappear due to the
air-egress pattern in the adhesive.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.320
When you have a long bubble like this, simply divide it up into smaller bubbles.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.759
Then, when all you have are smaller bubbles, simply place your finger or thumb on

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.040
each one and they will completely
flatten out

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.880
if you have a potential wrinkle like
this, start working it with the Teflon squeegee.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.840
Work the wrinkle back in the direction it came from.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.350
You can see that as soon as you get
closer to its origin the wrinkle

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.560
develops two corners. As you continue, cut each corner off at a 45-degree angle

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.740
until you work it back to the edge of
the application.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.680
Seal the edge and the wrinkle is undetectable.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.520
Sometimes we may drop the vinyl onto the vehicle and create a field of small

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.840
bubbles that don't have a large volume
of air. It could take some time to push

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.360
them all out one at a time.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.700
In this case, use the felt side of a wet edge squeegee

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.360
to firmly install a line straight
through them

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.060
Here we have a high-pressure bubble and
the vinyl is standing off the vehicle quite a bit.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.680
It also has a potential wrinkle at one end.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.580
This one has the same wrinkle and a higher pressure profile.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.440
first fix the largest bubble.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.960
We need it to be round.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.980
Start with the end of the wrinkle and follow it all the way

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.760
back to the bubble, cutting the corners at 45 degrees.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.600
Now, reshape the bubble into a circle.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.560
Repeat the steps of removing the wrinkle
first and then making the bubble round.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.140
We have a fair-sized bubble here, too.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.140
I suggest dividing it first before flattening it.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.640
Always remember to round the corners.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.140
We'll start with this one, because it has the greatest amount of pressure.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.080
Place your finger over the center of the
bubble and apply direct force to the bubble.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.480
High-pressure bubbles will leave
a ring of air around the edge.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.000
Treat it like a wrinkle with your Teflon squeegee, and it will lay down perfectly

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.680
Here is another high-pressure bubble.
Start in the center and if smaller

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.900
bubbles materialize, treat them as separate bubbles

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.780
and they will all completely dissipate.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.160
Finally, flatten the last small bubble in
exactly the same way.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.860
With these simple techniques your applications will be bubble and wrinkle free.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.040
