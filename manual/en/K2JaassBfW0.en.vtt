Hello everyone, this is Emily Frances.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.230
Welcome to How to MomTV.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.710
So you’re home with your newborn baby.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.510
They’re so little and fragile, it’s natural
to get nervous when it comes to giving your

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.510
baby a bath.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.730
Board Certified New York City Lactation Consultant
Andrea Syms Brown and her husband Peter have

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.330
been teaching Infant Care Workshops for a
decade.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:32.780
The essentials before you get started is a
washcloth and a baby towel.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.191
And make sure to scrub and rinse your sink,
bathtub or baby bathtub with dish soap twice

00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:44.010
before using it.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.859
And make sure to clean your baby’s gushy
before you put the in the bath and use a soap

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:52.649
product that both mom and dad have tried first.

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.020

Care Experts)

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.090
The bathtub should be filled with water only
to a shallow depth.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:09.400
When I say shallow I mean this, place fingers
into base of tub, water should not cross into

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.920
your palm.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.860
You want to test it by putting elbow, forearm
and fingertips in water.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.240
It should be so nice and hot, mom that you
wanna climb in and take your own bath.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.470
The reason I say mom because Mom likes the
temperature warmer than we do guys and babies

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.150
tend to like temperature that mom likes for
a bath.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:47.700
Grab a washcloth, dip it in water, soak and
lay a wet washcloth on baby’s chest and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.460
this keeps them warm throughout the bath.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.920
Every so often splash water on this to keep
them nice and warm.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.650
Use your hand to scoop up water and thoroughly
wet the baby’s hair dont use a cup because

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.660
if you slip, you can overwhelm baby w cupful
of water.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:15.440
Now that hair is wet, take 1 pump of liquid
soap and wash baby’s hair with it.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.440
Now baby’s hair washed, rinse hair thoroughly
and soapy water now in tub is all need for

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.440
rest of the bath.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.280
All you’re doing is massaging baby with
hands in all areas you need to clean, between

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.870
toes, extremities, to get to back and diaper
area shift weight to other arm.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:39.560
Mom you will show dad how to be gentle w girl
parts all cleaning on outside, and dad can

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.600
show mom how spread fingers gently around
testicles, not poke too hard.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.170
You clean the back and that’s pretty much
it.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.980
For newborns you don’t want to belabor the
length of the bath.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.180
((HOST EMILY FRANCES))
Andrea and Peter suggest giving your newborn

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.950
a sponge bath for the first 2 weeks of life
until their umbilical stump falls off.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.290
It’s a whole different process.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.010
We’ll show you how to do a proper sponge
bath in another video so stay tuned.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.040
