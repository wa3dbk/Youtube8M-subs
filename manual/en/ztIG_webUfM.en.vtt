00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It’s called the all rounder, made by Bosch,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
absolutely awesome tool, it’s an oscillating cutter

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What it does, it’s a problem solver really, 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.240
it does loads and loads of different jobs around the house.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.480
It’s the sort of thing you buy, you’d 
 use and then you’d use it 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
again and again and again and again for loads 
 and loads of different types of things.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.200
Bosch’s thesis behind this was that you could start a job

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.840
with this tool and finish a job with this tool.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.760
The first bit it actually comes with is this 
 flush cut blade type of applications 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.120
you can use this for is for cutting the 
 bottom off of architrave to actually 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.760
fit laminate flooring underneath. 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.880
Any flush cutting the blade can turn to face any direction.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.280
So as you can see as I turn 
 this upside down there’s a little 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.080
Allen key you just undo that very slightly, 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.320
you lift and then you can turn that blade actually around. 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.040
Well I’m laying some laminate flooring here, that’s what I want to do, 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.040
I want to fit my laminate floor actually in 
 underneath my architrave rather than cut it round

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.400
round the architrave which is obviously gonna to 
 be a lot lot more awkward. 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.880
The all rounder makes it a lot lot easier to do. 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600
I’ve taken the piece of laminate floor. I’ve turned it upside down cause 
 we don’t want to damage the top of the laminate floor.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200
Because this is a flush cutter it will sit just flat on top 
 of the laminate like so, it will cut into the timber,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.680
if there are any marks they which will be very very 
 minor they will be on the bottom of the laminate,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
once you flip it over obviously you’ve got shiny side up, it doesn’t matter.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.360
And then we can turn that laminate back over so we’ve got our side 
 and we can actually fit the laminate as you can see that underneath.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.560
Also as well you get this which is 
 what they call a plunge cut blade,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.040
semi flexible so it does move, for cutting wood, 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.560
and that you can maybe plunge out a worktop maybe to fit 
 taps in onto a work to, things like that. 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.640
When you’re bored with it like that you can then 
 double up and use it as a sander. 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.960
Cause you’ve got that oscillation that between 2 and 3 degree oscillation

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.680
no matter what area of what way you twist it it’s always cutting, 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.080
you can even cut on the very very slightest of edges so 
 it doesn’t make any difference what direction your going in, 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.800
you can use it as a saw, you sit it flat so it 
 just then cuts into it on its own, it’s really versatile.
