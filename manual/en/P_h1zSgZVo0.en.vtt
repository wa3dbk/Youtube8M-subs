00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.850
Hi guys!

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.040
It's Weylie, and I'm here with Sophia, aka
Fashionista804.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.309
We're gonna challenge ourselves a little bit
and we are actually sharing the five products

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:14.309
we have.

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.010
And we have these random tools that have nothing
to do with what we're doing.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.570
But we're going to try and make it work.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.570
Okay, you ready?

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.570
Start, let's go!

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.570
Use a different product!

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.580
Why don't you use a different product?

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.750
Because I got it first!

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.570
You look so good!

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.570
Eyeliner...

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.819
You need blended foundation.

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:42.600
Stay still!

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.269
I can't see.

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:46.379
We have to have our lashes.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.379
Oh you know the Asians.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.379
Our lashes are down!

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:49.379
My eyes are tearing.

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.379
It burns!

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:51.379
Here.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:52.379
Blush.

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.379
Come here!

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:54.379
We don't have time!

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:55.379
Wait!

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.819
Will you look down?

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:58.589
Okay, stay there.

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.359
Oh my god!

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.899
Okay, we're gonna add some blush.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.500
And just blend that out.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.640
We can even double it up as eye shadow.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.570
Perfect Valentine's Day look!

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.079
Wait, come back.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:27.090
Let me do it!

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.600
Perfect!

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.630
My eyelash is hanging on in the middle.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.360
She only glued the middle.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.360
Okay.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.030
The lashes are DECENT.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.770
But you did not blend anything.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.860
First off, this brow.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.150
What's wrong with the brow?

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.689
I have a unibrow right here.

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:42.979
That's not no unibrow.

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.810
That's your natural brow.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.140
And you gave me no eyebrows.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.220
I would rather have no eyebrows than half,
wispy brows like this.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.220
Okay.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.609
Leave us a comment down below with who you
think is the winner.

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.159
I mean, we kind of have an idea but...

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.159
You let us know.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.390
And also, let us know what challenge you want
to do next.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.020
We like to challenge ourselves, as you can
tell.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.020
We do pretty good.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.020
We do.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.020
Let us know.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.020
Thanks for watching!

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.020
Bye!

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.890
We're giving you a surprise mini-makeover!

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.440
You just texted me and told me you were here.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.440
That's debatable.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.070
Clearly, I'm not afraid of wearing color.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.070
See, check that out.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.060
Oh, look at that.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.060
BAM!

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.060
You see that?

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.060
Girl!

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.530
Yeah, this looks great and it's only two colors
so I can totally do this on my own.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.660
Yup, all about the blending.
