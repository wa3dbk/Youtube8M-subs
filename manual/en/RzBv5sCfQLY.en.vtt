00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:08.180
This new finding is titled "Neural Progenitor
cells regulate microglia functions and activity."

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.570
It was published in Nature Neuroscience journal
in November 2012 by Tony Wiss-Coray's group

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.320
at Standord University.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.040
To understand this finding let's talk about
a few cell types that live in our brains and

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.480
where they come from.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.070
If i asked you what cells were in our brain
you probably would say "neurons", and that's

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.210
absolutely true.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.460
Neurons in our brain come from specialized
cells that resemble stem cells that we call

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.170
"neural progenitor cells."

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.650
It was initially thought that neurons could
not be replenished in case of injury such

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.579
as a stroke or a brain trauma.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:52.080
But thanks to research such as this one, we
now know that these NPCs are very important

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.540
for brain injury patients to regain cognition
and fully recover.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.780
So remember these NPC cells because this is
what today's finding is focusing on.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.940
But our brains are composed of much more than
just neurons.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.679
Our brains are also composed of a whole array
of different cells that provide an environment

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:15.030
in which the neurons can behave like neurons
and produce a functioning brain.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.590
A "microglia" is one of these cells.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.520
Microglia are very important and in fact CRUCIAL
for the proper functioning of the brain!

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.649
That's in part because they produce molecules
or "secreted molecules" that are going to

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:36.049
travel to nearby NPC and tell them what to
do such as to divide and make neurons.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.179
So from what I've told you so far, you understand
that microglia can influence the behavior

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.049
of NPC.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.419
To be able to design better treatments for
brain injury, it is important that we understand

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:54.700
HOW NPCs work because NPCs are the ones that
replenish the neurons that are lost: what

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.630
they need to survive, and what they provide
to cells around.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.729
So in an effort to understand how NPCs work,
these scientists were interested in seeing

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.770
if NPCs could influence the behavior of microglia.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.800
First, the scientists noticed that microglia
were abundant near pools of NPCs.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.900
This provided a first clue that there could
be an important interaction between these

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.930
two cell types.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.810
Next, the scientists noticed that NPCs were
also producing "secreted molecules" and they

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:39.280
wanted to see if these "secreted molecules"
could influence microglias.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.030
To do this, the scientists isolated microglia
ALONE and secreted molecules from NPCs and

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.830
examined microglia function when the microglia
were in the presence of NPC secreted molecules

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.100
or not.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.160
So what happened to the microglia?

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.700
Well, the microglia that were given NPC secreted
molecules started to divide, they moved around

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.710
more, and changed the types of secreted molecules
they produced.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.220
So this was exciting and suggested that NPCs
can influence microglia function through NPC

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.220
secreted molecules.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.531
But the authors went even further and wanted
to see if NPCs could control microglia function

00:03:21.531 --> 00:03:27.920
in a brain, with all of the added complexity,
all of the other cells types, neurons, etc.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.310
So the authors injected NPCs and NPC secreted
factors into mouse brains and looked at the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.580
microglia.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.260
What the scientists saw was that at the site
of the injection where there were many NPCs

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.680
and NPC secreted molecules, there were ALOT
more microglia, a lot more activated microglia

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.400
that were dividing and secreting their own
secreted molecules.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.830
If the scientists injected NPC secreted molecules
in mouse brains instead of NPCs themselves,

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.600
they saw the same effect on microglia function.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.150
This means that the NPC secreted molecules
are responsible for controlling the behavior

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.740
of microglia both in an isolated cell system
as well as in a brain.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.489
The scientists of this paper discovered that
one of the important NPC secreted molecules

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.850
that is responsible for this is called VEGF
which controls the growth of blood vessels!

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.150
It's still not clear how a factor that allows
the grwoth of blood vessels could be responsible

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.930
for controllign microglia function, but it's
definitely a new avenue of research.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.460
So what did this study show?

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.810
This study identified a new complex interaction
between NPCs and microglia that surround it

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:54.020
where NPCs secreted molecules that control
microglia movement, number, and function.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.740
The scientists found that a factor that promotes
grwoth of blood vessels is responsible for

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.419
this.

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.449
This is very exciting because it suggests
that NPCs are controlling microglia that in

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.449
turn control NPC function.

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.020
This type of cycle is found in many systems
in nature.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.509
it's interesting to think about some possible
reasons life would have evolved such complex

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:19.580
modes of regulation!

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.960
So what can we take away from this study when
it comes to therapy?

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.159
Of course a lot of questions still remain:

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:34.529
- Is this important for recovery from brain
damage?

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:39.460
- How does this blood vessel growth factor
control microglia function?

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.319
And of course the ultimate question:

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:46.220
- Can we use this information to influence
recovery in patients? can we maybe find a

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:54.080
way to add more NPC secreted molecules (including
VEGF) into patient brains to promote microglia

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:02.219
function and in turn boost NPC function and
neuron growth?

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:08.910
This idea is very exciting and provides new
avenues for future research.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:14.129
So as you hopefully took away, scientists
are always asking fundamental question, offering

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:19.509
breakthrough answers that in turn open up
even more new exciting questions to expand

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:23.030
our knowledge with the ultimate goal of developing
efficient therapies.
