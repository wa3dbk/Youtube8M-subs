00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:07.500
Who doesn't love a dessert that's quick and
easy to make, light absolutely mouthwatering,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.110
and can serve a crowd?

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.360
That's exactly what you get with this clafoutis.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.400
Let me show you!

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.050
Place the almonds in the bowl of a food processor.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.220
Add the flour.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:37.210
And now process until very finely ground,
about 1 to 2 minutes.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:47.730
Place the eggs in a large bowl, add the egg
yolks and whisk until lightly blended.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:01:00.600
Add the sugar, the heavy cream, the milk,
the almond extract, the salt and the ground

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.790
almonds.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:11.859
Now whisk until all the ingredients are well
incorporated.

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:13.020
That's it for our base!

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.079
So simple.

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:21.420
For the apricots, the only thing we have to
do is to cut them in half and remove the pits.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.530
Place the apricots cut-side-up in your prepared
mold.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:34.090
You want the apricots to fit snugly together,
because this clafoutis is all about the fruit.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.170
Drizzle with the custard.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.399
Now sprinkle with the sliced almonds and the
turbinado sugar.

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:54.450
This is going to give the clafoutis a wonderfully
crisp topping.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.899
Here we are!

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:02.009
Beautiful golden-brown top, all puffed up
and smelling absolutely heavenly.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:22.110
Enjoy baking this gorgeous dessert, and bon
apetit!
