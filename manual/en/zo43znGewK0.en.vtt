[Strawberry Recipes For Spring - Ideas For Fresh Strawberries]

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It's late spring, and that means that strawberries are in peak season.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
[Tracy Metro for the Kraft Kitchens]

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And it also means that I'm in heaven.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I mean, really, who doesn't love a strawberry with a little something creamy on top?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And even though I could eat this simple treat every single day,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I found myself looking for some special new ways to use these beauties

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
now that they are so sweet and abundant.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm Tracy Metro for the Kraft Kitchens.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Come on, let me show you what I found.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Okay.  How would you complete this phrase:

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Strawberries and ?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Strawberries and cream, maybe.  How about strawberries and spinach with almonds?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I'm not kidding.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Here is a salad that uses fresh baby spinach, strawberries

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
[Spinach, Strawberry and Grapefruit Toss] and pink grapefruit topped with toasted almonds

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and balsamic vinaigrette dressing.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now, the trick to this salad is actually toasting the almonds.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You just spread the almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
you bake it for 8 to 10 minutes, you give them a stir every once in a while, 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and you're good to go.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Balsamic vinegar also adds an extra punch to this strawberry topped appetizer

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
[Strawberry Balsamic Delight]

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
made with Cracked Pepper &amp; Olive Oil Triscuits

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that have been spread with reduced fat cream cheese.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Now, I personally love how the vinegar pumps up the flavor 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and deepens the color of these strawberries.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Let's say you really do have more berries than you know what to do with.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Well, then it's time for the newfangled version of old-fashioned canning.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Now, this might sound intimidating for the novice,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
but have no fear.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
There's no actual canning involved.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Instead, we're using plastic containers that have been rinsed thoroughly in boiling water.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So what I have right here is two and a half cups of crushed strawberries and blueberries

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
combined with four cups of sugar.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It has to sit for ten minutes.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Just give it a stir every now and then.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In the meantime, I'm going to add my Sure-Jell package

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to three-quarters of a cup of water.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
[whisking]

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
If you don't know what Sure-Jell is, it's a fruit pectin that will help thicken the jam.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It can be found in the supermarket in the baking aisle.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
This needs to be constantly stirred over heat until it's boiled for one minute.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And now that this is finished, I'm going to add it to the fruit,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and it needs to be stirred constantly for three minutes.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
What this is doing is it's dissolving all of the sugar.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And there you go.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Now all you have to do is fill up your plastic containers to within half an inch of the top

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
before putting it in the freezer.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
You're going to want to wipe off the top if there's anything on there,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
[Lasts 3 weeks in the refrigerator and up to 1 year in the freezer]

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
put the lid on tight, and set it aside for 24 hours at room temperature.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
[chimes jingling] And baby, you've got jam like this.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It's your own homemade proof that you too are a domestic diva.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Sounds pretty fun, huh?
