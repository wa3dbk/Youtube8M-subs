00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:33.000
I’d just like to point out I haven’t played
RBI Baseball since the Clinton administration,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.290
and I’ve never even played this one.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.129
But I still go up there first-pitch swinging
because I’m a winner, and that’s what

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.190
winners do.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.190
Winners like me and Jay Bell.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:53.550
That’s one of the many reasons RBI Baseball
has always been such a tremendous video game.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.760
You can rest up for an offseason or two decades,
it doesn’t even matter.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.430
When you finally come back to Tengen’s pixelated
diamond, it only takes one swing.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.210
And then you remember why you used to play
this every freaking day.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.220
But again, I mean...not this game specifically.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.860
This is my first experience with this particular
version and with this franchise on a 16-bit

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.920
console.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.930
And although it’s the
same awesome baseball game at its core, I

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.860
actually prefer the older versions.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.950
And there are a few reasons why.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:42.000
RBI Baseball ’94 was the second game in
the series to use the year for its subtitle,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.509
having dropped the numerical sequels after
1992’s RBI Baseball 4.

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.230
But there’s more separating RBI ’94 from
the games preceding it, and for the most part,

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.540
that has to do with aesthetics.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.930
In my opinion, games from the 16-bit era have
aged better than any other.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.539
An older game can just look old, and frankly,
there are plenty of newer games that just

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.250
don’t have the same visual polish and timeless
charm of some 16-bit games.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.879
And so, obviously, it makes sense that RBI
Baseball ’94 would emphasize those.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.599
Unfortunately, that emphasis gets in the way
of the gameplay just a bit.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.180
So gone are the basic ones of earlier games,
and in their place are some slick new player

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.180
sprites.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.960
You also have the pixelated portraits of the
actual big league players, which pop up during

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.540
each at-bat and were probably cool in 1994.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.280
For example, there’s Bo Jackson.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.970
Unfortunately, he can’t run in zig zags
in this game.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.080
And frankly, he looks pissed about it.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.330
Of course, with such fancy new graphics, you
want to show them off.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.769
And so this version of RBI Baseball has a
much tighter camera than the older versions,

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:07.870
which makes the players look bigger and more
detailed...at the cost of gameplay.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:18.770
See, the camera is so tight, in fact, that
you can’t really play defense.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.330
Your team automatically plays defense, and
you sort of just throw to the bases.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.930
The problem is, when there’s a hit they
can’t play, you can’t tell.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.720
So you’re waiting for them to make the automatic
play, because you can’t freaking see...and

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.909
when they don’t, that’s an automatic double
for the opposition.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:43.330
Again, the gameplay is basically still the
same as prior versions, so it’s still an

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.049
outstanding game of retro baseball.

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.780
But these changes, most of which seem to be
based on the aesthetic improvement of the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.189
16-bit era, actually get in the way.

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.079
The formula for this franchise was always
simplicity.

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:07.340
And as RBI Baseball ’94 proved, sometimes
simpler is better.
