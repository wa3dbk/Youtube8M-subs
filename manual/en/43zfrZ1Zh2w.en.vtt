CHRISTIE OWNES: Hi, my name is Christie and
I'm with Expert Village and I'm teaching you

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.130
proper care of fish today and a little bit
about the different types of fish. Now we're

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.920
going to talk about fish and if you lose one.
Unfortunately as I was doing a water change

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.519
on my tank, I noticed one of my gold dust
mollies has passed away. When you lose a fish,

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.660
make sure that you remove the fish properly.
If you don't, it can leave an unsightly mess

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.310
in the tank and the other fish like to scavenge
on dead fish. Of course this is what they

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.649
do in the wild. Some people who get lazy such
as myself sometimes we always don't remove

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.660
the fish and the fish take care of it. But
for your purpose, I'm going to teach you the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.570
proper way to remove a dead fish. Lift the
lid on your tank. You're going to use a nice

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.350
little handy dandy tool which is called a
fishnet which you use to remove the dead fish.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.510
What I want to do is look in the front of
the tank and see if I can't find the fish

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.660
that has passed away. For locating him in
the tank, I'm going to use my net to find

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.769
the fish, scoop him out and remove him out
of the tank. Once you remove the dead fish

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.330
which we have in the tank, out of the fish
tank, properly dispose of it in the commode.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.050
So, if you send the fish out to big water,
blue open sea where it can break down naturally.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.460
Once you do this, your tank is happy and healthy.
And on an ending note if taking care of your

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.090
tank, make sure you look at your fish tank
everyday not only when you're feeding your

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.600
fish but just to makes sure that you haven't
lost any. If you have any fish that are being

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.650
too aggressive that you remove him from the
tank so that they're not picking everybody

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.610
else and pushing everybody up into one corner.
Sometimes this happens even on fish that are

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.390
listed as a community fish. Sometimes, they
can get a little feisty and like to pick on

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.570
other people in the tank. Just like us, fish
have personalities just like we do. When you're

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.380
a professionally person such as myself and
if you don't mind touching a dead fish body,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.770
you can just put your hand in the tank, remove
the dead fish and put it in a commode. Just

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.220
make sure you wash your hands thoroughly.
Another suggestion is we have Oscar fish which

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.351
can get up to two feet in length, please do
not put this on your commode. A two foot fish

00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:16.090
which is two feet long, approximately a foot
high and at two inches thick is not going

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.900
to fit down a commode properly. So, please
put this big fish in a trash bag, seal the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.530
trash bag and put it in the trash can for
proper disposable. There, again, don't put

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.840
the big fish in a commode. Let alone a three
foot algae eater 'cause it's just not going

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.170
to fit. Thanks again for coming to my house
and letting me teach you on how to take care

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.160
of a fish tank properly.
