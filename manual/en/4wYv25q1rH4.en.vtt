00:00:04.358 --> 00:00:10.868
Normally, if you have some illness, 
if you take medicine you feel better.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:19.751
But in case of cancer, you take chemo 
or radiation you become worse.

00:00:19.751 --> 00:00:21.461
So that`s irony!

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.368
The teaching of the Tibetan Medicine is like this.

00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:32.253
You know, it is not the question of 
 just treating the disease, treating the sickness.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.689
It is all about understanding the way of living. 
It is all about understanding the whole universe.

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:40.156
How the universe was formed.

00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:42.678
Why the universe was formed.

00:00:42.678 --> 00:00:45.769
And what power, what energy you know ...

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.010
... and what kind of life!

00:00:48.957 --> 00:00:53.756
My first surgery was when I was 35 years, 
 the second surgery was when I was 39.

00:00:54.723 --> 00:01:00.057
Now I am 49...
And the last 7-8 years I am on Tibetan Medicines.

00:01:00.985 --> 00:01:04.835
When we started to take the Tibetan Medicines
the counts came up to 6000

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:09.069
the hemoglobin was coming back and never once we had to go through the blood transfusion, you know.

00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:15.158
So if you want to cut out the root cause of 
 the poisoned tree you have to cut the root.

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:19.949
So just plucking the leaves,  it will not cure the problem, like that.

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:24.214
So Tibetan Medicine mainly targets the root cause of the problem.

00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:35.893
Suffering.

00:01:36.036 --> 00:01:39.533
The truth of the suffering.
The cause of the suffering.

00:01:39.686 --> 00:01:44.790
And the way to end the suffering.
And finally liberation from the suffering.

00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:47.180
These are the teachings...

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.550
very important teachings of the Tibetan Medicines.

00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:55.280
With these doctors you can feel, when they touch your hand, when they hold your hand,

00:01:55.282 --> 00:02:00.380
you can feel a fire coming out through
 your hand and you can feel a positive vibration.

00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:04.600
By listening to patientÂ´s emotions I always feel is very important.

00:02:04.596 --> 00:02:09.720
Then they feel more trust with the patient, trust with the doctors also.

00:02:09.723 --> 00:02:17.450
So then the doctor-patient relationship grew much firm, you have more close ties with the patients.

00:02:17.448 --> 00:02:23.790
You know prayers, we used to pray about this: "Four Immeasurables", "Four Infinities".

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:33.920
Compassion...

00:02:34.182 --> 00:02:38.190
For the patients who are really suffering...who're really suffering.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.000
Compassion, deep-seated compassion.

00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:52.410
The treatment approach, the health approach
is much more important than the treatment itself!
