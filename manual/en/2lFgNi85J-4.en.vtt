00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.420
uh... we have the world's tallest fast
ball player uh... he is of course

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.009
chinese uh... he we all mania services
at seventy-six feet

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.589
has stated seventy six inches tall

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.059
this guy outside since then this on the
maintained

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:21.960
and he is seven-foot nine inches tall

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.949
we're picture

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.730
data calumet

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.639
also

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:32.790
now the promise that you can tell his
mother and the eighties and japanese we

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.790
put up or little japanese fellow tricky
but with that

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.110
packets from is that he can

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.210
he's not as fast as above n_b_a_ players
so easy for me and then be age twenty

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.400
five years old

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.609
of what he had growth

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.010
their that wound up the in his body that
one of having

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.820
two different that consequences one was
the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.900
cause on national growth in his body
okay

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.780
but number two is that the

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.499
that absolutely destroyed his indoors
and his ability

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:09.040
uh... to keep a lid on the players so it
was a you know

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.640
obviously helpless always give your
trump let us one heard otherwise

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.890
and they took the growth out into the
tumor out

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.190
so now he's fine

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.480
and his endurance is getting a higher
and higher his fitness is getting higher

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.010
higher

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.160
so now he might have better chance

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.480
you know i've been in the studio

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.570
of a

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.720
which at this point

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.170
yugoslavia

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.420
historical data roughly reason

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.570
unless you're there was a

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.860
minor league team

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.540
or if there was an colleges of them

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.180
muscles that covers your personal dot
this alone

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.940
that this is something that was dot
light up he tried out for the lakers

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.160
there was a small there was a small
colors

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.859
nevertheless

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.939
like used leading up to tonight using

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.140
and he was ridiculously slow

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.930
but you have to jump to the it was that
it is the activists gathered he almost

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.760
doesn't have to jump to duck

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.729
it is like in the japanese leaders just
possible to write with housing attached

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.920
if the distressed about their heads

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.749
but an n_b_a_ numbers one if you will be
interested in what was it

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.509
and he's got a rock often now

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:22.280
and that's a problem as a problem on
defense someone of a problem on offense

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.760
but he's working on all that

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.210
and as you can see there you know why i
love that bad it looks like maybe you do

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.999
it

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.040
this was praising arrives at the scene

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.789
this motion

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:36.949
someone else loosens the tides just as
the normal at various argue that you've

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:41.559
read this and it could be destroyed that
that the fact that abroad underlining

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:42.999
his labor over

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:46.269
authorized so slow he's mortars

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.209
if you need some help to give to the
n_b_a_

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.099
outlet chris dudley and all these clowns
they hung around an n_b_a_ being like

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.480
eight inches short of that have and will
not have a much more speaker in the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.369
house

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:00.819
there are two men behave like ten years
of the time

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.180
so maybe he's got a shot

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.019
so by you-know-what something then

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:12.609
waiting for a man who does what is so
put nine guide and be a fun for everyone

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.139
but just to put down for the poor some
food but just wait a minute japanese lee
