00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:06.140
How to Buy a Car Battery.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.959
If you're buying a new battery for your car,
there are several factors you need to consider

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:12.790
to ensure you get the right battery for your
car.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:21.740
You will need Group size CCA requirements
Owners manual Reserve capacity Manufacture

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.279
date and electrical system information.

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.400
Step 1.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.060
Determine the proper group size for your car.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.760
The group size identifies the outside dimensions
of the battery, whether it will fit in your

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.090
car, and the placement of the terminals -- side
posts or top posts.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:46.129
Group size 75 fits mainly General Motors,
size 65 fits most Ford cars, and size 34 fits

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.640
most Chryslers.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.700
Newer Hondas, Nissans, and Toyotas use size
35.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.839
Your owner's manual will specify your car's
group number.

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:55.910
Step 2.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.359
Determine the cold cranking amp, or CCA, requirements
for your vehicle.

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.570
CCAs measure the battery's ability to start
in cold weather and indicate how much current

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.490
the battery can deliver to the starter at
zero degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.210
Your owner's manual will specify your CCA
requirements.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.230
Step 3.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.799
Check the battery's reserve capacity.

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.320
The reserve capacity denotes how many minutes
your car can run using the battery alone if

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.299
the alternator fails.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.170
Check the battery's product information literature
for reserve capacity -- it likely won't be

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.409
noted on the label.

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.409
Step 4.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.649
Buy a battery manufactured fewer than six
months earlier than your purchase date.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.640
Batteries are stamped with a date code, and
the manufacture date is usually indicated

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.150
by the first two characters of the code.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.390
The first character in the code will indicate
the month -- A for January, B for February,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.570
through L for December.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.890
The second character will indicate the year
-- 8 for 2008, 9 for 2009, or 0 for 2010,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:00.890
etc.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.140
Step 5.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.740
Consider the electrical needs for your vehicle.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.520
If you have installed additional entertainment
features, such as a stereo with a large amplifier,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.470
television screens, DVD players, or video
games, your car will have increased electrical

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.970
demands.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.730
Step 6.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.860
Consider a universal fit battery, which fits
most battery trays and has both top and side

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.360
posts.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.010
Many universal fit batteries are specially
designed to increase both output and battery

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.290
life, but can cost more than twice as much
as other batteries.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.340
Getting a new battery is an investment in
your car's life, so be sure to choose the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.050
one that fits your needs.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:46.750
Did you know In 2008, the Environmental Protection
Agency estimated that nearly 99 million wet-cell

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.819
lead-acid car batteries were manufactured
each year.
