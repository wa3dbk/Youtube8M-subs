00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:05.420
KARIN FONG: I think title
design's like a curtain.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.795
Like when you're in the theater,
when the curtain gets up

00:00:07.795 --> 00:00:09.580
there is a moment
of anticipation.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.160
And I think it draws
you from your everyday

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.519
into this fantastic world.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.310
JIM HELTON: It's a
movie inside of a movie.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.580
And it's always been something
that's fascinated me.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.579
BEN CONRAD: I mean, it's
such an important time.

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.320
The movie starts, and that's
a very precious little moment

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.170
there that really
can't be wasted.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.420
PETER FRANKFURT: I think a
good title sequence is just

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.580
a show of respect
to the audience.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.930
It says we're really
going to actually

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.855
try as hard as we possibly
can to invite you in

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:37.940
and to entertain you.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.648
KARIN FONG: A key
component of our design

00:00:39.648 --> 00:00:41.000
is just the concept work.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.960
We hope, you know, something
is very aesthetically striking,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.960
aesthetically memorable.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.460
But hopefully the reason
why it resonates with you

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.885
is because it's so true
to the story it's telling.

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:52.260
PETER FRANKFURT:
The project that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.370
really launched our company
was the title sequence

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.490
to David Fincher's SE7EN.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.040
What Fincher needed
was a formal expression

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.730
of what he was going for, not
so much to mirror his style,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.110
but rather to reinforce his
style but in a completely

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.360
different language.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.150
KARIN FONG: You hope that a
television series last years

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.566
and years and that whatever
sequence you're coming up with

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.460
would have a lifespan that
encompasses the bigger

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.262
ideas within the story.

00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:22.470
PETER FRANKFURT: Mad Men is
a perfect example, right.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.220
What happened is
that show became

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.630
part of the culture
and the title sequence

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.780
became part of the culture.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.570
And that final
image of Don Draper

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.150
with his arm draped over
the back of his chair

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.132
became the iconic
image for the show.

00:01:35.132 --> 00:01:37.590
KARIN FONG: We're not out to
duplicate what the director is

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.340
doing in the film.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.412
Sometimes it's wonderful to
have that contrast at play.

00:01:41.412 --> 00:01:43.370
PETER FRANKFURT: The sort
of highest compliment

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.170
is that the title
really is of the movie,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.710
and that the movie can't exist
without the title sequence

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.710
and vice versa.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.240
And that's always really
what we're going for.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.490
BEN CONRAD: Building the
anticipation for the audience

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.170
at the beginning of the film
before they've seen anything

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.320
is so much fun.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.560
In Zombieland, the
challenge was really

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.680
about bridging design
and filmmaking.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.370
It was directed by
Ruben Fleischer.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.180
And he was taking an
approach that we understood

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.300
in terms of bringing
type into the film

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.140
in a real integrated way.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.510
We were responsible
for the whole intro.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.640
So the whole beginning required
a lot of design thinking.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.320
Eventually everything
clicked that this

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.590
was going to be these beautiful
slow motion shots of zombies

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.720
all around the country killing
people and then integrating

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.720
the type in the
same way, so having

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.790
them move in that
beautiful balletic style.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.840
So you have this grace to
it, and at the same time

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.280
it's horrific.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.070
I think from the
beginning Ruben also

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.700
wanted to have the rules
be typographically featured

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.450
within the film.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.400
So the solution for that was
to have the type interact

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.320
and be part of the scene, and so
in a sense become a character.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.020
What we really discovered
is that we didn't

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.282
want to overpower the image.

00:02:59.282 --> 00:03:00.490
The images were so fantastic.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.230
And so we didn't want
to have the font do

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.640
so much of that work, and
say, like, hey, I'm funny,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.610
I'm a funny font.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.650
It didn't need that.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.740
It didn't need to be sort
of slapped in your face.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.820
I remember seeing it in the
theater and people laughing

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.240
at the way that
the type behaved.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.160
That was just a really
gratifying moment,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.907
to see that type could
entertain in that way.

00:03:21.907 --> 00:03:23.740
JIM HELTON: I've always
loved title designs.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.970
I've always loved title making.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.553
It's a really cool
thing to entertain.

00:03:26.553 --> 00:03:29.450
It's like, how do you make
something stick with someone?

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.020
How you put it in a context so
that they'll feel something?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.290
With Blue Valentine, in
particular, it hits people.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.480
It was very honest.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.354
It takes you places that
are really hard to go.

00:03:40.354 --> 00:03:42.020
One of the things I
wanted to get across

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.830
in the title sequence
was that there was love.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.660
That it did exist.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.720
And that even
thought it was harsh,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.700
and it was a hard thing to
watch them lose their love,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.570
it still existed.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.790
And it didn't devalue that.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.190
They had always planned to
have fireworks at the end.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.310
A DP shot the fireworks.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.810
You know, Derek
just kept on saying,

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.643
I want more out of
focus, more out of focus,

00:04:01.643 --> 00:04:02.495
more out of focus.

00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:04.780
And so finally they just
took the lens off the camera.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.670
And so the real beautiful
bouquets, I mean,

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.640
it's just the camera.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.570
And it looks magnificent to me.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.140
I edited that by itself.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.110
And I found the music,
and I did something that

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.190
was a rhythmic ode to the film.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.600
But it was purely rhythmic.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.579
We had one of our
test screenings,

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.522
and right after it the writer
came up to me and she said,

00:04:25.522 --> 00:04:27.730
you gotta do something with
the end that's nostalgic.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.720
And we had these
fantastic stills

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.241
that Davi Russo, our set
photographer on Blue Valentine,

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:34.740
took.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.670
And it was funny, because as I
was watching it, at that moment

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.710
I was seeing them
inside the fireworks.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.490
Right after that I
went back in the studio

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.970
and put something together.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.870
Those aren't
necessarily stills that

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.250
were taken while the
shooting was happening.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.160
There's a connection.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.209
He had time with them.

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:50.500
And they collaborated with him.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.274
He really got the
actors to give to him.

00:04:54.274 --> 00:04:56.440
I think that's one of the
reasons why the photos are

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.270
so resonant and powerful.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.980
Putting images inside of
darkness and lightness

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.429
and revealing them is an
experimental technique.

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:07.720
And especially to put something
like that in mainstream

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.080
cinema was really
exciting for me.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.770
And those moments of, almost
ecstatic moments of filmmaking

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.510
are really magical.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.294
BEN CONRAD: That
moment of mystery

00:05:17.294 --> 00:05:19.710
at the beginning of the film,
that's your only opportunity

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.804
to really get the audience
in into the story.

00:05:22.804 --> 00:05:24.220
PETER FRANKFURT:
Images in motion,

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.030
they're by necessity a
story, because they're

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.915
happening over time.

00:05:27.915 --> 00:05:29.540
JIM HELTON: For me,
the first explosion

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.164
is like, I'm going
to tell you a story.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.300
It's not going to be in words.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.660
But it's still clear that
there's a story happening.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.868
PETER FRANKFURT: When
everything all falls into place

00:05:37.868 --> 00:05:40.670
and becomes sort of part of
your experience of the show,

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.899
that's when design
becomes filmmaking, right,

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:44.440
storytelling.

00:05:55.085 --> 00:05:56.960
JIM HELTON: Watched all
of Saul Bass's stuff.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.700
I used to make mixed videos of
like all his title sequences.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.660
PETER FRANKFURT: He's the
pope, come on, he's Saint Saul.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.640
KARIN FONG: You know, he
was showing filmmakers

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.750
to not be literal.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.207
And it's OK to challenge
your audience a little bit.

00:06:09.207 --> 00:06:10.290
JIM HELTON: He's the best.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.790
I mean, it's not
just title design.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.160
Any major logo
that I grew up with

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.853
was probably designed
by Saul Bass.

00:06:15.853 --> 00:06:17.436
PETER FRANKFURT: He
elevated the form.

00:06:17.436 --> 00:06:17.780
KARIN FONG: Yeah.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.238
PETER FRANKFURT:
He just got people

00:06:19.238 --> 00:06:21.390
to pay attention
to title sequences

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.430
beyond simply the information
that they were conveying.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.680
JIM HELTON: It is mind-boggling
how much that guy contributed

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.230
to the visual world, the
graphic world that we live in.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.780
