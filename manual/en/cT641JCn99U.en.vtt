Hello, BSL community!

00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:12.026
I've got an announcement about
an exciting event happening soon!

00:00:12.026 --> 00:00:16.868
On August 8th, there will be a
Deaf Improv Comedy Show!

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:21.429
Er... hold on a sec...

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:27.204
Awti... you're
in-vision? What for?

00:00:27.204 --> 00:00:31.376
[Awti] Well, I'm providing an
interpretation for the viewers.

00:00:31.376 --> 00:00:34.949
[Matty] Nono, don't need one!
Know why? The viewers are all Deaf!

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:36.967
[Awti] Yeah but some of them use ASL...

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:40.588
[Matty] They're all BSL users and you're 
interpreting into ASL. Move please!

00:00:40.588 --> 00:00:44.242
[Awti] That's my point, we need to ensure
access. They need to know this information!

00:00:44.242 --> 00:00:46.952
[Matty] Move!
[Awti] No.

00:00:46.952 --> 00:00:50.677
[Matty] I said move!
[Awti] Nope. Oh wait... no.

00:00:50.677 --> 00:00:55.228
[Matty] Hold on...
[Matty transforms arm into machine gun]

00:00:55.228 --> 00:01:00.800
[Awti] What are you doing? Don't...
[Matty] Bullets are coming your way!

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.141
[Matty] I feel better, no more Deaf Ninja!
