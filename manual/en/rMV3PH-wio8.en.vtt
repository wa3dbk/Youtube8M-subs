00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:11.930
[Traditional Māori music (14secs)]

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:18.020
[Narrator] You would think it unlikely that
a series of rocks along a beach should become

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.240
a tourist attraction, but the spherical Moeraki
Boulders are a natural phenomenon that has

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.679
intrigued people for centuries.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:32.000
Over fifty of these strange spheres lie along
a sandy beach near the fishing port of Moeraki.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.250
Māori call them Te Kai Hīnaki -- eel pots.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.430
Locals call the boulders Hooligan's gallstones.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.150
Others have named them giant gob-stoppers,
aliens' brains, the bowling balls of giants,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.190
or even the Stonehenge of New Zealand.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.120
Whalers named the place 'Vulcan's foundry'.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.660
The boulders grew in a pile of mud some 60
million years ago.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.780
They are called concretions -- lumps of sediment
bound together by a mineral cement.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.520
Imagine dropping a lump of glue onto sand
-- the resulting clump would be a concretion.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.970
At Moeraki the glue was calcite which was
probably created when a marine animal began

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.340
to rot.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.009
The calcite hardened around the sediment and
as more was added it grew just like a massive

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.350
pearl.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.990
The largest boulders weigh 7 tonnes and are
2 metres across.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.479
They are among the world's largest concretions
and they took around 4 million years to grow.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.021
Their roundness is not because they have been
tumbled in the surf, as many believe; but

00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:43.999
simply because they grew evenly in all directions
-- forming a perfect sphere.

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:48.770
The boulders only recently landed on the beach
-- they formed in a layer of mudstone which

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.029
was lifted above the sea about 15 million
years ago.

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:58.799
Breaking waves released them from the cliff
and they rolled down to the beach.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.340
Today some boulders can be seen half-freed
in the cliffs.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.840
According to Māori stories, many centuries
ago, Māori arrived here from their South

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.220
Pacific ancestral home of Hawaiki.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.910
They made the long ocean voyage in canoes
carrying people and cargo.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.890
Unfortunately one of these canoes, the Ārai-te-uru,
was wrecked in a fierce storm on Shag Point

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.060
or Matakaea, just south of the Moeraki Boulders.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.530
The reef there is said to be the remains of
the canoe.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.600
Just before the canoe was wrecked the travellers
threw the food baskets of kūmara and gourds

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.250
overboard to lighten the load.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.540
The baskets washed ashore at Moeraki where
they petrified into what we now know as the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.860
Moeraki Boulders.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.840
Some of the less regular stones along the
beach are said to be kūmara.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.600
Photographs from the nineteenth century show
many more boulders on the beach than are there

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.600
today.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.570
Many smaller boulders were taken as souvenirs
or garden ornaments.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.490
One even made it to Australia.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.790
In 1938 a very large Moeraki boulder was hoisted
onto a truck and taken to Otago museum to

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.120
be preserved 'for all time'.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.401
But within 25 years it began to break up while
its companions on the beach remained intact.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:29.200
In 1971 as concern mounted that names were
being carved into the surface of the boulders

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.370
and that rock collectors were using explosives,
the boulders were given legal protection as

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.780
a scientific reserve.
