00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.710
Welcome Brothers and Sisters.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.580
As you can tell, things are a little different.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.970
For reasons you can't comprehend, my voice
has stopped working.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.390
Leading scientists are still baffled as to
why I called them about this.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.160
Especially since they were botanists and their
field of research has nothing to do with lost

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.690
voices.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.600
Since it may take a few more days to re-calibrate
and reboot my voice after a mysterious cold

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.480
left me bedridden and feverish for about a
week, I've commandeered this weird and arcane

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.829
machine I found in the woods to lend me it's
mechanical voice, so that I may reach out

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.070
to you.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.920
The members of the Royal Order of the Holy
Mackerel.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.640
There is much to discuss.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.970
Topics like the flurry of small revelations
in Mabel's Guide to Life, Pacifica Northwest,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.300
Gompers the Goat, and a host of other topics
that are requested frequently by our members.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:23.250
I don't want to get too far behind in these
requests, but in my current state of voicelessness,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.719
harnessing the power of this weird and arcane
machine,

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:34.399
I have decided to use this broadcast to quiz
our members with a puzzle.

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.549
Over the past fifteen meetings, we have shed
light on secrets, we have talked of Gravity

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:49.530
Falls, and I have tested your ability to decipher
increasingly challenging encrypted messages.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.969
Challenges that you have passed, or are in
the process of passing.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:56.600
But. starting now.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.600
I.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.170
The High Exalted Big Fish, will be crafting
occasional video puzzle challenges.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.100
Video puzzle challenges that will test your
logic and reasoning.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.100
But I digress.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.150
You must forgive me.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.430
I am having trouble focusing on the current
task at hand.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.270
Perhaps it's because of the strange powers
emanating from this weird and arcane machine

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.830
I found in the woods.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.550
It seems to be affecting how I think.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.020
I better hurry, and present this week's video
puzzle challenge.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:43.390
As you can see before you, there are sixteen
straws arranged to form five boxes.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.120
Say hello to the boxes.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.440
Aren't they cute?

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.990
It is your job to destroy one of these boxes
and leave only four behind.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.580
It is a cruel task, but it must be done.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.060
Sometimes we must do things we do not want
to do.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.870
This is not a test to prepare you for those
dark and troubling times.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.280
This is simply a puzzle of straws.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.230
So you don't need to worry yourself.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.860
Your challenge though, is that you can only
move, 2, of the straws to create the four

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.860
boxes.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.280
You can not remove any straws from the table.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.440
They can only be moved, and must ultimately
remain part of the connected box shapes.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.410
Only 2 straws can be moved to destroy 1 of
the 5 boxes.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.010
Each of whom has a loving family at home,
but you aren't supposed to know about that.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.910
So please, promptly forget everything about
the loving families the boxes have, and how

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.450
they will be terribly missed if they are destroyed.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.670
The puzzle is now yours to solve.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.650
It may be easier if you make it yourself at
home with straws.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.730
Or, if straws are unavailable, you can use
matches.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.850
Just be sure to get your parents permission,
before you attempt to solve puzzles.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.720
Puzzles can be dangerous.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.430
Especially in the wrong hands.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.229
I hope to be well enough soon to have a proper
meeting, but the secret whispers of this weird

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:36.710
and arcane machine I found in the woods are
compelling me to stay here for the moment.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.349
But regardless of the whispers of the weird
and arcane machine I found in the woods who

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.729
speaks for me now, you have a puzzle before
you.

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.100
And you must solve the puzzle.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.759
If you need the solution, click the link on
the screen to be directed to a video that

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.590
shows you how this puzzle can be solved.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.270
But do you really need help with this puzzle?

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.990
Do you really need to be handed the answer?

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:15.160
Don't give up easily, try this out for yourself
before you click for the answer.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:22.310
Also, check out the store where you can purchase
hand crafted Membership Kits, invisible ink

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.330
pens, and secret decoder rings.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.340
Until our next meeting, share, subscribe,
and keep cracking those codes.
