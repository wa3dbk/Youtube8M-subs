00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.250
Dota 2 finally gets released, Abaddon is added
to the game, along with tons of new cosmetic

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.190
items, bundles, hud skins, and more!

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.750
Hey guys, Jess here with the Dota 2 update!

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.830
So first up - Dota 2 is FINALLY out of beta!

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.910
So...what exactly does this mean for you guys?

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.429
Well, ironically, now that the game is out,
they're STILL not letting just anyone in - new

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.230
players who sign up to play will be invited
in batches, so as to not overload Valve's

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.230
servers.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.010
And for those who have already been in the
game, not a whole lot is changing - Valve

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.090
is of course going to continue supporting
the game and adding heroes, and those of us

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.960
who participated in the early access phase
have received a Bloodstone of the Precursor,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.810
a special item indicating how many players
we've invited - so how many new players did

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.030
you bring to Dota 2?

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.720
I apparently invited 7 people to the beta,
but leave me a comment and lemme know what

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.600
your magic number is - in Dota, I mean, get
your mind outta the gutter.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.730
Next, Abaddon has bene added to teh game!

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.780
He's a melee strength hero known for being
one of the most versatile heroes in the game,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.909
and is often played as a support to due to
powerful utility abilities like Mist Coil,

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.670
a powerful single target nuke/heal.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.880
You can click the link in the video description
to read more about Abbadon on his Dota 2 Wiki

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.880
article.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.009
Moving on, besides Abaddon, TONS of other
things were added, mostly cosmetic items.

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.780
New sets were released for Anti-Mage, Axe,
Batride, Bloodseeker, Clinkz, Doom, Death

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.240
Prophet, Dark Seer, Morphling, and Spirit
Breaker, and you can click the link in the

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.829
description to see those for yourself.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:28.960
Which one do you guys like best?

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.810
I'm really diggin' the Death Prophet one - she's
one of my favorite heroes and her new item

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.090
set includes custom ghosts for her ult, which
look REALLY cool - leave me a comment and

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.799
let me know which item set you guys like best!

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.679
Finally, the Dota 2 Wiki has been fully migrated
onto the Gamepedia platform - it's still accessible

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.490
at the domain dota2wiki.com, but will have
the improved functionality that you guys have

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.130
come to expect from our Gamepedia wikis.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.610
