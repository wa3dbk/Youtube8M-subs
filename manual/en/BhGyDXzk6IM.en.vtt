00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:04.140
Hello, welcome to Tundra Restaurant Supply.  I'm Chris Tavano and I'm here to

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.510
troubleshoot some fryer maintenance today.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.299
Common problems we tend to see are thermostat controls and calibration;

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.309
in other words, your pilot light won't stay lit, your burner won't ignite, your oil is

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.699
too hot or is too cold. A lot of common problems associated with that

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.210
are the gas burner safety valve, as well as, the hi-limit control and thermopile

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.829
Today, we will be using our Frymaster MJ35

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:34.829
for our example maintenance.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.540
Alright, so first thing we're going to talk about is the thermostat and how to calibrate the thermostat

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.440
to help calculate

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.490
exactly what the problem is.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.670
So, a lot of times you'll have your thermostat, and your hi-limit

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.620
shutoff

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.730
is around 450⁰. So, what you want to do is set your thermostat

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.050
to 350⁰,

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.860
get a thermometer and put it in the oil basin itself,

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.549
and you want to make sure that, that comes up to the temperature of

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:01.730
350⁰.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.070
at same time

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.140
when that temperature has reached on the thermometer, you're going to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.790
lower your thermostat

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.320
down to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.270
about 250⁰ until it clicks off.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.540
And then you're going to turn it slightly up,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.410
and let the oil cool down. And when that valve

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.900
kicks back on for the fire,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.189
and make sure that that you're going to make sure that,

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.259
that temperature on your thermostat is also what's reading in the thermometer that's sitting in the oil.

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.100
Once you've identified the problem of your thermostat being off from the actual fryer oil

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.210
temperature

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.150
the first place to look is your hi-limit switch.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.090
And what the hi-limit does is a safety precaution

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.530
saying that

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.720
it's going to turn off your fryer at exactly 450⁰, and never go higher than that.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.910
What we're going to do in here is,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.710
you take your two-wires that go to your hi-limit switch,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.810
and we're just going to unscrew them, and switch them in place to bypass that.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.350
We're going to take the one that gives us the source to the thermopile.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.409
This one is our actual limit,

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.409
and we're just going to bypass it and go instead to the thermopile.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:07.740
Really, all you need to do

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.209
is get the one that connects back to the thermopile so we have a

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.339
constant source again of that flame.

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:18.099
Alright, if you found out that your hi-limit switch is not the problem, the next place to

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.680
look is your thermopile.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.839
A thermopile converts your thermal energy into electrical energy.  It

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.029
is the source of your thermostat.

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:26.760
So,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.529
back in this

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:31.359
corner here we have our pilot light and our

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.559
thermopile. The thermopile is the rod that is connected to

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:36.209
this snaked wire.

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:43.209
Take out the probe itself

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.749
and there's your thermopile.

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:50.739
If you've found out that the hi-limit and thermopile

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.219
are not the culprit of your thermostat controls, the next place to look is

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.119
the combination safety gas valve.

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:02.130
That is not an easy thing to replace, it is not a quick thing to replace,

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.130
and it's not necessarily cheap, but it is something that needs to be done, and it's much better than buying a whole

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.609
new fryer itself.

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.919
If you look at this particular model,

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:14.290
the whole unit of the [combination] safety gas valve itself cannot be

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.949
removed from right here, so what you're going to do is

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.649
find your closest joints.

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:21.049
Unscrew those,

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.649
and your other one right here.

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:25.909
And your actually going to pull out the entire device with all of the

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:27.300
component pipes

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.909
associated with it.

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.079
Once you pull that out, you can

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.049
replace these pipes [take the pipes off of the combination safety gas valve] so that way you have the actual safety gas valve

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:35.989
itself.

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.589
And then you can get that replaced,

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:42.180
you can hook it back up to your previous pipes, and then again, you can screw that back on to the

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.659
actual gas lines themselves.

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.299
Alright, so your last troubleshooting tip would be

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.389
the thermostat itself. f you find that you've gone through all of that stuff, and your pilot light is

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:52.470
staying lit,

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.949
but however, you aren't holding temperature through what you had calibrated

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.139
earlier, and it's not being consistent,

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:02.489
odds are the thermostat itself is bad and needs to be replaced.

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.339
Alright, so other common problems to try and troubleshoot with your fryer

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:10.209
tend to be [small] explosions, it's too hot or metal fatigue.

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.699
A lot of times, you've got to check the basin of your fryer itself, and

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:17.930
make sure that there are no thin spots, worn out spots or any holes within the basin.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.209
If that exists, you have to get a

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.129
new fryer.

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:24.350
Other places you need to look are in

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.449
your exhaust manifolds and in the flume burners themselves. A lot of times

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.979
they get caked with grease and excess runoff, and over time, those just don't get cleaned out

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.810
the same way that the

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.500
oil basin itself gets cleaned. So you're going to want to check those on a monthly or quarterly

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.419
basis, and

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.199
try to clean out the soot.  If it's caked in there,

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.159
odds are you might need a new fryer as well.

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.800
Another common mistake is

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.749
liquid propane to natural gas conversions.

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:57.319
Those are one-way valves, so to convert from natural gas to liquid

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:58.110
propane,

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.580
there's one valve for that.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.060
To go from liquid propane to natural gas, there's a different valve for that.
