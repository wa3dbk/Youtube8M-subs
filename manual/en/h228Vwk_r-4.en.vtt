00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.980
The root cause and location of the
belt noise is often a difficult diagnosis.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.210
Belt noise, most often, is not a problem
with the belt,

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.739
so just replacing the belt will only
delay finding the real problem.

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.829
Belt Chirp is generally a misalignment problem between the component pulleys

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.200
and idlers in the belt drive system. Belt
squeal, on the other hand, indicates a loss of tension -

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.280
either from a worn belt, failing
tensioner or both.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.399
Both must be replaced to bring the
system back to a like-new condition.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.329
Here's a simple test that will help you
determine whether belt noise

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.470
is a system misalignment or a belt
tension problem.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.210
If it's an alignment problem, this test
can help locate the component or pulley

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.239
that is out of alignment. Before we start
though,

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.700
here's a word of caution: this test is
performed with the engine running so it's highly recommended

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.740
that a professional technician conduct
this test. All clothing,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.060
body parts and tools must be kept clear
moving engine parts.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.259
Failure to do so can result in severe
injury

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.100
or even death. First, fill a spray bottle
with tap water

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.619
make sure it's only water sense you'll be
spraying it on the belt.

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.740
Next, duplicate the conditions when belt noise is normally heard.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.450
For example, if you hear belt chirp when
the engine is cold

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.700
perform this test in the morning. The
objective is to spray water on the v-rib side of the belt,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.300
where the belt enters the pulley, in the
location where the noise seems to come from.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.439
The right location can be difficult to
determine, but frequently

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.579
misalignment noise originates from the
shortest belt span. In other words

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.889
the belt section with the shortest
distance between two pulleys.

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:52.999
This is especially true if one the short
span pulleys

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:57.450
operates on the backside of the belt. Here
is a water pump, for example, that is

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.619
powered by the backside the v-rib belt.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.709
Look to see if there is a short span
between this pulley and the next.

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.819
Start the engine and spray the v-rib side of the belt where

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.800
it enters the pulley. The water will
act as a lubricant.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.600
If belt noise becomes more pronounced, that
is, if the squealing gets louder when the belt is sprayed.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.300
It means that there is not enough tension on the belt. The belt

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.340
and the tensioner should both be replaced. If on the other hand,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.700
the noise, or chirping, goes away
momentarily when the bill was sprayed and then it returns,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.190
it means one or more of the pulleys at that
location are out of alignment.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.490
If there is no change in belt noise, look
for the next shortest belt span and

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.970
spray again where the belt enters the
second pulley

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.320
in the span. If the noise goes away and
then returns

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.840
you have identify the location of the
misalignment. The belt can be removed and

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.800
alignment checked with the laser
alignment tool available from Napa Belts &amp; Hose.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.000
Information on how to do that is in the
video segment "Changing the Serpentine Belt"
