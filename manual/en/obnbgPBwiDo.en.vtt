00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.049
the reach of the all-powerful king Kim
Jong Hoon government

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.309
it doesn't expand just in the confines
of Pyongyang or

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.099
North Korea in general but as a north
koreans barely reach

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.490
reaches all the way into the streets a
blunt

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.750
to take a look at this that picture here
this is a advertisement

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.119
put up by a barbershop essentially the
M&amp;M hair Academy in South

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.500
Ealing put up this says one meter by 1.2
meter but

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.859
thanks to my father I don't know what
that is I

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.160
appears you're blaming yeah my dad be
bet big beat back the metric system

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.280
on it's a so that their

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.090
added it was this idea that haircut that
Kim Jong Hoon has

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.020
and they had read that story that came
out I think in the south Asia Press

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.520
something like that I made a the Free
Asia radio his me what it was

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.440
a not-for-profit news agency based in
Washington that suggested that male

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.329
university students in North Korea were
being required to have the same

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.350
great haircut as a as

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.170
Kim Jong Hoon so they thought hey let's
like have a little joke here

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.060
and will show picture conjunction with
that phrase bad hair day but then

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.930
but what happened was is that this mo
Knobloch

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.950
who is the owner at the salon there in
healing says the day

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.990
after it went up the ad went up to Asian
looking guys

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.159
I do a little you guys were ensued
stirred up one was taking pictures the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.860
other taking notes I said to my client
at the time

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.350
I think they're North Korean officials
then they came and they asked who picked

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.790
who put that picture up

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.939
I said I did they said then later

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.540
you can add that the country is that as
the country's national leader

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.610
and he says correctly I told them a man
this is and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.340
this is like doctor clicked on the job
because a man with but

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.960
North Korea this thing on I'm himself
like a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.970
community after my name and then I told
them that

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.460
they would have to get their solicitors
for that so there I capital lawyers

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.110
standoff

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.159
but job I like the fact that that Kim
Jong Hoon just thinks that don't know

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.450
which is with a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.810
like couple a North Korean diplomats can
walk into our a

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.080
into better job alone in England Delhi
gotta take the picture doubt

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.550
so I think they'd at that I came up with
the reason why they did that because I

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.819
seem so mental like

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.700
all who are you to tell them to take the
picture to 9 but we just recently got a

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.670
story about how

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.110
thoroughly north korea brainwash is
everybody in the country it's possible

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.760
those North Korean officials

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.030
book really believe that Kim Jong own is

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.680
a profit is a God of some sort and so
they think of course we know anybody to

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.150
do whatever we want

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.170
we represent Kim Jong Hoon who are you
to are you with you know modern day

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.959
Jesus

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.250
and and I Mb I got bad news for them

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.069
that's not how the wrestling world
operates so you you bring my so you want

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.400
black going and take it down

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.010
right and it turns out it's definitely a
Kurd officials the north koreans call

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.670
the cops

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.510
I love with the Cubs over that I really

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.390
her brain yet so we're going to do them
right away

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.930
I can get them to the north korean
embassies contacted us and the way in

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.980
liaison with him

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.110
if the family is all about officer spoke
to all parties no fences have been

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.909
disclosed

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.500
applicable law goodness there's no pants
I

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.909
real quick guide Karim the back that the
guy side he designed the poster

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.239
offering up by the way was it that you
get 15 percent off their cat

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.090
on I should be referenced a poster and
he says it was a large in your face

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.860
pose to resign to get wants to come in I
with any points out that it was unlikely

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.140
to get people to come in

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.390
for that haircut which is unfortunate

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.860
better I and then he says that perhaps
if that

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.720
David Beckham oh right but I don't
really see it catching ought to be a

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.019
it appears to me that this is a bit of a
hairy situation and they do have the

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.680
Bakken their crosshairs

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.080
overall I gotta say sent whom realistic
demand well

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.330
I
