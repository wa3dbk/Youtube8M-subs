00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.730
At any given time, hundreds of salamanders
are being bred at the University of Kentucky.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.490
We have the only captive-bred salamander population
in the world where people can call us up,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.970
they can ask for material: “Hey, I want
some embryos,” “I want some larvae.”

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.080
“I want some adults,” and we can do the
breedings; we can make that those resources

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.820
and ship them out nationally, internationally
to folks.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.780
It’s about 150 research labs around the
world that work with salamanders at this point.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.010
The National Science Foundation funds us to
maintain that resource.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.550
With funding from the National Science Foundation,
the National Institutes of Health, and the

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.050
Army Research Office, biologist Randal Voss
is studying salamander regeneration—something

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.990
that may one day help people with spinal cord
and limb injuries.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.200
Then I have NIH funding which funds our genome
resource development work.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.190
And so the salamander has a very large genome,
it’s an order magnitude larger than the

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.190
human genome...

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.719
But with these advances in DNA sequencing
technologies that have happened because of

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:15.229
the Human Genome Project, essentially every
organism’s genome will be sequenced.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.469
We’re taking a very innovative approach.

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:24.700
We’re using a laser capture microscope that
will allow us to isolate single chromosomes

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.700
one at a time.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.960
And so our first set of chromosomes are being
harvested this month.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.600
The Army is funding us on three different
projects.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.049
And one is a project to describe how limb
regeneration actually works at what we call

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.319
an “RNA” level.

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:47.659
And so genes are initially transcribed into
RNA, and RNA is then translated into protein.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:54.009
What we’re trying to do is build a model
at that kind of RNA level of how limb regeneration

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.600
is accomplished…

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.560
Project two is to compare how different salamander
species regenerate…and then third, the Army

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.789
is also helping to support the genome sequencing
work.

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.520
Voss is studying a unique species of salamander
that’s found a way to postpone growing up.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.590
Aquatic amphibians--they start out as a single
cell.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.050
They’re very large, and they undergo a number
of divisions and slowly take the form of a

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.930
tadpole, but they maintain these kind of traits
that make it possible for them to live in

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.930
water.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.610
One of those characteristics are the gills.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.920
They’re branchy and they come out behind
the heads.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.030
And they have large mouths for suction feeding.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.100
They have a keeled tail fin for swimming.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.860
All the adaptations necessary to live in water.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.000
The ones that we work on--which are very unusual--come
from Mexico.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.400
What’s happened during the last few thousands
of years is a number of these tiger salamanders

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.420
have evolved this characteristic where they
no longer go through a metamorphosis.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.270
First of all, they block their development
to kind of maintain a juvenile look throughout

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.700
the course of their life--they really are
kind of like teenagers until they die because

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.700
of that.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.860
Voss uses thyroid hormone to turn these perpetually
aquatic teenagers into terrestrial adults.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.310
This allows him to find the genes responsible
for variations in the timing of metamorphosis,

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.770
and genes linked to regeneration after metamorphosis.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.320
Can we identify genes that explain variation
and some parameter of regeneration?

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.520
There does seem to be genes in the genome
that control the rate of regeneration…

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.450
It’s easy for us to imagine that our eye
color can be blue or brown, or a flower can

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.060
have purple or red color--and those are determined
by one gene … but most of the traits that

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.380
we care about are very complicated in their
nature.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.590
How long we live, how much we weigh, or the
time at which we metamorphose, or the rate

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.290
at which we regenerate, is probably determined
by hundreds to thousands of genes.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:04.730
And each of those are making some kind of
statistical contribution to that overall variation.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.840
In this complex research, Voss says UK offers
him a number of advantages over other universities.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.940
He counts shared scientific equipment, like
the laser capture microscope he’s using

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.470
to select single chromosomes, as one of those
advantages.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.470
Somebody with very minimal training can go
over there and just laser out small numbers

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.790
of cells or in this case, chromosomes.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.540
And so one of the great things about UK is
that we’ve got a number of these common

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.491
core facilities, and the instrumentation is
there, the expertise is there to help you.

00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:40.630
The advantage that I see of a UK over some
of the other universities that have a veterinary

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.190
school, have a law school, journalism, engineering,
arts and sciences--the whole nine yards--is

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.620
that they really are commonly located…I’m
in a biology department--which is in the College

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.100
of Arts and Sciences--but my lab is in a building
which houses primarily medical school researchers.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:06.270
And it’s only a short 100-yard walk away
for me to go back to my biology colleagues

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.270
to see them…

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.275
So that’s a big advantage.
