I'm currently at the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul,
Turkey.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.930
Welcome Class of 2017 from Phoenix, Arizona.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.980
I'm speaking to you from the second-best place
in the world -- Austin, Texas of course, but

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.940
I can't wait to be back at the best -- Princeton
University.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.200
Welcome to Princeton from San Francisco.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.690

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.910
Welcome to Princeton from the Jersey Shore.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.649
From my home town of Chicago.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.530
Welcome to Princeton from St. Louis, Missouri.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.609
Now before you all arrive on campus in just
a few weeks, your USG wanted to give you a

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:14.350
warm welcome, and some words of advice to
get you jumpstarted into an exciting Princeton

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.740
career.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.970
One piece of advice that I would give you
is to write yourself a letter at the beginning

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.692
of the school year, and then read it after
you graduate.

00:01:21.692 --> 00:01:22.945
It'll be really cool to see how much you've
grown over these four years.

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:23.945
Good luck!

00:01:23.945 --> 00:01:29.429
I think the best experiences are had with
an open mind so just come to campus being

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.829
very, very excited, because everyone is excited
to have you here, and Princeton took you on

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.359
campus for a reason so just be yourself.

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:44.162
This was my home for nine months during my
Bridge Year experience, and I want to tell

00:01:44.162 --> 00:01:45.810
you that Princeton can send you around the
world, but also you can find the whole world

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.810
right at Princeton.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.159
We're really excited to have you and I can't
wait to meet you.

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.159
Namaste!

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.549
Don't be afraid to try new things keep an
open mind because you'll never know what you'll

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.299
love, and enjoy the summer but know it gets
way better in the fall.

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.729
Try to things, meet new people and remember
to take time to enjoy your surroundings.

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.140
You never know who you'll meet or what you'll
find out about yourself along the way.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.180
Talk to other students and upperclassman about
what their favorite courses and professors

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.180
were.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.780
Freshman year is a great time to explore.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.430
There are so many people to meet and there
are so many things to do, and I encourage

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.930
all of you to take advantage of the many opportunities
you will have to get out there and meet your

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.680
peers, your professors, and meet the amazing
people in the Princeton University community.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.569
Know when you arrive on campus don't feel
confined your high school self you're going

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.689
to be a new face here and use this chance
to explore new interests, become friends with

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.939
everyone that you meet, and who knows what
incredible things will find in your new home

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.019
at Princeton University.

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.829
My favorite thing about Princeton by far as
the people, so get pumped to be around some

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.380
to be around amazing, inspiring, and people
you can just learn from.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.650
They're going to become your best friends
over the next four years.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.520
Don't jump in it too many hard classes to
quickly.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.640
Don't overload yourself your freshman year
you'll be exploring the different groups,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.250
the heart scene, your social life, and making
a lot of friends.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.790
So trust me, you don't want to spend your
whole time in the library.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.530
Don't ever feel intimidated.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.480
So when you step foot on campus, know that
you do belong here, know that these next four

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.980
years will be challenging but rewarding, but
also know that in the end, only you can determine

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.180
your success.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.910
Remember that even though you're about to
get a ton of independence and freedom, it's

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.159
your family that's there to support and encourage
you.

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.290
So don't forget to call your parents every
once in a while.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.120
Make sure you follow your passions.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.280
Study what you want and what interests you,
and not what you think will make a lot of

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.900
money or make your parents happy, because
in the end, you only have four years at Princeton,

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.790
and you want to be able to look back on them
and know that you make the most of them by

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.879
doing what you love.

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.140
I have four primary pieces of advice.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.140
One.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.049
Organize the files on your computer starting
freshman year, so that when you're a senior

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.940
you can find stuff again.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.760
It's terrible.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.760
Two.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.569
Go to office hours.

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.219
Professors and TAs love talking to students,
and you'll learn as much from them just kicking

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.829
it in their office as you would in class.

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.219
Three.

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:17.570
Email professors that you haven't even taken
class with.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.440
For the most part, they love talking to students,
and you can learn a lot from them just hanging

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.440
around.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.280
And four.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.050
Spend more time in the town.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.410
It's beautiful, and nothing treats you quite
as nice after a long day in Firestone or Frist

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.910
as a nice stay-cation in Palmer Square.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.033
Just bring a book, grab some iced tea, it's
beautiful.

00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:43.470
Again, we're stoked to have you join the Princeton
fam - see you in a few weeks.
