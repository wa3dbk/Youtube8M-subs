00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.440
Hi my name is Pamela Hill with Expert Village.com
and today I'm going to be showing you how

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.030
to deal Blackjack. Well the name of the game
is blackjack it's a gambling game. Another

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:18.360
name for blackjack is 21 and what a blackjack
consists of is an ace, and in every deck there

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.350
are four aces. And I'll just show you those...
There is the ace of spades, ace of hearts,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.619
ace of diamonds, and an ace of clubs. So you
have four suits. A blackjack consists of an

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:40.000
ace and a ten, and in each deck of cards you
have four types of tens. You have three picture

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:54.680
cards so you have four kings of every suit,
you have four queens of every suit and you

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:04.219
also have four jacks of every suit. This is
worth ten. And last but not least you have

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:13.619
four tens of every suit. So a blackjack is
an ace of any suit with a picture card. So

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:22.529
lets grab actually a blackjack. And this is
considered a blackjack. In a blackjack, it's

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:28.450
worth 21 that's the best thing you can get
in a game of blackjack. Blackjack is 21. When

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:36.689
a player has blackjack they get three to two
on their bet so for example if they bet fifty

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.880
the player would then get seventy-five which
is one and a half times their original bet,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.029
that the best thing they can get. The only
thing is if the dealer also gets a blackjack

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:54.639
the same time a player gets a blackjack its
called a push or a tie so the player doesn't

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:58.039
lose their original bet its just a tie and
they both win.
