Billy Crystal says:

00:00:04.868 --> 00:00:08.660
This audience is prettier
than Mountain Rockwood.

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:10.612
That was a joke.

00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:14.908
It's a reference to a mountain
that has the same name

00:00:15.242 --> 00:00:17.439
as Rockwood, the actor,
who you don't know...

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:19.661
Well, you can't translate that.

00:00:19.914 --> 00:00:22.482
Ellen DeGeneres answered
by saying:

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:26.843
This means you were not
at the Daily Show

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:28.368
on the day that...

00:00:28.764 --> 00:00:31.392
Well, the Daily Show is a show
hosted by Jon Stewart,

00:00:31.857 --> 00:00:34.771
and that was a joke focused
towards the American public

00:00:35.342 --> 00:00:39.180
who follow the TV shows and
it's unnecessary to translate.

00:00:39.491 --> 00:00:40.686
Billy Crystal, once again.

00:00:40.952 --> 00:00:43.174
Thank you, Matthew Chapman for...

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:46.002
It's a reference 
to a photography director

00:00:46.387 --> 00:00:48.363
who passed away in 2013.

00:00:48.657 --> 00:00:50.498
He was huge in the 1960s.

00:00:50.873 --> 00:00:53.680
Steve Martin made a joke
in reference to Miley Cyrus.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.641
I missed it because I was 
explaining the previous joke

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.976
in reference to Matthew Chapman.

00:00:59.338 --> 00:01:02.193
To present the award for
best actress: Whoopi Goldberg.

00:01:02.658 --> 00:01:04.685
The audience applauds intensely.

00:01:05.205 --> 00:01:07.373
Whoopi Goldberg says:

00:01:07.617 --> 00:01:10.920
Uh, uh, baby...
There's no translation for that.

00:01:11.185 --> 00:01:14.299
It's just a series 
of random sounds.

00:01:14.797 --> 00:01:17.482
with some visual humor,
an imagery joke.

00:01:18.156 --> 00:01:20.466
Or perhaps, it could be an imitation 
of someone I don't know.

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:23.764
The audience is laughing 
and I don't know why.

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:25.649
It's a mystery.

00:01:26.276 --> 00:01:29.199
Whoopi Goldberg says that
black people don't like...

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:33.218
I... I can't translate
that joke.

00:01:33.607 --> 00:01:36.760
Whoopi can make that joke because
she is black. I'm not black.

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:38.451
That would be awkward.

00:01:38.752 --> 00:01:42.072
It's a joke based 
on the preconception

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:44.992
that black people do not have
the habit of...

00:01:45.393 --> 00:01:48.350
I think she is talking about
the American ones.

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.732
There is no need to translate.

00:01:51.206 --> 00:01:53.342
Whoopi said something
I didn't quite understand.

00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:55.184
I think she was teasing Billy.

00:01:55.508 --> 00:01:58.062
They have been friends for a while
and it was a personal joke.

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:00.831
Whoopi answers with a
"Oh no, he didn't".

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.044
which in Portuguese means
"Oh no, he didn't do that".

00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:06.828
It's a repetition joke.
A running gag.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.074
It's an expression that lacks
a portuguese translation.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:13.429
It's a reference to a previous 
joke that I did not translate,

00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:17.545
because I was translating another
joke that I did not translate.

00:02:18.393 --> 00:02:20.959
Now I missed something that was
quite likely another joke,

00:02:21.352 --> 00:02:22.740
since the audience is laughing.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.277
The audience is applauding
from laughing so much.

00:02:25.727 --> 00:02:28.670
This Oscar Ceremony is turning
out to be really funny

00:02:29.047 --> 00:02:30.629
for everyone present
at the event.

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:38.534
Portela is presenting 
a revolutionary drum routine

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.832
where "surdos" and "repiques"
overlap themselves.

00:02:42.232 --> 00:02:46.651
You can see that the traditional
3x1 has a 2x1 break.

00:02:47.637 --> 00:02:49.900
It's revolutionary and the people
seem to be in ecstasy.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.320
The judges have no idea
of what's going on.

00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:55.752
I am not sure why,
to an outsider

00:02:56.097 --> 00:02:58.121
it all seems the same.

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:03.087
But it is revolutionary
what they are presenting.

00:03:03.411 --> 00:03:06.381
A new and revolutionary
drum routine.

00:03:06.743 --> 00:03:09.462
It will certainly make history.

00:03:10.011 --> 00:03:12.774
I don't know why, but...

00:03:13.077 --> 00:03:15.261
From what I can see, 
the judges look shocked

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.802
and they don't seem 
to be understanding.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.072
A new and revolutionary
drum routine.
