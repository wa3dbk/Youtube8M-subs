00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.440
I'm filled with wonder
because we were waiting for this.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.840
I'd not be here
without the Lumière brothers.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.880
Any filmmaker worthy of the name
follows in their footsteps.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.640
I'm very moved. It was the most
revolutionary invention.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.960
I cannot imagine a world
without films.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.800
I think it's very lavish,
very beautiful.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.080
It also really suits the Grand Palais.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.480
I'm flabbergasted, amazed.
It's incredible.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.320
It's quite a shock to see 1,500 films
showing at once. It's extraordinary.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.440
It's magical to be in the little café

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.160
watching the soldier
trying to climb on a horse.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.280
It's still funny, so that's great.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.280
For anyone who doesn't know anything
about cameras, for non-professionals,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.920
I think it's a really nice way
to discover the roots

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.080
and above all
the development of cinema.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.120
They brought the world to the world.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.440
And that's the proper role of cinema,
in my view.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.560
We all seek eternity. And it's
the only invention, until now,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.280
which gives us a sense of eternity.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.880
Define cinema in a word?

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.800
I've never thought about it.
I love the question.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.240
It's sacred.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.520
- The camera.
- Difficult.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.960
It's cinema.
