00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:23.040
We heard from a bunch of people that the Kepler
is really nice, we figured we need to do at

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.720
least one of the Great Walks while we’re
here.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.860
They’re not really that hard, so that’s
good.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.860
No, they’re very doable.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.860
This trail is much more well groomed than
a lot of the ones we’ve been hiking on.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.020
Its good to start this distance because it
goes back to the point of origin and you don’t

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.050
need to worry about leaving your luggage.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.660
It was beautiful walking along the top where
the trees are clear, and then you get out

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.460
and it’s a beautiful view and it was all
worth it!

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.460
There’s nothing better than being, you know,
together with people for a period of time,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.460
over several days on a track where there’s
no distraction from anything but each other,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.460
in the wilderness.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.760
Back at home I’m not really much of a hiker,
but I knew I was going to do quite a lot in

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.955
New Zealand, but when I got here its just
so amazing, its beautiful.

00:00:52.955 --> 00:00:53.955
Its such a good way to discover New Zealand

00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:59.469
Cos we’ve met people, for example, that
are travelling the South Island and are not

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:10.520
really tramping, and they don’t really see
the beauty of it.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:19.049
You have to get onto the tracks, and into
the wild to experience it.

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.210
I think its good to start with the Great Walks,
because everything is safe and controlled

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.550
and everything, so it’s a good start.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:40.600
Its good, it’s the type of thing that you
can do on your own, and you meet people. Its

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.600
very sociable actually.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.070
I would recommend it. Its not too hard, its
not too easy, it’s a good kind of balance.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.070
Its beautiful. I mean everywhere you turn
there is something amazing to look at. It

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.070
just never gets old.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.130
Its very nice to come here and be able to
have, like, wilderness that’s still wilderness,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.159
but at the same time you can come to a nice
hut and have a place to stay for a reasonable

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:55.399
price.
