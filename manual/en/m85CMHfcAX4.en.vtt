00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.110
Today we're going to teach you how do some

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.230
diamond grill marks using some pork chops.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.929
Now I have some pork chops here that we just cleaned off and

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.790
one of the key parts to giving your meat diamond grill marks is you need your meat to be dry.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.869
Before you put it on the grill. So we're just going to

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.460
dry this meat off real quick. Make sure we get

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.090
all the water from cleaning it off. We're going to get that off

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.070
and I'm going to tell you why in a second here. Okay so now the next step

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.789
we've taken our grill and we've cleaned it off with our Cave Tools Grill Brush

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.079
so it's nice and clean. Now the next step is we're going to

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.350
I've been pre-heating these grill grates and I just turned the fire off 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.800
real quickly so we can rub them down with a little bit of olive oil.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.090
It's just regular olive oil and now what this is going to do

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.100
since our meat is dry the olive oil is going to create some

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.600
lubrication on the grill grates.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.969
So when the heat goes on it it's going to bubble up and that's going to give us a

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.480
nice dark brown sear that we're looking for.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.350
So now we've cleaned our meat

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.890
we've dried it off and we've applied olive oil

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.000
to the grill grates. So now we're going to layer a 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.350
pork chop. I like to go diagonally across the grates

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.740
and we're cooking indoors. We're doing an indoor grill today.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.140
Specifically because we have thinner grill grates and I like that more

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.369
because it's just easier to get some really nice

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.200
diamond grill marks. Cooking our pork chops now and we're ready to do our 90 degree turns

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.150
so we're just going to

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.900
pick it up and go ninety degrees that
way so we can get

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.340
grill marks on the other side and this gives
us the diamond.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.299
We just finished grilling our

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.810
pork chops and as you can see we got
some really nice

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.520
diamond grill marks. So that's how you get 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.560
perfect diamond grill marks every time you grill.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.939
