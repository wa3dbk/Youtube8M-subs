00:00:00.446 --> 00:00:11.986
[Music] I went out and had the
opportunity to marry my son

00:00:12.326 --> 00:00:19.526
and daughter-in-law about six
years ago, and Calli was born

00:00:19.526 --> 00:00:21.786
on Christmas Day then,
about three years later.

00:00:22.106 --> 00:00:24.166
She was a joy, I have to say.

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:30.646
Probably 4 or 5 months
before this, she was at home

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:32.616
and she said to her mother,
"I want to go to school."

00:00:33.586 --> 00:00:36.086
And her mom said, "Well,
you can go to school

00:00:36.086 --> 00:00:38.846
if you can say your
ABCs and your 123s."

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:43.286
So, Calli rips off
her ABCs in English,

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.736
and then does them in Chinese.

00:00:44.916 --> 00:00:47.816
And did the same thing with her
numbers, in English and Chinese.

00:00:47.816 --> 00:00:49.906
So she was a very
intelligent kid.

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:54.226
And then it puts the parent
in a very difficult position.

00:00:54.226 --> 00:00:55.156
Then what do you tell her?

00:00:55.316 --> 00:01:00.596
Okay? She used to love to go to
this place called Sunrise Park,

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:02.686
which was about a block
and a half from her house.

00:01:03.556 --> 00:01:07.306
And so her mother took her to
Sunrise Park on December 1st,

00:01:07.386 --> 00:01:09.646
and they went into the park,
played for about an hour,

00:01:09.706 --> 00:01:11.746
and it was time to go home.

00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:15.436
And they left the park, and
then stopped at the curb.

00:01:15.686 --> 00:01:19.896
And they walked then from
that point on the curb,

00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:23.336
across a bike lane, which
was another five feet,

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:27.756
into the roadway, at which
point, at about the center

00:01:27.756 --> 00:01:29.876
of the roadway, was where
the driver hit Calli

00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:30.786
and killed her instantly.

00:01:31.376 --> 00:01:37.346
The day of the accident,
we were in Delaware,

00:01:37.586 --> 00:01:40.666
and our son called us
and said that Calli

00:01:40.736 --> 00:01:42.236
and Ling had been
in an accident.

00:01:42.296 --> 00:01:43.616
Calli had been killed
and Ling was

00:01:43.616 --> 00:01:45.716
in critical condition
at the hospital.

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:49.316
I mean, it was - it
was a huge loss for us.

00:01:50.146 --> 00:01:54.986
Even though we lost her, we
want everything that happened

00:01:54.986 --> 00:01:57.276
because of it to change
other people's behavior.

00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:00.446
And to think about what they're
doing and how they're doing it.

00:02:01.036 --> 00:02:04.316
And why it's so important
not to do those things.

00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:08.306
You know, paying attention
to a text message in the car

00:02:08.716 --> 00:02:11.846
and not paying attention to
what's going on out in front

00:02:11.846 --> 00:02:14.486
of you, which is where
your eyes should be, okay,

00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:16.226
can cause you to kill somebody.

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:20.426
Everybody in the car is
somewhat responsible, okay,

00:02:20.426 --> 00:02:23.316
for the actions of a
driver who violates the law

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:24.786
and texts while driving.

00:02:25.256 --> 00:02:27.706
Even if it's not a law
in your state, okay,

00:02:27.776 --> 00:02:30.676
doing that has severe
repercussions

00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:33.666
to not only yourself,
but to others.

00:02:33.696 --> 00:02:37.076
And the impact that you have
when you injure someone -

00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:41.066
that spreads to so many
members of the family and goes

00:02:41.136 --> 00:02:42.716
to so many people
in the community.

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:44.676
It's - it's devastating.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:52.596
[Music] Distracted
driving kills,

00:02:52.886 --> 00:02:56.636
safe driving starts with you.
