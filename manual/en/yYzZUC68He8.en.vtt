g'day welcome to the simple cooking
Channel today I'm going to show you how

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:23.340
to make two ingredient pizza dough so
easy unbelievably yummy let's go now

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.960
this is super super simple just get 1
cup of Greek yogurt or just natural

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.489
yogurt and 1 cup of self-raising flour
just two ingredients I'm using that

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.950
yogurt so put that in a mixing bowl and
then you add 1 cup self-raising flour

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.829
that's it all done now just drink now
all you need to do is mix it together

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:58.559
you can I just usually just use my hands
and just mix it together you can use a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:12.740
spoon if you don't like using your hands
for this put that down and just knead it

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:21.689
just keep kneading it probably take
about 3 minutes 5 minutes just add flour

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:33.000
as you need it there you go
go easy now just try and roll it into

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.350
the shape of a pizza base isn't that
easy seriously

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.750
copy yogurt cup of flour and you'll end
up using more flour than the cup just

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.549
through the process of kneading it but
that's just your start point there you

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:03.090
go beautiful pizza base 2 ingredients
yogurt and flour well I hope you like

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:12.470
