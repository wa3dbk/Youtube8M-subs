Hello and welcome to Deko Kitchen

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.020
Today I will show you how to make 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.340
a christmas ornament from paper and pipe cleaners

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.240
first you have to cut out 3 shapes of a heart

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.500
I used scrapbooking paper for the shapes

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.440
to fold the hearts I take a cutter knife

00:00:50.440 --> 00:01:02.200
and draw a thin line along the center

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:21.500
so it's easier to fold the thick paper

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.580
now I take the 3 pieces of paper

00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:37.821
and put them together like this

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.460
to fix the hearts I sew them together

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.620
leave the yarn a little bit longer

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.300
so you can use it as suspension

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.580
now I take 6 pipe cleaners

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.240
I cut them twice the length of the hearts

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:19.700
put glue onto the middle of the folding

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:32.500
and press the pipe cleaner on it

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.820
that's what it look's like when all the pipe cleaners 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.040
are glued on the hearts

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.680
now I take the pipe cleaner and bend it 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.060
to the lower end of the heart

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.440
I glue the ends of the pipe cleaners together

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.500
in addition I fix them with a yarn

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:20.900
that's the finished christmas ornament

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.820
Thank you for watching my video!

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.180
Looking forward to see you :-)

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.260
Bye bye!!!
