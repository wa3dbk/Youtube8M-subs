00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.880
A new image released to celebrate the 23rd
anniversary of Hubble has captured a stunning

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:16.000
infrared view of the Horsehead Nebula, one
of the most distinctive objects in our skies.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.090
These infrared observations pierce through
parts of the thick, obscuring dust, revealing

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:31.220
the delicate wisps of gas that make up the
HorseheadÕs famous and familiar shape.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.179
Some of us have followed Hubble from its conception
and birth, through its childhood and teenage

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.339
years, to see it emerge as a fully-fledged
adult.

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:45.829
Now, at the age of 23, Hubble is aging Ñ
but more capable than ever.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.699
And every year of observing continues to bring
us cutting-edge science, and stunning astronomical

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.159
images.

00:00:54.159 --> 00:01:00.269
Some of the most striking and beautiful subjects
of these images have been nebulae.

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:12.940
These come in all shapes and sizes, and often
seem to take on familiar or recognizable forms.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.860
Nebulae are vast interstellar clouds of gas
and dust.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.440
There are several different types of nebulae,
and they can take on a wide range of shapes

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.150
and appearances.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.370
For example, the Eagle Nebula was formed by
a collapsing interstellar cloud, and it glows

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:38.120
due to the hot new stars forming within and
around it.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.430
Some nebulae form in much more dramatic ways
Ñ like the Helix Nebula, for example.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:50.880
It is the result of a once Sun-like star blowing
off its outer layers.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.080
Or the Crab Nebula, which is what remains
of a massive star that exploded as a supernova

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.470
back in 1054.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.139
One of the most striking and distinctive nebulae
in our skies is the Horsehead Nebula, due

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:15.530
to its clear and curiously familiar shape.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:25.090
Hubble imaged this nebula back in 2001 to
celebrate its 11th year of observing Ñ and

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:33.129
now, over a decade later, it is again involved
in the telescopeÕs birthday celebrations.

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:40.560
Rising from a sea of gas and dust like a giant
sea horse, this dusty region is a great example

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:49.849
of a dark nebula Ñ a cold, dark, cloud silhouetted
against a background of glowing gas.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:56.900
But despite this nebulaÕs fame and popularity,
this new image from Hubble now shows it in

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.909
a whole new light Ñ quite literally!

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.560
This image was taken in the infrared.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.040
In infrared light, we can pierce right through
some of the bulky plumes of dusty material

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.829
which usually mask and obscure the inner regions
of the Horsehead.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.459
The result is this rather fragile-looking
structure, made of delicate, wispy folds of

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:32.790
gas Ñ very different to the nebulaÕs appearance
in the visible.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.840
Infrared light has longer wavelengths than
visible light.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.090
We cannot see this radiation with our eyes
alone, and so have capable infrared telescopes

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:51.159
or instruments Ñ for example, HubbleÕs Wide
Field Camera 3.

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:57.079
Seemingly normal-looking areas of sky can
suddenly appear to be dramatically different

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:03.709
in this part of the spectrum.

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.879
This striking new view of the Horsehead Nebula
is a fitting celebration of an incredible

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:26.370
23 years of the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.290
This is Dr J, signing off for the Hubblecast.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.660
Once again, nature has surprised us beyond
our wildest imagination.
