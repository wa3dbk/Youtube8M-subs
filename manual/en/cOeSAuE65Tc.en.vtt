Hostas, now they will blue things but
when you're getting the belly uninspired

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.990
this is what you get through the post
and it looks a bit sad but in actual

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.490
fact, if you're a gardener you're an
optimist, because that is going to turn

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.250
into a wonderful plant, now you put it in
water overnight just give it a good soak,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.000
24 hours do no harm and it swells up
just like that, you say oh that's

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.529
starting to burst
it's a greyhound it wants to go and all

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.460
it required was moisture because these
are kept in cool store so they last for

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.200
ages and ages but that's ready to go now
the simplest thing in the world few

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.510
pebbles in the bottom of your pot just
so the water can run away multi-purpose

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.500
compost and just place it gently on the
top there just spread them out quite

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.969
nicely a little bit more multi-purpose
on the top there. Now Hostas got the name

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:02.129
from a physician to the king of Austria
in the 1700 called Thomas hast so you

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.409
might like to know that now obviously
there's lots of different Hostas

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.070
hundreds if you go to the website and
it's the probably the multiple plant in

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.900
America but the thing is I like the
common garden one sites have success

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.799
when I'm doing gardening but there's a
designer range which are really equally

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.590
easy to grow but they obviously get very
more expensive. Now this is alba

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.689
marginata a good doer a good grower will
cause you no problems whatsoever and

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.380
grows away like that that's probably
been in there six weeks and it's a

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.270
lovely thing but there's something that
likes these more than me and that slugs

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.939
and snails now there are there are many
ways to stop slugs and snails all wives

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:52.770
tales as there are hostas so one of the
ways is cross gravel now Sargent snails

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.049
run on a bed of slime if you put Chris
gravel in the bottom they don't like it

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.360
it's so comfortable it's not nice so
you're hoping that they push off and go

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.649
somewhere else and it is a slight
deterrent there's Nemus lugs which is a

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.069
clay-like product with a small microbe
in that you

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.579
you're washing gives you six weeks
coverage does actually work they're

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:23.569
really at this copper banded now here's
a new thing this is really good

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.090
you can do do just as well with copper
wire that's sticky-backed

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.049
you put it round the edge there right
the way round so the snail comes up up

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.409
touches that this holds an electrical
charge just naturally because coppers

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.510
such a good conductor holds a natural
charge it touches it with its slime roof

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.209
its eyes bulge it gets all jittery and
pushes off the next door's garden

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.599
fantastic this stuffed but as I say
there's lots and lots but the plant

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.829
themselves are so easy you can have them
in pots like that in tubs put them

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.450
straight out in the borders I do like
them in pots on more say cuz I like to

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.129
be up close and comfortable with them
but Albemarle Janata are a designer one

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.290
try these it fantastic
