00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.640
What's up guys?

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.450
This is Zac with Attack Gaming with a First
Impressions video for Panzer General

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.809
Online, a unique turn-based strategy game
played right from your internet browser.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.809
Panzer General

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:21.390
Online is developed by BluByte and published
by UbiSoft.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.070
Panzer General takes place across an isometric
2D plane right from your browser.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.109
Unit models are in

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.150
3D set against 2D squares.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.760
Unlike more traditional turn-based strategy
titles, Panzer General operates

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:45.410
off of a card-based system and the field of
war is comparatively small.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.600
The objective of the game is to

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.010
destroy the fortress behind enemy lines.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.559
There are three lanes of attack on the battle
field with three

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:06.540
spaces in front of and behind enemy lines.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:19.479
Units can be placed at the front of the lines
to attack enemies and 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.799
can be supported by other troops

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.900
such as tanks or mortar teams which can fire
from behind offering added firepower based

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.900
on how units

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.900
are arranged.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:44.420
The various cards in your arsenal can be collected
traded, and sorted to provide 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.420
the ultimate control

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.420
over the perfect deck.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.909
Various cards allow you to perform various
actions such as calling air strikes,

00:01:49.909 --> 00:02:00.270
sending units for attack, or allowing for
multiple units to attack simultaneously.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:14.510
You'll need all the help you can get as the
enemy AI is fairly ruthless and the game requires

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.840
a solid

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.390
understanding of the basic mechanics before
you start winning matches.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.470
As ruthless as the enemy AI

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:49.150
can be in single player, you 
can also take your talents to the multiplayer

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.099
arena and try your skills and

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:11.069
your deck against players from all over the
world.

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:18.409
For fans of turn-based strategy titles Panzer
General is a solid entry into what is turning

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.470
into quite a

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.849
crowded genre.
