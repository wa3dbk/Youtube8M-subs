00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.880
So there's this huge gelatinous blob in the
ocean that's supposed to be from a squid.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.100
How does that work?

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.740
Let's talk about squid babies.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.379
Specifically, ommastrephid squid babies.

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.349
Ommastrephids are sometimes called flying
squid because they can fly.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.169
They're big--but not giant.

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:21.620
Even the biggest ommastrephid squid, the Humboldt
squid, is usually smaller than a human.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.570
Unless you stretch out the tentacles, which
is cheating.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.970
So how does something this size make something
that size?

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.700
Let's look at a female Humboldt squid.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:39.010
She has a body, fins, a head, arms--eight
arms and two hidden tentacles--eyes, and a

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.829
funnel for squirting water to help her swim.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:49.909
On the inside, she has an ovary, two oviducts,
two oviducal glands, and two big nidamental

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:51.059
glands.

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.469
Also three hearts and a bunch of other stuff
we don't care about now.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.800
I'm not going to draw a male squid because
they're basically irrelevant except for providing

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.469
packages of sperm, which the female stores
around her mouth, in the middle of her arms.

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.190
When she's ready to lay, her oviducts fill
up with ripe eggs.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.390
What happens next, no one has ever seen, but
we have a good guess: The eggs go through

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.030
the oviducal glands, and get coated with protective
jelly.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.610
Then the big nidamental glands make a second
kind of jelly, which gets mixed with the eggs

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.810
and squirted out the funnel.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.740
Now the eggs are right next to the sperm,
so they can get fertilized, and finally mom

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.750
lets go of the whole mass.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.280
Then the jelly reacts with the seawater, and
starts to expand.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.280
It expands.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.990
And expands.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.730
And eventually we have a gelatinous mass the
size of a car, and it's so dilute at this

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.330
point that a diver can actually swim through
it.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.520
The squid's many, many eggs are all suspended
within this matrix, spread out from each other

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.910
so there's no crowding and everyone can breathe.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.580
How many eggs are we talking about?

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.030
Well, the one Humboldt squid egg mass that
we've ever seen had somewhere between half

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.180
a million and two million eggs in it.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.950
All of them from one female?

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.810
Yeah, we think so.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.160
An individual female can have more than a
million eggs ripe and ready to go in her oviducts.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.200
As for the ovary, it can contain millions
more unripe eggs, so one mom can make quite

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.430
a few egg masses.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.400
If the ocean is full of egg masses and squid
babies, why don't we see them more often?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.670
Because the egg masses are transient and transparent,
which makes it really unlikely that a diver

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.920
will stumble across one.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.120
And they're too deep underwater to spot from
the surface.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.780
As for the babies, sure there are a lot of
them, but they're tiny!

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.780
Each squid baby, when it hatches, is no bigger
than a grain of rice.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.830
Really cute, though.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.420
And most of them do get eaten.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.310
For the population to remain stable, the babies
face a survival rate of a one ten-thousandth

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.370
of a percent.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.120
And that's life as a baby squid!
