To clean a salt water aquarium, very similar
to a fresh water aquarium, I recommend doing

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.349
it very, very regularly.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.340
You don't want to let a salt water aquarium's
parameters get out of whack.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.980
You don't want the pH to drift out of range,
your nitrates to get too high.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.270
You don't want to shock the system.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.200
The idea is to maintain a good environment.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.110
The best way to do that is with weekly maintenance.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.980
Now, that doesn't mean you have to devote
an hour or two every week to the aquarium.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.340
It does mean that you have to devote 20 to
30 minutes.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.980
But, if you love your aquarium it should be
no problem.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.250
You should enjoy doing it.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.330
So, to clean your aquarium you want to clean
the algae, obviously.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.220
You want to always have the viewing panel
look as good and clean as possible.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.620
To do that just use a regular algae brush.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.010
Just be careful if you have an acrylic tank
that you don't use one intended for glass

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.010
as you will scratch your acrylic.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.739
A lot of the cleaning magnets work really
well.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.720
One goes on the inside, one goes on the outside,
and you can run the magnet along the outside

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.760
of the aquarium without getting your hands
dirty.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.339
That cleans the algae off the inside viewing
panel.

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.939
Also, when you do regular water changes I
recommend gravel or sand siphoning to get

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.490
a lot of the waste, detritus, and fecal matter
that's been building up in the sand bed.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.130
You want to free that.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.910
Siphon it into a bucket.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.650
You could also pull out some of the decorations
before you do your water change as a lot of

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.590
the waste accumulates under the decorations.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.250
Then the decorations themselves, depending
on what they are and how they look, some of

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.400
them can be cleaned too.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.780
But you don't want to go overboard.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.050
If you're going to do a water change and clean
the decorations I recommend not cleaning your

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.160
filtration until like a week later.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.080
So it's good to do it on a schedule where
you do your filtration one week, the water

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.310
change on the following week, because the
goal is to minimize the shock to the system.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.110
Every time you do something to the aquarium
you're shocking the balance of the system.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.570
The bacteria that's been growing in there
doesn't like to be shocked, and if you shock

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.240
it too much it'll result in some die off and
you could have an ammonia or nitrite spike

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.300
a couple of days after you do some aquarium
servicing.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.759
So, keep all those tips in mind and, again,
minimize the stress to the aquarium.
