Hello its Neil Ball here from work with Neil
Ball and today in this video I'm going to

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.480
demonstrate how to create an image or banner
that when you hover the mouse over it changes

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.750
in some ways for example if you take this
banner on the right hand side of my website

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:31.721
as I hover over the mouse it causes the image
to change like that. Now it is very straight

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:39.980
forward to do, this is actually one image,
its actually made up of an image like this,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.511
which is the two image side by side so you've
got the image on the left, which is the image

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:54.149
which is shown before the mouse hovers over,
the right hand image is then shown. There

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.820
is a little bit of code you need to make that
happen, but it is very straight forward, so,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.290
you start off with the left and the right
image. They both have to be exactly the same

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:14.120
size. And what you do then is you put them
together on a single image. With a space down

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.450
the middle of something like ten. That is
approximately what I have done, I've got so

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.500
that they are not overlapping and there is
a distinct difference between the two of them.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.640
You could probably get away with a smaller
gap than that but I usually always work with

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:42.530
ten so if I now create another image now,
it's a very straightforward process, you are

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:52.659
going to be doing, 580 and the height on this
was 543 so I will just create a new image

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:06.200
like that and then it is a question of them
positioning the images to the left and the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:14.950
right, once you have created the larger sized
image so again I can duplicate that and send

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.630
it to a new image so here we have it, we have
got the left image and the right image, so

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.819
this one is the right image, so we are just
going to slide that over to the right, like

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:41.140
that until it is perfectly lined up. And then
the left image 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:58.560
and this one we are just going to position
to the left. I usually save it as PNG so that

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:06.879
is fairly straightforward and the next thing
you are going to do is to go into Wordpress

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:13.651
and media and add the image to the image library
you are just going to upload it and you are

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:19.330
going to get URL I will just show you now
as I have just done this fairly recently on

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:31.980
here. So here it is and you are going to grab
this URL here which is the URL of the image,

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.840
and then there is some code which I shall
absolutely supply to you on my website if

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.830
you come to my website which is WorkWithNeilBall.com
as you can see at the top. I'll actually put

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.940
a link at the side of this video on You Tube
or something click the link, I'll put the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:59.730
code on my webpage so you can grab it off
the page and copy and paste it onto your website

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:11.550
and put your link in there to get it working.So,
if we now go into widgets which is in appearance.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:23.289
We go right side bar, what you need to do
is, you need to drag a text box across over

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:28.740
into the side bar widget that is going to
be displayed. You need to be put a text widget

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.430
into the side bar are and then what you will
do is, you will then copy this code which

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:42.250
I am showing you now on the screen into that
box. Now a couple of things about this, you

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.860
now set on here this first part of it. You
set the size of the image that you want to

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.330
display because what actually happens here
is that as you hover the mouse over the image,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.589
it goes from showing the left hand side of
the image to the right hand side of the image.

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:07.659
So at any time you are only going to see the
width of the image. The two images that I

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:14.020
am using there on the single image are 285
wide. So the left hand image is 285 and the

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:21.909
right hand image is 285 and the height is
483 so these settings here need to be the

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:28.900
size you want to display so then what you
are going to do here is this background setting

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.830
here is where you put the URL of the image
that you have uploaded which is the big image

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.229
which I have just showed you there, that is
the URL which we have just taken there and

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.479
the only other thing you need to do is, I
have put some extra code on here, for when

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:50.340
you are clicking it to when you are clicking
the image, the image, you will then be taken

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.161
to another page.So what I will do is, I will
put all of that on my websites, so that you

00:05:56.161 --> 00:06:04.759
can easily copy and paste it rather than trying
to copy it off this video prone to mistakes

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:12.639
and once you've done that and you save it
then you should get an image like this. Which

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:19.520
is really effective and really simple. There
is nothing fancy about it at all and here

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.369
are a number of people out that as I said
earlier who are making this incredibly complicated

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:31.539
when it isn't that is how you make an image
that changes as a hover over as you did like

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:36.679
that. Which is a great way of getting peoples
attention that navigate round your website.So

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:42.750
I am Neil Ball from work with Neil Ball, if
you need any other hints and tricks have a

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.499
look at my website which is WorkWithNeilBall.com
and I will speak to you again. Thank you.

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:48.939
Goodbye
