00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.360
Five reds. Wait till they go off.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.720
Whoa.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.640
This is a Volvo FH.
That was a Koenigsegg One:1.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.960
I'm Tiff Needell, driving the world's
first truck with a dual-clutch gearbox

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.640
based on sports car technology.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.760
Coming up, I test-drive a Volvo FH
with the new I-Shift Dual Clutch gearbox

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.640
at the Ring Knutstorp race circuit
in Sweden,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.280
and we also get to borrow the world's
first megacar, a Koenigsegg One:1,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.440
for an ultimate duel,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.600
where I challenge
Koenigsegg's test driver to a race.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.480
I reckon we can do one lap in the truck

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.480
faster than the Koenigsegg can do two.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.240
Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.800
On the one hand we have a
state-of-the-art heavy haulage machine,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.640
the Volvo FH,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.800
on the other,
the streamlined Koenigsegg One:1,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.360
two totally different vehicles
built for totally different purposes.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.280
So why bring a super car
to a truck test?

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.520
Well, Volvo claim
that under the hood of this truck

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.200
lies the heart of a sports car.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.000
So I'm here to see
if there's any sense in that claim.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.640
What better candidate for a comparison
than the Koenigsegg One:1,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.880
the first ever megacar?

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.280
In racing and sports cars,
this sort of gearbox technology

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.280
has been around since the mid '80s,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.080
its main purpose to provide
faster acceleration,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.880
a pretty nifty feature in a racing car.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.320
But in a truck, its function
is a little bit more than that.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.240
Having spent most of my life

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.400
behind steering wheels
of various racing, sports

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.080
and even Formula One cars,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.440
I see myself
as a fairly competent test driver.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.480
But to help me with some of
the technicalities of the truck,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.040
I've brought along
an expert on the subject.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.920
Jeff Bird, Volvo Trucks
press test director,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.880
who's gonna tell me
all about this wonderful new gearbox.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.440
I certainly am, Tiff,
but I'm a little concerned

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.320
about what you have planned for us.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.040
The challenge. No, don't worry
about that. We'll sort that out later.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.200
First let's drive this truck.
I think I'd better get down to work.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.200
Release the handbrake
and we're ready to drive.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.680
Hey.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.360
Oh, bit narrow here.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.040
It feels too big to me, Jeff.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.800
Not at all.
You can handle this, Tiff, no problem.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.880
Hairpin.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.840
Squealing tyres already.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.440
Does it have a kick-down or not?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.600
Yes, it has a kick-down.
Just press that pedal to the floor.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.880
Open the throttle and that is frisky.
It leaps off.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.560
Acceleration is impressive for a truck.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.280
Mind you, I'm not carrying a trailer
behind me. I'm cheating slightly.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.400
We're only running at eight tons
on the track here today.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.960
I tell you, this corners really well.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.120
Very light on the steering
and responsive.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.720
I thought I'd be turning like a knob
on the wheel to get more lock on.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.600
- Brakes.
- Pretty good.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.520
They work. Yeah, OK. I'm having fun.
Actually, I'm having too much fun.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.760
We're supposed to be here
to talk about this wonderful gearbox.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.320
So if I stop on this hill...

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.240
So now I wanna do a hill start.
I'm in third gear now.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.320
Gentle acceleration.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.440
Four, I didn't feel that. Five...
I haven't felt a single gear change.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.120
Four, five, six, eight.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.800
Seamless gear changes improves
drivability and more comfortable.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.440
What are you aiming at, the purpose,
the main thing you've introduced?

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.560
Trucks don't need to be
like racing cars. What's the main aim?

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.880
It improves performance,
hill-climb performance, acceleration,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.320
but also drivability
and comfort, of course.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.120
I'm very comfortable.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.440
Right, where's that Koenigsegg?

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.880
OK, Jeff, because
these nice people at Koenigsegg

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.200
have lent us their first ever megacar,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.640
I thought we ought to have
a little challenge.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.400
Yes, that's what's
been worrying me all day.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.240
Nothing can possibly go wrong.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.720
Look, we obviously can't compare
these two vehicles directly,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.760
but I reckon we can do
one lap in the truck

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.960
faster than the Koenigsegg can do two.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.160
So it's us in an eight-ton truck

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.280
racing against
one of the fastest cars in the world.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.280
- What could possibly go wrong?
- Relax. I'm feeling really confident.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.080
Aren't you, Robert?

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.240
See? That's Robert Serwanski.
He's Koenigsegg's official test driver.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.560
He's relaxed, and we're about
to find out if he's any good or not.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.040
So, just to give you a few numbers.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.440
The car has 1360 horsepower
and weighs 1360kg,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.520
which makes it the first ever
series produced super car

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.080
with a one to one power to weight ratio.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.920
It also has 1371
Newton metres of torque.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.720
The truck has a 540 horsepower engine

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.960
that produces
2600 Newton metres of torque,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.560
which is almost double that of the car.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.640
Hey. Feel the torque of the engine.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.320
Fantastic.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.280
Engage gear.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.080
Wait for these lights.
How's he looking? A bit small.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.240
I think he's worried, Tiff.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.320
Red lights are coming on.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.760
Five reds. Wait till they go off.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.600
Whoa.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.880
Jeff, we need to accelerate faster.
The Koenigsegg's gone.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.920
I've just gone over to 95.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.800
I'd better brake for the corner.
Nearly forgot.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.840
Whoa. She's sliding now, Jeff.
She's sliding.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.600
He may have accelerated fast,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.520
but he's got all these corners,
he's got two laps to do.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.520
It's lovely. This is much more fun
than I thought it was ever gonna be.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.360
My God. This is exciting.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.600
Can you see him? Has he disappeared?

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.520
He's gone. He's heading
down the main straight already.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.240
What do they call this corner?

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.800
This is called the idiot corner,
justifiably so.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.360
Understeered.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.040
And then it lights up the rear.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.640
We're nearly there. Where's the mirrors?

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.040
I can just see him coming.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.640
He's already coming. I can't believe it.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.160
- Go, go, go!
- We can hold on.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.480
Here he comes.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.040
He's not coming through there.
I've chopped him.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.160
- Oh, no! He's coming this side.
- No.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.720
We made it across the finish line
in one piece.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.720
We so nearly won that.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.560
But at least we've proved
that the Volvo truck

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.200
is half as fast as a Koenigsegg One:1.
