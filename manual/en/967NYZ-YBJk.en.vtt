00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.240
Researchers at MIT have come up with an innovative approach

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.620
for creating Transparent

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.620
Displays inexpensively, while providing

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.700
wide viewing angle and scalability to large

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.500
sizes. This Transparent display

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.930
is created by the resonant nanoparticle scattering.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.449
To create this transparent display, silver nanoparticles

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.560
are embedded in the transparent material. And,The particles are

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.010
tuned to scatter only certain wavelengths  of light

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.399
and let all other wavelengths through. 
In this example

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.030
it is tuned to scatter only blue color. Silver nanoparticles

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.440
about the size of 60 nanometers  were used

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.020
to produce this blue image. The nanoparticles

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.390
are invisible to humans.
As of now it works

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.070
blue color only. But the researchers believe that

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.690
it can be easily enhanced to a muti-color display

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.869
by creating nano paticles that can scatter

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.680
other primary colors red and green.
The ability to display graphics

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.020
and texts on a transparent screen can enable many useful applications.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.610
For example, they could bring navigation data to windshields

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.290
of cars and aircraft, and advertisements

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.159
to the sides of skyscrapers.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.750
Cheap "stick-on screens" could be developed using this technology.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.590
The messages broadcast on nanoparticle screens

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.079
are accessible from virtually every angle.
It could

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.450
turn any window into a movie screen.
Transparent screens

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.110
themselves are not new; For example, Google is working on

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.390
Google glass. But they are expensive.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.890
This MIT invention will help to produce transparet displays

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.810
easily and inexpensively.
