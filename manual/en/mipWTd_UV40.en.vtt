Bonjour mes Gourmands,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.939
after we spent a bit more time in the kitchen
for last week's fried noodles I thought it

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.540
was about time I showed you another one of
my emergency recipes.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.030
I always keep some puff pastry and minced
meat in my freezer at home, so I'm always

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.210
prepared for guests who spontaneously decide
to drop by.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.789
With this shortcut recipe for a popular French
snack in Vietnam you'll be done in the kitchen

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.170
in no time!

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.560
For this recipe you'll need:

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.410
300g Minced meat
2 pck/ 900g puff pastry (19,5cm x 10,5cm)

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.740
1 large onion
3 pcs garlic

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.180
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp Salt

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.260
1 tbs soy sauce/Maggi sauce
2 Egg Yolks

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.060
First, peel and mince the garlic and the onion.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.440
I like to use red onion because I find they're
a bit milder in taste, but you can of course

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.390
use the regular yellow onion, too.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:02.960
Then add the garlic, the seasoning and the
onion to the meat, give it a good mix and

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.600
the filling is ready.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.539
Preheat the oven to 200°C or 390°F.

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:17.880
The size of my puff pastry sheets is 19,5
by 10,5 cm or 7,5 by 4 inches.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.210
You can certainly use them as they are to
make bigger pieces, but I like mine smaller,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.280
so I'm cutting the sheets into halves.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.109
I'm putting one to one and a half tsp full
of filling onto the sheet and I'm folding

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:31.149
it into half.

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.259
You can either seal the edges by pressing
them together with a flat object or you can

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.310
simply crimb the edges with a fork like me.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.819
I find this makes them look even better afterwards!

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.340
Lay the pastry pockets onto a rack lined with
parchment paper and brush the surface with

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.609
some egg wash.

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.490
This will give them a lovely golden color
in the oven.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.320
Don't use too much egg wash, though, as it
will otherwise make the puff pastry layers

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.789
stick together and therefore prevent it from
rising.

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:05.630
Bake the Pâté Chaud in the oven for 20 minutes
and enjoy them while they're still hot!

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.810
The original recipe actually calls for some
liver pie, hence the word pâté in pâté

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.530
chaud, but these pâtés chauds are just as
delicious without it.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.000
I hope you'll give this snack a try soon,
if you do then don't forget to share some

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.440
pictures of your edible piece of art with
me over twitter or Instagram!
