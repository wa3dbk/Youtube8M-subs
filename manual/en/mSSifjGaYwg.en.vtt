00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.860
Welcome to the 30-day challenge to improve your position.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.240
I am Hester Bransen from Riders’ Feeling.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.260
The tip I have for you today is about medium trot rising.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.760
In medium trot, if you rise high, you horse’s gait won’t improve.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.840
In fact, you are moving further away from your horse and your movement is getting less coordinated.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.540
And that is not the intention in medium trot as the stride has to lengthen. 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:44.480
It is good to stay close to your horse while posting the trot.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:57.040
If you stay close to your horse, you can use your weight aids better to encourage him to engage its hind legs.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.400
By doing so, you are actually getting a nicer medium trot.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.280
How can you activate the hind legs in rising trot?

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.780
By tilting your pelvis slightly backward.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.940
Not forward, but backward.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.540
You have to be pretty quick because you only have a split of a second to do this. 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.080
You keep close to your horse, and you slightly push your tailbone forward with the movement when sitting in the saddle.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.460
It is a very tiny tilt.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.780
You won’t be able do it at once and you won’t be able to learn it with a video.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.780
But being aware of the fact that you have to rise not too high and to stay close to your horse already helps.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.960
I will show you both ways and hopefully you will also see a difference in how the horse is moving.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.820
I sit stiller when I stay close to my horse.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.680
I wish you a lot of success, I am sure you will succeed!
