Hi everyone, this is Silent Age,

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.809
please excuse the graphics if they
go a little strange in places

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.210
we seem to be having a little problem with the compressor and the particular graphic style

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.199
that the developers have used here. It's very
much a problem with our equipment and not

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.310
a problem with the game.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.570
So please, you will find the graphics are brilliant with this game don't let this

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.119
slight graphical glitching we're having

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.400
here put you off. Now Silent Age is a

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.329
touch and click I suppose you could call it, adventure game. The idea is to uncover

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:38.040
the mystery

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.920
of what is happening to this particular
chap and it all takes place

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.120
I don't really want to spoil it too much and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.090
give away kind of one of the the key plot
points but time travel

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.260
is involved so the idea

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.710
is to click around the environment to
the various areas you need to go

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.880
to uncover the mystery and like all
great point and click adventure games

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.530
a certain element of thinking is going to
have to be involved. You'll have to solve

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.119
puzzles,

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.820
you'll have to look at the items in your
inventory and work out which items you

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.409
need

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.650
to complete the various tasks to move on.
This can sometimes lead to a slightly

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.000
frustrating experience of

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.130
randomly clicking around the place
trying to work out what you need to do

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.830
next and doubling back on yourself and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.110
wandering around a little bit but
overall the music,

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.210
the graphics, the story

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.510
that they've put together is fantastic and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.180
you really do need to check out this
title. You

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.409
in many respects will find yourself
going wow

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.650
just unbelievable wow.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.060
These are the kind of games that we've
kind of been lacking on Android that aren't

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.450
just remakes of previous titles like
Broken Sword etcetera

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.650
but are actually something original
and new

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.979
and like I say the graphics whilst maybe
are

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.330
simplistic to some, to me are just full of

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.170
atmosphere and they capture that simpler
time in gaming

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.570
but with so much detail and so much kind
of

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.750
life to them that it just drags you into
this world in a way that

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.430
I haven't really had from a game for
a very long time.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.799
It's certainly a much more involving
game than many out there

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.790
and one that will keep you wanting to play to  uncover the whole story.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.939
Like I say, I really don't want to spoil any of the plot on this title, I'd

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:27.930
urge you to play it yourself and kind of
experience what Silent Age is all about

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.389
because it really is a cracking title.
