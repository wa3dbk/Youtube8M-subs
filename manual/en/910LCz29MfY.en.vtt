Hi I'm Miss Pop, a New York City based nail
artist, and we are here at my favorite bar/nail

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:07.650
salon.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.880
Beauty Bar, right here on 14th St in New York
City.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.350
Today I'm going to show you my favorite nail
designs and let you in on some secrets.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.640
So lets get started.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.189
So this is a color wheel; just of a bunch
of different rhinestone colors.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.970
You can get them even off of amazon, at any
nail supply store they also have vino shapes

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.970
which are great.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.450
The best way to apply them is to add a sort
of a top coat special for rhinestones because

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.870
you want the shiny look and if you get that
regular top coat it would give it sort of

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.640
a glassy funky not so good look, it will take
away its shine so don't do that.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.680
So I got these acrylic paints at a nail supply
store, but really all acrylic paint is created

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.080
equally you can go to a art supply store:
it's all the same stuff, all acrylic works.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.980
So this is a dotter or motter, its perfect
for making dots or poke a dots or circles

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.580
or anything you need perfectly round it does
it like magic.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.390
Usually dotters are double sided so it will
give you two choices of options or size dot

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.390
per dotter but if you just buy a set its a
10 dollar investment, 15 dollar investment,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.430
and then here I have a variety of brushes.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.170
long and then short and fat, even a little
bit of a fatter stabler looking brush so you

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.909
can do kind of bigger swipes.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.601
And then i have this tiny tiny tiny tweezer,
I would never use this on a body part, it

00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:33.590
is pointy and sharp but its perfect for picking
up rhinestones.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.120
Then there is the orange stick.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.500
This is great for just cleaning up around
the edges of your nail, it really gets into

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.590
the corners.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.020
so its great to keep acetone and water on
hand.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.119
Water is for acrylics only but the acetone
is great for the nail polish because it takes

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.520
it right out of the brushes that was how your
going to keep your brushes clean and fresh

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.530
and movable so you can paint and paint away.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.250
So those are the tools your going to need
to get started.
