00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
with my friend Tubby and Freckles

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and my two best friends come on let's sing a song

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Holy Holy we have come to hear todoys story

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
aha I will tell you a story today only if Gumbo answers my question at the end

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
he never listens to my stories carefully all right I will

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
so today's story is about a rich man and a beggar

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
a long time ago there once lived a rich man he wore very expensive clothes

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and had plenty of good food and everything else that he could need

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
near the rich man's home lived a beggar called Lazarus he was very poor and had nothing to eat

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
every day he would come to the rich man's gate hoping to get leftovers from the rich man's table

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
one day the poor man died and the Angels took him to heaven

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to sit beside Abraham few days later the rich man also died

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and he was sent to hell there he was in great pain

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
he looked up and saw Abraham faraway with Lazarus at his sight

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
he asked Abraham for help to release him from the pain

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Abraham said my son remember in your lifetime you had only good things

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
but Lazarus had only bad things now he is very happy here and you are in pain

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
also there is a deep pit between us

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
those who want to cross over from here to you cannot do so

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
nor any one cross over from your place to us

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
the rich man begged Abraham to send Lazarus to his home

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and worn his five brothers so that they at least do not have to come to the horrible place of pain

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Abraham said your brothers have the teachings of Moses and all the other men of God to honor them

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
let your brother's listen to them the rich man went on begging him

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and said that if someone rose from death and went to them they would believe him

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and turn away from their sins

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Abraham said if they do not listen to the teachings of Moses

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
then they would not listen to even someone who has risen from death

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Now gumbo you will answer my question

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
what was the name of the poor man I know the answer

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
His name was Lazarus he was sent to heaven after his death

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
because he was a good man. Execellent

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
