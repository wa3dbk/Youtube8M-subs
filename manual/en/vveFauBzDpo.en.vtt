We got to the fire station a little bit early

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.980
so we made sure our pups “got busy” before
we walked across the street to the fire station.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.050
As soon as we saw the fire truck return we
headed over for an exciting day working on

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.380
puppy training with fire fighters.
We started off by introducing our puppies

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.670
to a fire fighter fully suited wearing a gas
mask. Can you hear that (pause)...He sounds

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.150
a like darth vader...I was expecting to hear...Luke
I am your father... Our pups all had a different

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.560
reaction to this unusual looking human...the
look, sounds, and smells didn’t bother Miles

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:21.180
one bit. Dublin got excited to see the fire
fighter like he was his new favorite toy.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.049
Chloe was a little bit hesitant of this strange
looking thing.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.080
After all the puppies observed, sniffed, and
greeted the fire fighter in his gas mask they

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:38.600
pulled the fire truck around to the back for
more puppy training exercises.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.100
Our entire group did some heeling exercises
around the truck. Dublin was a little bit

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.650
excited and was pulling more than he does
on his regular walks.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.549
After heeling around the fire truck we got
all the dogs in sit-stays and down-stays and

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.490
let them hear some of the crazy sounds that
come from a fire truck....yay! no howling!

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:06.330
all of our dogs did really well...while some
became alert to the sirens none of our pups

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.840
seemed fearful. After popping up to attention
they all recovered very well.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.180
By the way, who was in charge of making all
that noise...looks like a future fire fighter!

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.340
After listening to the sirens Dublin and I
posed in front of the big red fire truck for

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.260
a glamour shot.
We were all hungry after a morning at the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.810
fire station so we headed down the street
for a bite to eat.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.430
Once we got to the University Town Center
the farmers market was going on with a crowd

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.820
of people.
We made our way through the crowds and stopped

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.190
in at the Steelhead Brewing Company for some
lunch and a break for our puppies.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.060
Many thanks to the firefighters at the Orange
County Fire Station in Irvine for working

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.750
with us and our guide dog puppies. We’ll
leave you with the whole crew posing for a

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.980
picture. Thanks for joining us for this episode
of Puppy In Training TV. We’ll see you next

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.819
time!
