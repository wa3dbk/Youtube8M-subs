Tanzi: Too much intellect can be just as dangerous
as too much emotion. You don't want to be

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.170
a drama queen- that leads to disaster. You
don't want to just be intellectual because

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.890
that also leads to disaster. Emotion and intellect
are just responses, reactions of the brain

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.440
to you outside world. The fact that you can
be self-aware of the fact that you're having

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.490
feelings and thoughts means that you are more
than just the automatic thoughts and feelings

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.090
going through your head. Too much intellect
can also be dangerous just like too much emotion.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.910
Use them wisely.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.350

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.350
Chopra: So Rudy, there's been of course over
a thousand papers only in the last two decades

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.350
on the beneficial effects of meditation on
our biology, on our biochemistry. We know

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.710
that the metabolic rate goes down. We know
that the immune system seems to optimize.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.630
We know that cortisol levels decrease, adrenaline
decreases. Overall there's a general sense

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.270
of well-being. But I think what meditation
also does in the brain anyway, it increases

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.060
what I've heard is gamma synchrony. It increases
the coherence in the brain other than decreasing

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.060
the metabolic rate in the body. And that has
beneficial effects. I want to ask you first

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.570
of all, does quietening the mind enhance our
ability to remember, to memory, and does sleep

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.320
do that as well because recently I've heard
a lot about how you need to get out of the

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.900
default mode in order to repair your body.
So you have to reboot the brain. Talk to me

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.900
a little bit about delta waves, default, meditation,
sleep; how is this so important?

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.140
Tanzi: Well, most of us experience at any
moment an internal dialogue or monologue in

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.780
the brain. In other words there is a conversation.
This is framing your ego. So on one hand you

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.640
have emotions. You have desires, you have
fears that are driving you at any moment.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.569
So that those desires don't turn into addictions,
so that those fears don't turn into pathological

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.420
phobias, your ego is quelling everything.
It's happening all the time. In fact it short

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.389
changes your existence really because you're
limited to these words. So with meditation...

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.159
Chopra: You call this the default mode?

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:44.379
Tanzi: Yes. When this is happening, your intellect
is keeping your emotions in check. There's

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.269
a constant internal monologue or dialogue
going on in the brain. This is the default

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.840
mode or default network of the brain.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.239
Chopra: So the computer's buzzing even though
you're not using it.

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.359
Tanzi: Yeah. You don't even know what's going
on. Even when you daydream, that internal

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:03.939
dialogue is working together, feelings and
thoughts. All part of this system of your

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:09.650
ego that keeps you sane so to speak. Now when
you meditate, what you're doing is you're

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.239
turning off that internal dialogue. You're
quelling the emotions. You're quelling the

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.170
thoughts that come along with those emotions.
You're clearing the brain into a quiet space

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.019
so that your mind can be quiet. At this point,
everything's going to be much clearer. It's

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:35.019
going to be opening channels of intuition
in your brain which many would argue is the

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.099
next big part of the brain that's evolving.
You know beyond the original instinctive brain,

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.310
the emotional brain, the intellectual brain;
now the intuitive brain. To get to that, turn

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.180
off the bandwidth. Meditation allows you to
do this, so you will have just a much clearer

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.029
set of channels, whether you're recalling
or recapitulating memories from the past or

00:03:56.029 --> 00:04:00.919
whether you're trying to imagine what you
might do in the future, you're in the now.

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:07.919
You're in the present, quiet mind, and everything
will be much more acute in terms of awareness,

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.129
and now you're allowing intuition to bloom
in your mind through your brain.

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.379
Chopra: So you're rebooting your brain.

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.129
Tanzi: You're rebooting your brain..

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.379
Chopra: More than that.

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.810
Tanzi: ...but you're also- it's more than
that. You're allowing your brain to blossom

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.599
into what many would argue is the next stage
of evolution for the brain as it ties to mind.

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.449
And that is promoting intuition by turning
off the noise.
