00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're in the center of Barcelona on a beatiful spot.
Behind us is an epic statue

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And epic was the theme of the press conference 
Huawei just gave right here

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
They've just presented their latest smartphone, the Ascend P2

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's the fastest smartphone ever, is what they say

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Or at least, that's what we were able to make of it

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
**It's much faster than our competitors**

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
** ??? iPhone 5S? S4? performance! **

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
What we understood is that this phone
 has a 1,5Ghz quad-core processor

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
That sounds pretty fast, but we'll have to see
 if it is indeed the fastest ever

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
** Ok...next **

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The device has a 4,7 inch display

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And the battery is supposed to be the 
most powerfull ever, according to Huawei

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
At least for these kind of devices

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The Ascend P2 runs Android 4.1.2, covered 
by Huaweis interface which is completely adjustable

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
**Usability is possible! (?)**

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You can adjust in any way you want, what stands out for me is

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
You flip the homescreen like pages of a book, instead of swiping

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It has a 13 megapixel camera which recognizes people in the picture

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
If I snap a picture of my cameraman, 
I can automatically send it to him. Nice.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The device is 8,4 mm thick

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And you can use the touchscreen even with gloves on

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
What will this 'best smartphone ever' cost?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
â‚¬399,- euro and it is available in a couple of months, Q2 of 2013
