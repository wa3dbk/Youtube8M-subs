00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.850
Hey, what's going on? 
Let's talk future proofing.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.140
How about it? It's probably about time for
you to get a Blu-ray recorder, right?

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.160
There aren't a lot of them out there.
But, you're downloading lots of HD movies.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.220
You're... all your stuff that 
you want to burn to DVDs,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.530
when it used to fit, no problem, all of a 
sudden you're having to span three or four

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.830
DVDs at a time to back up your stuff.
You know, things are getting bigger.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.700
Movie files are getting bigger.
Music collections and photo collections

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.500
are getting bigger and bigger.
And,  you know, the standard DVDs

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.870
just aren't cutting it anymore.
That's why Blu-ray is here.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.850
Not only is Blu-ray awesome for watching
1080p high definition video content,

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.250
it's also great for being able to store
massive amounts of information

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.120
on a single disk, which makes it excellent
for being used for backup and archiving,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.660
and also excellent for, of course,
burning your movies to a disk.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.400
Now, a lot of people don't have Blu-ray
burners yet.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.000
That's because they're been, sort of, 
cost prohibitive, up to this point.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.170
And a lot of people were waiting 
to see how things went between

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.540
the whole Blu-ray and HD DVD battle.
Well, the battle's over.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.150
Blu-ray won. But it could be
that you made the huge mistake

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.680
of investing a thousand dollars 
in HD DVD movies.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.850
And you want to be able to watch 
"Robo Cop" on your HD DVD,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.120
without having to buy 
a new copy. Right?

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.620
Well, this one right here,
The LG BE06 Blu-ray Writer

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.060
is going to be perfect for you because
it's going to read all of your HD DVDs.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.890
The other great thing about HD DVDs
is you  get them cheap on eBay, man.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.710
So you can watch them 
on this particular reader.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.040
And, it's also going to be 
able to read all of your Blu-ray disks.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.540
Now, that's really cool. 
Being able to read the Blu-rays,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.040
and being able to read the HD DVDs
that's cool in and of itself, right?

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.820
But what's awesome about this one
is that you're going to be able to burn

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.120
Blu-ray disks, which is 
absolutely fantastic. In fact,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.090
you can even use the writable disks.
And it actually comes with one of these.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.760
It's a 25 GB disk, BD-RE,
meaning recordable and erasable.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.280
But a single disk can hold 25 GB
of stuff. That's a ton of stuff.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.670
That's like 5 metric tons of stuff,
if you were to load it into a big box. OK?

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.540
So, it couldn't be easier
to use either, right?

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.880
I mean... maybe you don't wanna 
open up your computer

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.550
and install new components 
and all that stuff.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.120
You don't have to with this.
It is USB. All it takes is the included

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.220
power adapter 
and the included USB cable.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.250
You plug it into the back here.
As you can see, it's two plugs in the back.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.300
All you have is the power 
and the USB.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.420
You plug in that USB port 
to your computer.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.440
Your computer will automatically recognize
your Blu-ray HD DVD reader/recorder,

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.300
and you're off. There are a few
drivers you may have to install

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.840
for doing all the burning 
and all that stuff, but that's it.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.610
It is a completely simple 
instillation process.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.050
It does 6x for burning BD-R disk. 
Those are the one-write Blu-ray disks.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.210
It does 2x for the BD-RE, which are the
erasable multi-write disks.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.720
It will read HD-DVD disks, 
as I said.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.630
It'll do DVDR at 16x. 
So that's +R or -R at 16x.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.400
It will handle 1080p Blu-ray playback.
It does do LightScribe.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.300
So you're going to be able to burn 
all of your labels and all that stuff

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.600
into your LightScribe
capable DVDs and Blu-ray disks.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.640
And, it's just a perfect, simple package.
And it's going to allow you

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.140
to step straight into the future.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.910
That's right. Blu-ray is here.
And this is going to make it

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.720
really, really easy for you to archive
all your stuff without having to span it

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.560
across nine DVDs 
and all that stuff.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.420
Blu-ray drive, HD DVD reader and DVD
all in one svelte looking package here.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.860
I think it's cute, isn't it?
Look at that.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.230
It's good looking. It's a good looking
DVD burner, right there, from LG.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.270
So get your hands on one of these.
They're on the market now.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.240
And you don't want to be the last one 
with a Blu-ray burner, at all.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.350
It's the LG BE06
Blu-ray Writer from LG.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.810
To grab yourself some more info on the 
external LG BE06 USB Blu-ray Writer,

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.280
go to any of these retailers
and type in:

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.380
L49-1016.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.490
For Computer TV, I'm Bauer.
