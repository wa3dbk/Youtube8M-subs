Hi guys, I'm Caroline. And I'm Alejandra.
And today we're making Chocolate Cupcakes

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:09.000
with Peanut Butter Frosting. 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:24.039
This recipe is
one of my very favorites to bring over to friends' houses for just the impromptu party.
It's super simple to throw together. I'm inviting

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.839
you to my house! So it's just a bunch of very
simple ingredients that you probably should

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:42.400
have at home already. We have some sugar,
baking powder, baking soda, flour, salt, cocoa,

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.900
Smooth Operator of course, some milk, melted
butter, a lightly beaten egg, and we'll get

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.750
to the frosting ingredients later. Good stuff.
All right, so let's boogie. So we've got some

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.090
dry ingredients, we're just gonna throw them
all together, go for it, you can help. I like

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.500
it. All righty, this is my kind of cooking,
just throw it all in. A stir-together batter,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.930
very simple, oh here we go. I'm just gonna
whisk together these ingredients just to sort

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.030
of get them all combined, and we're just gonna
add the wet ingredients directly into here.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.640
The peanut butter is actually gonna be saved
for the frosting, so we're gonna get to that later too. 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.740
Just add a little bit of this melted
butter, you can go ahead and toss in the milk

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:31.000
if you want. I want to. All right, and this
egg. I love it. And all we're gonna do now

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.880
is just fill up these cupcake tins. I like
to use a quarter cup measure because it's

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.810
makes it extra simple. And this is an awesome
because it ends up just making a dozen, that's

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.880
why I love to make it for parties. So I'm
almost done filling up these cupcakes, and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.100
I'm just gonna pop them into a 350 degree
oven for 20-25 minutes just until they're

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.770
done. Love it. Here comes the peanut butter
part: the frosting, the good stuff. So we

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.520
have two cups of 10X confectioner's sugar
and a stick of softened butter, and I'm gonna

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.619
add half a cup of the best ever Smooth Operator.
And I'm just gonna mix this together. You

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.240
could actually do this by hand if you wanted
to gain a little extra muscle, but I'm gonna

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.200
use an electric mixer here. And I'm gonna
stand back. Yes, this bowl is...There we go.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.700
There we go. So you want to have a frosting party? Yes
ma'am! All right. You already know I ate all

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.730
the cupcakes. You've been warned. You could
put it into a piping bag and everything if

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.989
you wanted, but you really don't have to.
Now all we have to do is just sprinkle them

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:53.489
with some peanuts. Nice. So there you have
it: Chocolate Cupcakes with Peanut Butter

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.400
Frosting. Do you want to dig in? Yes, ma'am,
I do. Yes I do. That came across, that came

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.200
across. I just want to make sure that you
understand how badly I want to dig in. Oh

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:14.800
yeah, oh it's so good. It's that classic chocolate
peanut butter thing, but it's kind of different,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:23.000
it's super easy to do, best thing for parties.
And super tasty. I'll take a dozen. Chocolate

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.989
and peanut butter's always a winning combination.
So what other things do you think we should

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.000
