00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:04.362
(jazzy instrumental music)

00:00:06.078 --> 00:00:08.293
- [Curtis] We're back,
watching Ginny and Shelley

00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:10.306
cleaning a pond.

00:00:10.306 --> 00:00:13.139
- [Shelley] Okay, we're going to catch fish.

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.831
Oh, two at once, too.

00:00:21.768 --> 00:00:22.642
- [Ginny] Oh, he's pretty.

00:00:22.642 --> 00:00:24.142
- Isn't he pretty?

00:00:25.083 --> 00:00:26.489
That was the pretty one.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:27.559
(someone speaking off-mic)

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:28.976
Look at this one.

00:00:30.173 --> 00:00:33.810
I'm going to go ahead and
start vacuuming a little bit,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.571
and try to get some of this out.

00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:39.570
This is a shop-vac, and it'll take out

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.237
the water, along with the trash.

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:45.825
And then you can tell when
your shop-vac gets full,

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:47.882
and then we'll start emptying it.

00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:50.837
I'm constantly keeping an eye on my pump,

00:00:50.837 --> 00:00:54.015
to make sure that the filter is clean.

00:00:54.015 --> 00:00:57.977
Which, at this point, is pretty tough,

00:00:57.977 --> 00:00:59.601
'cause it's just really sucking in

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.731
the junk outta here.

00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:03.764
Okay, somebody'll give me some power,

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:07.080
I'll go vacuuming.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:26.300
(vacuum running)

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.300
- [Curtis] We're gettin'
down to the bottom,

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.253
to the liner, now.

00:01:32.253 --> 00:01:33.677
And it's pretty much muddy.

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:35.998
This is what has to be cleaned out.

00:01:35.998 --> 00:01:38.082
But Shelley's almost done, here.

00:01:38.082 --> 00:01:41.225
- What I'll do is, we'll probably get

00:01:41.225 --> 00:01:44.470
most of this out, and then
I'll get a water hose,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.877
and rinse out just the tail end of it.

00:01:47.877 --> 00:01:50.327
You can fill your pond back up,

00:01:50.327 --> 00:01:53.077
and replace your fish, and frogs.

00:01:54.183 --> 00:01:58.100
You'll probably need to
let your fish acclimate

00:01:59.238 --> 00:02:02.553
to the new water by putting them

00:02:02.553 --> 00:02:06.046
in a bag of some sort, and setting them

00:02:06.046 --> 00:02:08.324
directly into the pond.

00:02:08.324 --> 00:02:11.437
We'll go ahead and set
the water lilies back in

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.020
without re-potting them, today.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.480
You've got a couple months in spring

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.140
that you can re-pot your lilies.

00:02:22.382 --> 00:02:27.243
But as you can see, we're
just about to get it all

00:02:27.243 --> 00:02:28.160
outta here.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.738
- [Curtis] So now, you're
washing the sides down?

00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:38.930
- Yeah, just kind of washing
it out, a little bit.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.952
Then what I'll do is
I'll just wash it off,

00:02:42.952 --> 00:02:45.011
and then come back in and

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.080
get the rest.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.680
I'm not going to try to get
the algae off the sides,

00:02:49.694 --> 00:02:52.511
as I said before, that's beneficial,

00:02:52.511 --> 00:02:54.513
and I don't need to.

00:02:54.513 --> 00:02:57.167
Just gets all the trash
and the leaves out,

00:02:57.167 --> 00:03:01.240
which are toxic to my
fish, and I don't want 'em.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.734
And that's about all I'm
going to do, right there.

00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:08.005
- [Curtis] And you're using well water,

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:09.488
so you don't have to worry about chlorine.

00:03:09.488 --> 00:03:11.152
- No chlorine in well water.

00:03:11.152 --> 00:03:13.113
- [Curtis] If this was
city water, we'd have

00:03:13.113 --> 00:03:14.618
to do something else so the water

00:03:14.618 --> 00:03:16.600
would lose the chlorine.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.851
- If this was city water,
what I would suggest

00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:20.293
is filling it up and letting it sit

00:03:20.293 --> 00:03:21.960
for two or three days.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.417
You can treat it with a chemical,

00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:25.232
but it's not necessary.

00:03:25.232 --> 00:03:27.598
And the less I can use chemicals,

00:03:27.598 --> 00:03:29.510
the better I like it.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.465
We're setting the water lilies back in,

00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:34.302
as you can see, some of these need

00:03:34.302 --> 00:03:35.655
to be re-potted.

00:03:35.655 --> 00:03:37.771
We've got about a two-month period, here,

00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:40.927
that we can re-pot, and for today,

00:03:40.927 --> 00:03:43.396
we feel like this is enough.

00:03:43.396 --> 00:03:47.053
Ginny can get to the plants easier, now,

00:03:47.053 --> 00:03:49.805
she can see what she's doing.

00:03:49.805 --> 00:03:52.149
Ginny, you want this one over here?

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:54.958
(someone speaking off-mic)

00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.137
You're going to notice that I still

00:03:56.137 --> 00:03:57.970
have some mud in here.

00:03:58.918 --> 00:04:01.912
It's a part of life, and
you're going to have it.

00:04:01.912 --> 00:04:05.011
When this pond fills, it'll be clear.

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:06.341
The mud will settle.

00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:07.491
It might not...

00:04:07.491 --> 00:04:08.522
Well, as you can see, it's starting

00:04:08.522 --> 00:04:10.105
to settle, already.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.431
- [Curtis] Okay, when will
you put the fish back in?

00:04:13.431 --> 00:04:14.612
- In just a little bit.

00:04:14.612 --> 00:04:15.445
We're going to...

00:04:15.445 --> 00:04:18.866
This water is warmer,
coming out of the well.

00:04:18.866 --> 00:04:20.465
- [Curtis] Okay, and you've
got to acclimate the fish,

00:04:20.465 --> 00:04:21.462
so they don't get shocked.

00:04:21.462 --> 00:04:26.157
- So what I'll do is, I'll
set the bucket in here,

00:04:26.157 --> 00:04:29.824
and let it kind of start
getting acclimated.

00:04:31.551 --> 00:04:33.789
Curtis, I'm going to go ahead and place

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.662
a rock, down here.

00:04:35.662 --> 00:04:37.301
It's a good flat rock, it doesn't have

00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:38.895
any sharp points, so it's not going

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.440
to puncture our liner.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.060
And then I'm going to place
Ginny's little pump on here.

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.911
So, when we get the water level

00:04:49.911 --> 00:04:51.888
up high enough, we can plug it in,

00:04:51.888 --> 00:04:53.763
and our waterfall will come on.

00:04:53.763 --> 00:04:54.596
- [Curtis] I didn't even know there was

00:04:54.596 --> 00:04:55.703
a waterfall here.

00:04:55.703 --> 00:04:57.032
- It's just a little pump.

00:04:57.032 --> 00:04:58.432
You can get all different sizes,

00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:01.461
depending upon what flow you want.

00:05:01.461 --> 00:05:02.536
- Okay, well, this looks good.

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:04.808
While it's filling,
we'll just let it fill.

00:05:04.808 --> 00:05:05.845
But I want to thank you for showing us

00:05:05.845 --> 00:05:08.531
how to clean out a pond, and make it work.

00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:10.891
And so, we'll shake hands, and we'll smell

00:05:10.891 --> 00:05:12.570
like pond water, here.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.796
- I knew I'd get you.

00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:15.525
- You were after that.

00:05:15.525 --> 00:05:16.689
So, thanks to both of you.

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:18.356
- [Shelley] It was our pleasure.

00:05:18.356 --> 00:05:20.896
(jazzy instrumental music)
