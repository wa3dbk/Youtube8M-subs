Hi, this is Laura Turner, and today I'm going
to talk with you about learning how to write

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.530
a novel. The first thing you're going to want
to do is you're going to want to read as many

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:15.459
novels as possible. And see how other novels
are written, because, today we have so many

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.621
different forms of writing. There's really
no one way to pinpoint 'this is what a novel

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:25.949
should be. And this is how we write novels.
So you can actually go and if you read as

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.369
many different kinds of novels as possible,
you can get a feel for what you like to read,

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.280
and therefore for what you like to write.
Because we really write because we want other

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.580
people to read the stuff that we like. So,
go and read things and find out what you like.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.061
Next, you might actually want to take fiction
writing class. And, in a fiction writing class

00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:51.910
you may not actually be able to submit an
entire novel. You might not only have, you

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.270
know, your short stories and stuff like that.
But your short story can actually grow into

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.660
a novel. So it's a good thing to be able to
sit down with a bunch of other writers in

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.640
a class, around the table, and to read your
work, and have comments back on your work,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.180
so that you can become a better writer and
you can start writing your novel. Next, if

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.040
you're writing your novel by yourself, you're
not in a class, you don't really have anybody

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.470
to help you with it, you might want to make
a very, very detailed outline for yourself

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.690
so you don't get off track, and so that you
can actually finish it within a pretty good

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.060
span of time, rather than, you know, "I'm
just constantly working on my novel, and I

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.060
don't know where the next chapter's going
to be", and all this stuff. So make an outline.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.610
Next, you're going to want to write something
that you're passionate about. Make sure that

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.981
you have enough devotion to this topic that
you're going to want to spend an entire novel

00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:53.190
with it. And finally, write from start to
finish, and then rewrite it. You learn by

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.280
doing, so write all the way to the end. And
try not to, you know, sort of censor yourself

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.340
and look back at it and say "Well, that's
not going with the outline." Use the outline

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.619
as a tool to help you in tough times, but
then, really push on through and get to the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.790
end of that novel. So learn to write novels
by doing it.
