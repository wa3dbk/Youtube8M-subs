Ask him to hold the camera for us.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:16.549

It's a video for a friend.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.185

Hi, Park!

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:59.459
 - Can you show the big wheel, please?
- Yeah, yeah. Ok. 

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:03.096
- Here, now! No big wheel!
Guess where there's something bigger?  

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.000
Hey Laura, Lucas... Lucas!
Hey! Live long and prosper!

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:11.805

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:30.857
- Yay!
- Gorgeous!

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:33.226
- Come here. Give it back, you naughty...

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:41.167
- See that, Laura? Ramiro is up there!
He's the one at the top!

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:45.405
He's the waving mane, up there!
Right there! 

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:50.810
I'm more a big wheel kind of guy.
This one is too much for me, it's scary. 

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:53.646
That's him!

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:58.318
Ok, that's Ramiro coming down. 
Let's see how it went. 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:03.690
How was it, Ramiro! 

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:06.860
- Awesome, I'm perfectly fine.
- Now, what?

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:11.531
- Say something!
- Laura, Merry Christm... mmm...

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.401
- Baaarrrfffggghhh!!!
- Oh, my god!

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:24.511
- Well, maybe it's time to go back 
to the hotel, eat something, and then...

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.613
- No, no, wait.
I'm getting on again, I'm... 

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.848
Baaarrrfffggghhh!!!

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.586
Ok, back to the hotel. 
- Can't you vomit that way?

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:35.855
