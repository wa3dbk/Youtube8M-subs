Hi, I'm Tim Gipson and I'm going to talk to
you about how to get scratches out of your

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.690
hardwood floors. Now, whether it's an engineered
floor, hardwood floor such as this or a solid

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.570
wood floor your surfaces are pretty much the
same, so if you have those instances where

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.519
somebody had moved back their chair and you
get a scratch then there are some different

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.650
things that you can do without having to refinish
the entire floor to take care of that. Now,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.100
first and foremost most of your hardwood floor
products come with some kind of a cleaner

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.730
and a cleaner/buffing agent such as this so
in most cases, if it's a really light scratch

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.740
you can just use this with a soft white cloth
and in most cases you can just either spray

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:56.380
it directly on or spray it on the cloth and
you simply rub and this will actually clean

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:04.280
and buff the area to get some of those scratches
out. Now there are some other after market

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:13.509
products that you can put on here that are
specifically formulated to hide surface scratches.

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:22.539
Now if you get some deeper scratches what
you may need to do is actually get a urethane

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:28.030
or a shellac, and actually shellac works very
well and what you do is you get some shellac

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.259
and you cut it with a little bit of denatured
alcohol to make a real thin mixture and then

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:40.069
you just take an artist's paintbrush and paint
it into the crack and you let that dry and

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.079
you come back and repeat. Now, after you have
repeated putting the shellac in there if you

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.149
can still see the scratch, then you will come
back and do it a third time. Now if you have

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.009
a really deep gouge or something like that
you can also use a product like beeswax. You'd

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.819
actually melt the beeswax into it, sand it
lightly and buff it. Use a buffing compound,

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:05.140
again the cleaning compound and those are
some typical ways that you can take care of

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.650
some scratches in hardwood floors. So, I'm
Tim Gipson with some tips on taking care of

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.370
scratches on hardwood floors.
