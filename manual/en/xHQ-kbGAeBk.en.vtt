00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.260
Good afternoon everyone, and happy Earth Day!
This year is the 45th anniversary of Earth

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.900
Day, and the Administration has been working
hard to make this year a special one. In 2015

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.879
alone, President Obama has established three
national monuments that protect treasured

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.820
natural landscapes and important historic
sites, issued an Executive Order to ensure

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.019
the Federal Government is leading by example
to save energy and cut the carbon pollution

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.189
that drives climate change, and launched our
Every Kid in a Park initiative to inspire

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.800
a new generation to get out and experience
the wonder and beauty of our Nation’s parks

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.760
and public lands.
The honorees today know something about inspiring

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.090
young people to connect with their environment
– they do it every day.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.100
Today, we are proud to be honoring 58 schools,
14 districts, and – for the first time ever

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.670
– 9 postsecondary institutions.
The honorees come from all over the country,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.750
and they’ve made great strides decreasing
their carbon footprints, cutting costs, promoting

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.340
health, and fostering a new generation of
thinkers and leaders ready to tackle some

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.799
of our greatest environmental challenges.
They’ll be the ones applying innovative

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.880
solutions to our toughest problems. They’ll
save species from the brink of extinction,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.670
design green spaces and parks for our cities,
and invent technologies that continue our

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.890
transition to a clean energy economy.
To the honorees, I want to say congratulations

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.360
on becoming one of our U.S. Department of
Education Green Ribbon Schools. Schools all

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.970
over the country are now looking to you as
leaders. I hope you’ll help them learn from

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.630
your successes; I’m sure they’ll find
your dedication and creativity as inspiring

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.990
as I do.
Congratulations again on this honor. Everyone

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.740
at the White House applauds the work you have
done and can’t wait to see the amazing things

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.659
you’ll do in the future.
Thank you, and now I’ll turn it over to

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.130
Secretary Duncan.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.890
Thank you, Managing Director Goldfuss.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.930
I’m Arne Duncan and I’m here today to
announce the 2015 U.S. Department of Education

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.310
Green Ribbon Schools, District Sustainability
Awardees, and Postsecondary Sustainability

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.579
Awardees.

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.910
Before we share the list of 2015 honorees,
I want to thank our government partners, as

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.310
well as our numerous non-profit partners,
including the Center for Green Schools at

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.360
the US Green Building Council and Green Schools
National Network.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.410
Finally, this award would not be possible
without the work of state education officials

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.430
dedicated to school sustainability in over
30 states.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.330
We created this award because healthy, safe,
sustainable facilities that include practices

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.980
like outdoor physical activity and good nutrition—as
well as real-world learning— are innovative

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.210
ways to boost achievement at every level.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.030
The honorees we recognize today serve everyone,
from early learners to career and technical

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.970
education students. And, for the first time,
we are recognizing Postsecondary Sustainability

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.750
Awardees.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.230
These honorees are demonstrating how sustainability
concepts allow students to collaborate, think

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.280
critically, and use these skills to better
their communities and the earth. Honorees

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.500
demonstrate good wellness practices that reinforce
student and staff attendance and performance,

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.700
and show how schools of all types can save
money, and direct more funds back into the

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.570
classroom.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.770
I want to make clear – ANY school, district,
or postsecondary institution can do what these

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.110
honorees are doing. What they have in common
is outstanding teamwork and extraordinary

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.720
leadership. Regardless of location, construction,
or student population, they demonstrate a

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.730
real commitment to serving students with the
healthiest and most sustainable learning environments

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.460
and instruction in the country.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.380
Honored schools, districts, and postsecondary
institutions have an important role to play

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.840
modeling promising practices. That’s why,
today, ED is releasing its annual report that

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.240
highlights each of the 2015 honorees.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.650
Congratulations to our 2015 honorees. We look
forward to celebrating with you in June. Until

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.850
then, share your story of progress -- so that
other schools can learn and adopt your promising

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.260
practices.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.090
Thank you.
