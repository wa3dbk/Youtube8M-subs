open park

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.640

what someone like that you have a hard
time you read a science journals

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.320
is a lady I just found out the
researchers believe bathed in blue light

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.140
is a better way for drivers to stay
alert than either cap in our energy

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.800
pills

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.420
in fact anti-matter and sell your
Polytechnic Institute to study how to

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.900
incorporate the lights in the cab cars
and trucks

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.970
because exposure boo I can reset your
body's internal clock

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.330
and give drivers the means to stay awake
and energized during their drive

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.330
or our viewers can use it to stay awake
every time we talk about Science Channel

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.510

but what about technology that can keep
you less stressed or driving in

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.610
it turned out a study by the Virginia
Tech Transportation Institute

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.959
found that 72 percent of drivers feel
less stressed when using a GPS device

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.550
over half said using the navigation
device help them keep focused on the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.090
road

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.280
while technology doesn't always keep guy
