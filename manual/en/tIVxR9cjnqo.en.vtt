00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.520
- Good morning, clan.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.510
Welcome to Saturday, July 11th.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.287
Bryce and I are up and out of the house,

00:00:09.287 --> 00:00:12.059
heading to Chipotle to grab some lunch.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.800
Love the fact that I can order online

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.550
and then just go pick
it up, skip the lines,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.810
all that good stuff.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.620
Maximize my time, people.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.610
That's what it's all about.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.150
Time is my enemy.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.890
My arch nemesis.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.090
Never enough time in
the day to do everything

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.850
that I wanna do slash need to do.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.650
Mostly what I wanna do.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.560
So, just got up a new vlog,
got it all ready to go,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.660
it's uploading right now,
and when it's ready to go,

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.200
it's just gonna blow up.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.270
All over your computer
screens, your iPads,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.140
your tablets, all that good stuff.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.731
So, that way it's doin' it's
thing while I'm doin' my thing

00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:47.270
which is pickin' up
burritos and burrito bowls.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.730
Did you have fun yesterday at Jump Street?

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.800
- [Bryce] Yep!
- [Clintus] Good stuff, huh?

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.910
- [Clintus] It looked fun, man.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.380
Bummed I missed it.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.570
- It was awesome.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.680
- [Clintus] It looked
awesome, yeah, good job on

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.950
climbin' the pillars.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.685
- Yeah, the first time I made
it up to the light green.

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:00.750
- [Clintus] Yeah?

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.350
- And then the second
time I made it up to the--

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.340
- All the way to the top.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.190
See, obviously yesterday,
kids were gone pretty much

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.060
all day, well, the kids were gone all day.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.270
They came home to pick me up
basically, drop Mason off,

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.230
and then we went back out,
and we were gone super late.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.100
Today's gonna be a kind of a
chill slash productive day.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.662
I gotta edit all those
gameplays I shot yesterday.

00:01:17.662 --> 00:01:21.440
But Bryce and I are gonna
stream some Destiny today.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.610
A lot of you guys were
requesting that, like,

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.940
"Ah, I wanna see you and Bryce play."

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.450
That's the plan today, basically,
is just to stream all day.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.913
Both on Twitch and on YouTube.

00:01:30.913 --> 00:01:32.380
Haven't streamed on
YouTube in a long time,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.512
so I'm looking forward to
playing with that again

00:01:34.512 --> 00:01:36.090
and seeing how that works
and basically like I said

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.930
yesterday, see who uses what the most.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.130
So, that's what we're gonna do today.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.290
Tiffany's probably gonna sleep all day.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.400
And Sierra will probably go hang out

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.680
with her friend Tatiana.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.250
So, that's what our
Saturday looks like so far.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.560
Oh yeah, we've got that
Chipotle action goin'.

00:01:55.987 --> 00:01:57.929
Two times in a row, it seems like.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.720
I'll never complain about that though.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.710
All our burrito bowls, doo doo doo.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.357
- Hey guys.

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:05.500
Good morning.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.110
I don't know...

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.690
if Daddy or Bryce have said anything.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.497
- [Lucy] It's not morning, it's afternoon.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.000
Yeah, it's 5:00.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.130
The reason I said good morning is 'cause

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.300
I don't know if we've actually
opened the vlog yet, so...

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.350
Anyway, good morning,
good afternoon, hello.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.250
Me and Lucy, Lucy's over.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.360
Are playing with Play-Doh.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.340
Making little cookies.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.371
Yes, there's Play-Doh stuck in the thing.

00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:36.660
She's tryin' to make corn.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.020
- All right, guys.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.260
So, it's, man it's almost 6 pm already.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.450
And it's kinda been a lazy day.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.950
Obviously we were up late last night

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.140
hangin' out with the Wolfs.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.600
These two are hangin' out.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.701
Watchin' Netflix, eatin' some chips.

00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:55.960
Bryce and have I been playin'
Destiny pretty much all day.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.430
We ran through Vault of Glass.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.140
We ran through Prison of Elders 28 and 32.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.780
His first time runnin' those.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.550
And now we're, I'm
playin' Trials of Osiris

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.830
with a couple of my buddies and man,

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.170
it's so much fun, so much fun.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.950
And I've been streaming
all day long as well.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.430
So, if you are a fan of
gaming, you can watch me live

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.050
over at Twitch.tv/clintusgames.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.090
Hopefully some of you
guys were able to do that.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.630
I've been havin' a blast and...

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.030
Yeah, gettin' back to the gameplays.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.230
- Hi, guys.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.010
So, Lucy is staying the night,

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.960
and when you're having a
sleepover you need popcorn 'cause

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.830
you're gonna be watching movies, so...

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.168
- So I'm gonna watch, I'm
gonna control the camera

00:03:35.168 --> 00:03:37.290
and Sierra's gonna take out the popcorn.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.530
First she's takin' out the popcorn.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.460
She's takin' out the popcorn.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.730
See?

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.940
Popcorn!

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.800
- [Sierra] Let's see.

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:56.700
- [Lucy] So, we're gonna watch a movie.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.300
On her tablet and eat some popcorn.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.295
Yay!

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.020
- Are you in the sub, Bryce?

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.720
- Hey. (mumbling)

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.040
- Hello.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.010
(Clintus laughs)

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.820
- Girls had a little sleepover.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.230
Still asleep.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.060
Sierra fell asleep with her iPad.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.600
Watchin' Netflix.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.310
It's on autoplay so
it'll just keep playin'

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.840
over and over again.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.830
There we go.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.020
Girls and their sleepovers.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.062
All right, you guys.

00:04:53.062 --> 00:04:56.980
So, I think I streamed for
like maybe six hours today.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.320
It was awesome.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.940
Highest record number
of concurrent viewers.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.000
Record chat.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.430
Record followers, like
just a great, great day.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.100
This is exactly what I
wanted for my Twitch streams.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.900
And eventually for my YouTube streams.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.910
I'm so excited, thank you
so much for all of you guys

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.268
that jumped in, watched me play.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.880
Camaraderie, commented, just interacted.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.500
Love it, love the live stuff.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.240
And love doin' it while playin' games.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.190
So, I ended the stream
playing Trials of Osiris.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.890
I played four or five matches in a row.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.620
We got to four wins, I think,

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.090
five is when you get the helmet.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.330
That's that I was shootin'
for, couldn't make it.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.570
Finally said, you know
what, I'm done for a while.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.170
Killed the stream, put all my stuff away.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.020
Another buddy jumped
in, said hey let's play.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.070
Let's do some trials.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.800
I was like, all right,
let's go for trials.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.850
And we went nine and O, nine and O, dude.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.300
I made it to Mercury!

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.570
I'm gonna put up a screenshot right here.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.420
This is the screenshot
when you go to Mercury.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.040
It's what it looks like.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.050
And it was amazing, man.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.560
I got from the chest.
- [Bryce] Dang, so close!

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.720
- [Clintus] I didn't
get anything, no, I did!

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.290
I got the Jewel of Osiris with Hand,

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.490
Hand Cannon solar, my
buddy wants that big time.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.100
I bought the helmet, I bought the shotgun,

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.590
and I got a Fusion Rifle.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.730
Huge, huge win.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.990
I'm super, super excited.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.500
Did not think it was gonna happen.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.240
But it did, and so...

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.240
Yes!

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.370
Speaking of Trials of Osiris,
Bryce is actually playing his

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.150
very first Trials of Osiris right now.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.280
With my buddy Gits and
his son, Turpy Turtle.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.610
I'm gonna go ahead and
end the vlog here, guys.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.610
My goals were purely around
the gaming and whatnot.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.605
Didn't get to do everything I wanted to,

00:06:33.605 --> 00:06:35.650
but I got most of it done,
and I got to stream a lot

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.930
which was huge, big
success for the channel.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.690
And yeah, so...

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.690
That's today's video.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.490
Tomorrow, headin' to Meemaw
and Papa's for our pool party.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.270
As usual, expect GoPro
footage, underwater stuff,

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.660
kids do their snorkeling.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.800
My brothers'll be over there,
so hopefully we'll get to see

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.570
Victoria and Max.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:54.970
All of them.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.019
And we will see you
guys tomorrow, vlog on!
