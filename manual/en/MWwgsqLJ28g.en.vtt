00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.650
Hey it's Bauer we've got some more digital  cameras for you.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.900
The Kodak EasyShare M1093. You know,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.680
Kodak is definitely making some really really nice cameras nowadays. In fact, 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.970
this one, when you first pick it up you notice that it feels incredibly solid, 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.800
in your hands, it's made of a very very nice metal enclosure, 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.530
so you got a 10 megapixel sensor in it, 3X optical zoom and it has that really really nice

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.490
Retinar glass lens on this thing. This camera in particular is pretty impressive.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.230
It's got features that you are simply not going to find, in some of the other point and shoots 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.800
out there, but let me give you some of the details first of all, before I dump into the...

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.790
Jump into the nitty gritty. 10 Megapixel sensor,  3 inch LCD touch screen,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.540
or not touch screen, but 3 inch LCD screen on the back. It has Image Stabilization

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.350
 and Blur Reduction built into it. Like I said  it's got 3X optical zoom, 5X digital,

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.400
so it'll do 15X total zoom. One of the really  really cool things about this camera,

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.610
is here's a little HD logo right here. This  actually does HD video.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.660
Most of the point and shoots that you see out there do 640 by 480 at 15 or 30 frames per second,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.870
this one actually does 1280 by 720 at 30 frames per second. 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.200
And it will also do 640 by 480 at 30 frames per second as well.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.160
So you can get extraordinary high quality video, with this camera. 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.530
In fact higher quality than you're going to be able to find on most point and shoots out there,

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.210
period. And the video actually looks really really good on this camera.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.510
It has face detection built into it, so that it will be able to focus on multiple faces 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.930
in the scene. In fact if you take a look right here you can see it as it detects my face,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.430
and focuses on it. See? It's very impressive.  The face detection.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.880
32 MB built into this camera, not a whole lot of memory for 10 megapixel camera,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.830
especially a 10 megapixel camera that does  720p high res videos.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.630
You're going to want to get a nice large SD card for this if you are... Especially 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.700
if you're planning on shooting video, you want to get a nice large SDHC card, 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.570
because that 720p video takes up a lot of space. But,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.370
you'll definitely want to get one of those,  it does take SD cards, which is good.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.200
You probably already have a few of those laying  around somewhere anyway,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.790
so it does take standard media. It also does  all your text and sound tags, 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.300
and let me go ahead and show you how this works. If you take a look at the top here, 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.830
these are 4 buttons, they're kind of hidden, now this is the Power button right here,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.900
lets you know if your camera is on or off. Here is your Flash settings, 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.480
and here is your Mode button. I'll show you  what that does, and your 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.940
Shutter button is kind of hidden right here. That's actually the Shutter button.  

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.990
On the back, it's very very simple your wide and telephoto settings are right here.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.310
This will take you to your menu, this will take  you to your Play mode,

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.570
it's got a very nice little joystick control here, this is to quickly trash your photos,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.110
and this is to share your pictures, either to  one of the Kodak photo printers

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.730
or over email actually. You flip it upside down this is where you can get to your card holder

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.200
and your rechargeable battery. This does take a rechargeable battery, 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.560
that comes with the camera. Your SD card is  actually going to go in right there,

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.510
and on the side... And actually on the bottom here, this is your docking port.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.740
This is going to plug in to one of your Kodak easy share printers, or a docking station.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.530
And on this side right here is your USB port, and a...

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.470
And a part to charge the battery right there  inside the camera. It does come

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.730
with a charger so you don't have to worry about that either.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.140
So let's go ahead and take a look at what this thing has going on,

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.480
on the inside of it. When you click... when you push the Mode button,

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.430
You'll see that it gives you some options here.  Of course Smart Capture is going to be 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.530
your fully automatic mode, it's going to take care of all of your picture taking settings,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.270
without you having to intervene at all. Video, that's going to be your various video modes,

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.400
either the 720p or the 640 by 480 at 30 frames per second.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.600
The Program button right here, that will let you to get to your,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.630
to you manual modes, and the Scenes button  right here will take you to the various

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.710
scene settings. It does have a lot of different scene settings in this camera, 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.700
so that you can actually very very easily find the correct settings for whatever situation 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.830
that you are taking pictures in. As you can see there really are a whole lot. 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.210
And this blur reduction here actually works quite well. 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.630
This is special technology inside of the Kodak EasyShare, it does a really really good job of 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.130
making sure those pictures, even pictures with a lot of motion in them stay nice and crisp

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.870
and very very well focused. If you take a look at the more manual settings, 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.940
inside this camera go ahead and go to the program Scenes right here.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.970
The manual settings are all accessed right here. It's got a very very nice menu system,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.700
you can set up your Exposure Compensation  your actual resolution right here, 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.770
your various focus modes, it does have a number of very very long exposure times,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.810
you can build, they are built right in, in case  you want to take like some very very low light

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.640
pictures if you have a tripod. Lots of different manual settings you're going to find inside

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.400
this camera. These are actually right here... 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.570
There we go. All of the basic settings inside  the camera, these aren't necessarily 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.100
specific to the pictures that you're taking, but all of the basic settings 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.370
that you're going to find inside of the camera  itself. Now, the Play mode,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.800
is very very nice as well. It does have a number of different display settings, 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.930
and as you can see there is a Histogram  view right here,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.830
in the camera so you can take a look at that. Also all of your basic information

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.930
about the settings when the picture was taken  are all included in there as well.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.870
So, it's a sharp camera. On the back.. Also, I forgot to show you this. 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.560
The Share button of course is going to allow you to quickly print or email those photos,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.970
and that's very nice, especially if you have one of those photo printers,

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.130
you can just drop this thing in here, hit the  Share button and it will print 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.710
all of your favorite pictures. It will also allow you to tag your pictures, 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.700
If you go and hit the Tag button you can add tags to your photos so they'll be very very

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.750
easily found within your camera, and it also  retains all that tagging information,

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.760
once you hit... Once these pictures hit your computer. So you can actually continue

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.550
to be able to search for those, once you get into... Once they get actually into your computer 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.230
obviously it's a lot easier to just tag a picture  once you take it,

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.760
rather than try to do 30 at a time once you upload the pictures. So,

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.250
it's a solid camera. Very very nice, it's got that automatic face detection that works

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.880
really really well, but I think one of the stand out features of this,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:58.150
is that high resolution video mode, so you know this will actually... could take the place of

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.000
your video camera if you have a nice large

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.440
memory card to stick into this thing, you're going to be able to record lots of

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:13.380
extraordinarily high quality HD video  with the Kodak M1093.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.130
So it's a very solidly built camera, it's got a  very very nice glass lens in it.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.190
Overall, as soon as you pick this thing up you're going to notice that it's just a...

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.760
It just feels like an extremely high quality camera, so go check it out.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:32.700
It's the Kodak M1093 EasyShare with all of the image stabilization and the blur reduction,

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.490
and the 10.0 megapixel sensor so,  go grab one. They're very very nice.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:43.600
The Kodak M1093. For more information on the Kodak M1093

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.370
also available in a number of colors: Black, White, Grey, Red,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:55.760
go to any of these retailers listed here, or type in K23-4302 into any major search engine.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.840
