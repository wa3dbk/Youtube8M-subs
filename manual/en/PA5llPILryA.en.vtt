00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920
 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.430
 Hi, I'm Matt. This is my friend, Norah, and we're going to show 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.560
 you around the surgery area. 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.990
 (Norah) Just like you, we both had surgery here. 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.950
 (Matt) Come on, let's get started. 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.770
 You're probably here for a surgery where a doctor called a "surgeon" 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.150
 may fix a part of your body. 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.340
 It's normal to be a little nervous, but the people you will meet are 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.400
 all here to help you and can answer any 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.870
 questions you may have regarding your surgery. 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.860
 First, you'll check in at the registration desk so the doctors and

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.780
 nurses know you're here. 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.390
 They'll give you an I.D. bracelet with your name and birthday on it. 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.490
 You and your family will go into an exam room where you will change 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.950
 your clothes, put on hospital pajamas or a hospital gown and slipper socks. 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.280
 The doctors and nurses will want to make sure you're healthy before

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.040
 your surgery. The nurse will check your vital signs. 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.810
 Do you know what your vital signs are? 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.210
 Your vital signs are things like your heartbeat and temperature. 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.440
 The nurse will listen to your heartbeat by using a tool called a stethoscope. 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.480
 That's called a blood pressure cuff. 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.580
 It feels like a tight hug on your arm or leg. 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.540
 The nurse will use a thermometer to check to see if you have a high 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.310
 temperature or fever. The nurse might check your temperature in your 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.940
 ear, under your tongue, on your forehead or in your armpit. 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.390
 The nurse will need to know how much oxygen or air you have in your body. 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.040
 The nurse will put a tiny band-aid with a little red light on your finger or toe. 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.980
 This is called a pulse oximeter.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.820
 Don't worry, the red light never gets hot. 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.660
 The nurse will also need to know how tall you are and how much you weigh. 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.650
 You and your family will talk with two kinds of doctors. 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.730
 One doctor is your surgeon. The other doctor is the anesthesiologist,

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.600
 or the doctor who gives you your sleep medicine. 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.470
 You can ask your doctors any questions you might have. 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.500
 This doctor will talk with you about the medicine you will have to sleep.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.830
 The sleep for surgery is different from when you are at home in your bed. 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.050
 This is a playroom with lots of toys and activities

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.640
 you can do while you wait to go to the room where you will get your 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.140
 sleep medicine. 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.940
 When it's time to go into the room where you will get your sleep medicine, 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.060
 the person that brought you might get to wear a hat, mask, 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.600
 and a suit called a "bunny suit." 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.860
 They don't look like bunnies, they look like Smurfs! 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.540
 The nurses wear clothes called scrubs, a hat, and a mask. 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.650
 They wear these outfits to keep it really clean in the room where you 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.250
 get your sleep medicine so that you won't get any germs. 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.420
 Germs can sometimes make you sick. 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.310
 Depending on the type of surgery or procedure, parents and medical 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.640
 staff may or may not wear a mask and hat. 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.230
 Do you have a blanket or stuffed animal? 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.400
 You can bring this into the room with you if you want. 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.160
 Some kids walk to the sleep room and other kids ride in a bed. 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.220
 This is a room where kids get their sleep medicine. 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.020
 See this big, blue pillow? 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.520
 The machine behind this gives you the sleep medicine. 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.150
 See those lights? They might be a little bright, but they won't touch you. 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.700
 The doctor uses them to see better. 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.610
 You'll see your nurses and doctors in this room. 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.980
 Most kids breathe their sleep medicine through a mask. 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.980
 Sometimes the sleep medicine smells funny, so they might let you 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.830
 pick a scent or flavor before you start to make it smell better. 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.140
 Other kids get their sleep medicine through an I.V., 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.190
 which is a short name for an intravenous catheter. 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.560
 The tiny tube sits in your vein to give your body a drink. 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.740
 Veins are the blue lines you see when you look at the 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.750
 back of your hand or arm.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.220
 The nurses can give you medicine through your I.V. to help you feel better. 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.210
 When you sleep with this medicine, it's a little different than when

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.660
 you sleep at home. 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.390
 When you're asleep for surgery, you won't feel anything. 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.650
 You'll sleep the whole time the doctor is fixing your body. 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.260
 When the surgery is done, the sleep doctor will stop giving you your 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.600
 sleep medicine. 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.430
 Then you'll wake up in the recovery room. 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.950
 You will also meet a nurse who will help you feel comfortable. 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.140
 Whoever came with you can see you when you wake up. 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.950
 When you wake up, you might get a popsicle, juice, slushies, 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.760
 or other things to drink.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.150
 Before your surgery, it's important not to eat or drink

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.480
 anything for a little while, because the sleep medicine helps your whole 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.910
 body fall asleep, including your stomach. 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.160
 If you have food or drink in your stomach, then it may get sick and 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.520
 make your surgery unsafe. 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.900
 When you're ready to leave the hospital, the nurse will gently take 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.150
 the tape and I.V. off your hand or arm. 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.140
 It feels just like taking a band-aid off!

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.030
 If you are spending the night at the hospital, then you and whoever 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.710
 brought you will go together to your room here. 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.120
 There is a playroom with fun things for you to do while you are here. 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.970
 When the doctor says you're ready, then you'll get to leave the hospital. 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.400
 (Norah) And then your surgery is over! 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.220
 (Matt) It's a lot easier than I thought it would be.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.780
 (music)

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.060
 (Matt) And now we're going to share 10 of our favorite

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.950
 things about surgery at Children's Colorado. 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.310
 Child Life Specialists! 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.950

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.730

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.550
 The ball machine! 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.730
 Lego hospital!

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.030
 Bring your blanket or stuffed animal!

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.660
 Stress balls and pinwheels!

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.780
 Popsicles!
