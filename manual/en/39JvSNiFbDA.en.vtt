00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.300
First, I´m going to paint the interior of the first bottle. 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:23.020
For this, I´m going to mix acrylic paint with water and afterwards I´m going to fill it into the bottle.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.660
The paint should not be too thin.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.160
Next, I´m going to fill the paint into the bottle.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:13.040
And then I turn the bottle, so the paint spreads evenly.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.280
Then I´m goning to let it dry.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:12.420
I let the paint dry over night and then I sprayed a layer of adhesive spray on the bottle, so the paint, that I´m going to add now, will stick to it better.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:21.020
Now, I take a thin brush and acrylic paint and then I´m going to paint on the bottle.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:01.940
It looks like this, when it´s completed and now I´m going to spray a coat of varnish on the bottle, in order to seal everything.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.360
I´m going to use an acrylic spray for the other two bottles.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:53.380
Next, I´m going to paint with Pearl Pens and Paper Pens on the bottle.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:34.380
After painting on the bottles, I added a coat of varnish. And now the bottles are finished.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.460
If you want, you can put a string of lights into the bottle.
