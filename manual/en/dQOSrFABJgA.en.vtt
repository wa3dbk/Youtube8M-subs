00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.460
Hello everyone

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.780
Today I have the Disney Frozen Sparkling Paper
Dolls

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.380
That comes with Queen Elsa and Princess Anna

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.780
And of course Olaf

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.580
Elsa comes with this beautiful dress

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.120
And Anna comes with this beautiful dress

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.840
And see how sparkly the snowflakes are

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.180
Okay the first thing it comes with is this
beautiful background

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.760
And you can see Queen Elsa's palace way back
there

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.900
Very Pretty

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.440
And Elsa

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.960
And her stand is a little tricky

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.830
You want to put the left one here

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.640
And you want to put the right one here

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.240
And in the back you want to criss-cross them

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.100
Like that

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.110
Making it a triangle that allows her to stand
up

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.100
They already look so pretty and we haven't
even dressed them up yet

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.900
Lets do Elsa first because she comes with
this beautiful dress

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.200
This beautiful sparkly dress

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.320
That you just punch out

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.140
An put on

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.220
And I think I'll go with the

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.160
Gold

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.180
Crown or tiara

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.950
And now its Anna's turn

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:06.200
To put on her beautiful sparkly dress

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.740
And again it just punches out

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.040
This is the skirt

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.400
And this is the top

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.280
They both look so pretty

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.000
I almost forgot Anna's necklace

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.060
Anna looks so pretty

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.860
Elsa looks so pretty too

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:02.100
But Anna has decided she would like to go
out in the snow with Olaf

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.040
So she's going to change

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.580
She'll be right back

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:36.060
Olaf looks happy that she came outside to
play with him in the snow

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.390
Thanks for watching

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.260
Bye
