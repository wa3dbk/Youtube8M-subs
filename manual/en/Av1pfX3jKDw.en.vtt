00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.357
 

00:00:06.357 --> 00:00:08.186
It's so good to see you.

00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:09.960
Oh, it's fantastic to be back.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.219
I have a whole gaggle of girls
that I haven't seen in years,

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.510
because we're all over the
country, in different places

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.244
all coming.

00:00:18.244 --> 00:00:22.160
But the first time, I came
here I was only 13 or 14,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.450
came up to visit
my eldest cousin.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.490
And that was it.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.670
I knew I was going here.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.934
I sat down in front of
Thompson Hall and just said,

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:32.850
this is what college is
supposed to feel like.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.230
This is it.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.350
And then driving back yesterday,
passing the old farms,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.610
I actually got teary-eyed,
because it was just

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.590
like, oh my god, for
a while this was home.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.230
So much happened here.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.010
And it all came flooding back.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.270
Some of the most significant
changes in your life

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.400
happen in college.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.650
You're in that between
of finding where

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.380
you want to go for
the rest of your life

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.040
and letting go of anything
of childhood in many ways.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.850
So it's very significant.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.080
The friendships you
make here run deeper

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.440
and they last a lifetime.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.290
And then academically,
I always loved books.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.750
I loved storytelling.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.685
I knew I wanted to do
something in that area,

00:01:18.685 --> 00:01:19.890
but didn't know what it was.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.040
I hadn't been a writer
before that at all.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.010
I was always drawing
stories, and I was always

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.110
making up stories, but not
really focusing on writing.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.541
And it started here.

00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:31.040
So I started doing
creative writing.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.340
And then I was doing
poetry with Charles Simic.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.950
And then I was taking dance
classes and studio art painting

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.510
classes.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.290
And just that Liberal Arts
education just fit me.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.580
I went right into book
publishing from here,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.169
and started writing
my own stories.

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:45.710
And then that turned
into filmmaking.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.940
So I think here was when I
really began that serious work.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.770
The way the world has
embraced the film.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.260
Chris Buck and I,
my co-director,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.370
we talk all the time.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.650
We can't process it.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.990
It's a little too big for
our heads to get around.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.550
And it pops up
every now and then.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.410
It hits you like you'll
be in the airport

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.480
and you'll hear a little
girl singing, Let It Go.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.355
And you're in Mexico.

00:02:08.355 --> 00:02:19.240
 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.930
The funny thing
is when they asked

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.620
me to be the
commencement speaker.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.020
My first reaction was like,
I'm way too young to do that,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.900
and then I realized I wasn't.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.710
So that was hard.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.800
 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.040
I made the mistake of looking at
commencement speeches of people

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.010
like Ellen DeGeneres
and Steven Colbert, who

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.600
are not only hosts,
but hilarious.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.510
So I was like, I'm doomed.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.312
And then I won't
say who, but then

00:02:44.312 --> 00:02:45.770
I watched a few of
the politicians.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.800
And I was like, all right, I'll
fall somewhere in the middle.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.510
To come back means
the world to me.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.060
It's such an honor
and I love being here.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.690
Thank you.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.440
Congratulations.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:12.422
