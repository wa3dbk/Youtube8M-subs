00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.279
The Jonard Industries UST 100 series
of cable prep tools are designed to

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:29.470
strip RG59, RG6, RG6 tri and quad, RG7, and
RG11 coaxial cables for CATV and video

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:37.180
applications in many CAT5, CAT6, and other
UTP type cables. This smart, sleek, and

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.579
versatile design makes prepping cable
simple, quick, and affordable and it's

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.600
ambidextrous design is perfect for both
right and left-handed technicians

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.160
because the interchangeable blades can
be placed on either side of the tool. The

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.449
UST 100 series starts with the tool
itself and changes based on the

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:06.280
cartridge chosen. The UST 100 model uses
the UST 205 cartridge for RG59, RG6, RG7,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:14.790
and RG11 coaxial cables. The UST 1596
model uses the UST-210 cartridge a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.540
double sided RG59 and RG6 coax blade,
giving you a blade exclusively for RG59

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:32.100
and RG6 cables. The UST-150 model uses
the UST-215 cartridge for stripping RG59,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:42.219
RG6, CAT5, CAT6, and other UTP cables. To
use a UST-100 series tool, place the

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:47.259
cable in the end of the tool. Make note
of the stop or stop marker indicating

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.539
how much cable to insert into the tool.
The UTP cartridge is the one exception.

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:58.590
It does not have a stop for CAT cables.
After cable insertion, turn the tool

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.750
several times around the cable until you
no longer feel any resistance. Remove the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.940
tool and pull the strip jacket and
shield away from the cable. The cable is

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.730
now ready to be terminated. Jonard
Industries offers a full line of fiber

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.970
