00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:16.909
Weird and wonderful take one. 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.349
Thank you. This is Caleb here, 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.519
our intern from prison. Thank you very much.
Okay, so, we're going to do another

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.380
session of weird and wonderful. It's gonan be beautiful. Now do you know,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.710
what this is?

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.760
Yes, this is your everyday,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.070
leafy, non-waxed lemon. 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.070
Oh yes. But

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.180
today

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.620
is a time where we don't just have that kind of lemon,

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.480
we have this kind of lemon.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.739
We're talking a big lemon. A big bad ass lemon. 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.810
This my friends,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.230
is the one and only 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.010
cedro lemon.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.560
It is a citrus fruit, it is a member of the lemon family

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.900
but where as this 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.830
if cut in half 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.770
gives you your normal

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.560
juicy

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.860
lemon situation across the nation

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.820
this is what we get here

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.450
which is as you can see not particularly juicy. If you come forward have a look at this. If you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.050
have a look in there

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.610
this pith, unlike this lemon, is not bitter. 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.360
This is a neutral pith. It's also quite firm, if you can look in there you can see it's

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.610
quite firm

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.560
and also you can see

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.030
that the skin 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.500
is knobbly like an old mans nose. An important thing is you can't go using this delicately 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.360
if your going to clunk it up all chunky. You don't want that in your salad.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.170
So we need to use so
skills. Now that comes in the form of

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.340
knife skills

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.120
or our dear friend

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.740
Mr. Mandolin.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.690
Go as fine

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.100
as you think you can get away with.
fThe finer you will get it

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.780
the better it will be

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.780
uh... when you use your mandolin

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.570
use a guard

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.409
because you don't want to cut yourself.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.549
I know I'm setting a bad example today, but 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.779
I lost my guard. 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.159
And that

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.419
is how my fourth child was born. 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:18.620
Over here we're going to do a bruschetta.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.179
Some people say brusketta, it's bruschetta.

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:24.009
What is it bruschetta? It's not brusketta. 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.219
Jim, is it bruschetta?
It's brusketta.

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.139
Brusketta? Si. 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.849
Okay, back here... sourdough bread

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.299
uh... about a centimeter thick.

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.219
We are going to toast, we are going to put our cheddar and lemon in.

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:40.949
So put in some lemon juice, 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:43.479
we're going to go in with a pinch of salt, 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:45.019
very important, 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:51.049
and some very good olive oil. 
I'm going to choose a herb - mint is really, really good. I might just take some mint

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.409
and chop it up. I'm going to do that now. 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.099
Just finely chop the mint. 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.919
The thing I really love about Italian food

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.409
is there is a simplicity there.

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.859
So let's finely slice some chillies

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.129
so in you go my friend,a little wodge of rocket

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:12.329
rocket we're gonna just toss this up, like that. 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.879
Just get a little bit of garlic, 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.930
just cut it in half.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.400
It's a bruschetta so just rub it a few times, 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.909
we're then going to drizzle it 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.549
with good olive oil again.

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.479
Get a couple of tomatoes

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.879
and once you've rubbed it with garlic and olive oil

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.299
just get a tomatoe

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.869
squeeze it a bit 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:34.419
and just sqaush that tomato in and around

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.119
the whole toast,

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:38.379
and you can leave it on the toast as well. 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.309
Then we come to our mozzarella. We're going to 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:42.699
tear this open

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:46.249
and we're going to kind of unwind it, see how it's unwinding.

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:48.149
We're going to unwind that little, 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:49.070
beautiful thing.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.370
Toss up your salad

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.269
when it looks pretty in the bowl, just pick it up 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.689
then go on top.

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.179
Very simple. 

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:58.519
Very unusual. 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.539
Definitely weird and wonderful.

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.879
So look at that. 
That that my friends is a bruschetta with cedro lemons,

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:04.729
rocket, mint

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:09.169

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.240
unusual

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:28.830

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.880
Cue the music Caleb, 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.710
go on cue it. 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.969
Don't throw the lemon, eat the lemon - 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:41.249
you don't throw the lemon.
