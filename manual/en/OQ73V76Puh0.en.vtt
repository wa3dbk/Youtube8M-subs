00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.630
The Third Plate came off of research about
the history of our food culture.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:15.470
And what I came to realize is that we have
a pretty bad history when it comes to food

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.440
culture and really what that means is that
we eat off of this – or we have been eating

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.780
off of what I was calling the first plate
which is a protein centric plate of food.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.330
It’s a steak, a seven ounce steak with a
little bit of vegetable, a little bit of grain

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.369
on the side.

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.530
But essentially it’s protein takes center
stage.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.170
And the second plate as I describe in my book
is sort of we’ve come out of the first plate

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.050
and enter the second plate with this farm
to table movement.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.190
The good food movement.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.679
It’s really about knowing where your ingredients
come from.

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:53.420
So the steak is now grass fed and the vegetables
are organic and the grain is, you know, I

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.789
mean instead of white rice it’s whole grains.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.420
But the problem with the second plate is that
it looks very much like the first plate.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.119
The architecture is the same.

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:06.970
So while it’s a better plate of food – gastronomically
it’s better and from an environmental perspective

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.300
it’s better.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.940
The architecture dictates a kind of caring
capacity that the land can’t support at

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.780
least in our region it can’t support it
for very long.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.560
For a growing population, for a cuisine or
for a pattern of eating, you know, two times

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.690
a day, seven days a week to expect that kind
of architecture from our diets is a huge expectation.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.840
And to export that diet to the rest of the
world, the Western diet.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:40.030
It’s really the American diet is unfortunate
and also the true definition of not sustainable.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.530
So the third plate is sort of a way to kind
of circle out of that and take the progress

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.350
of knowing where our ingredients come from
but changing the architecture and looking

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.700
at a plate of food not so much as what we
expect from our lunch or dinner but what is

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.430
the land telling us it can provide and then
figuring out a cuisine, a pattern of eating

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.640
that responds landscape and actually improves
landscape.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:16.689
The best farmscapes or the best farmlands
in any region are always about an abundance

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:17.689
of diversity.

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:22.719
Those are the healthiest landscapes because
in a natural setting there’s no such thing

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:23.719
as a monoculture.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.209
There’s no such thing as lack of diversity.

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.069
In fact the world – a natural environment
is defined by its diversity.

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.549
Even the most severe environments.

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:40.340
And so what we need to do as eaters because
as eaters we are disrupting a natural food

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.250
system, a natural system, any natural system.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.069
Domestication is about disruption of a natural
system.

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.640
And the art in eating and the art in cooking
and the art in farming, all three of the correspondents

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.159
of all three is really about disrupting that
natural landscape thoughtfully and with a

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.159
thought to the future.

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.930
How can it not only be disrupted but disrupted
well so that it improves the ecological conditions

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.529
and functioning of nature and doesn’t take
away from it.

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:10.970
That’s really the true definition of sustainability.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.319
How do we think about improving ecological
function, water use, diversity, life both

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.739
in the soil and above the soil, diversity
of life.

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:21.860
It’s always about diversity.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.180
So one surefire way to encourage that is to
eat with a diverse plate.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.500
So if you’re cooking at home – by the
way if you’re cooking at home you’re already

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.290
doing a lot because that means somebody else
isn’t cooking for you.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.879
When someone else cooks for you it generally
means that they’re cooking less delicious

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.900
food and they’re cooking food that’s less
good for you.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.500
Because usually when we process food we end
up denuding it and denuding it in ways that

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.450
go beyond just health and just flavor as well.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.019
So the best thing you can do is cook your
own food.

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.449
And then the second best thing you can do
is cook with diversity.
