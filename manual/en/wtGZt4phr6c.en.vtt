00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:08.066
- Boo, boop.

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:08.658
Hello

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:10.516
Let's be cool, let's be cool.

00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:12.130
What's up?

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.092
Don't judge this scot glass-- Scot glass?

00:00:14.092 --> 00:00:16.797
They say the best chefs cook
on the highest temperatures.

00:00:16.797 --> 00:00:18.259
And I say, "So do I".

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:19.571
Does that make me good?

00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:20.894
Late 80s are back.

00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:22.334
Oh, god.

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:23.797
Mama's a little drunk.

00:00:23.797 --> 00:00:25.051
Yeah, it's going to be
one of those kitchens.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.105
Hola, everybody.

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:31.085
This week on My Drunk Kitchen,
we're making enchiladas.

00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:31.746
"Why?" you may ask.

00:00:31.746 --> 00:00:34.022
Because, when you set out
to get something done,

00:00:34.022 --> 00:00:35.786
or to marry someone,

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:38.306
or to commit to a new thing in
your life, like a big change,

00:00:38.306 --> 00:00:40.360
you must embrace it for all that it is.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.721
You must, in fact, accept
the whole enchilada.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.834
Oooooh!

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:47.987
(mumbling)

00:00:47.987 --> 00:00:50.507
Don't judge a scotch
glass by its contents.

00:00:50.507 --> 00:00:53.222
It says scotch on the
outside, but on the inside,

00:00:53.222 --> 00:00:55.898
it feels more like a
mixed tequila-based drink.

00:00:55.898 --> 00:00:59.477
Step numero uno in
making an enchilada is to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.445
"pour the oil into a medium pot,

00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:05.626
and warm it up until it's
hot, but not sizzling."

00:01:05.626 --> 00:01:07.530
Cheers, my dears!

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.109
That's not my mouth.

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.443
Mmmmmmm!

00:01:11.443 --> 00:01:13.626
(sings)

00:01:14.827 --> 00:01:15.436
Ahhhh!

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:16.898
Oil be the judge of that.

00:01:16.898 --> 00:01:18.152
This is a tortilla.

00:01:18.152 --> 00:01:19.776
This is a hand full of cheese.

00:01:19.776 --> 00:01:22.378
These are the basic
ingredients of an enchilada.

00:01:22.378 --> 00:01:23.934
But, we don't want to burn our tortillas.

00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:27.006
But, we're going to
lightly cook, but not fry,

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:30.457
the tortillas, so that we can
wrap them around the cheese,

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.581
without them breaking.

00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:32.999
It broke.

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:36.943
(sings)

00:01:36.943 --> 00:01:38.742
While this lightly cooks,
you want to go ahead and

00:01:38.742 --> 00:01:40.251
prep your paper towel and your plate,

00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:41.690
so you can get all the oil off of it,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.245
and then touch it later,
without it being super oily.

00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:44.960
Don't burn yourself.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.580
If you don't have tongs, use chopsticks.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.938
Mmmmmm!

00:01:47.938 --> 00:01:49.661
Ow! Who knew?

00:01:49.661 --> 00:01:51.045
Great.

00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:55.600
Next, take your baking
dish, and ... cuddle it.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.456
Pour enchilada sauce to
lightly coat the bottom.

00:01:58.456 --> 00:01:59.532
Boo boop!

00:01:59.532 --> 00:02:01.835
Coat the baste of your baking thing--

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:06.153
Set your expectations
like a fine spicy base.

00:02:06.153 --> 00:02:08.440
If you proportion them evenly,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.693
meaning, not too high, and not too low,

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:13.375
you're guaranteed to find success.

00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:17.960
Small disclaimer: There are
no guarantees ... in life.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.946
Next step is to take your enchilada,

00:02:19.946 --> 00:02:21.684
and put it in a bowl with
more enchilada sauce.

00:02:21.684 --> 00:02:26.458
But, I'm pretty sure I can
just roll this around in here.

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:28.652
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:28.652 --> 00:02:30.278
And then stuff it with cheese,

00:02:30.278 --> 00:02:33.804
roll it up, and scootch it to the side.

00:02:33.804 --> 00:02:37.615
Add some cheese, in queso emergency.

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:40.238
The warm, gooey cheese is like your own

00:02:40.238 --> 00:02:42.177
malleable, flexible nature,

00:02:42.177 --> 00:02:44.151
which can bend and twist to any

00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:46.752
new adventure that life
sets out before you.

00:02:46.752 --> 00:02:49.175
Ooooh! Can you guys see what I'm doing?

00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:50.896
I hope so, because I feel like

00:02:50.896 --> 00:02:52.812
we're going to make a good, tasty thing.

00:02:52.812 --> 00:02:54.436
Another one of this.

00:02:54.436 --> 00:02:56.852
I really hate when my hands get sticky.

00:02:56.852 --> 00:02:59.011
I really didn't want to
compromise in this way,

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:00.798
but I'm in it, and I'm gonna win it.

00:03:00.798 --> 00:03:02.059
Find your way to cope.

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:03.104
Mmmmm.

00:03:03.104 --> 00:03:08.104
It's hot in here, there must
be 'chiladas in the atmosphere.

00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:10.046
Roll it, roll it, roll it a lot.

00:03:10.046 --> 00:03:11.508
Ooooh, more cheeses.

00:03:11.508 --> 00:03:14.365
Just in case things get
dicey, like these onions,

00:03:14.365 --> 00:03:17.267
remember, that's a natural
part of the journey you're on.

00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:19.322
You've made a commitment,
and you're going to

00:03:19.322 --> 00:03:24.268
adhere to that commitment by
accepting the whole enchilada.

00:03:24.268 --> 00:03:26.906
We're really running with this theme.

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:29.098
And now we roll, and we're rolling,

00:03:29.098 --> 00:03:30.905
and we're rolling with the punches.

00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:31.869
Mmmmm!

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:36.071
Last but not least, take your final--

00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:37.592
An interloper.

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.099
You're going to take this enchilada,

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.539
and you're going to add chicken to it,

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.547
because you want meat, and you are hungry.

00:03:43.547 --> 00:03:44.708
Are you guys ever drinking,

00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:46.821
and you breathe out through your nose?

00:03:46.821 --> 00:03:48.342
Next, we're going to add some protein.

00:03:48.342 --> 00:03:49.665
"What kind of protein?" you may ask?

00:03:49.665 --> 00:03:53.044
The canned chicken kind, of course.

00:03:53.044 --> 00:03:54.808
Oh, god.

00:03:54.808 --> 00:03:58.883
This is canned chicken,
smells a lot like tuna,

00:03:58.883 --> 00:04:00.926
looks a lot like sadness.

00:04:00.926 --> 00:04:04.035
Wrap it up ... is what
you're telling yourself

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:06.083
about this video, on a whole.

00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:07.883
Great, this one has canned chicken in it.

00:04:07.883 --> 00:04:08.846
Yummmm!

00:04:08.846 --> 00:04:10.599
Now that you've got a base
of four more enchiladas,

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.920
poor more enchilada
sauce all over the top.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.043
Take some mozzarella,
sprinkle it all over the top.

00:04:17.043 --> 00:04:18.958
Because, at least if
it's covered in cheese,

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.685
you'll still be compelled,
naturally, to eat it.

00:04:22.685 --> 00:04:24.066
Take this beautiful monstrosity,

00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:26.261
and put it in the oven
for 20 or 30 minutes.

00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:27.386
Have fun!

00:04:27.386 --> 00:04:28.745
Now wash your hands.

00:04:28.745 --> 00:04:30.800
Cheers. Mmmmmm.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.936
Oh, my god, it smells like cat food.

00:04:37.998 --> 00:04:39.856
You guys know that point
in alcohol consumption,

00:04:39.856 --> 00:04:42.817
where you can't taste alcohol any more?

00:04:42.817 --> 00:04:45.278
That's what I like to
call, "The Danger Zone".

00:04:45.278 --> 00:04:47.995
It means, anything after that point,

00:04:47.995 --> 00:04:50.368
is dangerous for you to do.

00:04:50.368 --> 00:04:52.000
(whistles)

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.961
Holy shit, it looks delicious!

00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:57.638
Oh, my god! We've done it again.

00:04:57.638 --> 00:05:00.660
Holiest of guacamoliest, guys!

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.590
We've made a real food.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.828
Ow, it's hot! You burnt me!

00:05:04.828 --> 00:05:07.076
I don't know if I accept that.

00:05:07.076 --> 00:05:08.449
Garnish, garnish, garnish.

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.409
It's a whole enchilada, just for me.

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:12.534
Now, add avocado.

00:05:12.534 --> 00:05:13.263
"Why?" you may ask.

00:05:13.263 --> 00:05:16.637
Mainly, just because
you really want avocado.

00:05:16.637 --> 00:05:18.593
Hot, you wait, too hot!

00:05:18.593 --> 00:05:19.742
Mmmmm!

00:05:19.742 --> 00:05:22.120
Happy Enchilada Day.

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.616
The whole enchilada.

00:05:26.616 --> 00:05:29.100
