00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:02.290
- We're doing City Links
because it's a great way

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.174
to get more involved in the community,

00:00:04.174 --> 00:00:07.075
so that we're not just a school on a map.

00:00:07.075 --> 00:00:10.100
We're a school that embraces
the entire community.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.844
We're a school that really makes a name

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:15.974
for the community and shows how
much we love serving others.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:20.672
(students talking)
(upbeat music)

00:00:20.672 --> 00:00:24.149
- City Links, really, is your
opportunity to get connected

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.828
to the local community.

00:00:25.828 --> 00:00:27.401
- Is the door open?

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:29.970
- It's a new chapter in
your life, and today,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.203
we'll being doing a new
page in that chapter.

00:00:32.203 --> 00:00:33.702
You will be different in the afternoon

00:00:33.702 --> 00:00:35.887
than you are right now because
you're going to move people.

00:00:35.887 --> 00:00:38.070
They're going to have
the opportunity with you

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.001
and have you be part of their family.

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.918
(students talking)

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.666
(vacuuming)

00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:56.492
- We do City Links
because we need to get out

00:00:56.492 --> 00:00:57.790
and serve in our community.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.880
- We have a group that's
preparing sandwiches.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.671
We have people getting rid of termites.

00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:04.836
It's just a lot of service
going around the old church.

00:01:04.836 --> 00:01:06.947
- I think it's really
an awesome opportunity

00:01:06.947 --> 00:01:09.679
to serve our local community and be aware

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:12.518
that there are a lot of things you can do.

00:01:12.518 --> 00:01:15.852
- Doing this as a freshman,
it helps you get involved

00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:16.994
in the community right away.

00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:18.838
They just moved in a couple weeks ago.

00:01:18.838 --> 00:01:20.633
- [Megan] It's kind of
a humbling experience

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:24.800
just coming out and giving
part of our day to help others.

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:38.472
(upbeat music)

00:01:47.817 --> 00:01:51.641
(students cheering)

(students laughing and talking)
