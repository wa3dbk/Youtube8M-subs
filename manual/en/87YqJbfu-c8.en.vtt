00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.470
Hi Fitlifer, Drew Canole it's another exciting
episode of Fitlife.tv.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.000
I have a personal friend who's really really
close to me, almost like a family member of

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
sorts.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.160
They've been living their life for a while
in the victim mentality, right.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.430
I'd like to say there's two types of people,
there's the victims, and there's the victors.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.850
They're the people that are [after] conquering
in their life.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.790
The victor believes that every single thing
in their life that they are responsible for.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.500
There's no outside circumstance, there's'
nothing outside of themselves that can't be

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.500
fixed.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.120
So this is a very powerful perspective on
life and in life, all we have is our perceptions.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.010
The victim believes that everyone's out to
get them.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.480
They're always injured, there's always medical
ailments going on, there's all these situations

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.460
always coming up and it's completely out of
their control.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.899
They like to blame everything and everyone
else; whereas the victor goes off every single

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.840
day and knows that that person that cut in
front of them is an extension of their own

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.570
consciousness that they manifest to that and
if you don't know what that means you [inaudible]

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.570
by watching our videos on Fitlife.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.880
These 2 very distinct perceptions are what
create everything.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.110
You see, right now the world is filled with
victims.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.990
95 percent of the world's population believe
that every single thing in their life from

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.600
the moment they get up out of bed and put
their feet on the floor throughout the waking

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.210
day, for the next 12 hours, their circumstance
created not by them but created by outside

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.210
of them.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.660
And I strongly strongly suggest in this Mindset
Monday that you, if you are a victim and you

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.890
start to shapeshift your thoughts because
those thoughts are going to create your circumstance.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.240
When I wake up in the morning, the first thing
I do is I say 'Who am I going to bring in

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.240
my experience?'

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.710
'Who can I impact today?' and 'What lesson
do you want me to learn?' and when I say that

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.020
it's an open question, I don't try to answer
it with my human mind, human thinking gets

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.020
you nowhere.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.649
I let the universal mind or whatever you want
to call it come in throughout the day and

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.319
then show the expression of that and through
that expression, magic happens, miracles start

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.040
to happen in my life, because I have that
mentality.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.900
It's all about asking the right question,
so if you are a victim, start to ask better

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.900
questions.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.760
'How can my life get better?'

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.419
'What can I do every single day?' and you
leave it at that, don't try to answer it,

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:28.879
don't try to solve your own problems, let
those problems solve themselves.

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.410
As a victor, you know that everything is created
by you, you go off throughout the day and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.280
you bring about miracles into your experience.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.680
You start to notice that there's this underlining
something [left] of energy right?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.359
As a victim, you're constantly living in the
land of 'me'.

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.529
It's all about me; it's all about what's happening
in my world.

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:54.150
My world's not good enough among all these
prescription medications nobody cares about

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.150
me.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.650
I wake up every morning, I do all of these
stuff and yet the world still shits on me,

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.650
right?

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.950
Over and over and over again, living in the
land of me.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.280
What I want to encourage you to do, as becoming
the victor that you are, and we're going to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.980
talk about this over the next few weeks is
we're going to talk about moving you from

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.730
the land of me into the land of we.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.530
As a victor you know that you create every
single thing in your experience based on the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.400
thoughts that you have.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.230
So if you know that that is powerful and that's
a really really strong paradigm in your own

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.370
life then you start to shift it in others.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.620
If I can change my life by switching my thoughts
how can I impact everyone else and that's

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.730
much more power.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.209
Anytime, anybody has a physical ailment or
they're stressed out or depressed and they

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.469
come to me for you know, guidance, I always
tell them to start thinking about others.

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:47.150
It's the easiest way to get outside of yourself,
truly start thinking about other people and

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.900
how you can make a difference in their life,
guess what happens, your life doesn't look

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.529
so bad.

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:58.379
So I encourage you to stop living in the land
of me, stop thinking about all the ways your

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.879
life sucks and start thinking about everyone
else.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:07.669
In this mindset Monday I really want you to
get clear on which one you are, are you the

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.889
victim, are you the victor.

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:16.190
So when I say we're in this together, I'm
talking about living in the land of we.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.120
You and me living in this land, helping each
other and getting outside of ourselves, almost

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.199
like selfless development right?

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:30.360
People spend millions of dollars every single
year on self development; let's start developing

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.229
our selfless development.

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.389
