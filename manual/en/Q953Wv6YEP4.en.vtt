00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.559
so a Ducati Shan Britannica welcome to
Thai pot 101.com the walks on Thai made

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.689
easy the fastest easiest and most fun
way to learn the Thai alphabet the walks

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:27.199
on high in the last lesson we learned to
tie consonant and one vowel do you

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.789
remember them in this lesson we are
going to learn three more consonants and

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:38.000
your first turn rule ready to start now
let's go the three consonants that you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.520
are going to learn are all low class
consonants

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.150
the first one is long whew it makes the
cell look just like the ng at the end of

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.160
the word sing this sound is not
difficult for English speakers you just

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.590
have to get used to making the sound you
know at the beginning of words - Gong Wu

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.640
is also named after an animal can you
guess which one mu means snake you can

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.730
remember the shape of this letter easily
just think of a snake with its body bent

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.770
get out your pen and paper and let's
practice writing it together start with

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.000
the head drop down then veer up at an
angle it's easy right the next consonant

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.550
you learn is Yahya as the initial sign
of a syllable it makes the sound yeah

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.560
just like the letter Y and yes that's
the final set of a syllable it adds a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.080
sound e that blends with the vowel just
like the y at the end of the words say

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.110
and boy and if you're wondering about
the name of your yak the word yak means

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.840
a giant Yaya is distinctive because it's
the only tie letter with two bumps on

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.880
one side like this let's write your yak
together the hate goes counterclockwise

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.330
we make two bumps and then come back to
the top at the right angle

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.900
time for our last consonant this one is
called wall when it makes the sound or

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.360
just like a W in water but when it is
the final consonant in a syllable it

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.630
blends with the vowel to add a slight or
sound the name of Warren comes from the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.910
word when which means ring let's write
Warren together start with the hate at

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.590
the bottom and curl to the left

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.160
we've now learned five consonants plus
the long vowel sound

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.010
Sarah ah which we can use to make words
every syllable in Thai has one of five

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.480
tones mid low falling high or rising you
can always figure out the tone of a

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.040
syllable by how it is spelled the first
thing to know is the class of the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.380
consonant all the consonants we've
learned so far a low class the next

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.720
thing to know is if the syllable ending
is live or dead a life-ending is one

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.950
that makes it possible to keep
resonating the sound syllables that end

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.600
in long vowels alive do you remember the
word for ricefield

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.050
it was now this is a live syllable
because if I wanted to I could extend

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.740
the length of the word and say man as
long as I don't run out of breath the

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.620
sound goes on forever so it is the live
ending the five consonant sounds we've

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.260
learned are the only ones that can end a
syllable and make the ending life for

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.520
example you can keep making the sounds
hmm or mm for as long as you like but

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.400
you could not do it with or SHhhh
so now that we know what a live sound is

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.680
we can learn our first tone rule which
is low class initial consonant +

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.040
life-ending equals mid-tone a mid-tone
is pronounced at a flat pitch in the

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.780
middle of your regular vocal range now
is an example of a mid tone syllable now

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:19.850
now let's use a tone rule to make some
words wrong Oh Sarah ah no no makes nan

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:30.020
nan means work the sound of nanu makes
it a live syllable so it is mid-tone and

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.920
okay try to write it

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:41.300
namu Sara ah no no

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:50.069
and
the next word is yow which means long.we

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:57.840
right yow with Yaya that ah ah whoa when
yo yak is a low-class consonant to start

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.430
a syllable and well when at the end
makes it a live syllable so it's also

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.389
mid-tone
yow your turn to write it

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.280
Yaya

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:19.379
Sara ah
whoa an yeah

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:29.500
the last word is nigh which means boss
we write nigh with nanu Sarah ah yah yah

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.629
again it is mid-tone because it has an
initial low class consonant and has a

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:40.050
life-ending
okay one more for you to write

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.520
nan-oh

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.140
so ah ah
yeah yeah

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.919
nyeeeeehhh

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.090
now it's time for brattiness points ty
doesn't have a root sound like the

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.520
letter V in Valentine so ty speak is
used to letter well when in foreign

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.229
words that contain the letter V a lot of
new where Thai words are lone words from

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.729
English while much of the Thai base or
capillary consists of words that come

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:19.580
from Indian languages such as Sanskrit
and Pali do you know how to say good

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.770
entire in the next box on high made easy
lesson you'll learn how to say it and

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.190
how to write it to see you there so at
decaf
