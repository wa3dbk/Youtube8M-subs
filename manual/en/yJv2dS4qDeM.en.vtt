Part of our responsibility as being a veterinarian
is also taking care of wildlife and we are

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.660
wildlife certified and what we do with a lot
of these guys is help people that find these

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:19.970
and they are abandoned, this is a little juvenile
wild rabbit and we try to triage them, make

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.550
sure that they are ok treat any diseases that
we see and then try to get them to a rehab

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.839
facility so they can feed them and actually
release them at some point. So we do also

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:40.770
take care of lots of wildlife. What would
have been my hardest day as a veterinarian,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.670
honestly that would have had to be the day
that I had to deal with my own, one of my

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:56.500
own pets illness. And this was a very, an
older dog, geriatric dog, who had a chronic

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.630
illness and there always comes a day in, when
you are working with animals, that you feel

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.229
like they, you feel like they potentially
cannot go on. And when you are making that

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.290
decision about your own pet, that can be extremely
difficult. And one of the worst days for me

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.369
would have had to have been that day of deciding
for my own pet that it was time to let her

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.399
go. How did I get past that day would have
been revolving around the same skills that

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:33.509
I use day to day when I have to talk to people
about a let's say a dog with cancer, or a

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:41.929
dog that is geriatric and can't walk anymore,
and so you use your instincts, your people

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:48.289
skills, and your ability to understand that
you are actually helping these animals. That

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.740
this is something that you are going to make
them feel better, you are going to end their

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.929
suffering. And when you kind of put it into
those terms, that helps you overcome that

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.869
because you are actually helping them and
making them feel better.
