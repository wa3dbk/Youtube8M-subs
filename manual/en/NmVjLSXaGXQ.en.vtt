Welcome to OnlineSecurityScreens.com.au.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.960
In this video we�ll be taking you through
the correct way to measure and order your

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.500
new security screen.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.719
You are going to need a few tools for this
job.

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.199
Please ensure you have;
A Metric tape measure

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.750
A Pencil
The OnlineSecurityScreens.com.au Screen - Measure

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.919
Sheet
First, we�ll check two criteria to ensure

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.009
your new security screen can be installed
properly.

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.290
One: The existing window needs to be sliding,
double hung or louvre.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.440
If the window is a louvre window there must
be enough clearance for the blades to be fully

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.710
opened once the security screen is installed.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.090
Two: All security screens will be face fit.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.219
Therefore, there needs to be enough fixed
aluminium or timber, minimum 10mm, on a flat

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.280
plane on all four sides of the outside of
the opening section of the window for the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.789
screws to be inserted and not interfere with
any moving panels or components on the window.

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.070
If you are in doubt with either of these two
criteria please take a picture and send it

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:10.040
to info@onlinesecurityscreens.com.au with
your name and contact phone number.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.650
Okay � we will now begin filling out the
order details on the OnlineSecurityScreens.com.au

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.830
Screen - Measure Sheet to make ordering your
security screen as easy and efficient as possible.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.270
First you�ll need to decide on your security
screen style &amp; colour

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.390
Your style choices are SecureView 316 Marine
Grade Stainless Steel Mesh or Xceed Perforated

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.000
Aluminium Sheet
To choose your Colour: Use the colour chart

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.940
that can be ordered from OnlineSecurityScreens.com.au
to match existing window frames.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.020
Alternatively, obtain the colour from your
builder or house plans.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.880
Right, let�s measure your security screen.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.480
Starting with the Security Screen Height:
Measure the height of the flat plane in three

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.480
places.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.170
The two edges and the centre.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.570
Deduct 3mm from the smallest measurement &amp; record
on the screen - measure sheet.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.599
For the Security Screen Width: Measure the
width of the flat plane in three places.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.450
The top, centre and bottom.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.769
Deduct 3mm from the smallest measurement &amp; record
on the screen - measure sheet.

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.000
Please Note: Security screens can�t be built
out of square so make sure the flat plane

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.629
of your window is not more than 3mm out of
square.

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.260
If the flat plane of the window is more than
3mm out of square you can deduct more off

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.049
either the height or width to make it fit.

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.599
However, you will need to ensure that there
is still enough fixed aluminium or timber

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.840
to screw into.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.650
That�s it, now you are ready to order your
security screen online.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.540

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.879
