Hi.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.240
I'm Erick from Orbit and I'm here to talk
to you about one of Orbit's high performance

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.969
gear drive sprinklers.

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.670
Orbit offers a complete line up of gear drive
sprinklers with spray decencies starting at

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.720
15 all the way to 52 feet, including the number
one selling retail gear drive, the Voyager

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.220
II Professional.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.960
All of Orbit's gear drives offer an easy pattern
adjustment from 40 to a full 360 degrees as

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.370
well as having a simple distance adjustment.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.409
Each gear drive also has a precision filter
to make sure no dirt or debris in the water

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:40.510
system will clog up your nozzles.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.120
Today, we're going to talk specifically about
the Saturn III gear drive.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.319
The Saturn III is meant for small to medium
size watering areas with a spray distance

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:51.489
of 15 to 25 feet.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.640
It has a half inch female pipe threaded inlet
and a four inch pop-up pipe.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.059
It also has a 40 to 360 degree easy pattern
adjustment that can be down with just a small

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.539
screw driver and let me show you how it's
done.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.390
Before making any adjustments to your Saturn
III gear drive, you have to make sure that

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.820
the turret is locked in to its home position.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.400
To do that, you simply rotate the turret all
the way to the left and then all the way back

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.940
to the right until you feel it lock into place.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.580
Now, any adjustments are ready to be made.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.030
If you're going to adjust the spray pattern,
all you have to do is turn the pattern adjustment

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.420
screws seen here.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.750
With a flat headed screwdriver, simply turn
it clockwise to increase the angle or counter

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.100
clockwise to decrease the angle.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.450
For any distance adjustments, simply turn
the defuser screw.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.170
Again, clockwise to decrease the distance
or counter clockwise to increase the distance.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.920
You may have thought the gear drive sprinklers
were only well suited to water in very large

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.560
areas, the Saturn III gear drive with its
15 to 25 foot spray distance and easy pattern

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.250
adjustment from 40 to 360 degrees, will work
perfectly in almost size of yard and is sure

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.200
to keep your yard green and healthy for years
to come.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.310
