00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:26.720
Look, I'm no stranger to bad DS games.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.919
It's almost like it's become a game in itself,
for you guys.

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.820
"Hey, let's send Derek the worst games we
can find."

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.399
And that's cool, because I think it's funny,
too.

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.130
When I stop weeping and the thoughts of suicide
wear off...I think it's funny, too.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.500
So I'm usually prepared for bad games.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.680
But this one?

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.430
This was, like, I was expecting the left-hand
jab, but instead, I got...oh, someone dropped

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.059
a piano on my head.

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:53.920
So.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.760
The Wonder Pets!

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.560
Save The Animals!

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.879
That's two exclamation points, in that title.

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.660
One of which comes at the end of a sentence
fragment.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.820
I'm not sure what upsets me more.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.870
And frankly, I'm too flabbergasted by this
game to care.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.670
This game has three adventure modes, each
of which lasts about seven minutes.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.780
A few minigames aside...that's about 21 minutes
of total single-player gameplay.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.220
Currently, The Wonder Pets!

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.070
Save The Animals! costs about 21 dollars on
Amazon, which averages out to about a dollar

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.070
a minute.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:37.750
Even an ugly stripper, would be a better way
to spend a dollar a minute.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.990
Speaking of which...you get to pick their
outfits.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.990
No extra charge!

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.680
That's one of the game's little minigames,
of which there are three.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.520
But the thing is...that dress-up game repeats
itself in each of the three adventure modes,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.520
as well.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.320
I'm not going to count the minigames in this
thing, because frankly, there's already been

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.870
way too much math in this review.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.890
All I'm saying is...that's poopy.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:11.340
And five-year-olds know poopy.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.280
So quantity aside, what do the minigames entail?

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.810
Well, uh...sometimes, you get to match stuff.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.860
Other times, you get to...trace stuff.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.950
And sometimes, you get to scream stuff.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.340
Which, as far as I can tell, are about the
only capabilities of a young human.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.930
Hardly an impressive bunch.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.080
If we were dinosaurs, we'd just eat them.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.980
And look at this.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.879
Thing's designed in crayon.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.849
Obviously, with a game like this...you don't
want things to be complicated.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.879
So the approach of the minigames makes sense.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.190
Keep things simple.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.340
But it's not that these games are simple.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.760
They're godawful, man.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.349
And you know...when each of your main modes
only lasts seven minutes a piece, why not

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:51.580
make each one different?

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.680
That's like writing a haiku and saying you
ran out of words.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.310
There are lots of words.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.440
And you can find them in books.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.280
You f*cking moron.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:16.349
To its credit, the 
game does use the stylus, and the microphone...it

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.650
at leasts uses the unique attributes of the
Nintendo DS.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.310
And I guess for little kids, playing a game
like this kind of prepares them for the digital

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.530
world they're growing up in.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.530
I don't know.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.640
This is a terrible game, you guys.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.620
In fact, there's only one good thing about
it...and that's this piano thing.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.620
I could see kids having fun with this.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:49.180
And you can also teach 'em to play thrash
metal riffs.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.470
I'm not saying this is bad because it's a
kids game.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.690
I'm saying it's a bad kids game.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.450
There are countless games in the App Store
that are gonna cost less, have a better quality

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.050
and do a better job of teaching your kid.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:08.129
This one's ugly, it's cheaply made, overpriced...and
of course, my friend Jane from Watford, England,

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.129
sent it in.

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:10.810
Why, thanks, Jane!

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.569
Bloody kind of you, isn't it?

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.010
Two exclamation points.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:26.140
This is ridiculous.
