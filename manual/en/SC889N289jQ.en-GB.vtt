00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.870
Hey guys, impaKt here. This time I'll be talking
about something that most of you have asked

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.340
me about: how to raise your ELO in the Solo
/ Duo Queue Ladder when playing Support.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.000
Instead of analyzing plays, I'll be giving
tips and suggestions. This isn't just another

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.780
theoretical guide though. I was stuck in silver/gold
before I actually changed my mind set and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.300
how I approached Solo Queue. So I'm confident
that if you follow the advice I'll be giving

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.600
you, and if you're patient, you'll start to
raise your elo in no time.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.649
Before we get started, realize that Elo Hell
is in your head. And I do mean this almost

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.420
literally.
If you believe in Elo Hell, each time you

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.329
see someone giving out first blood, going
AFK or anything of the sort, you'll immediately

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.379
start to blame it on the system.

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.420
The problem with this mentality is that it
stops you from realizing the truth: everyone

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.460
gets teams like that. There are games impossible
to carry, but in most of the cases, the games

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.950
are carriable. Even for a support.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.500
Most important of all, blaming losses on the
system reduces your concentration and makes

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.789
you care less about the game, because you'll
actually believe that it's not your fault,

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.170
making your win rate decrease over time.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.470
With that being said, let's get started:

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.711
1) Losses are more beneficial than wins -
Now, hold on, let me explain this one: Every

00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:32.430
time you win, I can almost guarantee you feel
some sense of accomplishment. You managed

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.079
to carry a game, right?
However, there are NO perfect games. No one

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.491
has them. There is always - ALWAYS - something
to improve on. The problem with winning, is

00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:48.299
that it makes you not realize this as well
as losing does. So, Step 1: be your own worst

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.080
and best critic.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.020
2) Stop blaming losses on other people.
If you lose a game, you could've done something

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.679
better, even as a Support. That's the plain
truth. For instance, If your mid is feeding,

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:06.009
push the lane, tell your ADC to go back and
try helping him out. Think about what you

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.830
CAN do to minimize the damage, and NEVER flame.
Flaming doesn't help.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.490
At all.
Seriously, I've done it.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.820
It doesn't help.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.120
3) Pick Supports that can push the lane -
All you have to do is ward the gank paths

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.110
to your lane so you don't get ganked, and
push the lane non stop. This will make the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.410
bottom turret go down quickly, and you and
your AD Carry will be free to roam around

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.190
the map. If you manage to coordinate your
team and make them push with you, it'll make

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.700
the game even easier. Examples of supports
that can do this rather well: Lulu, Zyra,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.170
Sona, Lissandra. There are a few others, but
these are my favourite ones.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.920
4) Map Control -
You wouldn't believe the amount of games that

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.310
I've won just by giving my team the map control.
As soon as you get your bottom tower, go for

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.330
an oracles. Clear the enemies' wards and replace
them with your own. The chances of one of

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.240
your team mates dying will decrease significantly,
and the chances of you getting kills for your

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.430
team will increase.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.050
5) Go for deep wards when you know you won't
get caught -

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.330
If the bottom lane just went back for instance,
and the enemy jungler is ganking top, drop

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.290
a ward near his red or blue buff. Time his
buffs and coordinate invades with your team.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.850
6) Practice 3 support champions and get good
with them.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.320
Don't just pick the support your AD Carry
asks you for, go for something you know you're

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.070
good at. I would suggest 1 for poke, 1 for
kill lanes and 1 for sustain lanes.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.850
7) Keep pressure around the map -
This actually wins a lot of games as well.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.081
If you keep pressure bottom, for instance,
and snowball ahead of the enemies, the enemy

00:03:46.081 --> 00:03:50.940
jungler and mid laner will probably be trying
to gank you. And this isn't as bad as you

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.970
may think. If the mid laner and jungler are
bottom, then your own mid and jungler are

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.270
freed and can get objectives elsewhere. Just
make sure you don't die by warding whatever

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.340
you need to ward.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.240
8) One of the easiest ways to climb up the
ladder is by duo queueing.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.070
It's EXTREMELY IMPORTANT however that your
duo queue partner has a mindset similar to

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.200
yours though. If you're trying to improve,
not caring too much about losses, and your

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.019
duo queue partner keeps getting annoyed or
even mad, you'll get mad as well eventually.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.169
You don't want this to happen as it will decrease
your win ratio.

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.659
I found that the 3 best roles to duo queue
with, as a support, are:

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:32.700
- Jungler (your role as a support will be
to pressure the bottom lane and make sure

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.740
your ADC gets out of the laning phase farmed.
You'll want to draw out the enemy jungler

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.620
to the bottom lane as well, so that your duo
queue partner is free to gank top/mid. Dragons

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.449
are also easier to coordinate when playing
with a jungler);

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.960
- AD Carry (Well this one is rather obvious.
If you have good synergy with your AD Carry,

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.741
and if he knows how to position properly,
all you have to do is win the lane and the

00:04:54.741 --> 00:05:01.010
rest of the game will flow as smooth as silk);
- Mid Laner (Because of the roaming potential,

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.040
pretty much. Even though you're supporting
the AD Carry, you can always roam mid to help

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.710
your partner get a kill, while getting some
ganks from him afterwards);

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.630
9) Play aggressive supports that scale well
with AP -

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.491
One of the problems of playing support in
solo queue is that you don't know if your

00:05:18.491 --> 00:05:23.440
team will listen to you or follow your calls.
Your role is to support your team, after all.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.250
So if they're not that good, it may get near
impossible to do so. So my suggestion is:

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.020
play something that scales well with AP. Don't
neglect the wards, but go for some damage

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.830
too! Zyra is especially good in this situation
since she can build up a lot of damage without

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.310
that many items.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.100
10) Relax! - And I do mean this. Don't get
frustrated when you lose! Just remember that

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.280
everyone improves a lot more when they lose
than when they win. And this happens to pro

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.130
players as well. Remember that League of Legends
is a game. You're supposed to have fun!

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.330
I truly hope that clears some stuff for you
guys, and I hope the video will be able to

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.570
help you out. Don't forget to visit my youtube
page for more video guides about supporting,

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.600
and don't forget to subscribe to my twitter
and facebook pages.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.370
I'll be leaving everything up in the description.
Thanks for watching and until next time!
