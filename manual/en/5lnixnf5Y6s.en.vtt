00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:14.829
the david package and ideas that dot com
yesterday we started seeing drudge

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:19.559
report and daily callers stacked high if
this all bomb a video that it was very

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:22.960
clear they wanted to kind of implied
that it was going to be this incredibly

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.400
shocking video

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.640
it referred to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.029
the accent the anger on drugs report box
news was going to run this video during

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.720
the shot hannity show and people started
wearing while what could this be this is

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.699
incredible

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.499
this could be a game changer this'll
role

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:43.160
everything upside down at the shocking
obama video

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.580
then sean hannity went on

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.390
and it turns out that it's a video
that's been uh... out since two thousand

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.500
seven but more interestingly

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.710
it's been covered by a number of
different networks in the past including

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.800
pockets in other words fox news in their
own hyatt

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.680
seem to have forgotten that they covered
that exact same speech already years and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.990
years ago

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.140
desperation for an october surprise
which still may come but this is

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.030
apparently not going to be at lewis

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.060
so do we do we have the video

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.640
you know i'm not going to play the video
because it's nonsense it's like if i

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.970
play for you other any other
inconsequential video capsule email

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.270
relevance or importance it of any kind
of this election

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.159
okay so what he did was supposed to be
so uh...

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.350
apparently the accent and the anger that
president obama displayed

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.969
you can send and the anger

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.560
he was talking in a way of tucker
carlson

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.960
tucker carlson by the way going on china
hannity desperate to to do anything

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.409
about uh... the uh... seeming

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.910
momenta ne president obama has built
saying

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.840
he never talks that way

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.550
now that he's president we never hear
him talk that way and speeches now

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.680
good point level for romney instead

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.890
rather what's the what's the connection
what dates fear-mongering

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.000
this is the type of video that only
going to appeal

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.590
to people who have no idea that it's
been a video that that on the public

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.620
record for five years already

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.240
and to people who are really good i
think critically about what what is

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.960
going on here it makes absolutely no
sense justices and this is their

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.500
response to the uh... before it was that
there is a video yeah

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.660
mit romney right now like a bit like a
couple months ago goes out there and

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.069
sold half of uh... of the electorate

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.940
and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.800
brocco obama five years ago in a video
that's already out

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.640
speaks in a way that may be slightly
different than the way he speaks now

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.569
it's basically the same thing with both
of them are incredibly shocking

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.500
offensive

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.510
yes uh...

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.590
clearly broke speak differently

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.999
uh... depending on the situation
minority argued

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:39.599
that's the common giving we've certainly
at c_n_n_ returns that both old baba and

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.349
romney

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.290
speak in different ways depending on
where they are

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.079
the differences that weather would go
bomb it seems to be an and finish in

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.579
issue whereas with mitt romney it seems
to me that he despaired that half of the

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.699
electorate yeah

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:54.280
or is somewhat robotic

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.340
or is the world bike this effect
desperation ladies and gentlemen and

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.950
really

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.500
the debates are tonight will talk about
that more it's it's trying to ramp up

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.249
anything that they can

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:06.169
to try to counteract

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.879
the way the election is moving forward
which is

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.499
the more people know about what mit
romney thinks

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:13.969
the less interested they are going for
him

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:15.859
that's that's that's the reality

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.799
and distractions like this

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.139
really sad

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.029
hyped up drudge daily caller fox video

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:25.699
we're going to a predator the election
around

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.899
it seems to be going in a

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:32.289
direction that uh... were both happy
with it i think after tonight

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:34.360
that that uh... worldwide

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.479
more talk about expectations after i
want to jump the gun on that list
