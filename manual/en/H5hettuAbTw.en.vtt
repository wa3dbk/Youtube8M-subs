00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.490
I am here

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.192
beneath your pain,
behind your fear

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.462
My dear child,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:50.936
within your mind
I am here

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.180
You have made this world
of anger, hate and hurt

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:07.044
where you dream that you deserve
your guilty pain

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.264
But you who are myself,
my treasure and my wealth

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:33.533
Let my Love
break the spell of sin and shame

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.340
I am here
I could not leave my child so dear

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.280
Reach for my strength,
my Love, my peace

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.820
for I am here

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.940
Beneath your hours and your days,
I wait in gentleness and grace

00:02:07.265 --> 00:02:13.540
It's ever yours
forever more

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.640
I am here

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:30.420
beneath your pain,
behind your fear

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.670
My dear child,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.230
within your mind
I am here

00:02:46.334 --> 00:02:53.550
Created out of light,
you were perfect in my sight

00:02:53.644 --> 00:03:03.640
and your nightmares cannot alter
what you are

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:12.700
Behind your veil of dreams,
our Love is all that's real

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:27.110
I'll be here for you always,
in your heart

00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:35.790
I am here

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:43.400
I am here

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.400
I am here
