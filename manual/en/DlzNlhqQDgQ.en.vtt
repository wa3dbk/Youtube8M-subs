00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:16.829
A Wall Wine Rack Lets You Live With Your Wine

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:39.059
Share Your Wine With Your Friends!

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:50.220
Become a wine enthusiast and you will find
a whole new world opening up to you, the world

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.220
of fine wine.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.440
It is an interest shared by many the world
over and it can be a fascinating and enriching

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.399
hobby.

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.309
Of course, collecting wine means having the
right method for storing it and understanding

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.830
the ins and outs of proper wine storage.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.140
Fine wine can be very delicate and requires
particular conditions for storage.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.001
There are a number of possibilities open to
wine collectors, from a formal cellar to a

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:20.130
metal or wood wine rack.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.700
The route you decide to go will depend on
the size of your collection and, obviously,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.780
your available space.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.820
But you don't have to have a big, fancy house
in order to have a quality wine collection.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.890
You do not need a wine cellar or a room dedicated
to wine storage.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.430
In fact a simple wood wine rack in the family
room stores your wine while displaying it

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.649
for all to see.

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.670
Many wine enthusiasts prefer to display their
wine visibly so they can enjoy its beauty

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.619
as well as its flavor.

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.580
Fortunately, there are many sizes and styles
of racks available for containing and displaying

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.580
wine.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.689
You can find something to fit nearly any decor,
from traditional to sleek and modern.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.970
Whether you choose a wood wine rack or a piece
made of metal or glass, the look can be quite

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.450
enticing.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.180
The only feature necessary, no matter what
style you choose, is that your rack allows

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.319
for horizontal storage of the bottles.

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.940
as this allows the cork to remain in contact
with the wine so that it does not dry out

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.060
and allow air to seep into the bottle.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:34.020
Aside from horizontal storage, the features
of your wine rack are limited only by your

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.020
personal style.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.120
Considering a wide selection of wall wine
racks before buying one means we are more

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.730
likely to make the best choice.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.690
Find the perfect hanging wine rack for your
collection wherever you live, whether that's

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.330
in Los Angeles, New York, or anywhere else.
