Hello my friends and welcome
to another Tuesday of tutorial.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.720
I am Leonardo Pereznieto
and today we will draw

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.200
glamorous lips and a feather.

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:23.200
Let´s start by sketching
the general shape of the mouth.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.400
The top lip and the bottom lip, roughly.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.400
Then the upper teeth.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.829
I´ll erase the lines that we don´t
need anymore and then draw

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.200
the mouth in a little bit more detail.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.200
Good! The texture line will be
on this direction following the shape

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.200
of the lips.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.000
Now let´s do the overall shape of the feather.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.000
I want it to go here,
it may be a little bit tickling [laughs].

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.400
Again we start with the general shape.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.900
Now with a red marker let´s outline the lips.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.600
Good! We will leave some reflections here.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And let´s fill it in!

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.200
More or less try to follow their shape.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.340
Now with a white pastel we will do the feather.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.830
I am drawing on a gray cardboard paper.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.700
On a white paper, the white pastel wouldn’t be seen.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.700
We should get some red in between the feather.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.900
Good!

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Use linear strokes,
they will be thicker toward the center.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.680
The reason I am doing this drawing,
aside from the fact that I wanted to draw lips

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.970
and a feather [laughs],
is because I want to show you

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.900
how to draw two very different kinds of textures.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
This feather is going to be soft and fluffy.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.290
The lips are going to be shinning
and they need more shadows,

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.330
more reflections and volume.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.400
We can do the reflections with a 
white pastel and a white pencil.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.600
For the light shadows I´ll use some magenta.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Some fuller red...

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.200
and now let´s do the teeth part
filling the space with black,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
use gray for the shadow,
and white for the tone.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.230
Since in reality they are not
totally white, I´ll get some

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.200
very slight brown as well.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.400
Good! I like how it is looking so far,
I love doing this!

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.400
I´ll work on the feather a little bit more.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.800
Let´s do a shade with the light gray toward the center.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.170
The lips need more volume
we can achieve this by darkening

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.240
some areas with the blue pencil.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.200
Notice that there is a reflected 
light toward the bottom of them.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.500
By the way the list of materials
is in the information bellow the video.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.900
We need a shadow for the mouth
and for the feather as well.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.900
I don´t like the reflections
on the lower lip

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.900
too much, so I´ll cover them and redo them.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.569
For the feather to look very soft,
the tiny hairy things, need to be

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.440
in different directions a bit random.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.069
I´ll use an oil base paint for
the last touches of the feather

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.000
as well for the highlights on the red.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.520
A last texture with the marker and it´s ready!

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.480
If you wanted to kiss it
please give it a LIKE,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.030
share it to your friends
and subscribe to this channel,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.409
and I will see you on Tuesday :)
