00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.870
I'm going to show you today how to curl short
hair using a curling iron.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.080
It's one of the biggest trends right now is
kind of a shorter style with a little bit

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.809
more wave or texture.

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.750
We do see styles moving from being so straight
and so sleek, as far as short hair is concerned,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.990
moving into a more tousled or curled way.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.730
With my model today, in her haircut she actually
has lots of layers.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.629
So I'm going to style it kind of a softer,
more wave.

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.520
And one thing we notice a lot in these styles
is it is smoother from the root, kind of,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.520
down.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.159
We don't start see the waves come till kind
of midway down, which is great for short hair

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:50.079
because it's always hard to curl the top and
not look like it's too curled.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.399
So what we're going to do, because she has
these layers, is I'm going to section her

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.999
hair off into two sections.

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:01.789
If you had a haircut that was more one length,
then you would just take big sections straight

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:02.789
out to the side.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.310
So you would do the same thing I'm about to
do to this first section, only you would do

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.070
it to the whole section.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.050
So I'm just going to take a top section here.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.490
The top of her ear is about right here, so
it's a pretty big section.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.649
And I'm going to curl them moving straight
out from the head.

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.659
I think a lot of times with curls, our instinct
is to always curl under.

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.460
So we're doing the exact opposite.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.649
We're keeping it straight out, and then we're
going to curl it.

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.680
There's a couple of different techniques you
could do.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.510
For her hair, what I'd really like to do is
a tonging technique.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.960
So what you're going to do is you're going
to take your curling iron, and you're going

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.110
to point it straight down.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.040
And you are just going to wrap the hair around
your curling iron, holding the end in your

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.040
hand.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.280
Hold it a couple of seconds, and then release
it.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.369
And you get just a very soft little curl.

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.890
I'll show you that again.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.320
Again, take a pretty long section.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.470
Pull it straight out from the head.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:17.640
Point your curling iron down, and then wrap.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.250
This is such a great technique for shorter
hair, because you have to do so many little

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.761
sections, and it's a little bit easier, I
think, to curl your hair, tonging it, with

00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:32.930
the short hair.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.299
So I'm going to continue doing that all the
way around to probably the middle of the back

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.299
of the head.

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.040
All the sections that I've done so far have
been curled away from her face, and I'll continue

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.849
to do the same thing on the other side.
