00:00:28.997 --> 00:00:30.122
- Can you take it?
- Is it right?

00:00:30.123 --> 00:00:31.422
You must touch this.

00:00:34.564 --> 00:00:35.441
See you!

00:00:59.183 --> 00:01:01.576
We're in this together,

00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:03.590
welcome to Santos
and good luck!

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:05.952
Today's match is not
going to be easy!

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:08.406
but, since we'll be playing at home,
we must score three points!

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:10.939
He must be congratulated!

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.532
I've won more titles
and disputed more matches than you!

00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.528
- Respect us!
- Respect us!

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:33.316
- Respect us!
- I've won more titles than you!

00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:35.355
Look who is going to the stadium!

00:01:36.087 --> 00:01:38.149
That's right, David Neto!

00:01:38.294 --> 00:01:40.901
"I was born cute
and a Santos FC fan!"

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.576
He's going to the stadium...

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:45.391
to watch us winning again!

00:01:45.392 --> 00:01:47.724
He won't experience
any difficulties in life!

00:01:47.725 --> 00:01:50.419
Are you nuts?
He'll have to work hard!

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.894
He'll have to work hard
and bring money back home!

00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:54.373
Because his dad...

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:34.985
He's the one
who takes care of the money!

00:02:36.353 --> 00:02:37.534
Let me tell you something.

00:02:37.943 --> 00:02:39.453
These dudes...

00:02:47.382 --> 00:02:48.811
Welcome, dude!

00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:50.569
We're a crazy team!
Welcome!

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.199
- Those juveniles!
- They're still boys!

00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:55.069
Come on!

00:02:56.157 --> 00:02:58.224
You must stay with the old ones!

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.238
What's up, brother?
We're in this together!

00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:17.187
That's right, Zé!

00:03:44.922 --> 00:03:45.817
Braz!

00:03:48.143 --> 00:03:49.378
We are in love!

00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:50.402
LGG?

00:03:51.843 --> 00:03:53.666
- LGG!
- LGG!

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:55.134
Lucas, Gigio and Gabi!

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.510
Vila Belmiro's trio!
LGG!

00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:00.289
We are the LGG trio!

00:04:02.181 --> 00:04:03.565
I'm very happy to be here,

00:04:03.815 --> 00:04:06.463
we'll achieve a great victory today,
God willing!

00:04:06.787 --> 00:04:09.053
You already hit me!
You already hit me!

00:04:09.054 --> 00:04:10.789
Go away, come on, go away!

00:04:12.937 --> 00:04:14.452
Wow!

00:04:18.276 --> 00:04:20.353
Move it, Zé, move it!

00:04:20.354 --> 00:04:23.084
Come on, Zé,
move it!

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.168
Where is your brother?

00:04:29.914 --> 00:04:31.102
Is he playing soccer?

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.109
Are you alright?

00:04:43.955 --> 00:04:46.276
What's up with that hair of yours?

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.633
You don't want me
to touch it, right?

00:04:51.477 --> 00:04:54.383
You've been scoring
several goals, haven't you?

00:04:56.676 --> 00:04:59.366
I want some of that too!
Give it to me!

00:05:15.296 --> 00:05:16.514
This jersey is magical!

00:05:18.493 --> 00:05:23.273
FAMILY

00:05:53.402 --> 00:05:55.488
We must be happy
when we're playing, guys!

00:05:55.632 --> 00:05:56.399
Let's go!

00:05:56.684 --> 00:05:58.693
Victory!
We are used to winning!

00:05:59.133 --> 00:06:01.159
Nobody is satisfied
with what happened,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.065
but that's the past!

00:06:02.314 --> 00:06:05.042
We need to start writing
a new chapter, to win,

00:06:05.043 --> 00:06:08.855
we've shown we can take on
any opponent!

00:06:08.856 --> 00:06:12.021
But we need to be committed,
we must be hunger to win!

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.968
Today we'll write a new chapter,
as Ricardo said,

00:06:15.103 --> 00:06:16.891
we'll write a whole new chapter!

00:06:17.195 --> 00:06:18.861
We always want more!

00:06:18.862 --> 00:06:21.435
We're not comfortable with
what happened, but it's in the past,

00:06:21.436 --> 00:06:23.031
we deserve better!

00:06:23.114 --> 00:06:24.141
Good match,

00:06:24.142 --> 00:06:25.865
everyone knows what to do,

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:28.823
we need to win playing at home,
it's crucial!

00:06:30.784 --> 00:06:32.762
We need to play densely,

00:06:32.763 --> 00:06:36.444
we must play well
throughout the entire match!

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:13.292
We played against
a direct opponent,

00:07:13.957 --> 00:07:17.734
it was crucial for us to score
three points playing at home.

00:07:17.735 --> 00:07:21.556
It was crucial for us
to score these three points,

00:07:22.121 --> 00:07:25.305
each match will be decisive,

00:07:25.306 --> 00:07:29.450
we'll do our best
with our fans supporting us,

00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:30.780
we want to achieve great things!

00:07:30.781 --> 00:07:31.787
Congratulations,

00:07:31.788 --> 00:07:34.427
your commitment was extraordinary!

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:36.229
Congratulations
to each and every one of you!

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.469
They avoided two goals
right under the goal post,

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.756
but that happens,

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:43.434
we played with our hearts,

00:07:43.745 --> 00:07:47.003
we kept fighting,
and we deserved to win.

00:07:47.004 --> 00:07:49.619
That's how we must play at home,

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.641
we must be strong...

00:07:50.844 --> 00:07:54.695
in order to win the matches
and make it to the top.

00:07:54.901 --> 00:07:56.474
Now, as I said before,

00:07:57.472 --> 00:07:59.315
we need to rest.

00:07:59.591 --> 00:08:01.222
We won our first battle,

00:08:01.393 --> 00:08:03.387
there'll be another one,
on Wednesday, in Recife.

00:08:03.602 --> 00:08:04.913
Congratulations to everyone,

00:08:05.326 --> 00:08:07.344
that's how the Brazilian Championship works,

00:08:07.514 --> 00:08:12.270
and we've shown to ourselves
that we can make it to the top!
