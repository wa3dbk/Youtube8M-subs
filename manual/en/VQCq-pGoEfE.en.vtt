00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:32.430
It’s amazing to me that a film like Alvin
and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked even gets made.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.390
I mean, I’ve been known to worship at the
altar of the pun myself, but far as I can

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.610
tell, this movie’s entire existence stems
from the moment when someone somewhere in

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.530
Hollywood actually said, “Hey guys...what
if they’re chipwrecked?”

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.210
Guy probably made a million dollars.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:12.660
I have a feeling this video game adaptation
won’t make quite as much money, but then

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.220
again, never underestimate the public’s
ability to celebrate mediocrity.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.710
It says Kinect on the box and it has the same
name as a film that will undoubtedly be very

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.490
popular—this gives Alvin and the Chipmunks:
Chipwrecked pretty good odds.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.110
Regardless of whether or not it resonates
with Kinect owners, this is a fairly harmless

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.110
game.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.920
This is the latest Dance Central clone to
hit Microsoft’s underperforming motion thing,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:55.670
and specifically, this is one intended for
much younger audiences.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.040
Chipwrecked starts things off by giving you
a personality test to see which chipmunk you

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.770
are.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.229
This was one of the biggest wastes of time
I think I’ve ever experienced.

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.000
The day I die, I’m going to look back at
this and think, “Man, I really wish I would’ve

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.760
done something else that day.”

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.200
This is just...so dumb.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.650
Once you get past that needless introduction,
you get to the main game.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.030
You can do individual songs or play through
a story mode...which basically just groups

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.010
the songs together and gives you dialogue.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.370
Dialogue that’s even more a waste of time
than the personality test.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.140
Obviously, there really isn’t much here
beyond the core dancing.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.230
You have 30 songs, each with vocals performed
by Alvin and the Chipmunks.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.290
It’s actually a pretty fun idea, but there’s
just something strange about hearing these

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.290
characters sing some of these songs.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:01.840
I don’t know, maybe I’m just old-school,
but...Hootie and the Chipmunks?

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.430
Ugh.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:15.629
I’ll just take Christmas with the Chipmunks,
thanks.

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.980
But again, this is a Dance Central alternative
for kids, and I say that because of the game’s

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.980
difficulty.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.670
The dance moves are very easy to do, and the
motion recognition is generous, to say the

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.670
least.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.530
Young players should have no trouble completing
these dance numbers, so it’s definitely

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.110
age-appropriate in terms of challenge.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.600
You can also use the stars you earn to buy
accessories for your chipmunk, which is obviously

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.140
a nice touch for the kids.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.820
I wonder if there’s an accessory to turn
them into drawings.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.989
Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked is a
game you already know if you want.

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.620
It’s perfect for what it is, it’s just
that what it is...is a mediocre Dance Central

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.620
clone.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:11.879
I’d go with the original, but for the kids...I
guess it’s not a complete chipwreck.
