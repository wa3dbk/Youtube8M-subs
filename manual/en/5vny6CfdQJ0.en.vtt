Hi, my name is Kevin and on behalf of Expert
Village, I'm going to show you how to properly

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.070
use the jointer to get wood flat on one face
and then from there to take it to the jointer

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.950
and have another side parallel to it in a
process of getting our wood square and perpendicular

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.349
on all side. We've got our solid wood here
and we've determined that we want joint this

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.960
side going down based on the bow in the wood
and we've got our jointer set to where we

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.019
don't have a lot of extra knife exposed, so
when we go over it, its going to be a nice,

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.610
safe cut. Not a lot of exposed blades so that
we can do this and when you're pushing it

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.130
over the jointer, you're going to be pushing
with everything on this bed, but as soon as

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.510
you get enough of the board on this side,
you really want to concentrate the weight

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.260
and pushing it on this side because this is
where the board is coming out, the new surface

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.980
is being established and you want to go with
that and let he knives do its work and cut

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.330
off the rest on the of the board. When you've
turned on this machine, you'll see that I'll

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.489
start out on this side and quickly I'll be
pushing and concentrating all my effort with

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.159
my hands on this side where the new surface
is being established. Whenever you use this

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.390
machine, it?s really important to be able
to have headphones and to use them. Although

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.600
not the loudest machine in the shop, over
time it will do damage to your hearing, so

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.990
almost with every machine, it?s a really good
idea to have a good set of headphones, especially

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:49.789
for very loud machines like the planer. For
this one, very good idea to use headphones.

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.159
Ok, so now we've used the jointer and we've
established a flat face on one side of the

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.840
board and we're given a nice piece of walnut
here that we're able to start seeing the grain

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.799
here and part of the reason that we're able
to see this so good, is we ran the board in

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.179
the same direction as the grain is running
on this board and we've got a nice smooth

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.830
surface with no tear-out. Part of that is
because we ran it in the same direction as

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.311
the grain and that we've got a nice set of
sharp knives which you always want to use

00:02:15.311 --> 00:02:19.280
on all machines as the knives get dull, it
can become a safety hazard. If you've got

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.350
good cutting tools, it?s really going to help
the machine and less work you have to do later

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.260
on with repairing things like tear-out. We've
established this flat surface and it?s important

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.450
to remember that when you're running it over
the jointer, you don't have to get an entirely

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.000
clean surface as we've done here. As long
as you've got about 70 to 80 percent of it

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.880
jointed and its sitting flat on a good flat
surface that we can test out here, then you

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.590
know you've done your job. Its feeling flat,
I'm not getting any bows or its not rocking

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.350
anywhere, so we know we've downs our job.
From here, the next step is we're going to

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.930
do and go and put it through the planer and
we're going to establish this side parallel

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.980
to the flat side we have over here.
