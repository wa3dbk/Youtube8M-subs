00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.070
It's just seven years since the public first
experienced cinema in London, but this shot

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.500
is not black and white, as you might expect;
it's not been toned, it's not been tinted,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.840
it's not been hand-coloured. It's in natural
colour – photographed that way. It comes

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.169
from the National Media Museum collection
and its recent discovery prompted a programme

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.980
of restoration and research which enables
you to see this film for the very first time.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.600
The National Media Museum had this film in
their collection and it's the Lee Turner colour

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.340
process, although the film looks in black
and white. It's a non-standard size film,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.190
so it wouldn't run on a modern projector,
so it had to be copied, which we did. Each

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.809
frame is very slightly different to look at
because in those black-and-white pictures

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:08.729
is colour. The frames were taken through colour
filters, red, blue and green. You can work

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.659
out which one was taken through the red filter,
which one through the blue and which one through

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:20.160
the green – as long as you know the colours
in the film. We were helped a little bit because

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.880
Mr Turner had already marked up the film,
as you can see here: there's a blue frame,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.920
a green frame in the middle, and a red frame
there. Our job was to try and restore it with

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.920
those colours back in.
Because the film is non-standard we had to

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.979
copy it onto standard 35mm film. Again, because
it was non-standard, we had to build a gate

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:54.740
in order to do this. The technique was that
we took the film, it was placed in the gate,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.060
and there are some little round pins – called
register pins – which hold the film in position.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.390
We would lock the film into the gate, in position,
and then on an optical printer which consists

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:15.110
of a camera and a projector, we photographed
that frame. We then had to open the gate,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.879
lift the frame, and move it to the next one.
When we were photographing it, we didn't know

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:26.310
what the result was until the film had been
processed. So we might spend a whole day at

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.400
25 frames an hour and when it comes back it
might not have been any good.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.050
But it's lovely to see them in colour. It's
really worth it.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.040
Yes, that's the main thing.
Having scanned the film, we then took the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.370
digital files down to a company in London
called Prime Focus, and they took the digital

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.840
files and used their digital editing software
to take a red frame, a green frame and a blue

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.200
frame and combine them together to give us
our colour frame. It was important that we

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.319
used the technique that Turner had used in
his projector – that is taking frames 1,

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:07.510
2 and 3 and then taking 2, 3, 4, then 3, 4,
5 and so on.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.570
It was quite important for us to produce the
result and also to verify that Turner's system

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.430
did actually work.
Edward Raymond Turner was born in 1873, in Cleveland,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.220
Somerset. From the age of 15 he was a photographer,
working in various photographic studios around

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.220
London. His work with Frederic Ives and the
Photochromoscope Syndicate is absolutely crucial

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:36.900
to this because he learns there how to separate
colours into red, green and blue separations.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.900
He obviously starts to understand the chemistry
of it.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.080
The girl on the swing is, at least we think
she is, Agnes May Turner, who would have been

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.780
about six at the time. I think it's probably
taken around the same time as Turner made

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:04.439
a shot of his three other children; she's
wearing the same outfit. It's most likely

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:09.620
that it was shot in the back garden of the
house he lived in in Hounslow. It's a long,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.019
thin garden. In the background you've got
a fence, a pretty substantial fence, and if

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.459
you go there today, there is, again, a substantial
fence.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:26.690
This piece of film has been in our collection
for 75 years and no-one really has done anything

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:35.080
with it. It had to wait until now when we
actually had the means to do it. Someone could

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.800
have thrown it in the bin a hundred years
ago – we would have never known that these

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.380
films exist. Now we have them, and now we
can see them. A little bit of history has

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.780
been rewritten.
