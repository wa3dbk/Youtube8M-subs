00:00:00.876 --> 00:00:07.643
- Okay. We made it through all
the stuff in your head.

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:10.975
We made it through
all my pharynxes in the back.

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:13.518
We made it through the larynx
where we make sound,

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:15.560
and the trachea.

00:00:15.584 --> 00:00:17.975
And there's only one trachea,
my clowns.

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:21.602
There's only one,
and look, here it is.

00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:22.935
Here's my trachea.

00:00:22.959 --> 00:00:25.435
Here's my larynx.
Piece of cake, right?

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:27.935
And up here,
this is my epiglottis.

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:30.226
You guys are good,
right?

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.976
Everything else is contained
within the lungs.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.059
So look, my trachea,
how far down does it go?

00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:43.477
It goes far, and then
it does this amazing thing.

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.185
It bifurcates.

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:48.560
What?
Holy bifurcation.

00:00:48.584 --> 00:00:52.602
The trachea bifurcates
into two tubes

00:00:52.626 --> 00:00:56.185
that look like little tracheas,
but they're not.

00:00:56.209 --> 00:01:00.143
And we're going to talk about
them next. Those are bronchi.

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:06.143
But the bronchi are
contained in the lungs.

00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:10.518
So you could take a lung out,
and cut it all up,

00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:11.975
and inside that lung

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:13.975
you're going to have all sorts
of structures.

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:15.975
And that's
where we're going next.

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:19.185
Now, the lungs are
contained in a cavity.

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:22.935
What cavity are they in?
Dude, take your pick.

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:27.435
They're in the thoracic cavity.

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:32.310
What other cavity are they in?

00:01:32.334 --> 00:01:36.975
They're in the pleural cavity.
So watch and be amazed.

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:39.101
This is so amazing.

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:41.393
This whole thing,
do you agree,

00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:45.018
this whole thing is my
thoracic cavity.

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:47.976
Hey, did we even talk about one
of the coolest things ever,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.185
which we haven't?
Okay. I can't help it.

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.975
I feel like I'm in
physio right now.

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.059
What is this?
Okay.

00:01:56.083 --> 00:02:00.310
This is separating.
Oh, my gosh, for real?

00:02:00.334 --> 00:02:07.852
This right here is separating
my thoracic cavity from what?

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:11.518
What is inferior
to the thoracic cavity?

00:02:11.542 --> 00:02:12.975
The abdominal cavity.

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.727
I could start drawing stomachs
and livers down here.

00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:20.560
This is ab cav.

00:02:20.584 --> 00:02:25.975
Superior to all of
that is thoracic cav, thor cav.

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:30.768
And who is this guy?
Who is that masked separator?

00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:37.435
It's the diaphragm.

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.852
But don't say the G,

00:02:38.876 --> 00:02:41.393
because it's not
pronounced like that.

00:02:41.417 --> 00:02:42.935
It's just spelled like that.

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.393
So the diaphragm is actually
a skeletal muscle

00:02:46.417 --> 00:02:49.975
that we will know
and be able to identify.

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.477
And when this skeletal
muscle contracts,

00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:56.975
it actually increases the volume
of the thoracic cavity.

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:00.101
What else was in the
thoracic cavity?

00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:04.351
What other cavity is
possibly in here?

00:03:04.375 --> 00:03:06.143
The pleural cavity.

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:08.185
Okay.
Now, watch.

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.059
The pleural cavity is just
like the peritoneal cavity,

00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:15.185
but there's no retro pleural.

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.310
The pleural
cavity contains the lungs.

00:03:18.334 --> 00:03:24.185
Now, watch and be
gloriously excited.

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.685
I'm not going to do it that way.
I'm going to do it like this,

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.643
so that you can see that we
have one piece of pleural,

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:36.602
like, membrane.
Look.

00:03:36.626 --> 00:03:40.477
Can you follow me?
Can you?

00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:42.976
Can anyone follow me?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.393
I mean, what color
should I do next?

00:03:45.417 --> 00:03:49.810
Let's try this pink.
Whoa.

00:03:49.834 --> 00:03:51.226
What did I just do?

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.975
That pink really blends in
with my lung, but that's okay,

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.101
because you can see that I'm
drawing something different,

00:03:56.125 --> 00:04:00.059
right?
That actually isn't bad.

00:04:00.083 --> 00:04:02.727
What is this pink thing called?

00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:06.768
This pink thing
that is covering the lung,

00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:09.975
the organ in the pleural cavity,

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:18.935
that's the visceral pleura.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.268
Dude, how money is anatomy
when things make sense?

00:04:23.292 --> 00:04:26.935
So who is this guy that's
lining the pleural cavity,

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:29.975
which is essentially half
of the thoracic cavity?

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:37.435
This is the parietal pleura.

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:38.768
True story.

00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:43.101
Now, you want to know something
even more amazing?

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:47.810
Inside here
is this pleural cavity.

00:04:47.834 --> 00:04:49.768
It is.
That's awesome.

00:04:49.792 --> 00:04:53.310
This space right here
is a potential space

00:04:53.334 --> 00:04:56.975
that is filled
with what kind of fluid?

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:01.518
Serous fluid.
And I'm just going to tell you

00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:07.602
right now that the pressure
inside here is low.

00:05:07.626 --> 00:05:09.435
And I don't want to
get too crazy into it,

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:13.727
but the fact that
inside this space,

00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:16.894
the interpleural space
between the parietal

00:05:16.918 --> 00:05:18.768
pleura and the visceral pleura,

00:05:18.792 --> 00:05:23.477
inside that space it
maintains a low-pressure zone.

00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:25.477
And so your lungs stay inflated,

00:05:25.501 --> 00:05:28.685
because your lungs have
more pressure in them.

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:33.018
That is why your
lungs do not collapse.

00:05:33.042 --> 00:05:35.310
And in fact, if your
lung does collapse,

00:05:35.334 --> 00:05:40.143
it means that you lost this
low-pressure zone in that space.

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:42.810
And then they stick
a tube in that space,

00:05:42.834 --> 00:05:44.975
and they suck out all the
fluid and all the air,

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:47.975
and try to reestablish
basically a vacuum,

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:49.852
a low-pressure zone.

00:05:49.876 --> 00:05:51.351
That's what keeps
your lungs inflated.

00:05:51.375 --> 00:05:54.768
That's crazy talk.
That's physio.

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:58.268
We'll try not to get too
crazy and excited about that.

00:05:58.292 --> 00:06:01.185
Your lungs are not symmetrical.

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:03.059
Why not?
Why not?

00:06:03.083 --> 00:06:08.768
That's so lame.
Why not?

00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:12.602
Because you have to have
room for your heart,

00:06:12.626 --> 00:06:15.975
and your heart kind of leans
a little bit toward the left.

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:17.643
It's actually in the
middle of your body,

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:19.976
but the bigger part
goes to the left side.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.727
That is my left side.
And so your

00:06:22.751 --> 00:06:27.975
left lung has two lobes,
again,

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:29.975
containing all the rest of the

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:31.768
structures we're
going to talk about.

00:06:31.792 --> 00:06:34.975
Your right lung has three lobes.

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:37.643
This would be a
phenomenal question if I,

00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:39.810
like, could find lungs,

00:06:39.834 --> 00:06:42.477
and one had two lobes
and one had three lobes.

00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:45.143
You could tell me did it
come from the right side or the

00:06:45.167 --> 00:06:49.602
left side of the body.
Lungs.

00:06:49.626 --> 00:06:52.310
I feel very satisfied with this.
Do you?

00:06:52.334 --> 00:06:55.059
The whole serous membrane thing
is making sense, isn't it?

00:06:55.083 --> 00:06:57.792
You guys are so smart.
