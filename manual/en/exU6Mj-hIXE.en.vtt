00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:07.470
How to Determine the Correct Frame Size for
a Bike.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.110
When purchasing a new bicycle, be sure to
take measurements and get the right fit.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.770
Just a push -- and a few numbers -- and you're
on the way!

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:26.050
You will need Wall Book Measuring tape Calculator
Body type knowledge and test rides.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.779
Step 1.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.329
Measure your inseam by standing barefoot with
your back against a wall, looking straight

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:33.329
ahead.

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.320
Hold an inch-thick book between your legs.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.140
Measure the distance in centimeters from the
top edge of the book to the floor.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.420
Perform the measurement three or four times
and calculate the average.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.039
Step 2.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.070
Determine your measurement for a center-to-center
measured road bike frame, which measures from

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.620
the center of the bottom bracket to the center
of the top tube, by multiplying your inseam

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.929
by .65.

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:58.929
Step 3.

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:03.499
Figure your measurement for a center-to-top
measured road bike frame, which measures from

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:08.310
the center of the bottom bracket to the top
of the top tube or seat lug, by multiplying

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.299
your inseam by .67.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.780
This accounts for the additional length of
the top of the seat tube.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.780
Step 4.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.920
Adjust your measurement by subtracting 10
to 12 centimeters from your center-to-top

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.640
road bike size and converting it to inches
to determine your center-to-top mountain bike

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.080
size.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.650
Convert centimeters to inches by multiplying
by .3937.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.369
Step 5.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.850
Since women generally have longer legs and
shorter torsos than men, women should look

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.619
for frames with shorter top tubes or frames
that are specially made for women.

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.079
Men with shorter upper bodies or who prefer
a more upright position should also consider

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.510
frames with shorter top tubes.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.020
Step 6.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.939
Divide your height by your inseam if you have
unusually long or short limbs.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.630
If the quotient is more than 2.2, you will
need a longer reach or top tube.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.740
If it is less than 2.2, you will need a shorter
reach or top tube.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.189
Step 7.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.330
Test ride several different frame sizes, taking
into account any top tube length added by

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.420
the saddle post, to get a clearer idea of
the size most comfortable for you.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.070
Did you know Of the 60 riders participating
in the first Tour de France in 1903, only

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.000
21 finished the race.
