00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.727
Something's missing.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.600
It can be done better.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.247
It's a fitting intro for this car,
the E-Class facelift. 

00:00:30.247 --> 00:00:33.685
The previous one had
square double headlights.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.932
Mercedes says these still are. It's
one unit, but you do see two things. 

00:00:41.932 --> 00:00:49.435
Something new was hidden in the press
report, but we've been to the presentation.

00:00:49.435 --> 00:00:52.300
Standard LED lights.

00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:57.740
You'd think running daylights,
but the low beam is LED as well.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.457
You'll need to pay for it
on the Audi R8, for example,...

00:01:02.457 --> 00:01:04.259
...but it's standard on the E-Class.

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:12.203
There's a lot of choice for
the engine. It's almost stressful.

00:01:12.587 --> 00:01:16.100
It starts with the E200,
diesel or gasoline,...

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.700
...which continues up 'til
the E500 with a 402 hp V8. 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.131
A fantastic turbo engine, but
today we're doing it differently. 

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:34.515
We're doing the 20% additional
tax liability. Almost 20%.

00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:42.700
We have two glass and
one roof pieces too many. 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.990
This is the E-Class Estate.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.830
The sedan in this variety has
20% additional tax liability.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.566
A 2.1 liter diesel engine with
many turbos and 201 hp. 

00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:13.904
The electric motor has 26 hp.

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:21.679
It's a special combination, because
no other car maker dares to combine... 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:28.895
...a diesel engine and electric motor
on the same set of wheels.

00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:32.816
All the other 2WD hybrids
run on gasoline.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.621
To be honest, Mercedes
didn't do a very good job.

00:02:38.621 --> 00:02:43.959
When starting off electrically
the engine has to help,...

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.382
...because the electric motor is
relatively weak for a big car.

00:02:47.382 --> 00:02:54.111
It seems like it won't go and needs
all the power to help the diesel engine.

00:02:54.472 --> 00:03:03.319
Also when cruising there's some jolts
and quirks in the motors' teamwork.

00:03:03.882 --> 00:03:06.188
It just doesn't work right.

00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:20.147
It has a top speed, and the 0-62 mph
sprint is done in 7.8 seconds.

00:03:20.147 --> 00:03:27.263
You just don't notice it,
which you should.

00:03:27.263 --> 00:03:31.454
It doesn't feel smooth and quick.
It's no lightning.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.800
The E-Class is stuffed
with safety measures,...

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.291
...shared with the new S-Class
this summer. 

00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:46.699
It's a huge list, including
Cross Traffic Assist.

00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:51.000
The system will check
the intersection...

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
...with radar and cameras
to look for other traffic.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.093
If every car would have this,...

00:03:57.093 --> 00:04:00.500
...there would be 25% less accidents
on intersections.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.911
It's like driving an older Mercedes.

00:04:08.911 --> 00:04:14.509
Maybe it's because this Elegance
version with a star on the hood.

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:17.945
The Avantgarde has
a 0.6 inches lowered chassis.

00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:22.241
The AMG has packages too,
but it's not really "AMG".

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.170
This is the ideal car
to meet new people.

00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:31.148
If you like to be social
and meet a lot of people,...

00:04:31.148 --> 00:04:33.038
...visit the Mercedes dealer.

00:04:33.616 --> 00:04:38.171
Starting at 45,900 euros
you'll have a new E-Class. 

00:04:42.864 --> 00:04:45.000
