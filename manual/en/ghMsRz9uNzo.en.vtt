Ah!

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:22.066
Who needs a remote control when you’ve got a sonic?

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.635
So, thank you for watching my video

00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:26.173
I hope you liked it, I sure enjoyed making it

00:01:26.173 --> 00:01:27.609
if you didn’t like it, I’m sorry.

00:01:28.014 --> 00:01:29.873
There’s nothing I can do about that.

00:01:29.873 --> 00:01:34.260
This was actually a request video, and I 
 killed a few birds with one stone.

00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:35.965
Play Doctor Who: check.

00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:38.578
Play something other than sixteenth notes: check.

00:01:39.046 --> 00:01:40.860
Those are quarter note triplets by the way.

00:01:40.856 --> 00:01:42.680
Get a band: che- well...

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.590
a digital band. Does that count? I think it counts.

00:01:44.593 --> 00:01:46.540
I’m going to count it. Check.

00:01:46.535 --> 00:01:47.700
So I really enjoyed making this,

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:50.450
it was actually one of my smaller projects believe it or not.

00:01:50.453 --> 00:01:55.660
But fortunately I started this one last, so when the one 
 I started first comes out, it’s going to be amazing.

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:56.820
Hopefully.

00:01:56.823 --> 00:02:00.090
You can check out my facebook page, link in 
 the description, for more information on that.

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:05.100
I actually only started watching Doctor Who when I started 
 this video and now I’m on season five

00:02:05.102 --> 00:02:10.630
so whether that speaks to how easily distracted I am, 
 or how long this has taken, I’m not sure.

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:13.700
But it’s a good show and I highly recommend that you watch it.

00:02:13.704 --> 00:02:18.270
Oh! One last thing! This video actually has bonus 
 features in the form of hidden annotations.

00:02:18.268 --> 00:02:20.110
They’re actually pretty easy to find- well... 

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:22.240
Some of them are hard to find- well...

00:02:22.245 --> 00:02:26.040
I’m actually the one who put them there, 
 or I’m going to put them there.

00:02:26.036 --> 00:02:29.830
This video thing gets all wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey, you know.

00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:31.900
So I’m really not the best person to judge.

00:02:31.896 --> 00:02:36.090
