00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.330
pinhole photography starts with a

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.520
pinhole camera.  You can make your own

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.919
from any light tight container, such as a

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.839
cookie tin or an oatmeal box.

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:10.710
usually photo paper is used

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.110
to capture the image

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.420
in a homemade camera and what you get is

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.060
a negative print.  You can reverse it to a

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.369
positive in a dark room or by scanning

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.660
and then inverting the image.   When the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.220
camera is designed so the paper is

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.659
curved you may see some beautiful

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:30.359
distortions of straight lines. If the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.340
film or paper is flat then the image

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.170
looks fairly normal although pinhole

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.180
images do have two special propertie.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.150
One is that since there's no lens

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.710
there's an infinite depth of field.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.530
Everything is in focus, whether inches

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.110
away or in the distance.  The other

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.820
special property is that because the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.010
aperture is so small the exposure time

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.750
will be relatively long compared to a

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.390
lens camera.  You wouldn't typically take

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.970
a picture indoors at f/22 so imagine

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.180
working at f/138 or f/250 which are typical

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.910
pinhole camera F numbers. And if you're

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.979
using photo paper then the exposure will

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.320
be even longer since the ISO a photo

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.850
paper is so much slower than film

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.999
usually about 6 or 12 rather than 100 or

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:15.299
200 or 400.  The long exposure means that

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.979
anything moving in the scene will blur

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.890
or even disappear.   This room was full of

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.200
people during the long exposure but no

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.759
one stayed in one place long enough to

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.670
register on the film.   You can also buy a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.460
pinhole camera or a kit to build one.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.020
My favorite purchased camera is my Zero 2000

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.450
which I bought at Freestyle photo. It takes medium format film and I get

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.639
12 negatives  per roll.   I always keep this

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:41.639
camera and a light meter in my bag.  I've

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:43.200
used it to take almost two thousand

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.929
pictures, mostly in restaurants.   This is

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.729
my series called "Squaremeals:  a pinhole

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.920
diary of eating out."  But also at amusement

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.920
parks, hotels...  I've done still lives.  I

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.679
also like working with toy cameras and

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.350
my Diana plus has a pinhole setting so I

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.420
can use this camera with either a lens

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.939
or with a pinhole aperture.  Here are some

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.459
of my other cameras.  This beauty was

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.399
hand-built by Mark Brown, and this is one

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.080
version of the pinhole blender by Chris

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.780
Peregoy.  The Monochrome and the P-Sharan

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.700
you're an both of which I built from

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.370
kits work really well.   I still have to

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.220
try out my Stenoflex .  Pinhole

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.170
photography is more popular than you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.379
might think.  For a few years now the last

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.940
Sunday in April has been Worldwide

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.269
Pinhole Photography Day.   In 2011, over

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.370
3,000 people from 67 countries

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.650
participated.   I was the only one in

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.769
Delaware.   If you're new to pinhole, it's

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.599
fun first to build a camera yourself.

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.849
You'll find lots of directions online.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.849
Try to calculate the f-number for your

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.730
camera, which isn't that hard.   Hand sewing

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.040
needles have known diameters and the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.230
f-number is the diameter of the camera

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.569
over the diameter of the hole.   For

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.849
instance, 100 millimeters over half a

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.209
millimeter would be f/200.   Then you can

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.099
use a light meter such as the one on

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.959
another camera to figure out the

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.079
exposure time.  However, if you want to

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.970
keep working in pinhole, I really

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.410
recommend getting a camera that takes

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.140
roll film.   I can go on vacation with

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.760
my camera and come back with a number of

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.010
rolls ready to be processed, which is

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.480
much better than running to the darkroom

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.299
to develop each paper negative.  If you are

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.010
shooting film you need to remember

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.560
reciprocity failure, which means that

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.900
after about a second or two exposure, the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.549
time you expect will actually under-

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.980
expose your film.   If you google my name

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.200
and the words pinhole exposure you'll

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.870
find a page where I explain that.   Here

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.670
are a few of the many photographers who

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.380
do interesting work with pinhole cameras.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.840
For landscape work you might look at

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.250
Martha Casanave,  Craig Barber, Ilan Wolf

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.000
or Diane Boss or Vera Lutter, who

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.829
exhibits her work as paper negatives.

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.400
Jessica Ferguson and Ralph Howell often

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.500
work in still life, with the cameras

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.269
themselves being a delightful subject

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.569
for Howell.   Katie Cooke makes striking

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.959
self-portraits.   Ann Hamilton uses pinhole

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.319
photography in a more conceptual way.  For

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.510
Steve Irvine the camera itself is a work

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.870
of art.   One artist well known for pinhole

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.880
camera work actually takes pictures

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.919
within rather than with a pinhole camera.

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.979
Abelardo Morell has turned rooms into

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.930
pinhole camera obscuras and then

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.849
photograph the outside world projected

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:27.880
inside.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.700
To keep it short I've left a lot out, but

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.590
you'll find tons of information online.  I

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.750
