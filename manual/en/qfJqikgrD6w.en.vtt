00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.900
"Whole Beets vs. Juice for
Improving Athletic Performance"

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.940
Nitrates, concentrated in green
leafy vegetables and beets,

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.130
underwent a great makeover
a few years ago

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.380
from inert substances
to having profound effects

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.490
on the power plants
within all of our cells,

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.240
reducing the oxygen
cost during exercise

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.300
meaning we can bust out the same
amount of work with less oxygen.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.770
So one little shot of beet juice
allows free divers to hold

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.250
their breath for over four minutes.
They get about a half minute longer.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.930
And for others this improved
muscle efficiency

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.879
allows athletes to exercise
at a higher power output

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.399
or running speed for
the same amount of breath.

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.300
I profiled this discovery
in an unprecedented

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.210
17-part video series, the longest
I think I've ever done.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.789
It was just so fascinating.
But that was back in 2012.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.609
What's happened since?

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.489
Well, this all led to many athletes,
elite and amateur alike,

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.170
consuming beetroot juice
prior to competition.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.730
But what does
the new science say?

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.730
Well, most of the studies
were done on men.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.360
Turns out it works on women, too,
even African-American women â€“

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.130
an even more neglected
research demographic.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.780
Same workload power outputs
using significantly less oxygen

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.780
after drinking beet juice.
But forget beet juice.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.420
What about whole beets?

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.750
Cheaper, healthier, can find
them in any produce aisle,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:36.210
but there had never been any
studies on actual beets, until now.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.820
Whole beetroot consumption acutely
improves running performance.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.250
They gave physically
fit men and women

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.920
a cup and a half of baked beets, which
is equivalent to about a can of beets,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.009
75 minutes before
running a 5k.

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.719
They started out the same, but
during the last mile of the 5k race

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.310
the beet group pulled ahead
compared to the placebo group,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.570
who were given berries instead.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.140
Though they were running faster,
their heart rate wasn't any higher.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.360
If anything, the beet group
reported less exertion.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.700
Faster time with less effort?

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.890
They don't call them block-rocking
beets for nothing.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.320
But if nitrates are so good
why not just take them in a pill,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.250
nitrate supplements
with names like "Hellfire."

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.660
Although they can work, their
long-term safety is questionable.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.950
Non-vegetable sources of nitrates
may have detrimental health effects.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.450
So if we want to improve
our performance,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.190
we should really ideally obtain
nitrates from whole vegetables.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.140
The industry knows this,
so instead markets an array

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.320
of nitric oxide stimulating
supplements.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.910
However, there is
little or no evidence

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.450
of a performance improvement
following supplementation

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.280
with these so called NO boosters.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.040
The evidence is with the vegetables.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.120
How much money can companies
make selling beets though?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.900
So how about a novel
beetroot-enriched bread product?

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.230
We've tried to get people
to eat their fruits and veggies

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.700
and where has that gotten us?

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.710
But hey, lots of people
eat white bread.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.710
So why not have
them eat red bread?

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.210
And indeed it worked.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.820
Red beet bread brought
down blood pressures,

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.510
improved the ability of arteries
to relax and dilate naturally.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.400
Bread, therefore, may
be an effective vehicle

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.330
to increase vegetable consumption
without significant dietary changes,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.760
because, heavens forbid,
people should have

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.000
to change their diet
to improve their health.
