00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.210
0:00:07.190,0:00:11.260
Hi these is Julie from Beadaholique.com and

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.230
today I want to show you how to cut

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.730
0:00:11.260,0:00:13.989
LillyPilly aluminum blanks and sheets.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.860
0:00:13.989,0:00:17.579
This is what they are.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.200
You can also cut the blanks
with the same technique.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.050
0:00:17.579,0:00:22.129
So these are nice pretty substantial

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.220
heavy aluminum sheets with wonderful

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.720
0:00:22.129,0:00:23.460
patterns on them

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.230
0:00:23.460,0:00:25.630
and there's the solid color on the back.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.779
0:00:25.630,0:00:29.619
So you can just let your imagination flow

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.260
on how do to use these.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.350
0:00:29.619,0:00:32.890
You're probably going to not use the entire

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.840
sheet
you're going to want to cut them down

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.380
0:00:32.890,0:00:34.900
if your making jewelry.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.630
0:00:34.900,0:00:39.920
So the way you do that is very very easy.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.970
First
you don some safety glasses because you

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.010
0:00:39.920,0:00:41.350
are cutting metal.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.219
0:00:41.350,0:00:42.910
So you want to make sure you

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.870
0:00:42.910,0:00:45.430
take every precaution necessary.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.760
0:00:45.430,0:00:49.610
What you're going to want to use is a

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.760
metal sheer.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.760
I have this one here.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.760
It locks

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.120
0:00:49.610,0:00:52.040
in place when your storing it

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.879
0:00:52.040,0:00:54.460
like so.

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:53.879
To unlock it

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.289
0:00:54.460,0:00:56.330
just go like that

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.560
0:00:56.330,0:00:57.720
you see it opens up.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.839
0:00:57.720,0:01:02.170
This particular set of shears will cut

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.829
up to twenty gauge metal.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:02.829
The blanks

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:03.829
0:01:02.170,0:01:04.979
that were using and the sheets are going to

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:04.860
be
twenty two gauge.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.790
0:01:04.979,0:01:07.860
So they're gonna cut with no problem.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.970
0:01:07.860,0:01:10.530
I'm going to show you exactly how easy this

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.970
is.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.210
0:01:10.530,0:01:14.890
Just line up your basically scissors

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.520
where you want them to be

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.000
0:01:14.890,0:01:17.530
but you're going to using these which

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
are for metal

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.560
0:01:17.530,0:01:22.490
and just cut.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.770
I'm not using much
pressure here.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.640
0:01:22.490,0:01:24.189
It just cuts through

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.560
0:01:24.189,0:01:28.960
just like that.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.759
There you go.

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.380
0:01:28.960,0:01:33.020
Now you might have a little bit of curling

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.450
on the end when you do that.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.450
You'll see it's not

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.450
0:01:33.020,0:01:34.020
quite flat

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.820
0:01:34.020,0:01:38.709
you can just take rubber mallet and a bench

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.350
block
and hammer that down so it's flat again.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.469
0:01:38.709,0:01:42.930
You also might want to take a diamond file

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.350
and file down any rough edges.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.850
0:01:42.930,0:01:47.720
Now I brought over a sharpie marker here

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.110
because I want to show you what else you can
do/

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.590
0:01:47.720,0:01:51.000
So if you have a specific size you want

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.590
to cut

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.770
0:01:51.000,0:01:53.270
you can go ahead

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.740
0:01:53.270,0:02:00.270
draw it on the back of your sheet.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:10.869
0:02:04.490,0:02:11.490
Cut out your shape.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.860
0:02:15.930,0:02:19.879
If you don't want that line to show

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.070
on the back of all these aluminum sheets

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.580
0:02:19.879,0:02:21.979
there's a protective little backing

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.530
0:02:21.979,0:02:25.389
and you can just peel that off so you won't

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.890
have
that marker line.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.140
0:02:25.389,0:02:32.389
You can also cut the LillyPilly

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.380
aluminum blanks the same way.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.490
0:02:34.089,0:02:38.549
You see how easy it is to cut them.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.340
0:02:38.549,0:02:42.779
That is all there is to cutting LillyPilly

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.580
aluminum sheets aluminum and

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.580
0:02:42.779,0:02:43.369
blanks.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.580
0:02:44.779,0:02:49.369
