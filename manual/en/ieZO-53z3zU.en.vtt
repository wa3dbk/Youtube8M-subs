00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.960
I gang its Brendan McCray from mini
mania and today we're going to do an

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.390
install of the Sprint booster for a 2007
r56 mini cooper s it's our testbed car

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:26.950
the Sprint Booster if you don't know is
a throttle feel enhancer if you will

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.599
what it does is for all modern cars that
use an electronic throttle control like

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.680
all of your minis what this will do is
this will give you about 30% more

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.170
throttle feel and it makes a fun drive
even more fun so what we're going to do

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.500
we're going to take this we're going to
install it in our car I'm going to show

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.460
you how to do the installation step by
step and if you want to go to our

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.620
website you can look up the part number
for this particular item which is SPR

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:01.280
two zero nine five that's for the manual
for the automatic it's SPR 209 5a the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.239
skill level required for this kind of
installation not much it's a pretty easy

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.590
install we're going to write this an
easy not even intermediate and that's

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.439
one of the reasons why we like this
product so much is that it basically is

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.329
a plug-and-play product for your car
it's not something that you need to have

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:22.100
any mechanic skills in order to do and
yet the results are really satisfying

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.369
for most people so we're going to jump
right into it right now and we're going

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.700
to install this puppy the first thing
that you need to do is leave your driver

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.700
side door open for five minutes that way
it will ensure that you don't get an

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.009
engine check light after you've
installed your mr and then after that

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.079
first step is to
move your allen head bolt here that

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:58.219
holds your throttle pedal in place you
can either use an Allen head socket like

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:04.819
I'm doing or you can use a regular allen
wrench and then to remove the pedal you

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:13.310
want to push up towards the footwell and
it lifts out just like that you can see

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.470
right here this cable right here is
basically what we're going to be taking

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.209
the Sprint booster and putting in series
we're going to disconnect it here we're

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.420
going to put the Sprint Booster there
and then we're going to plug the cable

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.860
that goes to your throttle body into the
other end of the sprint booster

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:44.010
comes up just like that the Sprint
Booster selectable model has a module

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.130
that connects to it and this allows you
to select the different modes I like to

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:58.020
plug this in first before we plug in the
module to our petal assembly here

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.230
now I'm going to plug in this end to our
pedal assembly you can hear it's got a

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.310
nice positive click I like to rock it
back and forth and make sure that it's

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.070
really on there securely before I do
anything else whatever you do don't grab

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.030
your sprint booster by the wire itself
always only grab it by the sides of the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.660
connectors you don't want to yank out
any of the connections to the pins

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.520
inside okay we've got that side
connected now this side needs to connect

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.660
to the wire coming down out of footwell
which is right here

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.550
I'll check the connection make sure that
it's secure

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.050
only pushing on the connectors again
don't pull on the wire don't grab it

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.970
this way and pull on the wire and that
looks like a nice positive connection

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.420
next thing I'm going to do I'm going to
route my wires around the back as much

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.020
as possible of you're going to need to
do a little bit of tweaking for your

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.660
particular model and you basically hide
this wire away and out of your way of

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.050
the pedal we'll do that in a minute for
now I'm going to go and try to find the

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:34.400
clip at the top that you slide into free
pedal which is right there fit it right

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:57.430
down into here we can replace bolt there
you go now that we've got that installed

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:06.680
we need to test to make sure that we
have a signal from the pedal and give it

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:13.060
a little bit of juice we can see, I have throttle control,

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.290
now I have much better throttle control.

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:39.680
that's it that's all there is to the
installation
