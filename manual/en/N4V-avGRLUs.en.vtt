Hi, I'm Laura from youngwritersworkshops.com
and I'm going to talk about how to teach kindergarten

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:17.470
drawing. In kindergarten exploration is key.
Your young artist is just beginning to understand

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:24.720
how to hold the materials, how to connect
with the paper what their mechanics of drawing

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.650
are, as well as sort of what are some of the
ideas of what makes something art. There's

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:39.590
so much exploration going on, focusing very
little on technique will really help to expand

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.790
and keep it age appropriate. There's often
a mistake of telling people what color things

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.370
need to be. You know, make the grass green.
And that's really something you want to avoid

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.680
because, as I said, exploration is key. Exploring
what if and throwing the world open to a lot

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.730
of possibilities can really help your child
see art in a way that they can continue to

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.350
enjoy it for as long as possible. But, on
the basic level you may need to help children

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.659
hold the crayon, hold the pen, whatever marker,
material they're going to be using. They might

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.170
need a little bit of instruction about how
to balance it on their ring finger. How to

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.369
hold it and with the point pointing towards
their shoulder. So, you can give them a little

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.359
bit of basic technique about how to hold things.
But, also at the same time letting them explore

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:39.600
how it feels to draw on the paper. They can
also do some tracing. That's a good way for

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.389
them to build fine motor skills. You could
let them explore tracing different objects

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:52.399
on the paper, tracing their hand. This can
give them some practice in using the, whatever

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.799
writing utensil they're using, but also feeling
how it feels to draw something. They could

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:04.889
trace their hand and then color it in. Do
a lot of color. Use a lot of color. Talk about

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:08.600
the colors as they're using them. Again, without
telling them what colors things should be.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.930
But, some students at this age are still learning
the names for their colors, so while they're

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.120
exploring they can start to learn them more,
the less common color names and really have

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.629
fun creating something. So, those are some
ideas about how to teach kindergarten drawing.
