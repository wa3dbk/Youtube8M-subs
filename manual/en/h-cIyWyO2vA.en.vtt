00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.500
The bits about the PGCE I mostly enjoyed were
the placements.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.430
Getting out there in a variety of different
schools - big schools, even rural, urban schools

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.420
as well was a real benefit.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.199
To see kids in different environments, because,
you know, in the big city schools, you do

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.289
meet some characters, which is really good,
and then going out into the schools out in

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.790
the sticks, like my last school - I was in
Bewcastle, the most rural place you can ever

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:37.960
imagine, really.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.879
There was 40 kids in the whole school - and
then the school I'm working in now, I've got

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.149
31 kids in one class.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.420
So there really is a massive range and it's
really, really enjoyable seeing all the different

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.750
children in different environments.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.690
Other things about the course, I enjoyed meeting
a range of new people as well.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.070
I've made some lifelong friends, you know,
only in a year's course and it's people who

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.990
have similar interests to myself.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.280
Just real good characters and bonds being
formed here.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.500
I enjoyed it lots.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.870
I do think it is a good route to take and
if I was recommending a PGCE, I really would

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.349
because it allows you - I mean, I wasn't sure
when I left school whether I did want to become

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:30.150
a teacher, so doing a three year course in
something I enjoyed prior to dong the teaching

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.679
was something that I'd pre-planned and something
I managed to follow through.

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.989
As a postgraduate student, you are more of
a professional in training as opposed to an

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:41.250
actual student.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.630
And during the three years of the three-year
course, I did - I'm not saying that I didn't

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.860
work hard for the first couple of years, but
you feel like you are building up into it.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.959
Whereas during the PGCE, you do go straight
into it and you're into a real tough blend

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.209
of modules and placements that you just can't
afford to ease your way into.

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:04.179
It really is good - straight into a full-time
job.

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.820
Which is something that was really good, really,
I mean the three-year course I was at some

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.430
stages, perhaps, coming in one day a week,
maybe a dissertation workshop.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.349
Whereas the PGCE, you are in 9 to 5, Monday
to Friday, so you do feel the blending in

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.959
from the student into the work placement,
really.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.370
That's something else about the PGCE that
I would probably recommend, really, it's that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.170
it's a nice blend between, like I say, student
life into your professional life.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.269
As I mentioned before about the placements
that I've been on, my extended placement in

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.319
particular, the 8-week block, last placement
we had was probably one of the best 8 weeks

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.891
of my life, to be honest, because of course
I do think the PGCE obviously gave me the

00:02:48.891 --> 00:02:55.230
chance to go on that, but the actual time
you spend in school is crucial and I can't

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.659
stress that enough, really.

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.599
You probably only spend 21-22 weeks of the
course in the school.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.170
If I was to tell the people for PGCE what
I would like to see more of, it would probably

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.799
be more time in school because the experience
that you gain working with the children is

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.799
just unsurpassed.

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.069
You can't beat it.

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.770
You can sit in front of a lecture theatre
and you can get told "There's your behaviour

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:21.770
strategies.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.269
That's how you assess pieces of work."

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.799
You can't actually do it unless you go out
into the schools and you find that out for

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:28.799
yourselves.

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.209
So the behaviour strategies, for example,
that I learned in the university - yes, I've

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.621
been into to go into that and apply them,
but if it doesn't work for that school, you're

00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:39.621
not going to get anywhere.

00:03:39.621 --> 00:03:45.340
So it's about adapting and about finding what's
best for your teaching, and then also for

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.370
what the children need as well.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.889
And that is what the PGCE and particularly
these placements really, really allows you

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.200
to do.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.560
I chose the University of Cumbria predominately
because it had a fantastic reputation for

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.909
providing people straight into a job.

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:05.150
I knew it had a really high percentage of
- as soon as you completed your PGCE, there's

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.529
a very good percentage of people who go into
a job.

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:15.040
As well as living locally in the area, them
two combined - really, it was a no-brainer

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.739
for me, to be honest, to actually do my three-year
course and just stay at home and then complete

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.210
the PGCE and I knew that if I completed the
PGCE successfully, I would have a pretty good

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.450
shot of finding a job locally.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:36.420
So it was a definite 100% University of Cumbria.
