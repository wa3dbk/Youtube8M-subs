00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:09.030
So I am just going to put four of my basic
colors into this tray so I can work on the

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:21.740
mountains, the river and the base color of
the brown - orange of the tiger. So this is

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:34.290
the brown I am using for that. I'm just going
to pour some of this into one of these food

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.070
trays. I like using these because you can
separate the colors in them. And then we have

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.880
the purple for the mountains and also for
the mountains in the background this nice

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:53.969
yellow - orangey mix. I was going to put some
blue in there. Actually no I can't, no I can't

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.170
not quite enough blue left right now. I'm
just going to start using these colors. I'm

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:15.830
going to start using the purple to create
some of the mountain shapes in the background

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:25.439
with the snow capped peaks. Again this is
very, very, rough just a first coat. There's

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.860
one for the mountain. This one will be more
in the foreground so it's actually going to

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.130
put some yellow into it. This is just to get
some shapes right now, later on I will be

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:50.870
putting some more green into this. These background
mountains here that follow on from the other

00:01:50.870 --> 00:02:09.950
mural are more of the yellow and brown.
