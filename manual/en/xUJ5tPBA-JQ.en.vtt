00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.520
There's another way to specify a complex number.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.790
For this other way, we have to know two
things: number one

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.840
we need to know the distance between

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.400
0 and the complex number that we're
interested in expressing.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.690
Let's take z for example.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.650
So we need to know the distance of this.
And the distance of this line segment

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.300
is simply the modulus of z.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.769
Now, we need another piece of information,
and that is

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.369
the angle that's measured from the positive real axis

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.770
to this line segment which we call theta.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.100
Now, notice that once you have the modulus of z

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.500
and this angle here, you can then tell me the
exact location of z on the complex plane.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.040
So let's see if we can work out this angle

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.640
theta here. 
The modulus of z

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.900
is not difficult to obtain because we
already have the number here.  It's -2 + i.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.070
So the modulus of z is going to be

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.739
the square root of -2 squared plus

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.979
1 squared and that is the square root of 5.

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.660
To calculate the angle, what we're going to do is

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.950
we're going to work with this angle instead

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.560
within this triangle. 
So this is a right-angled triangle

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.369
the height of this triangle is 1, the
base of the triangle is 2.

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.340
So tangent of alpha is equal to one-half.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.200
Now, once you have alpha, 
you can calculate theta because

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.920
theta is given by pi radians

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.190
minus alpha.  So if you take out your calculator

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.200
and compute the arctangent of 1/2,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.290
you'll get roughly 0.4636476

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.869
and so on.  And so

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.400
theta will be roughly 2.6779 and so on.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.400
Uh, we usually use r

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.360
to denote the modulus and we'll write z as

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.560
r times cos theta plus

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.800
i sine theta.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.900
And usually we abbreviate is as r tims

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.820
C I S or cis of theta.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.200
So cis theta represents this expression within the brackets.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.950
And in our case, r is going to be

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.530
the square root of 5 and theta is

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.900
exactly pi minus arctangent of 1/2.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.680
And if you want to give an approximation,
it will be 2.6 779.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.730
Now to convert a complex number from
polar form to rectangular form,

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.769
all you have to do is just expand this expression here.

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.190
Alright.  So the real part is given by r
times cos theta.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.780
You can work that out numerically and
then the imaginary part

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.459
is r times sine theta which again you can
work out numerically.

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.010
Now there is something is about having
complex numbers in polar form.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.430
It makes multiplication of complex numbers
rather easy.  So suppose you have two

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.200
complex numbers expressed in polar form.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.300
Say z is r_1 cis theta_1 and

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.800
w is r_2 cis theta_2.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.959
Now to multiply them

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.959
all you need to do is just take r_1 times r_2

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.400
and then cis theta_1 plus theta_2.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.799
And if r_2 is non-zero, z divided by w

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.859
is given by r_1 divided by r_2 times

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.300
cis theta_1 minus theta_2.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.620
These results are not difficult to prove.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.560
The first requires using sum formulas for
cosine and sine

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.739
and for the second one, what you need to
do is you first rewrite this

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.260
as z times the complex conjugate of w

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.000
and in the denominator you have

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
the square of the modulus of the w
which is basically

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.709
w times the complex conjugate of w.
And once you do this

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.449
you can apply this up here to give you this.
The details are left as an exercise

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.000
and I encourage you to work them out.
