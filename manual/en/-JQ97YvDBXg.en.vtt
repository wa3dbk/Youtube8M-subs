Chapter_5_-_From_blue_to_red_terrain

00:00:09.534 --> 00:00:12.620
If you wish to master the blue and red runs

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.661
you must know how to make good parallel turns

00:00:17.132 --> 00:00:21.628
Start on an easy slope and find the rhythm in your parallel turns

00:00:29.143 --> 00:00:34.769
One important step to becoming more advanced is the proper use of the ski poles

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.725
Learn to use them correctly

00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:42.379
By using your poles you can improve your balance

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.854
and ease the transition from one turn to another

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.721
When you need to plant the pole

00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:55.114
you should only use your arms

00:00:55.114 --> 00:00:58.027
don't move the rest of your upper body

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:07.950
Always use the arm which is inside the turn and closest to the mountain

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.975
Plant the pole in the snow right before the new turn

00:01:11.975 --> 00:01:16.072
The pole determines where the new turn begins

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.735
Use also the pole-plan for rhythm

00:01:24.735 --> 00:01:28.575
and the result will be skiing with flow and ease

00:01:34.905 --> 00:01:39.126
Next step is to get more rounded and completed turns

00:01:39.126 --> 00:01:42.467
That's the way to control your speed

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:47.786
The up-and-down movements help obtain rounded turns

00:01:58.096 --> 00:02:01.143
Move upwards when you start your turn

00:02:01.143 --> 00:02:07.615
and lower your body to apply more weight onto your skies to complete the turn

00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:19.043
Notice the skier continues to apply pressure throughout the turn

00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:40.587
When you master the various basic steps

00:02:40.587 --> 00:02:43.284
you can begin to alternate your skiing

00:02:43.284 --> 00:02:47.299
Make wide turns at higher speed

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:52.400
Ski with friends and synch

00:02:59.641 --> 00:03:03.093
and challenge yourself with different terrains
