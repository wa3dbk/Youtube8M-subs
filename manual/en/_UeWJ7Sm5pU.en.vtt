00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
[JUNGBUB TALK] 0126. Why Don’t They Do Things This Way?

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.000
[Jungbub Terminology]
Grand Nature: the whole-dimensional Universe
Jungbub: ‘the Righteous Law’ in Korean, the law of Grand Nature
Seuseungnim: the Great Mentor who gives out the law of Grand Nature

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.400
When I see someone in action, it flashes across my mind “Why don't they do things this way...?” I am sure that my counterpart is also smart in their own ways, but what is it that makes them unable to see the way I do?

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.140
When we live our lives, we often see others at fault and think,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.460
“Why don't they do things this way?”

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.720
However, this is your opinion.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.120
All people are living in various different ways.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.320
Just because one can’t do well in a certain field doesn’t make them stupid.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:49.740
You are only assuming that the man would do it well in this area, because you have seen him doing well in the other area.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.920
Each individual is born with his or her own talents and skills.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.860
Each of us has different energy and different paths in life.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.380
Along with that, each person comes to the Earth with various forms and shapes.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.300
So there are things that you are good at,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.460
there are things that the other person is good at,

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.740
and you are simply a person who is good at catching the counterpart’s fault in his or her action.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.580
Then what is it that one should do when you are good at pointing out others’ fault?

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.520
What is the ability that you are lacking when you can see things?

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.920
The way to make them understand their fault is what is lacking.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.640
If you don’t study your own when this happens,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:40.000
you would feel frustrated looking at this, because you can’t lead and make them understood in a way that they can do things well.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.720
This is where your frustration comes from.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.160
Who is in difficult situation when you feel frustrated?

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
The answer is you.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.060
Those who don’t, have no issues.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.160
But, if you see things and feel frustrated,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.600
it means that this is your fault for having no ability to fix the situation,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.920
when you are the one who should be doing so.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.140
You can say that you didn’t study your own since you couldn’t help that situation.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.420
This is the principle which is precisely applied to your case.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:22.080
After I came out and looked around at this time of an era in which people are living without knowing this,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.340
from now on, I say it is time to know things like this one by one.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.160
Do you know the first thing you’re going to notice after knowing this?

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.580
You’ll notice that you don't rebuke others anymore.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.980
Even when you see someone at fault,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.420
if you know this,

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.560
you wouldn’t hold grudges or blame others.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.980
You won’t blame others at all.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.620
Then you won't feel frustrated.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.480
Without knowing this, you will,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.360
but just by understanding this basic principle,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.980
it will release you from feeling frustrated.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.660
You don’t fall into hardship because you don’t blame others.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.360
When you blame someone once, you will precisely fall behind one step down.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.240
Lacking in self-reflection with difficulty,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.680
you will face another challenge and will end up blaming others again,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.740
which will drag you down a step down farther.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.260
This is exactly how all human beings place themselves in hardships.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.200
Have there been times when you were moving up in the world making lots of money?

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.440
I know a lot of you here made tons of money at one point in your lifetime.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.640
You all have lived during that time.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.340
There were times when making money was easy.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.360
But those days are gone.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.840
You can’t make money easily now because that money has already been made and set aside by the people in the past.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.560
When you make lots of money,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.160
you never blame others.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.060
Instead, you will be smiling ear-to-ear without worrying about speaking ill of others.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.480
In doing that, you will create great wealth.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.060
But once you start blaming others at certain point,

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.660
you begin to lose money and things start to go downhill.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.800
Then good things that happened in your family start to die out.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.240
This is how families come crumbling down.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.960
Why?

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.060
It begins at the point of you starting to blame others.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.100
When things are going great, you are busy enough focusing on your own business.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.360
However, when things are not going well, you start meddling in someone else's business.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.540
You can say that your amount of work has reduced when you start meddling in someone else’s business.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.020
With less things to do, you start prying into other’s business which earns you no money.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.720
It doesn't help you at all.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.400
Interfering in things that aren't your concern makes you able to see contradictions of others,

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.800
which makes you become even more frustrated and blame others as a result.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.680
This is why things get harder and harder for you.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:26.220
A common practice of the people around us actually is what is greatly going against the Law of Grand Nature.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.380
What other people do is their own business to worry about.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:36.640
God never gave you a right to reprimand anyone in the first place.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:48.980
In other words, the Grand Nature never gave us any rights to say anything on what they did wrong.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.300
They are free to do what they choose to do freely,

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.200
and what they do wrong is also their own business.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:04.020
However, there are some who take lessons from others’ mistakes for their personal growth.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:11.300
While there are others who just blame and rebuke someone else's mistakes.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.060
They are different.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.860
If you don’t fulfill yourself, you will be a man who blames others.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.540
If you fulfill yourself,

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.260
you will not only take lessons from others’ mistakes without rebuking them,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:31.740
but even grow to manage what could not be done in their roles.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.500
This is what you call a wise man.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:42.260
So, never blame others when you see someone at fault.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.320
Instead, when they are seen in front of you,

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:53.000
set forth your aspirations and say to yourself, “This is my study to guide them in a right direction.”

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.060
and take it to your own study.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.940
Then you will achieve stupendous personal growth.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.020
Do you understand?
