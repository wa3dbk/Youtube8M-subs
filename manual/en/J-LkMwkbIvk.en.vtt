00:00:15.785 --> 00:00:16.670
I'm a busy guy.

00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:19.287
Things to do! Places to go!

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:23.859
Over time, I've accumulated quite an inventory of items over my random meanderings . 

00:00:24.093 --> 00:00:26.726
The problem is carrying all that stuff around.

00:00:32.213 --> 00:00:33.213
Son of a...

00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:36.866
Storage cabinets. Closets. Sheds. They're all for wimps.

00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.244
A real man carries all of his inventory at once.

00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:42.095
So I need a solution and I needed it fast.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.967
That's when I came across this pouch.

00:00:45.348 --> 00:00:46.065
Boom!

00:00:46.334 --> 00:00:47.249
Who's next?

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.479
Now it makes zero sense and defies all logic.

00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:56.447
But it works!

00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:59.280
You may wondering how the weight is evenly distributed.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.360
Science.

00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:04.564
The only downside 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.738
Is I'm temporarily blinded blinded everytime I have to get something out of my inventory.

00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:10.284
*Painful grunt*

00:01:10.858 --> 00:01:11.858
Thanks for the ride!

00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:13.037
Hey, no problem, man.

00:01:13.216 --> 00:01:14.216
Although it's bright out.

00:01:14.736 --> 00:01:16.659
Definitely get my sunglasses on.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.936
What about the driving part?

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:20.980
Let me get my sunglasses.

00:01:21.178 --> 00:01:24.133
No. Okay. Hold on! We should...

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.532
This is getting intense.

00:01:25.603 --> 00:01:26.948
Just relax, dude. It's okay.

00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:28.508
But you're not even looking at the road.

00:01:28.562 --> 00:01:29.566
Shhhhh.

00:01:29.674 --> 00:01:31.108
It's okay. I've done this a lot.

00:01:31.198 --> 00:01:31.912
Watch out!

00:01:33.346 --> 00:01:34.386
I don't wanna die!

00:01:34.512 --> 00:01:36.950
We're good. We're good. We're good. Shhhhh.

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:37.793
It's okay.

00:01:38.528 --> 00:01:38.905
It's all right.

00:01:38.994 --> 00:01:40.590
Can you stop at the store for pants?

00:01:41.397 --> 00:01:44.691
Yeah! We can make a unplanned detour.

00:01:44.817 --> 00:01:45.817
Pants. Thank you.

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:46.817
- Pants?
- Yes.

00:01:46.888 --> 00:01:47.614
What about underwear?

00:01:47.883 --> 00:01:48.829
Yes, that too.

00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:50.513
Okay. We can do that. We can do that.

00:01:50.925 --> 00:01:52.592
They should have that at the local pants store.

00:01:53.023 --> 00:01:54.023
i'm fairly good at it.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.147
But all my friends seem to get up in arms.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.301
I've pretty much mastered the art of not being able to see.

00:02:01.968 --> 00:02:04.389
There's really only one instance where it becomes a problem.

00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:07.106
Hey babe.

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:08.236
How ya feeling?

00:02:08.307 --> 00:02:09.307
Feelin' great!

00:02:11.907 --> 00:02:13.668
Awww man!

00:02:13.812 --> 00:02:14.382
What!?

00:02:14.543 --> 00:02:15.834
Well this stinks!

00:02:15.996 --> 00:02:17.143
Are you kidding me right now?

00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:18.735
Start.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.962
Is that what I mean to you?

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:22.307
Come on!

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:25.660
Finally!

00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:28.386
No, no, no, no! I just...

00:02:28.978 --> 00:02:29.641
Eh.

00:02:35.307 --> 00:02:39.180
*Humming*
