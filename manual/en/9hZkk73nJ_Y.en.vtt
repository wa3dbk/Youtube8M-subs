00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.080
Introduction to Fractions.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.600
Pizza.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.700
Let me order another pizza.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.000
Large Pizza.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.300
I will divide the pizza into equal parts.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.400
This pizza is a whole.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.600
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.200
Divide the pizza into 6 equal parts.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:18.400
One out of these, six parts can be expressed as one upon six.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.400
This number is read as one sixth.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:42.600
Two out of six parts can be expressed as two upon six and read as two sixth.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Such type of numbers are called fractions.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.440
Whole.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.400
Part.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.400
Fractions express a part of a whole.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.400
1 upon 6.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:15.200
Fractions can be written using two whole numbers and a line.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.400
Number above the line is called numerator.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:33.080
Number below the line is called denominator.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.000
Whole.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Parts.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:59.600
Denominator tells us total number of parts in a whole.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:33.200
Numerator tells us how many parts are taken from the whole.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.200
Whole.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:04.500
Note that, denominator cannot be zero because we cannot make zero parts of a whole.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.100
The End.
