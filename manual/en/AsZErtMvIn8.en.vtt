00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:03.939
Hi, how are you doing?! My name is Ot치rio (Sucker)!

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.939
And today I'm here in this yellow Camaro to show how BraZilians are made of sucker!

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:28.540
While in the U.S. a Camaro Coupe model SS 2014 costs around US$35.400 (including taxes)

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.550
In Brazil, this same car costs more than R$222.000 (or approximately US$100 thousand)

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.770
A difference of almost 3 times!

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:44.739
But... convert dollar to real is not the
proper (or fair) way to verify how the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.560
goverment, automakers and dealerships fuck with you!

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.479
'Cause while in Brazil, the minimum wage
is of R$724...

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.260
In the U.S., depending on the State, is of more than
1.400 d칩lares

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.540
Therefore, there are necessary around 306 minimum
wages in Brazil to acquire a single Camaro.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.759
While in the U.S., with only 25 minimum
wages, you can have this car at home!

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.120
WHAT?! You don't get it?! So, let me explain in
another way...

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.280
Assuming that both the workers (brazilians
and americans) work exactly the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.229
same amount of hours monthly

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.560
and receive for this, a minimum wage in
their respective countries...

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.929
would be necessary 306 months, or 25 years and a half, 
for the Brazilian worker acquire

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:35.069
this so-dreamed yellow car.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.060
However, for the american worker,
would be necessary 25 months, or 2 years and one month

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.380
to reach the same objective.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.390
But if we want to be a little more realistic
and imagine that they saved 50%

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.790
of the minimum wage to acquire the car.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.900
The Brazilian would have to save 
during 51 years of his life

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.619
while the american, just 4.

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.990
You kidding, huh?!

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.189
Yeah... if the two workers started to work with
18 years old

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.720
the american worker would have
the car key with 22!

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.760
The Brazilian would only have the key with 69 years

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.620
Although... there is an advantage for the Brazilian 
wait for so long,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.160
'cause, probably, 51 years from now, the
Camaro would be like this...

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.610
[Robot] Hello Ot치rio! Let's take a ride?!

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.210
You didn't like it?! Take it easy...

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.440
'Cause in contrast, in Brazil, you can buy a complete Gol Rallye, 
for just R$56.911

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.960
That is almost the same price of Camaro Coupe,
the most basic sold in the U.S.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.070
Oh, remembering that this little one can also have
the yellow color!

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.200
Wooow, that's cooool!

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.300
For this and other, you have to be a huge sucker 
to buy a car in this country!

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.020

because car in Brazil is too expensive!
