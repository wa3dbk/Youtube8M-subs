00:00:06.111 --> 00:00:06.610
Hey, guys.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:06.845
What's up?

00:00:06.845 --> 00:00:08.860
It's Lauren from the
YouTube channel LaurDIY,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.620
and today we're making this
really cute statement necklace.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.210
And we're using this really
fun tape called Teal Blooms.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.120
And it's just a really fun
floral, and a little bit vintage

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.070
looking which is really,
really in right now.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.986
So for this craft, you're going to
need a stirring straw, some fishing

00:00:21.986 --> 00:00:25.330
line, card stock,
scissors, a crafting knife,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.015
and then I've got my Teal Blooms tape.

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:29.392
I'm just going to start
with my card stock triangle

00:00:29.392 --> 00:00:30.850
here, which I already have pre-cut.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.064
I'm going to go ahead and
fold this right in half.

00:00:34.064 --> 00:00:36.230
So we're going to use this
as the base of the charms

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.540
that we're going to
hang off the necklace.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.700
So fold it in half just like that.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.730
And now, just to make sure that it's
going to be perfectly symmetrical,

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.320
I'm going to go ahead
and cut off the end here,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.460
because we're not going to use that.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.907
And then push that aside
because we don't need that.

00:00:51.907 --> 00:00:53.990
And now we're going to cut
this into three pieces,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.135
so it's going to make a total of five,
because this one is folded in half.

00:00:57.135 --> 00:00:59.910
So we're going to go here and here.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.580
I'm going to go ahead,
make my first cut.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.330
That's going to make
our two outer charms.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.730
And then one more cut.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.490
This one's going to make our center
charm and the next two on either sides.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.360
So now if you unfold this
one, we have our middle one.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.230
We're going to use this as a template.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.630
Then we have our two outside
ones, outside the middle one.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.200
And these ones, which are going
to go on the very outside.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.719
It's going to look like
that once it's all covered.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.010
So now I'm going to cover them.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.830
I'm just going to set
this aside for a sec

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.620
and pull out a few inches
off my Teal Blooms tape here.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.757
So I'm going to lay this sticky side up.

00:01:39.757 --> 00:01:41.590
I'm going to cover up
this middle one first.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.960
So I'm just going to plop this right
in the center here, just like that.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.480
And I'm going to go ahead
and trim off the sides.

00:01:58.116 --> 00:01:59.990
So now I've got one side
covered, and then we

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.660
have the card stock showing on the back.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.326
So we're going to go ahead and
repeat that exact same process so

00:02:04.326 --> 00:02:05.660
that we have both sides covered.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.330
So same thing.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.630
I'm just going to pull
out some of my Teal Blooms

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.416
and then lay this sticky side up.

00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:20.517
And just sandwich that card side down
right into the tape just like that.

00:02:20.517 --> 00:02:21.350
And then same thing.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.142
Just go ahead and snip off the sides.

00:02:25.142 --> 00:02:27.760
So now we have our first
piece completely covered.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.030
So it's got the floral on both sides.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.690
And go ahead.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.490
Repeat that exact same process until
you all your pieces are covered.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.560
So I'm going to go ahead and swap
these ones out for my finished charms.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.750
So here's what they'll look like
when everything is all done.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.520
Just like that.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.310
So super cute.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.590
So vintage-y looking.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.700
And now we're going to
take our stirring straw

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.100
and pull out a piece of tape
that's about the same length

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.380
as our stirring straw,
maybe a little bit longer.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.300
So I'm going to use this as a guide.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.365
Snip that off.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.330
And then lay this sticky side up.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.140
And now I'm going to
take my stirring straw

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.195
and just touch it at the very
edge here and then just roll.

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:21.292
So before you start rolling, just
go ahead and flatten that edge out

00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:22.250
and keep rolling it up.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.710
And this is going to make
a bead to put on the back

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.265
so we can attach our string to it.

00:03:26.765 --> 00:03:30.370
So I'm just going to go ahead and snip
off any extra I have on the edge here.

00:03:33.794 --> 00:03:36.460
Because we have five charms, I'm
going to make five little beads

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.002
and cut these into five small pieces.

00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:40.960
And you want to make sure they're
smaller than the actual charm itself.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.030
So if you want to use your charm
to measure, go ahead and do that.

00:03:49.222 --> 00:03:50.930
I'm just going to pop
these right on top,

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.341
just to make sure they're all
smaller than the charm itself.

00:03:55.341 --> 00:03:57.227
And we are good to go.

00:03:57.227 --> 00:03:59.060
So now all we need is
a little piece of tape

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.790
to attach that bead onto
the back of the charm.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.612
So we're going to lay a bit of tape
out and just cut a short piece.

00:04:07.612 --> 00:04:11.115
Hold this down on my crafting mat
and then cut this into five sections.

00:04:18.352 --> 00:04:20.810
And again, you just want to
make sure that these pieces are

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.212
smaller than the charm itself
so it's not hanging off.

00:04:23.212 --> 00:04:28.590
I'm taking my big charm here,
take my bead, pop it on.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.270
And if you want, you can actually
pop the bead onto the tape

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.970
first so you know it's
centered just like that.

00:04:38.164 --> 00:04:41.020
And then I'm going to pop this on.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.970
Secure it down on both sides.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.970
And you have a bead
to attach your string

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.670
through on the back of your charm.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.820
Go ahead and repeat that exact same
process until all five of your charms

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.780
have beads on the back.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.178
So I'm going to swap these ones out.

00:04:57.178 --> 00:05:03.558
And now I'm going to go ahead and lay
these back out into the proper order.

00:05:03.558 --> 00:05:06.830
Next, with my fishing line, I'm going
to make a little flag at the very bottom

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.580
here so that when we
thread the charms on,

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.295
they don't slip off on the other end.

00:05:11.295 --> 00:05:13.310
So I'm going to use my
crafting knife here.

00:05:17.472 --> 00:05:19.680
And we're going to end up
taking this off afterwards,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.630
so it doesn't matter
how big or small it is.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.170
Just so that it's wide enough
that the charms won't slip.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.230
And now on the other end, I'm
going to go ahead and start

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.760
threading on my beads.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.640
And you are all done.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.010
You have your super cute, slightly
vintage statement necklace.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.960
So I'm going to go ahead and pop
this little flag off the very end.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.404
And now with the ends, you
just go ahead and tie these up.

00:05:50.404 --> 00:05:53.070
And if you want, you could go
ahead and add a clasp if you want.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.278
But I'm just going to do
something really simple here

00:05:55.278 --> 00:05:57.180
and just tie a double knot.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.670
Go ahead and pull that tight and
you have a new finished addition

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.210
to your jewelry collection.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.710
So I hope you guys enjoy this craft.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.930
And if you did, make sure
to give it a big thumbs up.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.867
And if you do try it out, make sure
to send us a picture on Instagram

00:06:09.867 --> 00:06:11.200
by using the hash tag duck tape.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.815
And like, the quack quack duck.

00:06:12.815 --> 00:06:14.225
Like d-u-c-k duck.

00:06:14.225 --> 00:06:15.934
Because we love seeing
your guys' crafts.

00:06:15.934 --> 00:06:18.724
So I hope you guys enjoyed it and
I will see you in the next video.

00:06:18.724 --> 00:06:19.300
