00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.450
This is John Kohler with OKraw.com.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.160
Today we're going to talk about olives.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.290
Olives are one of my favorite foods and they're
great alternative sources of fat instead eating

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.290
nuts.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.419
You want to keep water rich fats in your raw
food diet and, you know, nuts have very highly

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:19.380
concentrated fat and olives have much less
fat, but the problem with olives is that they're

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.030
often pasteurized or cooked.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.480
Definitely in a can, you don't want to eat
canned olives.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.170
They have been heat processed.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.910
The problem with jarred olives is that they
may be pasteurized, and if there's no labeling

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.300
law, if it is pasteurized it must be labeled
as such.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.580
So, some brands are labeled pasteurized and
some brands are not, although they may be

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.780
pasteurized unless you get them direct from
the farmer.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.180
So, if you are going to buy olives, I ten
to buy the salt cured olives and then actually

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.670
soak them in purified water to get the salt
out of the olives before I eat them, that

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.440
way they're also water rich.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.970
The other thing I do is, what, if I do olives
in water is I check for the ingredients, and

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.990
you know I don't want to do ingredients like
vinegar or sometimes they put little dyes

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.289
or other things in there.

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.049
Usually I'm just looking for olives, salt,
and water or maybe olives packed in olive

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.469
oil and herbs and salt.

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:17.840
So, that's what I normally do, but today what
we're going to do is we're going to go to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.460
and olive tree, and I'm goanna show you how
to basically cure your own olives.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.859
Today we're teaching you how to dry olives
with or how to cure olives.

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.179
It's very simple, you know, I've messed with
drying olives for many years now.

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.579
I've tried to do the brine technique and you
got to basically put salted water or salt

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.460
water and put the olives in there and then
change out the water all the time and then

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.100
if you forget they kind of get all funky.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.549
So, I'm goanna show you the easiest way to
cure your olives.

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.229
So step number one is you need to obtain the
olives.

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.639
Sometimes you could buy uncured olives at
specialty produce stores, but it's always

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:57.340
best to pick it fresh, so we're here at an
olive tree and you can see some of the olives

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.810
on here are still green.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.649
Now, you know, people do cure green olives
and you can buy green olives, you know, in

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.779
cans all the time and, you know, I don't like
the green olives.

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:09.539
I prefer the black olives when they're more
mature and more ripe.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.189
So, we're goanna come over here and pick some
olives easy.

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:14.200
I just have a paper bag.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.989
You come below the branch, and you just squeeze
them all out, get a handful, put it in the

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:20.989
bag.

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.019
It's just that easy.

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.400
So, it's best when you're harvesting the olives
to get the larger olives because the olives

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.829
have a high percentage of water weight, and
when you cure them how I'm going to cure 'em

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.680
takes a lot of that water out and also takes
the (unclear) out.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.400
So, if you want to play mean joke on your
friends, just say, 'oh, here's some ripe,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.160
fresh olives,' and have them eat it and their
mouth is goanna pucker up because they're

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.160
not good.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.209
Although another way to cure the olives is
actually sun drying.

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.269
In certain climates they can actually sun
dry on the tree and they are absolutely amazing.

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.120
You can also take these and dry them in the
dehydrator, but then they get hard.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.660
I'm just going to go ahead and a harvest the
full bag of olives, then we'll be back and

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.140
we'll show you all the olives that I've harvested.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.680
So, I just got finished harvesting all the
olives.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.970
We have several pounds of olives here in this
paper bag.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.709
You check it out, all fresh, right off the
tree.

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.690
So, the next step is we need to get the items
that we need to preserve the olives.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.469
So, the next step is we're going to go to
store and get the stuff we need.

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.140
So, now we're at my local health food store
and we got to get salt.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.390
So, they have several different kinds of salt
here in the bulk bins.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.590
So, they have the real natural mineral real
salt, and this is mined in Utah, but we don't

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.590
want that.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.110
They have the fine sea salt, solar evaporated,
and we don't want that either 'cause it's

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.420
too fine.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.800
Next here we have the course sea salt.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.800
That's the one we want.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.680
We want the ones with the big crystals.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.870
So, we're just goanna go ahead and scoop out
the sea salt.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.630
We want to get about, it's a one-to-one ratio,
so as many olives as we have, and you want

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.980
to get about as much sea salt.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.069
Right here's the last scoop, and once again
we got the course sea salt.

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.790
We've got the whole bag here, next we're going
to check out, then we'll be in the kitchen,

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.370
we're goanna show you how to make it.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.909
So, now we're going to cure the olives.

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:19.260
You saw me buy this, it's the rock salt and
basically I brought the olives home, washed

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.540
them and took out all the stems and all the
leaves, so now we have is basically the washed

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.460
olives that I picked, fresh picked, and the
rock salt.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.110
So, all we're goanna simply do is get a nice
big bowl, and we're goanna layer the rock

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.170
salt with the olives and then we're just goanna
put a lid on it.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.250
So, let's do that next, real simple real easy.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.540
Take the salt out.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:50.160
You're goanna line some up in the bottom there
and this is the easiest way to cure your olives,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.470
like bar none.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.910
Really simple, real easy.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.060
This is like, you really cannot mess up this
way, 'cause it's going to happen.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.920
As long as you put the appropriate amount
of sault in.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.201
You don't put enough salt in you could have
an issue but if you put enough salt, in this

00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:09.450
way will work.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:16.070
So, that's I'm usin' it, you know, I definitely
would prefer a water cured olive but that's

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.850
more difficult, and this, if you forget about
it no big deal.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.230
If you forget to change your water out of
the water cures, they can get a little bit

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.530
kind of funky on you, but this is pretty much
just goanna work.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.020
So, as you can see we're just layering up
the olives, making sure there are like touching

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.470
in the salt.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.580
Here's the rest of the olives in there, layer
that a nice small layer, and next we're just

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.740
goanna dump in the rest of our salt.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.220
Real simple, real easy.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.530
All olives are pretty much covered in salt
for the most part.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.990
Then we're just goanna stick this lid on it
and you can see, wow this is heavy, all the

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.990
olives in there.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.520
So, basically all we need is every few days
and just shake up the mixture, make sure olives

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.250
stay continually coated in the salt.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.380
Alright, so we're back and here are the olives
that have been basically curing in side the

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.040
cowl and basically every couple days and just
shake the bowl, and then we're going to go

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.620
ahead and take off the top and show you what
we got.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:31.250
Well, wow, what happened is all olives, you
can see, are all dried up in there, and there's

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.230
some water leftover, and some salt.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.370
So, at this point what you're going to basically
do is just sieve off all of the olives, put

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.220
'em into a storage jar, and then you'll be
able to store them.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.490
I like to store mine in the fridge, and they'll
keep for actually quite a long time that way.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.580
Now, this is the easiest way that I've found
to preserve olives.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:57.490
You saw here how easy is it to just salt the
olives, leave 'em in, shake 'em up, and they'll

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.100
cure themselves, no input necessary.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.900
The other way to cure olives is really easy
if you live in a sunny climate.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.570
You can just leave them on the tree, sand
they'll sun dry.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.540
So, I know in San Diego, we have some sun-dried
olives right on the tree.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.470
So, that's really the best way of all, but
aside from that you can pick ripe olives and

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.880
put 'em in your dehydrator, but when you do
that they get really hard, so I don't like

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.880
'em too much.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.510
The problem with this method of curing is
that it does add some salt to the olives.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.300
So, what I recommend is before you use them,
maybe for twenty four hours before you them,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.860
and don't store them like cause they'll go
bad, but 24 hours before you use them, soak

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.880
them in like some purified water overnight.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.560
Now, we'll get a little bit of the salt flavor
off, because, you know, we need an adequate

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.910
amount of salt but too much salt is not good
for us, and in any case when you are eating

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.040
olives, I encourage you to eat them with other
water rich foods.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.470
So, once again this is John Kohler with OKraw.com.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.390
Keep eating your fresh fruits and vegetables.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.160
We'll see you next time.
