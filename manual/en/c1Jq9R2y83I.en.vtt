00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:06.359
Now I'm going to tell you a little bit about
common animal that we'll find in the pet trading.

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:14.130
This is the Chilean Rose Hair Tarantula. Scientists
refer to it as Grammostola Rosea and like

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.679
the name implies, you'll find him originally
in the scrub lands of Chile, especially in

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:27.470
area called the Atacama Desert. And the Rose
Hair Tarantula gets his name on the males

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.290
have a, a pink rose color, right here on a
part of the their body called the cephalothorax,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.930
that's where the head and the thorax if fuse
together. You can see he's got a pair of spinnerettes

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.160
coming from his abdomen here. And if I move
him over, let's see if we can get him to go

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.930
after something he'll eat in awhile. They
eat small crickets and other invertebrates

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.080
and he senses the vibrations with those hairs.
So let's see if he'll take some prey. He may

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:08.659
have done a little too work to after, to go
after the prey. These spiders are common prey

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:18.240
for lizards and other small mammals, birds
and so forth. And what they'll do has a defensive

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.260
behavior, when they feel threaten, they'll
wear up on their back legs and they'll extend

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.530
the front pedipalpis, the front pair of appendages,
they'll extend their fangs in a warning. But

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.070
if that doesn't work, they'll often flick
this irritating hairs, called urticating hairs

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.630
off their abdomen. Let me turn him around
so you can get a good view of the spinnerettes.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:50.840
And I'll try to, get the web and here we go,
get a nice strand of web, coming out. Now

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.560
unlike a group of animals called the true
spiders, these animals, chelicerae or fangs

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.220
are arranged to move up and down, like this.
True spiders, like black widows and the latrodectus

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.030
will have their fangs arrange to pinch on
the sides. So these are very primitive form

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:20.599
of the spider family. They evolve before the
true spiders did and this is the Chilean Rose

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.060
Hair Tarantula, another amazing terrestrial
invertebrate.
