00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.300
Hey it's Sharon again with Nappy Hair
Nation and today I like to talk to you a

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.130
little bit about

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.220
hats!

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.430
okay it cold it's wintertime

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.619
and we want to look cute while we're wearing
our hats, giving our her hair

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.000
a rest, protective styles, but as our hair
grows

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.939
out, the kinky hair the natural hair is
very difficult (especially if your hair grows

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.300
up like mine) to find a hat that works
okay?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.940
So I wanna, I've made it be easier to

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.449
separate them into 2 completely
different hats.

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.440
We have the "Beret" and we have the "Fedora"

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.829
The Fedora is the hotness right now so
I'll focus on that. The Fedora, this is my

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:50.940
husband's the Fedora.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.309
The secret, if your hair is big and poofy, and it grows up like mine,

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.200
the secret to a Fedora is making sure
that

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.399
you have plenty of room it goes deep
enough and its wide enough to fit your

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.930
hair

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.210
okay um I pin my hair up

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.979
in the back and then I use my husband's
Fedora, which is an extra large,

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.630
okay and then I just place it on

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.780
back here kinda push and pull it feels
like its on.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.819
That obviously is very stylish and it
feels good

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:26.580
it doesn't feel secure just kinda feels
like it may fall off eventually

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.840
um but it is a fabulous look and again as my
fro gets bigger you start to stop

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.160
even seeing the hat but

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.340
when you buy these you want to try them on
and make sure that

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.330
your rim is big enough.  If you have like a TWA
a shorter hair

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.679
you have the freedom to pretty much
wear almost any size Fedora hat you want.

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.239
Okay, this is another Fedora that I
actually got this one from Target

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.560
and again it has that wide rim, I plop it

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.810
on the back my hair and I sit it back
here and this rim is a little bit wider

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.599
it again it doesn't feel 100 percent
secure but it still works if I wanna do

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:03.819
protective style.

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.800
This is a shorter hat, what do you call this
again hun?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.320
"Trilby"

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.530
A trilby? This is a trilby hat some
people

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.700
confuse with a Fedora but it's a
little different kinda like that

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.940
whole Frank Sinatra 1960s

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.460
Rat Pack vibe you know? You can take
it

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.990
and again plot this on you see it is
shorter than a Fedora

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.210
for some reason this hat actually feels a
little bit more secure on

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.880
my head,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.360
it's not as much brim so I'm

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.380
it feels a little bit more comfortable
so that's an option for you right there

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.890
In the Fedora family if you really want to
get crazy and have fun

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.890
you can always do...."WooooooHooooooo!"

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.730
1 of these, and let me tell you

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.310
a Natural CAN wear one of these hats!

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.770
 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.180
Ok, now that those

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.580
are out of the way, my favorite and most
comfortable for

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.640
type 4 who's hair grows up or even type 3

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.600
who just have a TON of hair, Berets

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.800
I find to be the most comfortable and
those come usually in either knit

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.950
or wool. The knit ones are super duper
comfortable because

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.800
they're stretchy and their light weight and
they look really cute and they're

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.530
really popular they come in different
colors and you can match them with your sweaters

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.950
the only thing is usually knits

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.070
um don't come with a lot of

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.450
elastic right here so you may have a
harder time keeping them on if you have

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.100
a whole ton of hair back here.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.160
So when I keep my hair pinned up and then
you can you know keep it

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.769
sitting there like that, my hair is getting caught in my ring here...

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.019
oops, just ripped my hair out, okay

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.950
and or you can pull over and kind of like

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.230
put it to the side in you know I mean
you can see how it is much more flexible

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.669
you can tuck more hair in

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.720
and have a little hair out if you want
to you know so I'm

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.430
I really like the the these hats but

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.240
again I like when the beret hat a little
bit more

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.400
elastic to it. For instance, this is another beret.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.530
and a lot of these berets, my favorite berets to be honest
if you go through the Asian hair store

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.330
where you get your products and your coconut oil and your bobby

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.200
pins.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.020
If you go to their hat scarf section they
have these which are

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.160
great and these have really nice elasticity.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.220
These are my all-time favorite sometimes I even sleep in these.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.970
These like to stay on!

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.190
I pull these up over my Fro, my Fro really

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.810
really loves these.  These are super
comfortable and lightweight you can

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.139
barely even feel it

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.789
okay these are nice, you can always go with
the classic

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.909
um you know beret that the French have
made very popular, its

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.539
kind of stereotypical.  When I was in
Paris I didn't see anyone wearing it

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:19.180
but anyway

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.030
I wasn't there in winter so I don't know
but you can put these on again

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.370
if you have less hair like maybe a medium amount of

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.610
hair you can put these on, super warm
again

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.639
flexible, tuck your curls in and I and do
what you need to do

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.750
and these come in a variety of
colors you can match your 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.280
outfit pretty much with these.  I have
these in tan and black and red and cream ans

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.280
animal print, you can never
have enough of these 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.800
especially in the winter and they give your hair a nice rest. These are

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.349
fun this is a little bit more casual look

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:00.150
that has a brim on it that knit beret
but it has this so if you wanna like

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.009
kind of get Gangsta wit it

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.830
put it like down over your eye

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.409
"You ain't got the answers Sway!" you
know whatever.

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:17.610
I rarely wear this but these are
fun t and again you can get these

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:24.430
at the Asian hair store.  Last but not least
I have to give a shout out to my girl

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.919
who

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.669
owns a vintage shop "Hinesite Vintage" you
can go into a Vintage shop

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.800
and find what I call the "William
Shakespeare" beret

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.050
Which is kinda the guy on the ledge

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.629
you know Juliet "wherefore art thou

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:44.139
Romeo" I am Telling You it you have a ton
of hair

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:47.210
these things are absoutely humongous!

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.559
They almost look like a shower cap but
you can work it

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:54.589
with a nice turtle neck, put off to the
side it's kinda like that

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:58.399
"Rerun" thing going on, I absolutely positively love
this hat!

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:01.999
I found this hat and all of my hair fit in it and I was 

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:06.740
absolutely THRILLED!  So anyway these are some of the hats that I use.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.039
I hope this helps. But ladies just have fun with it
you know

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:14.849
find a different hats,different styles,
different colors. Buy your scarves to match.

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:18.039
Buy your sweaters to match, have fun with it

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:22.449
find your lip color that matches and
turn a cold frigid day into...

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:28.670
the runway! I hope this helps ladies, take
care

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:35.670
Bye!
