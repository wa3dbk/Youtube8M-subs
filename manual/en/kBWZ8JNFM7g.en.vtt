00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:17.776
[fzzt]

00:00:17.776 --> 00:00:19.143
--AAAAAAA! WAAAAAAA--

00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:22.591
[underwater mumbling]

00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:27.118
[gagging]

00:00:27.118 --> 00:00:29.147
Haa-haa-yehh-woo...

00:00:29.147 --> 00:00:30.391
Ho...

00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:33.824
Hey! I... think it worked!

00:00:33.824 --> 00:00:36.911
This looks like... deciduous--

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:41.287
Well, I'm not in New Mexico!
And that's what matters.

00:00:41.287 --> 00:00:44.716
Hey, a fire tower. Maybe I
can figure out where I am.

00:00:44.716 --> 00:00:49.291
I mean, did they actually get
Massachusetts? Is that where I am?

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:51.844
I'd be really impressed then.

00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:55.500
Huh. Not a lot to go on.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.306
But, hey, what a problem to have, right?

00:00:59.306 --> 00:01:06.456
I am almost ecstatic that my worst problem
right now is being lost in the woods,

00:01:06.456 --> 00:01:09.655
approaching sundown with
no food or shelter.

00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:15.297
I haven't heard one bomb go off or been
shocked with electricity since I got here.

00:01:15.297 --> 00:01:17.968
Yeah, this works JUST fine.

00:01:17.968 --> 00:01:23.009
But the no food thing IS getting
my attention, but I'm in the forest.

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.533
Maybe I can kill a chipmunk and eat it.

00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.302
Huh, ruins.

00:01:27.302 --> 00:01:29.586
Actually, a chipmunk might be a problem.

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:32.957
With my guns, it would just explode if I shot it.

00:01:32.957 --> 00:01:35.351
Whatever. I'll figure something out.

00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:38.210
Okay, this looks really old.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.185
And the architecture...

00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:42.574
Jesus, I might be in Europe!

00:01:42.574 --> 00:01:45.374
That could explain the daylight,

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:49.190
though I kind of gave up trying to
figure out what was going on there.

00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:51.527
You know what? I'm not complaining.

00:01:51.527 --> 00:01:53.527
Yeah, this suit has a tracker, right?

00:01:53.527 --> 00:01:57.166
HAVE FUN TRYING TO FIND ME
IN EUROPE, ASSHOLES!

00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:01.689
Oh! A building! Time to
introduce myself to the locals.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.693
Thankfully, buckshot is
considered universal currency.

00:02:05.693 --> 00:02:09.643
EVERYBODY DOWN ON THE GROUND! GIVE ME
ALL YOUR MONEY! I'M A POLITICAL REFUGEE!

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.453
Oh.

00:02:11.453 --> 00:02:13.938
Well, maybe they left a bag of
chips lying around...

00:02:13.938 --> 00:02:15.854
I'm surprised this place has power.

00:02:15.854 --> 00:02:17.240
Oh, a map!

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.878
I can't read a damned thing! It's
completely smudged from water damage.

00:02:21.878 --> 00:02:23.120
Why even hang it?

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.264
So, this must be a ranger station.

00:02:25.264 --> 00:02:27.014
I guess I could sleep here.

00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:29.819
BUT I CAN'T EAT THESE PAPERS, CAN I?!

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.610
I don't hear a generator. The power lines
must be buried. That's a good sign.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.092
Well, time to go find some
chipmunks before dark.

00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:39.764
Hey, y'know...

00:02:39.764 --> 00:02:44.195
If I started a forest fire, then
people would come to me.

00:02:44.195 --> 00:02:49.359
No, maybe not. It's too damp.
The woods aren't dry enough.

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:50.195
J--!

00:02:50.195 --> 00:02:54.649
Or, I could just have my prayers answered!
That's always my first choice!

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.464
Jesus! It even has a backup can of gas! 

00:02:57.464 --> 00:03:00.266
Okay, time to LEARN how to hotwire.

00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:01.651
Is this a test?

00:03:01.651 --> 00:03:03.316
No? I don't see anyone.

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:08.366
Well, I just became a Jeep fan!
I understand Jeep people now!

00:03:08.366 --> 00:03:10.899
OH MY GOD! THE KEYS ARE IN THE IGNITION!

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:11.983
[engine turns over]

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:13.339
HA-HAAA!

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:16.575
Some ranger is walking home tonight!

00:03:16.575 --> 00:03:17.989
This is beautiful.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.200
I'll find a surplus store to sell the rocket
launcher and be back on my feet in days.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.608
That's it! I win!

00:03:27.476 --> 00:03:28.843
Hey, what's on the radio?

00:03:30.547 --> 00:03:49.237
