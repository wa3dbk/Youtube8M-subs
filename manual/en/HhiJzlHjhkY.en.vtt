00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:03.679
Hi everyone.

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:04.679
I'm Rincey and this is Rincey Reads.

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:08.309
Today I'm going to be doing a Quarterly box
unboxing.

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.520
This is the Book Riot Quarterly box.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.799
Just as a disclaimer in the beginning, just
cause I'm a contributor for Book Riot doesn't

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:15.799
mean anything.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.250
I've been getting these since before I was
a contributor.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.460
They don't, you know, pay me for this.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.530
I pay for it myself and they just ship it
to me.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.710
That's really all it is.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.260
I will say, I think I know what one of the
books is because I saw Rebecca talking about

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.600
it on our little Book Riot forum thing that
we have for all the contributors.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.970
But I was trying really hard not to pay attention
to that thread.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.620
[laughs] So yeah, let's get started and open
this up.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.820
OK, something gorgeous right at the top.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.140
So the first thing right at the top of the
box - oh there's a lot of really gorgeous

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.940
stuff in here - is this print.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.290
There is one that's an F. Scott Fitzgerald
print.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.130
And this is Jorge Luis Borges, I don't know
how to say the name.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.850
This is super gorgeous.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.370
Oh my gosh, wow.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.440
This is like really nice paper, I can tell.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.650
So this is a custom literary quote print from
obvious state.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.920
So they created the design exclusively for
Book Riot Quarterly subscribers.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.920
Wow!

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.740
That is kind of fantastic and I think I will
put this up at my job because this is gorgeous.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.310
Or maybe I'll put it up somewhere in my room.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.710
I don't know, this is going up somewhere because
this deserves to be hung.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.799
OK, I also have a code that's redeemable for
one ebook at openroadmedia.com.

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.380
OK so it looks like everyone gets a free ebook
of MAPS &amp; LEGENDS: READING AND WRITING ALONG

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.439
WITH THE BORDERLANDS by Michael Chabon.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.210
We also get Read sticker, which is fantastic.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.979
I will be sticking this along with my other
stickers.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:48.979
Oh.

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.250
I almost bought this the other day.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.100
Glad I didn't.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.490
So one of the books is WHAT WE SEE WHEN WE
READ by Peter Mendelson.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.590
This is a really gorgeous book, by the way.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.689
It has really thick paperback covers.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.130
And it looks like this is another one that's
annotated by the author.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.980
Um, kind of like how LEXICON was annotated
in the first Quarterly box.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.159
So this is really nice.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:19.900
Uh, so this book, Peter Mendelson is apparently
an illustrator and this book comes, like it's

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.090
kind of illustrated.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.999
It's not just like a straight novel.

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:23.999
Um.

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:27.079
And it talks about what you as a reader see
when you see words.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.769
Like, not necessarily neurologically, but
what you're imagining when you're looking

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:32.769
at words.

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:33.769
So this will be super interesting.

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:40.159
And then I also got a copy of THE SALINGER
CONTRACT by Adam Langer.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:45.579
So this book is a fast-paced literary thriller
that revolves around the central question

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.620
of what makes certain books resonate so strongly
with people that they can't not remake them

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.959
into their own reality.

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.359
It's about the power of stories to inspire
and the relationships formed between an author

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.359
and a reader.

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.730
That sounds really interesting and it comes
with [laughs] an insert.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.250
Sorry I was laughing because I was already
reading what some of the stuff said on the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.250
insert.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.609
So it comes with a hilarious handwritten note,
partially handwritten note from the author,

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.400
which is very cool.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.109
And then I got, it's a Book Riot water bottle.

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.599
This'll be nice to keep my water in.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.230
It says "whether you're a devoted gym goer
or prefer say, lifting that hardcover, you

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.459
gotta stay hydrated."

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.739
This actually would be really nice while working
out.

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.549
So, thank you for that.

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:33.699
And I think that's it.

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:36.870
Yeah, I didn't get any of the bonuses this
time around, which is fine.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.680
It says one person gets this Lumio lamp thing,
which I'm fine with not getting because I

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.629
don't really have space in my room for something
like that.

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.589
And there were a couple of ARCs that went
out to certain readers or certain subscribers

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:49.629
and stuff like that.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.689
So that would have been cool but it's OK I've
gotten some of the bonus stuff in the past.

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:56.540
So I'm guessing it's not my turn yet.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.379
Although they say it's like randomly chosen,
but I'm sure it would be unlikely for me to

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:01.379
get it twice in one year.

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.419
So yeah, that was this quarter's Quarterly
box.

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.879
If you have any questions about any of the
stuff I got, feel free to leave a comment

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:07.879
down below.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.569
As usual there is a link down below explaining
what the Quarterly box is and if you want

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.900
to subscribe, there'll be a link to that as
well.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.329
If you've read either of these books, feel
free to leave a comment about it down below,

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.900
let me know what you thought of them or if
you've heard anything about them.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.459
So yeah, that's all I have for now and thanks
for watching.
