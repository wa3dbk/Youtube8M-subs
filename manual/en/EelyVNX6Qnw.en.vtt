00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.370
Toda on our 2013 For Explorer well install
the Curt hitch part number C13100.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.320
This is what our hitch will look like once
its installed.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.070
Next well go ahead and give you a couple of
measurements to assist you with selecting

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.900
accessories for your new hitch.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.580
From the center of the hitch pin hole to the
outer most edge of the bumper is four and

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.580
three-quarter inches.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.180
From the top of the receiver tube to the ground
is 16 and a quarter inches.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.720
This will assist you with selecting accessories
such as a drawbar, a bike rack, or a cargo

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.720
carrier.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.810
Now lets go ahead with installation.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.220
First before we can install the hitch well
need to lower the exhaust.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:50.480
Well remove the three rearmost rubber isolators
from the metal hangers of the exhaust.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.530
To lower the exhaust well first put a safety
strap underneath the exhaust so that once

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.080
we remove the hangers we can safely lower
the exhaust without damaging anything further

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:12.260
up the line near the engine.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:02:01.590
Well spray each 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:03:15.080
isolator 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:33.320
and 
then 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:58.930
use 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:05:19.469
a pry 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.720
bar to remove it.
