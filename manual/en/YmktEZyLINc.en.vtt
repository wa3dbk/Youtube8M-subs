00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:09.490
Question often comes up as to how much restoration
work should be done on a vintage instrument

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:18.390
and how do you go about finding someone to
do the work. This particular example here

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:27.789
is an 1946 Martin D Twenty-eight herringbone.
This is the last year that this particular

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:38.180
model had the herringbone purfling around
the top. This guitar is made with Brazilian

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:52.620
rosewood and it has the zigzag back strip
on it. Has all the right appointments, but

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.420
as can be seen on this one, theres a lot of
wear around the pick guard a lot of pick marks

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:10.130
across the top both above and below the sound
hole. The lower part of the sound hole is

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:20.260
literally worn away from heavy pick strumming.
Some people would want to have this completely

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:28.270
restored back to the original. But a lot of
the original guitars that were played too

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:39.120
hard and worn away like this are endeared
in the hearts of collectors. some collectors

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:47.330
are all about the originality, some are about
the quality and they want a near flawless

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:56.980
instrument. Just a matter of personal opinion
as to which one is more desirable and how

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:05.310
much should be done to change what has been
seen as playing wear to this instrument over

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.450
time. This is not really considered abuse.
It's considered playing wear. Some people

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:20.450
would see this wear and think that it's very
unattractive and they would want to have this

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:29.099
guitar refinished. If you do that, if you
take this original lacquer on this instrument

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:35.239
and refinish it even though it looks better
and this area right here the sound hole gets

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:42.650
replaced and patched in, you have devalued
this instrument by fifty percent. And when

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:51.099
you are talking about a guitar that say is
worth twenty thousand dollars and you devalue

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.970
it by half, that's a lot.
