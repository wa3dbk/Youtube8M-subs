A Level Biology: Enzymes 2 – Induced Fit
and Lock &amp; Key Theories

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.330
Hi!

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.330
Welcome to my second video on the series about
Enzymes.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.860
Today, we are going to be looking at Induced
fit and the Lock-and-key hypothesis.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.730
The last time, we looked at a few key terms
and so one of the first ones was anabolic

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.730
reaction.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.470
In an anabolic reaction, enzymes are used
to bring substrate molecules together for

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.120
form bonds between them.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.670
In a catabolic one, they do the opposite of
that.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:36.050
They break bonds between molecules and therefore,
they are used to break things down.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.020
The Lock-and-key hypothesis assumes that the
active site of the enzyme is rigid in shape.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.440
This is our enzyme and this is the section
where the substrate will bond is called the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.440
active site.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.360
It is the bit where all enzymes bond to substrates.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.540
It used to be the case where we thought that
these active sites were rigid and therefore,

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.260
didn’t change their shape at all.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.750
So only a very, very specific-shaped substrate
could fit in.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.980
But current tests have shown and from looking
at other top forms of data, we found that

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.420
doesn’t always necessary ring true.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.860
The best current hypothesis or the best current
idea that we have for this is called the Induced

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.960
fit hypothesis.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.750
That’s where the active site could be flexible
and so what will happen is our substrate will

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.590
bond in and in this case, this an anabolic
reaction.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.220
What will happen is the active site will physically
change shape to suit the shape of the substrate

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.140
and hence, the induced fit.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.800
What will happen when the enzyme leaves the
active site, the enzyme will revert back to

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.200
its inactive state.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.940
For a run of that again, you’ve got essentially
an Induced Fit hypothesis whereby the active

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.440
site doesn’t necessarily fit the shape of
the substrate.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.710
In an anabolic reaction here, what happens
is the active site will basically fit around

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.009
it and therefore it is an induced fit.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.890
Then once the substrate leaves, it reverts
back to its original shape.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.870
This diagram here shows us an example of an
enzyme Lipase.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.290
Lipase breaks down fats.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.430
The active site of this is specifically down
to the tertiary structure of the protein.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.740
It is the folding in from the secondary structure
that gives this a very, very specific shape.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.010
Initially, it is the order of amino acids
and then the secondary structure and how that

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.730
folds in to form a tertiary structure that
means only certain substrates could fit.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.980
This is very, very specific when alone you
break down certain types of fat.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.480
If you want an enzyme to break down protein
or proteate, then that will have a slightly

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.190
different active side and will have a very
different tertiary structure.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.290
Some of the important things to do with enzymes:
They only change the rate of reaction.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.690
Rate means how quickly it is happening.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.630
They don’t change the equilibrium or the
end-products.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.430
They have no effect on the type of product
that is made.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:19.190
For instance, if you have the breakdown of
starch into glucose, the enzyme won’t change

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.349
the actual end-product.

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.819
It will only speed up the reaction and they’re
specific to one particular reaction.

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.640
This is down to their specific tertiary structure.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.170
They are present in very, very small amounts
due to high molecular activity and that means

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.730
you need a very, very small amount of them
to get this huge marked effect.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.400
This value here, the turn-over number is a
number of substrate molecules transferred

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.709
per minute by one enzyme molecule.

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.650
In this case, this is Catalase; amongst the
quickest enzymes we know.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.569
It is made by the liver and this should be
6x106.

00:03:52.569 --> 00:04:01.400
They are basically 6 followed by 6 so that’s
6,000,000 per minute, which is a staggering

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.459
number.

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.709
If you join me on the next video, we will
be looking at the rates of reaction and how

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.700
enzymes can be affected by different conditions.
