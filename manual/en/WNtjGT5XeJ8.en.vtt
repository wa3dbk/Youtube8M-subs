Hi this is Larry Crane, the director of the
Release Technique. It’s a technique of getting

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.600
rid of negativity on the spot. And it’s
so critical, particularly what’s going on

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.689
now, today. You see what’s happening on
television in Alabama, with this tornadoes

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:26.439
that hit all over the west, and it’s devastating
cities. Now recently, we have one of our teachers,

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:33.780
Rebecca who lived in New Orleans during Hurricane
Katrina and her house was the only house that

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.640
wasn’t destroyed for miles around. Not a
wood had dropped there. We’ve had other

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.670
graduates in Houston, Texas with cyclones
hitting. Nothing happened to the house. We’ve

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.840
had hurricanes hitting in Florida with our
graduates. Nothing happened, no water damage,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.190
no windows broken, nothing.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.710
Now, how is that possible? Well, it’s simple.
If you freak out, you get out of harmony with

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.859
Mother Nature. And when a disaster befalls
us, we usually freak out and get negative

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.500
and then you pull negativity at you. When
you pull negativity at you, you’re causing

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.030
negativity to happen for you.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.409
That make sense? Garbage in, garbage out.
So we have a technique of showing you how

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.060
to get rid of the negativity. Very simply
it comes in cds, seventeen of them. Comes

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.850
with a money back guarantee, comes with free
coaching and you could go to www.releasetechnique.com

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.399
But let me give you a little sample of what
I’m talking about. If you have fear, you

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:38.270
can get rid of the fear. Now, just think about
a natural disaster coming towards you, a tornado,

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.189
alright? Now check the fear that you have
inside you and measure it. Is it from a zero

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.700
to ten, ten being the most fearful and zero
being the least fearful, where would you be?

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.280
Just check.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.409
Okay, now I can show you how to get rid of
the fear but you’re gonna have to do something

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.810
totally different than you’re used to doing.
Are you willing to do that? Okay, all I need

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.270
you to do is say yes to the fear. Why yes?
Could you just say yes to the fear and see

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.521
what happens. And could you just say “yes”
to the fear once more. And could you say “yes”

00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:14.110
some more? And could you say “yes” even
more? And more? Now from a scale of zero to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.700
ten with ten being the most fearful and zero
being the least fearful, where would you be

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.620
now?

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.921
And could you say “yes” to the fear some
more? And could you say “yes” to the fear

00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:28.870
some more? And just say “yes” some more…a
little bit more. Now from a scale of zero

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.530
to ten with ten being the most fearful and
zero being the least fearful, where would

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.340
you be now? Take a check.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.730
Okay then this may probably surprise you but
this “fear” really wants to leave. So

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.980
go ahead and just ask the fear if it wants
to leave. It sounds silly, but try it. Go

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.700
ahead and ask fear if it wants to leave. Chances
are, it’s saying “yes”.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.690
It needs permission for you to let that fear
go. It’s your feelings, it’s your fear.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.019
So look at the fear and say to the fear, “I
love you, I really love you and I give you

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.150
permission to leave.”

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.280
Now from a scale of zero to ten with ten the
most fearful and zero the least fearful, where

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.200
would you be. Right? Chances are, it dropped.
Okay?

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.230
Now go ahead and ask the fear if it wants
to leave…the remaining fear. And just say

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:29.629
to it, “I really, really love you and I
give you permission to leave.” Okay, now

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.060
on a scale from zero to ten with ten being
the most fearful and zero being the least

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.060
fearful, check where you’re at. Okay?

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.610
So what I’d like you to do is to get rid
of the negativity, and you can do that with

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:51.680
the Release Technique. So be smart. Get in
harmony with Mother Nature and be happy, and

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.879
healthy and safe.
