Could you ever imagine an online game being so addictive

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.000
as to keep players interested for hours every night

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.000
about 45.000 Greek players in front of their PC monitor?

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.000
Indeed, Lineage II has even created "fights" between Greek cities

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.000
as there is a great competition going on right now in 400 iCafes 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.000
throughout the country

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.000
"Your goal is to be in a clan and conquer a castle

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.000
"and become a hero"

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.000
"A magical world that pins you to your seat

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.000

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.000
are the elements of success of the online game Lineage II,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.000
which even created rivalries between Greek cities 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.000
as there was a big competition in 400 Greek iCafes."

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.000
"There are fights between players and rival groups

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.000
in the fight to build a better clan and win in a virtual fight"

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.000
"Lineage II players are over 11.000.000 worldwide

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.000
while in Greece, the game's fans are over 45.000.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.000
Each Internet warrior stays in the game for about 8 months."

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.000
"What is the most you have stayed in the game- A party, 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.000
that is  12 hours, from 12 at night until 12 the next morning"

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.000
"Goal of the game is to raise the level of each 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.000
of the 7 characters you can create, create factions with 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.000
other clans, siege castles, act as a mercenary, 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.000
or travel in the game's vast world helping other players

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.000
and killing monsters."

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.000
"In this particular game participate thousands

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.000
or even millions of people, in a virtual world and the goal

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.000
is to create a character, like a mage or a warrior, 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.000
and make him as strong as you can."

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.000
"Our goal was not to find the best player in the game

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.000
but to invite the players to experience 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.000
the new game Update."

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.000

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.000
not only did they had the chance to play the game for free

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
but also won many high value prizes."
