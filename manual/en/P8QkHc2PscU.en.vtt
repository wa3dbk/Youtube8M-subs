Hi! My name is Yvette Parish, and thank you
for visiting expertvillage.com. I am here

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.240
at Cynergy Dance Studio in San Antonio, Texas
with my beautiful model Kerry. We’re going

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.949
to be talking about moisturizers for different
skin types, doing a beautiful makeover on

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:21.430
her, discussing eyelashes, the different eyelash
curlers, and proper eyebrow placement in the

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.340
makeup. I’m going to be applying her eyeliner
now, and I’m using a dark color. You have

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.020
a couple of choices with your eyeliner. You
can use a pencil, which will give it a nice

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.800
smooth line; it’s quick and easy. Everyone’s
seen a pencil. You can take your brush and

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.280
you can grab some color on your brush and
apply it from the brush here. There’s a

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.010
lot of different ways, but since this is natural
look, what I’m going to do is take a dark

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:01.260
pencil and brush and I’m going to apply
it on her upper lid. If you see, I’m slightly

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:10.860
lifting up her lid to get super, super close
to the lashes. The closer you get to the lashes

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.610
the more natural it looks and it actually
opens up your eyes and makes your lashes look

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.760
thicker. So, if you spend just a little extra
time on your eyeliner, it’s make a big difference.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:31.780
I’m going to take that same style of applying
it and I’m going to apply it to her lower

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.850
lashes. Any time you use a brush you have
much more control over your makeup. If you

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.560
have a big pencil and you’re trying to apply
it, now it really depends how sharp it is,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.700
how close you can get into the eye. I find
that with a brush you really have more control.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.171
You can apply it as light or as dark as you
want, and I’m going to apply it very, very

00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:20.730
close to her lashes. I’m kind of lifting
up her lid just to get in there.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:31.450
This is a soft black color, which is looking
like a dark brown on. Okay, open….alright,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.581
look up at the ceiling. So, now I’m going
to go ahead and add a little bit more in her

00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:47.000
corners, just so that she has a little bit
of a smoky look on the sides. Sometimes if

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.750
you’re blonde and you’re very fair, you
can kind of lose your eyelashes and your eyebrows

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.209
in it because everything is so fair. That’s
why it’s very important to fill in your

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.300
eyebrows, and very important to use a dark
enough eyeliner. If you’re using a too light

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.940
eyeliner, you’re not going to do anything
for your eyes. Look up.
