00:00:07.408 --> 00:00:11.956
Hi how are you doing, Justin here again
and we're starting stage 3.

00:00:11.956 --> 00:00:15.076
And as usual we're starting off with a look at a new chord,

00:00:15.076 --> 00:00:19.074
and the chord that we're gonna be doing in this video
is the G chord.

00:00:19.074 --> 00:00:23.559
A G chord is a little bit stretchy compared to
the other chords that we've looked at so far.

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:27.321
It got notes on opposites sides of the neck to each other

00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:31.181
and personally I found G chord really really hard
when I was learning.

00:00:31.181 --> 00:00:34.124
I was only pretty little when I was learning
and my fingers were pretty short.

00:00:34.124 --> 00:00:38.508
But it's still possible no matter how little you are,
it's still possible to play a G chord,

00:00:38.508 --> 00:00:40.765
but it is gonna be a little bit stretchy.

00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:45.008
So let's get to a close up and have a look at this new chord.

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:50.117
Okay, so here's the close look at our G chord.

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:55.021
And as you can see we've got this bit of a strech here
between the second and third finger.

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:57.177
That's the nasty bit I was talking about there.

00:00:57.177 --> 00:01:02.256
So it's not too hard, but it's a fairly difficult chord
when you first start,

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:03.692
at least I found it was.

00:01:03.692 --> 00:01:06.217
So let's go through one bit at a time.

00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:12.088
First of all: first finger, second fret, fifth string,
not particularly difficult that one,

00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:17.326
reaching over now, second finger, third fret, sixth string,

00:01:17.326 --> 00:01:21.069
now making sure that's nice and round
and that you're using the fingertip.

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:23.557
If it's too flat, you'll be muting all the strings.

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:31.542
And then here with the third finger is having to go down
on the thinnest string at the third fret.

00:01:31.542 --> 00:01:34.125
Now there's quite a few common problems with this one.

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:37.717
First of all, a lot of people have trouble with
positioning that third finger.

00:01:37.717 --> 00:01:42.120
They're either like this, where it's too round
and the finger is kind of pushing down.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.038
That's gonna be pushing the string off
and the fingernails are gonna be getting in the way.

00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:50.542
The solution here is bringing those knuckles
back around a little bit,

00:01:50.542 --> 00:01:55.108
so they're back underneath the fingerboard a little bit more,
that should straighten that finger up.

00:01:55.108 --> 00:01:58.359
At the same time it's very important
that this one is round enough

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:01.593
not to be muting all of those notes underneath,

00:02:01.593 --> 00:02:05.115
because we really need to be getting
those three strings in the middle open.

00:02:05.115 --> 00:02:09.787
So making sure that it's not this, that's the other
common thing, it's this finger being too flat

00:02:09.787 --> 00:02:12.638
So make sure that's nice and round.

00:02:12.638 --> 00:02:15.052
Now if we go through and play one note at a time,

00:02:15.052 --> 00:02:16.852
as you know that you should when you pratice,

00:02:16.867 --> 00:02:17.679
. . .

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.244
first note shouldn't be a problem.

00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:21.873
I can't imagine why you might have a trouble with that note.

00:02:21.873 --> 00:02:22.640
. . .

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.976
Second note:

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.768
Sometimes this is a problem
because the second finger here

00:02:27.768 --> 00:02:31.326
is touching the fifth string just at that point.

00:02:31.326 --> 00:02:34.869
So that's quite common for that to be happening,
but it's not right.

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:39.039
You need to get that second finger rounder
to free up that fifth string.

00:02:39.547 --> 00:02:40.919
Now the next string,

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.065
. . .

00:02:42.065 --> 00:02:43.273
the D string,

00:02:43.273 --> 00:02:44.295
if it sounds like this,

00:02:44.295 --> 00:02:46.240
. . .

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.585
and it's not ringing out properly,

00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:50.521
it's cause the underneath of the first finger is to blame.

00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:54.617
So again you need to get the first finger
working on to its tip a little bit more.

00:02:54.617 --> 00:02:56.895
. . .

00:02:56.895 --> 00:02:58.956
G and the B strings are usually okay with this chord,

00:02:58.956 --> 00:03:00.055
. . .

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:03.124
and then we've just got to make sure that that note is good.

00:03:03.124 --> 00:03:08.363
Some people for some reason try
and put their third finger right back far away from the fret.

00:03:08.363 --> 00:03:11.221
I don't exactly know what causes that,
but it's definitely not a good idea.

00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:15.075
But if you remember me talking before
about trying to lift up this part of your hand

00:03:15.075 --> 00:03:18.028
and kind of twisting your palm that way,

00:03:18.028 --> 00:03:20.210
that can help, if you think of that a little bit

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.762
to try and keep your fingers nice and round.

00:03:25.485 --> 00:03:27.985
Well, I hope you have fun playing G.

00:03:27.985 --> 00:03:29.442
It definitely was a struggle for me,

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:31.357
but it's a really really used chord.

00:03:31.357 --> 00:03:35.322
It's one of the five most basic shapes on guitar,

00:03:35.322 --> 00:03:36.825
one that you really can't avoid.

00:03:36.825 --> 00:03:38.991
So spend a bit of time working on that G chord,

00:03:38.991 --> 00:03:41.021
it really is a cool one.

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:43.288
There's quite a few different ways of playing G

00:03:43.288 --> 00:03:46.174
that you may have already seen from other people

00:03:46.174 --> 00:03:48.610
or other courses or you've seen your friends
playing another way.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.342
I'm gonna go through that in one of the later stages,

00:03:51.342 --> 00:03:54.738
I'll show you all of the different variations
of playing an open G chord.

00:03:54.738 --> 00:03:57.522
But this is really the one that I would recommend
that you start off with.

00:03:57.522 --> 00:04:00.699
There are other facts that I don't wanna go into

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.801
that make it kind of a really good one to learn.

00:04:03.801 --> 00:04:05.129
In fact now I'm gonna go into it,

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.691
it makes... it helps you develop your stretch
between your second and third finger.

00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:12.965
If you try and do a G chord with two notes on the thin string,

00:04:12.965 --> 00:04:16.931
it kind of means you're not
getting as good as stretch in between those fingers.

00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:20.292
So try and stick to this way of playing the G chord for now

00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:22.426
and we will be covering the other ones later.

00:04:22.426 --> 00:04:25.696
So now on to the last difficult open chord.

00:04:25.696 --> 00:04:28.424
The last of the big eight which is the C chord.

00:04:28.424 --> 00:04:29.976
And that's even stretchier.
