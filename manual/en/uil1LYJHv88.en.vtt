Hi! My name is Shawna on behalf of Expert
Village. In this clip, we are going to talk

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.160
about seam rippers and how you can use those.
Again, there are lots of different types of

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.820
seam rippers: the basic seam ripper that probably
came in your sewing machine. These are actually

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:30.869
one of my favorites because they are tiny
and easy to use. This is just a simple inexpensive

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.650
seam ripper that is really nice to have also.
This is another one of my favorites by Clover.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:47.860
Because of its heavy base, it is just really
nice to use—kind of a big fat, heavy base.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:57.670
I am going to show you an easy way to use
a seam ripper, and I am just going to start

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:06.360
off by picking up one of the threads out.
You notice that I am not clipping it all the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.869
way down, which I can do and I could turn
it over and pull the one thread all the way.

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:17.520
But when you are working with a lot of stitches
or quilting, when you are taking out quilt

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.119
stitches, if you actually hold this thread
and then you just clip the bottom thing…

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.329
I’m going to do it the other way: I’m
going to hold the top thread. I’m just going

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:38.359
to grab the bottom loop that has been pulled
through, clip that, pull it again and clip

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:43.469
that. Then you are not running the risk of
cutting a hole in the fabric, which I am sure

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:54.780
everyone has done before. You just clip that
loop and keep pulling it, and makes it really

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.189
easy and really clean to cut that off. Of
course, the other way that I was just talking

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:15.600
about, is putting it in between the seam with
the red ball down, and then running it and

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.581
holding the backside—running it like this—but
you do run the risk of cutting the fabric

00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:27.180
and cutting a hole in it. So there are lots
of different ways and lots of different uses

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.620
for these, but you definitely have to have
these in your basic sewing tools.
