00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.813
- EVERY YEAR IN BLOOMFIELD,
WE DO VISION SCREENINGS.

00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:08.132
WE'RE 100% BEHIND IMPROVING THE
VISION AND HEALTH OF CHILDREN.

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.900
- WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL
TO THE LIONS CLUB BECAUSE

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.092
THIS DETECTS PROBLEMS
THAT MAY NOT BE DETECTABLE

00:00:16.092 --> 00:00:17.600
THROUGH YOUR TYPICAL SCREENING.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.934
- FACE THE CAMERA.

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:21.867
- WITHIN 30 SECONDS OF TAKING
AN IMAGE, WE CAN DETERMINE IF

00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:24.533
THE CHILD IS REFERRED FOR
FURTHER TESTING OR HAS PASSED.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.700
- HI, BRIANNA.
CAN YOU COME IN

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.000
SO WE CAN TAKE YOUR PICTURE?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.934
- SO THE MORNING OF
THE LIONS CLUB'S SCREENING,

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:31.800
I MYSELF ALMOST FORGOT TO SIGN
THE PERMISSION SLIPS.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.200
- BRIANNA WAS ONE OF OUR KIDS
THAT WAS SCREENED LAST YEAR

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.000
WHERE WE GOT
AN IRREGULAR RESULT.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.100
- WE RECEIVED OUR LETTER
FROM THE LIONS CLUB

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.266
STATING THAT BRIANNA

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:44.166
NEEDED TO BE SEEN BY
A PROFESSIONAL EYE DOCTOR.

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.944
WE DIDN'T REALLY
THINK ANYTHING OF IT.

00:00:45.944 --> 00:00:48.270
SO WE MADE THE APPOINTMENT
3 WEEKS LATER.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.834
BRI, HOW MANY FINGERS
DO I HAVE UP?

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:53.066
TWO WEEKS AFTER THE EYE
SCREENING WAS DONE,

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:56.266
WE NOTICED THAT
HER VISION WAS BLURRED.

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.300
YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING
OUT OF THAT EYE?

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.200
WE WENT INTO OUR APPOINTMENT
AND THE DOCTOR HAD TOLD US

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.967
THAT HER RETINA WAS
COMPLETELY DETACHED.

00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:07.100
THAT AFTERNOON WE WERE
ABLE TO GET IN CONTACT

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.066
WITH A RETINA SPECIALIST
AND BE SEEN.

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:13.400
- THEY WANTED MORE TESTS DONE,
SO WE ENDED UP IN EMERGENCY.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.767
- OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS, WE HAD
AN MRI DONE, A CAT SCAN DONE.

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:20.667
- IT WAS A TUMOR
OR COATES DISEASE.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:23.934
ONE OF OUR QUESTIONS WAS IF WE
COULD DO A BIOPSY ON THE EYE.

00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:26.600
AND THE PROBLEM WAS THE CANCER
COULD SPREAD IMMEDIATELY.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.367
SO EXTRACTION WAS
OUR ONLY OPTION.

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:31.567
- IT WAS DEVASTATING,

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:34.767
KNOWING THAT WHAT WE WERE
ABOUT TO DO TO OUR DAUGHTER.

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:36.877
YOU KNOW, I MEAN--
WE WERE SAVING HER LIFE

00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:40.500
BUT ALSO MAKING A HUGE
DIFFERENCE FOR HER.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.500
SO WE STOOD IN
THE MIDDLE OF HER ROOM

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.166
AND JUST HELD EACH OTHER
AND CRIED.

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.860
- THE EMOTIONS
WERE RUNNING SO HIGH.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.266
IT'S A DIFFICULT DECISION
TO MAKE AS A PARENT.

00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:53.200
AND UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU MAY
BE MAKING THE WRONG DECISION

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.607
IF IT'S NOT CANCER.

00:01:54.607 --> 00:01:56.880
- WE DECIDED TO
MOVE FORWARD IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.127
TIME WAS NOT ON OUR SIDE.

00:01:58.127 --> 00:01:59.266
- LOVE YOU!

00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:02.033
- SHE WOULD BE THE
FIRST SURGERY THE NEXT MORNING.

00:02:09.317 --> 00:02:11.393
THE ONLY THING THAT
SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT

00:02:11.393 --> 00:02:13.734
WAS GRADUATING WITH HER
KINDERGARTEN FRIENDS.

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:17.934
- SHE ENTERED THE SCHOOL
WITH A BIG SMILE ON HER FACE

00:02:17.934 --> 00:02:21.033
AND WENT ABOUT HER DAY AS IF
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:24.533
- BRIANNA
IS A ONE-OF-A-KIND KID.

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:27.166
SHE'S VERY RESILIENT.
SHE'S VERY SPECIAL.

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:29.767
- A WEEK AFTER SURGERY,
THE LEITTENS LEARNED

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:33.600
THEY HAD MADE THE RIGHT
DECISION--IT WAS CANCER.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.433
FORTUNATELY, IT HADN'T SPREAD.

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:36.633
- IT SHOCKED ME.

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:38.470
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
SOMEBODY'LL FIND

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.700
A CHILDHOOD CATARACT.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.433
BUT CANCEROUS TUMOR WAS
SOMETHING ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT.

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:45.667
IT REALLY OPENED OUR EYES
AS TO HOW BENEFICIAL

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:48.247
THIS PROGRAM REALLY IS.

00:02:48.247 --> 00:02:49.967
- THEY SAVED OUR
LITTLE GIRL'S LIFE.

00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:53.166
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE LIONS
CLUB, SHE MAY NOT BE HERE TODAY.

00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:55.467
- THE BLOOMFIELD LIONS
ALSO HELPED PAY

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:57.333
FOR BRIANNA'S PROSTHETIC EYE.

00:02:57.333 --> 00:02:59.100
IT WASN'T COVERED BY INSURANCE.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.386
- THEY POLISHED IT
ALL UP AND PUT IT IN HER EYE

00:03:01.386 --> 00:03:04.467
AND THEN WHEN WE GOT OUTSIDE,
SHE STARTED DANCING.

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:07.900
- I GOT MY EYE.
I GOT MY EYE.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.066
- SHE WAS VERY HAPPY.

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:11.834
WE WERE VERY HAPPY
AND LIFE WAS GOOD AGAIN.

00:03:13.834 --> 00:03:15.567
- THE LEITTENS
MADE IT THEIR MISSION

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:17.433
TO GIVE BACK TO THE LIONS.

00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:19.333
THROUGH FUNDRAISERS
LIKE THIS ONE,

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:22.433
THEY HELPED THE BLOOMFIELD CLUB
PURCHASE THEIR OWN CAMERA

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:24.867
SO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE
TO BORROW ONE IN THE FUTURE.

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:26.487
- INCREASING
THE NUMBER OF CAMERAS

00:03:26.487 --> 00:03:29.266
AND THE NUMBER OF LIONS
TRAINED ON USING THOSE CAMERAS

00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:31.900
MEANS WE CAN SCREEN MORE KIDS
AND HOPEFULLY PREVENT

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.000
MORE VISION ISSUES FROM BEING
PERMANENT FOR THE CHILDREN.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.467
- SINCE BRIANNA,
WE'VE GONE UP 400%

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:41.200
IN CHILDREN HAVING
THEIR VISION SCREENED.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.066
IT'S REALLY HER EXPERIENCE
THAT HAS GOTTEN

00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:46.500
MORE PARENTS AND KIDS ON BOARD.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.066
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY...

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:50.600
- YOU NEED
TO LIVE EVERY MOMENT

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.333
AS THOUGH IT'S
YOUR LAST MOMENT.

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:54.066
YOUR LIFE CAN CHANGE
IN A HEARTBEAT.

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:55.767
AND OURS DID A YEAR AGO.

00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:57.867
IT'S DEFINITELY
MADE US STRONGER.

00:03:57.867 --> 00:03:59.633
BRIANNA HAS TOUCHED
A LOT OF LIVES.

00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:02.467
AND HOPEFULLY SHE WILL HAVE
SAVED A LOT OF LIVES.

00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:05.600
- EVERY DAY, I
LOOK AT HER AND I WANT TO CRY.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.934
BUT EVERY DAY, I LOOK AT HER
AND I WANT TO SMILE,

00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:10.433
BECAUSE SHE BRINGS A LOT OF
HAPPY THOUGHTS TO US.

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:12.667
I EXPECT THAT KID TO BE HAPPY
HER WHOLE LIFE.

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:14.096
THAT'S WHAT I REALLY WANT.

00:04:14.096 --> 00:04:15.600
AND THAT'S WHAT I HOPE FOR HER.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.333
- THANK YOU, LIONS.
