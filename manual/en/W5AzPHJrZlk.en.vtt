00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.920
Welcome to this film about self-aligning bearing systems

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.470
In this film you will learn about self-aligning
bearing systems, and how a CARB toroidal bearing

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.490
can further improve performance. 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.780
Since 1907, SKF has invented all self-aligning roller bearings.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.660
We will present a number of applications
where SKF can help.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.360
Often, deep groove ball bearings are an appropriate solution. 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.560
But in some cases they also need to accommodate misalignment.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.200
To cope with this, design engineers use a conventional self-aligning bearing system

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.940
consisting of two self-aligning ball or spherical roller bearings.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.079
This is a conventional self-aligning bearing system

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.540
with two spherical roller bearings.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.280
They take heavy loads

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.000
and accommodate misalignment.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.280
In operation, shaft temperature rises above that of the housing.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.340
The non-locating bearing
must slide in the housing. But, forces required

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.340
to overcome friction, will induce additional
loads, vibrations and increase operating temperature.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.340
Sliding of the bearing can cause wear and
fretting corrosion. 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.580
This will induce high axial loads and eventually cause failure.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.240
To solve these issues SKF invented the CARB bearing.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.000
It supports high loads and accommodates
misalignment.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.360
 It also allows axial displacement within the bearing with virtually zero friction.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.520
The SKF self-aligning system has a spherical

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:55.069
roller bearing in the locating position and
a CARB bearing in the non-locating position.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.140
It is capable of accommodating misalignment

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.500
allows frictionless axial displacement,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.200
and prevents fretting corrosion.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.440
The CARB bearing is interchangeable with a spherical roller bearing.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.720
In this fan, the SKF self-aligning bearing system

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.969
helps the customer to reduce vibrations,

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:36.069
noise levels, and can double service intervals.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.580
In this conveyor pulley, the SKF self-aligning

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.650
bearing system gives increased reliability
and less unplanned stops.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.260
In wind turbines it can reduce the weight
of the nacelle by up to two tonnes,

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.580
enabling a weight reduction of up to 20 tonnes in the
tower.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.140
With the SKF self-aligning system, design
engineers are able to 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.940
optimize design, downsize, avoid fretting corrosion and increase robustness.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.240
It fits in SKF standard bearing housings.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.700
CARB bearings are available for shaft diameters
from 20mm to 2 meters. 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.340
Sealed bearings are also available.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.200
Not so long ago, compromise was a part of every bearing system

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.180
 that had to accommodate
axial expansion of the shaft. 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.220
The CARB bearing developed by SKF changed that.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.740
Today, the SKF self-aligning bearing system with a spherical

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.400
roller and a CARB bearing can help your machines
to run smoother, with less vibration, less

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.290
friction and with reduced need for maintenance.
