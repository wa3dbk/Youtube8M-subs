00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.480
Have a look at this perfect value tower
from the folks at Acer.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.250
It's the Acer Aspire M3201
good sort of, mid level specs,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.260
perfect for an extra computer, 
maybe full time computer, really,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.500
if you don't need 
gobs and gobs of power.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.560
AMD Athlon Dual Core processor.
2.5 GHz, 4 GB of DDR2 RAM,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.250
Vista Home Premium 64-bit Edition
is pre-installed.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.340
It has a 640 GB hard drive.
It's got DVDRW on board.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.640
And, it's got integrated graphics, 
but good integrated graphics.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.540
Radeon HD 3200 is what you're 
going to find inside here.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.220
And, of course, 
4 GB of DDR2 RAM.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.520
Let's go ahead and
show this whole thing off

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.020
so you know exactly what's going on 
before you decide to buy this thing.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.060
Up top is where you're going to find all of
your USB ports, headphones,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.600
microphones, all of that stuff
is running along the top bezel here.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.230
Your optical drive is found right underneath
here. Of course, it does have Labelflash,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.740
which means you're going to be able to flip
Labelflash compatible DVDs over

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.410
and burn labels directly on to them.
You have a free bay right here.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.880
And of course, below this little window here
is where you're going to find

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.450
another USB port, Firewire 
and your card reader.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.120
It's like XD,  SD, Memory Stick, 
Compact Flash, all that stuff

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.890
located right behind 
this little, secret door here.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:40.100
Now, around back, check it out.
You've got your two PS2 ports, right here.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.070
You've got HDMI which is great for being able
to hook up to your HDMI compatible monitor

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.440
or even your big screen TV.
You do have a VGA port, as well,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.960
More Firewire on the back.
Four more USB ports.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.390
You've got your LAN port right here,
surround sound, and right down here

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.660
is, of course, the venerable modem, 
which, for whatever reason,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.530
has yet to go away.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.720
I don't even know anybody that 
has an actual phone line anymore.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.100
But they're still there, 
in case you need them.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.370
Let's take a look at the inside. 
Easy to get into.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.970
Tool-less design, simply push this down,
pull it off, and you're in the case.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.340
Very simple case, you're going to find.
Tool-less case though, which is very nice.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.330
So you're gonig to be able to install all 
of your drives without having to deal with

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.960
any screws or anything like that.
Down inside  you see

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.480
our processor is right here.
You got a couple of free DIMM slots

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.710
which is nice if you want to 
expand the memory.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.830
Right now it's 4 GB on board.
Very easily expandable because you've got

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.590
the free space there. 
Down here is your modem.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.220
You do have a couple 
of standard PCI slots,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.740
as well as a PCI x1 and x16 slot
available inside the case.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.470
And right back here, you can see, 
I got plenty of free SATA ports

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.070
in there as well for expansion.
So, that's what's nice about this system,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.750
is take a look at the inside you'll see
that there is tons and tons of room

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.720
to expand this thing 
and add on to it.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.970
And of course, considering we're starting
from such a reasonable price as it is,

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.230
perfect little starting system, 
right here.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.500
Inexpensive, all the features 
you're going to need.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.430
And of course, 
the Radion 3200 Graphics,

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.330
good enough to play games,
good enough to do

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.600
most anything 
you want to do.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.930
Of course, it's not going to be
nearly the fastest out there,

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.080
but it's gonna get it done.
So, go check this one out.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.170
It's the Acer Aspire M3201.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.140
