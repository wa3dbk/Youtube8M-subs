Colin Evans: Professional Building Supplies
was set up as a specialist builder’s merchant

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.630
as opposed to a generalist.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.830
That means we specialise in certain areas
of the building trade, namely guttering, above

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.900
and below ground drainage, PVC fascia, plumbing
and ventilation products.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.210
Well the benefit of being a specialist as
opposed to a generalist is that we hold a

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.649
great depth of stock.

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.280
To give an example of this we currently hold
33 different styles of guttering in stock

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.809
and all the fittings to go with it.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.449
At any one point in time we would hold around
about 2,000 length of gutter.

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.819
That enables us to turn orders around in a
24 hour time frame.

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:55.719
So if customers place an order with us before
12 noon on any given day, we'll get that order

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.999
picked, patched and dispatched that same day
on an overnight carrier and should be with

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:01.990
the customer on their site the next working
day.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.640
Spencer Priestley: We've got a team of very
experienced individuals at Professional Building

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.880
Supplies who are always happy to give as much
technical advice or assistance in choosing

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.200
the right products for your project irrelevant
if you're a builder of years of experience

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.970
or DIY on a first time project.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.420
Colin Evans: Very easy in the building trade
to forget that you've got the knowledge and

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.939
that perhaps the people that are buying your
products have never used them before.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.579
So we do offer an advisory service whether
that's installation or just a few tips and

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.560
hints, we're quite happy to help you out so
give us a call or email us whichever you feel

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.939
more comfortable with.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.030
We are well aware that our customers like
to shop around and of course that's an easy

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.880
thing to do on the internet.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.540
But the one piece of advice that we would
give customers is please, please do ensure

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.359
that you buy a quality product.

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.492
There's nothing more frustrating than being
at the bottom of a drainage trench or at the

00:01:47.492 --> 00:01:53.020
top of a ladder trying to fit a gutter clip
or a drainage seal that isn't fit for purpose.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.179
We're fortunate to enjoy quite a lot of repeat
business; about 15% of our sales are actually

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.710
customers that have bought from us before
so I guess we're doing something right.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.719
We are run by humans and like all humans we
do make mistakes from time to time.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.560
If we do then we give it our best to try and
put it right and to try and make that a more

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.560
of a positive experience for the customer.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.302
The other thing that we try to do is to learn
from all of our mistakes so that they don't

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:16.302
happen again.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:19.980
We only sell products that we'd be happy to
have installed in our own houses.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.830
So if it's good enough to go in our house,
it's good enough to go on our shelves.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.880
Our website, the address is www.professionalbuildingsupplies.co.uk
It’s got full online ordering facility but

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.040
for those of you who are more comfortable
on the telephone, we are quite happy to take

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.140
orders over the phone.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.630
The phones are manned between 7:30 and 5 everyday
and until 12 o'clock on a Saturday.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.230
The phone number is 01206 867 500

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.320
If you'd actually rather come and collect
then that's fine as well; we're based on the

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:56.900
Whitehall Industrial Estate in Colchester,
in Essex.
