00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to change

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.799
I want to be full of 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.799
energy in order to meet my friends

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.120
whom I haven't seen for a while

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.230
I want to look on the outside the same as I feel on the inside

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.660
not like my body looks right now

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.970
and I will do everything to achieve this

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.009
finally 8 weeks of Yulya's struggles are over

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.470
the first two weeks were the hardest

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.019
first of all, it's diet, it was hard to get used to 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.919
eat 5 times a day, it was for Yulya

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.159
one of the hardest tasks, because she got used to 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:30.839
not eating at all

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.730
The send thing is that workouts were too hard for Yulya

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.370
Because Yulya

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.730
didn't feel well

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.140
Four more reps, come on

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.890
four, three

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.990
two

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.840
One, good job, stretch

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.290
I feel like a tyrant, I’m telling you

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.100
inhale and exhale

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.720
Left foot, no one is gonna wait for you, come on

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.460
That's all because of the diets she had and thus ruined her health

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.209
Very often she had shortness of breath

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:01.750
She walked out to breath some fresh air

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.960
or just stopped in order to drink

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.770
water

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.460
Super! Take the weights and do lunges, ok?

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.330
Take a break, drink

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.409
it's very important to drink during your workout

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.259
During these 8 weeks we encountered

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.870
One big problem

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.070
I was shocked: Yulya didn't eat anything during 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.030
the whole day

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.619
She didn't snap

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.779
she didn't eat any sweets

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.940
nothing, she just didn't eat

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.150
Really she just didn't understand how much this slows down 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.540
her metabolism

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.240
we made her sandwiches 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.780
I gave her to eat whatever I had 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.200
She is skin and bones now

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.010
Recently she

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.300
lost a lot of weight

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.900
and I fight with her all the time

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.720
because four sizes

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.500
is a lot, she is just skin and bones now

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.940
If we eat five times a day

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.130
You boost you metabolism and your

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.110
digestion becomes better

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.730
You burn fat

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.000
That's why during these 8 weeks she tried to eat

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.270
five times a day

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.520
Yes, she practically forced herself to do it

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.319
She forced herself to eat, but after a week

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.360
She saw results in her size

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.549
and her weight

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.989
and it motivated her

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.899
and she understood how important it is to eat right

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:20.319
At first I was very scared, because

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.419
I was afraid to regain lost weight

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:24.859
I was afraid of getting weight

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:26.239
of my size becoming bigger

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.419
But after I was measured

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.789
I was very happy because my results

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:32.909
became

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.779
better and better

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.769
and workouts were a lot more

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.199
fun for me, I did everything

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:42.119
with enthusiasm

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:45.769
You are smiling, good job, come on

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.989
She works out so much

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.179
I can't even count how many of everything she has

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:52.819
And some, as I always say

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.649
stick climbing

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:56.569
I keep telling her, what's the use?

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.349
She says, look

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.539
I can do an arabesque, look, I can do a split 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:02.979
And I’m standing there with a mop

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:04.709
and look at Yulya

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.389
and I tell her, go eat something, or else you won't even have strength to go to all your dancing classes 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.639
Very often we have to deal with

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.349
fashion that tells us 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.199
to be skinny 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:16.909
We look at magazine covers

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.109
at advertisements and see beautiful girls with beautiful figure

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.549
and we think that we want to look the same 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.159
But just look at yourself in a mirror

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.469
How beautiful you are, how beautiful is your figure

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:29.429
You are one of a kind

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:32.020
and this is what we had to deal with in Yulya's case 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.460
At first she didn't want to look at herself

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.769
in the mirror

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.340
But every week she woke up 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.199
with a smile and started loving herself

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.799
Trust me, when I look at her now

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:43.589
it's a different person 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:47.579
I was standing at the tram stop, waiting for me tram to come

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.409
I was minding my own business

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:50.989
and then I saw a girl 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:51.600
whom I thought I have seen before 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.329
I thought of where I could have seen her 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.899
and then it hit me, it's Yulya

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:57.519
Yulya? She changed so much

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.669
and then I stopped her and told her, “Yulya!”

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.219
She turned around and looked at me

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:05.789
and I started running toward her as if I haven't seen her for a year 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.809
I stated hugging her, saying “Yulya, you changed so much!”

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.880
She started loving herself

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.209
She is a confident girl now, completely different from how she was 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.089
before “ 8 Weeks”

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.549
Good job, we  did it! 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.100
I don't know
