Hi, my name is Denver and I'm a Ventrac
owner and today I'm gonna be blowing

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.930
this area with a Tough Cut. As you can
see a lot of this grass is almost over my

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.949
head and I'm 6 feet tall, but we're gonna
come in with a Ventrac Tough Cut and

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.399
clear all this area out and as you see
behind me

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.630
I got a 30-degree Bank up and down. We're
gonna be mowing that. There's a lot of

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.489
briars. The Tough Cut's one of those
amazing attachments that will clear out

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.450
this brush will take care of brush
that's up to half an inch in diameter so

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.760
it's a really aggressive Tough Cut. Some
of these briars back here there's some

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.469
thorns and it's going to take care of
that and make it passable. Right now I

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.059
can't even walk through this. I like to
mow this area a couple times a year.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.570
I let things grow up so I'm not mowing it
all the time

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.909
and saving some fuel but I like to clear
it out and then my wife and kids can

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.880
enjoy it.
Another amazing thing that Ventrac does

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.220
is it's a great slope mower. The slope
behind me you see there's parts that are

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.119
30 degrees. I'll be using a Ventrac 42:31
turbo diesel tractor and it's got duals

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.680
on it and with that Ventrac turbo diesel
I can mow up and down and actually

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.780
sideways with those duals up to 30
degrees.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.140
Another thing of note: this area is pretty swampy

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.020
and we got a stream coming through 
here and the Ventrac's gonna

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.649
come across here and we're gonna cross
this Creek and not have any issues there

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.000
because the Ventrac's four-wheel-drive
will be able to get in and out of the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.880
swampy area with no problems. It's a
little wet today

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.680
so we'll see how the traction on the
ventrac goes the weight transfer will

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.099
help that out it will help transfer some
of that weight back onto the axle and

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.090
give me some good traction

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.270
While I'm using the tough cut my
father's going to use the power rake

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.140
today. I have a lot of areas that we're
going to need to see later. It's some

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.950
rough ground that has a lot of weeds and
stuff on it we're gonna take the power

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.360
rake and smooth those areas over and
then we'll come back and see that later.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.440
But the power rake's another attachment
does an amazing job of taking out the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.270
ruts and just making that a nice
planting surface so we can come in and

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.620
seed that. Whenever you're operating
Ventrac equipment you should wear eye

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.680
protection and some ear protection and
then Ventrac is also equipped with a

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.700
seat belt which is a very good to use
especially when you're doing on

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.380
hillsides it's a must to wear your seat
belt and the other important thing when

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.160
you do it in hillsides and slopes is
we're equipped with duals and that adds

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.400
a little extra safety

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.880
Get my RPMs up a little higher

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.780
It's not bogging down, the Tough Cut's eating this pretty good

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.440
Yeah, this thistle right here is probably 6 feet high.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.320
Yeah this Tough Cut just eats this stuff up

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.600
No problem
