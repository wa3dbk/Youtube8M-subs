Let's talk about cleaning and clean water.
I use distilled water when I'm mixing my paints,

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.120
because it's just a little bit purer than
the kind of water that you get out of the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.130
tap, but I will confess that when I wash my
brushes I just use water from the sink. As

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.960
a matter of a fact, I consider it pretty essential,
because what I want is running water; however

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.640
we can't get you guys, camera people, into
the bathroom where I do my washing of brushes,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:38.449
so I'm going to improvise here. Here is a
nice dirty brush; its got a lot of paint on

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.670
it. I don't want the paint to dry in here.
You know what? You can't let paint dry inside

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.530
a brush. As a matter of fact as soon as you
use is it and you're done with it you basically

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.739
want to run and clean it. OK. So, the first
thing I do is I swish it around in the water.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:58.949
Then it gets a little bit clean. OK. The water
is running, pretend the water is running.

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.440
Then I take, this is a; this is Ivory soap,
a nice mild soap. Then I go like this, actually

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.500
it depends on the brush. OK. Let's say it's
a lettering brush. Then I'm only going to

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.140
go this way and I'm going to be very, very
gentle; very, very gentle. Then I'm going

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.821
to go like this. This is all going on under
running water. OK. Then more running water,

00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:25.950
more running water, more running water and
then take a look at the guy and if it's OK

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.899
then fine otherwise repeat. Then you're going
to store it upright. You're going to shape

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:40.979
the brush, however it's meant to be shaped;
pointy or square or whatever. Shape the brush.

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:52.759
Then make sure it's dry all along here. Alright.
Then just store it upright. Brushes are expensive.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:02:01.799
I do not buy my brushes with a mail order.
I always go to the store and buy the brush.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.729
I bring some water along with me and I actually
put the brush in some water and see whether

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.561
or not itâ€™s a well made brush because brushes
vary in terms of, well, the quality of how

00:02:14.561 --> 00:02:18.470
they're made. It doesn't really matter how
good the company is there's always going to

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.120
be some brushes that might not be as perfect
as others. So, you want to literally choose

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.350
your own brushes so that eliminates mail order.
That's my recommendation.
