00:00:01.126 --> 00:00:03.936
HEY. WHEN I GET HOME FROM THE
STORE, I LIKE TO GIVE MY FRUITS

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:05.046
AND VEGGIES A GOOD WASH.

00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:07.576
THIS IS TO MAKE SURE THERE
ARE NO HARMFUL BACTERIA,

00:00:07.576 --> 00:00:11.666
SUCH AS E. COLI OR SALMONELLA,
ON THE FOOD I'M ABOUT TO EAT.

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:14.606
A PURDUE UNIVERSITY RESEARCHER
HAS THOUGHT OF A NEW METHOD

00:00:14.796 --> 00:00:16.726
TO KILL HARMFUL BACTERIA
ON FOOD,

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:18.826
SUCH AS TOMATOES AND SPINACH.

00:00:20.556 --> 00:00:23.456
DR. KEVIN KEENER HAS USED HIS
BACKGROUND IN FOOD SCIENCE

00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:26.196
TO TAKE A CLEANING PROCESS
IN THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.286
AND TRANSLATE IT
INTO PACKAGED FOODS.

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:31.176
HE CALLS THIS AN
IN-BAG OZONATION METHOD.

00:00:31.386 --> 00:00:32.636
DR. KEENER, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:35.846
WELL, WHAT IT MEANS IS IT
MEANS WE NOW HAVE A CAPABILITY

00:00:35.886 --> 00:00:38.216
TO TREAT FOOD PRODUCTS
INSIDE OF THE PACKAGE.

00:00:38.216 --> 00:00:40.716
WHAT TYPE OF METHOD
ACTUALLY KEEPS THE FRUITS

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:42.126
AND VEGETABLES STERILE?

00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:45.576
WELL, THIS PROCESS -- WHAT WE'RE
ABLE TO DO IS IN THE PACKAGE,

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:47.496
WE CAN ACTUALLY GENERATE
WHAT'S CALLED OZONE.

00:00:47.676 --> 00:00:50.116
WE TAKE OXYGEN THAT'S
IN THE AIR NATURALLY,

00:00:50.536 --> 00:00:53.796
WE APPLY A HIGH VOLTAGE TO THAT
OXYGEN, AND WHAT WE'RE ABLE

00:00:53.796 --> 00:00:55.486
TO DO IS THOSE OXYGEN
THEN RECOMBINE

00:00:55.486 --> 00:00:59.176
INTO THIS OZONE MOLECULE, WHICH
IS A BACTERIA-FIGHTING MOLECULE

00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:02.086
THAT WE CAN THEN GENERATE IN
HIGH LEVELS INSIDE THE PACKAGE.

00:01:02.626 --> 00:01:03.756
AND I SEE RIGHT OVER HERE,

00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:06.496
WE HAVE SOME TOMATOES
IN A PLASTIC BAG.

00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:08.736
CAN YOU SHOW US HOW
THIS METHOD WORKS?

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:12.986
SO, WHAT YOU SEE IN THE BAG
RIGHT NOW IS YOU ACTUALLY SEE

00:01:13.096 --> 00:01:15.016
VISUALLY THE EFFECT
OR CONVERSION

00:01:15.016 --> 00:01:17.366
OF THESE OXYGEN MOLECULES
INTO OZONE.

00:01:18.126 --> 00:01:19.046
THEY'RE STREAMERS.

00:01:19.136 --> 00:01:22.326
THESE ARE KIND OF THE CASCADING
WATERFALL ILLUMINATION EFFECT

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.256
THAT YOU'RE SEEING THERE.

00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:26.236
AND THAT IS THE PROCESS,
VISUALLY,

00:01:26.526 --> 00:01:28.116
IDENTIFYING THE CONVERSION

00:01:28.286 --> 00:01:31.046
INTO THESE REACTIVE
BACTERIA-KILLING MOLECULES.

00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:33.146
SO, I KNOW THE BACTERIA
IS BEING KILLED.

00:01:33.236 --> 00:01:34.116
IS THE FOOD SAFE?

00:01:34.916 --> 00:01:37.076
YES, THE STUDIES THAT WE'VE
DONE HERE IN THE LAB SHOW

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:39.626
THAT FOR TOMATOES, WE CAN
KILL ALL OF THESE BACTERIA,

00:01:39.626 --> 00:01:42.856
AND WE DON'T SEE ANY NOTICEABLE
CHANGES, LIKE TO THE QUALITY.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:45.826
AND, YES, THE FOOD IS
SAFE ALSO IN THE FACT

00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:48.716
THAT THIS OZONE HAS THE
FDA APPROVAL AND IS SAFE

00:01:48.716 --> 00:01:50.906
FOR TREATMENT OF FOODS,
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES

00:01:50.906 --> 00:01:52.046
IN PARTICULAR, LIKE TOMATOES.

00:01:52.496 --> 00:01:53.736
NOW, I WANT TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT

00:01:53.736 --> 00:01:56.836
ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES
OF THIS PROCESS.

00:01:56.836 --> 00:01:58.796
OKAY. WELL, THERE'S THREE
ADVANTAGES THAT I SEE.

00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:02.416
ONE OF THEM IS THE ENERGY
COST ASSOCIATED WITH THIS,

00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:03.456
OR THE ELECTRICAL USE.

00:02:04.026 --> 00:02:06.306
WE'RE TALKING TO FILL
A GALLON-SIZED PACKAGE

00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:08.956
WITH THIS OZONE, WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING LESS

00:02:09.036 --> 00:02:10.386
THAN FLIPPING ON A LIGHT BULB.

00:02:10.616 --> 00:02:12.896
IT'S IN THE RANGE OF ABOUT
30 TO 40 WATTS OF POWER,

00:02:12.896 --> 00:02:14.506
WHICH IS VERY LOW
-- LITERALLY LESS

00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:17.136
THAN A PENNY PER PACKAGE
TO DO THIS TREATMENT.

00:02:17.456 --> 00:02:20.036
THE SECOND THING WITH THE
TECHNOLOGY IS IT ALLOWS US

00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:22.336
BECAUSE IT'S CONTAINED
WITHIN THE PACKAGE,

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:26.196
IT ACTUALLY ALLOWS US LONGER
CONTACT TIMES, THE OZONE,

00:02:26.506 --> 00:02:28.216
TO REACT AND KILL
THESE BACTERIA.

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:30.236
AND THE THIRD ADVANTAGE
IS THE FACT

00:02:30.236 --> 00:02:31.956
THAT IT'S LOW-COST TO SET UP.

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:35.326
SO, BASICALLY, YOU PLUG IT INTO
THE WALL, AND IT STARTS UP.

00:02:35.596 --> 00:02:37.356
WHAT ARE SOME OF
YOUR FUTURE PLANS?

00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:39.806
WELL, WE'RE LOOKING
IN THE FUTURE TO WORK

00:02:39.856 --> 00:02:42.336
WITH SOME COMPANIES TO
KIND OF REALLY TAKE THIS

00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:44.746
TO THE NEXT STEP, TO
DEVELOP SOME COMMERCIAL UNITS

00:02:44.806 --> 00:02:48.296
THAT WOULD BE PUT
INTO PACKAGING SYSTEMS

00:02:48.386 --> 00:02:49.466
FOR FRUIT AND VEGETABLES.

00:02:50.506 --> 00:02:52.366
DR. KEENER, I WANT
TO THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:55.276
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH YOU
ARE MAKING FOODS SAFER

00:02:55.276 --> 00:02:55.886
FOR ALL OF US.

00:02:56.306 --> 00:02:57.006
HAVE ONE OF THESE.

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:57.956
THANK YOU, GINA.

00:02:57.956 --> 00:02:58.566
THANK YOU.

00:02:58.856 --> 00:03:01.836
FOR "BOILER BYTES,"
I'M GINA LAZARRO.
