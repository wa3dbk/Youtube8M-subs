Hello, my name is Tony Ramirez from Tampa
Florida, and on behalf of expert village,

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.990
this is how to write a screenplay.
Let's get started.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.990
Chapter one: Screenwriting 101. So, you want
to write a screenplay. This is the basic thing

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.250
that you're going to want to follow to write
your own screenplay. There's several ways

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.789
to do it. You have the old fashioned writing
it by hand, or if you're still using a type

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.340
writer, you can go ahead and type it out,
if you're using a word processing software

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.850
such as Word Perfect or Microsoft Word, you
can use those as well. The one thing that

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.760
you are going to have to remember is the formatting
of how a script is written. This is something

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.950
throughout the next couple of chapters, hopefully
I'll be able to help you understand... the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.289
spacing of things, the order of things, how
things are supposed to be written out when

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.750
writing a screenplay. These are the main things
you're going to have to follow; everything

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.180
has a format and it has to look exactly like
this. So again, hopefully, the following chapters

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.579
will help you out.
My suggestion is to go out and get yourself

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:10.220
software. This one I purchased a few years
ago; it is the Movie Magic Screenwriter 2000.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.390
They're up to version six now, they're not
number 2000 anymore. Thi program cost $299

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.200
a few years ago; I spent that because I was
making some decent money while I was trying

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.881
to make all these short films, commercials
and things like that. There's also Final Draft,

00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:31.850
which is another company that makes screenwriting
software. Those now are just over $200 as

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.220
well. But the best part if you're listening
to this and you're remembering this and you're

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.740
going to be doing stuff is that there is a
website out there called celtx.com. This is

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.020
a free, yes free, free, free, free, screenwriting
software. This software is very powerful,

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.461
it works perfectly, it's just as good as this
$300 one or the $200 and $300 Final Draft

00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:59.320
ones, so go out and get that one. Especially,
if you're just going to test the waters and

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.310
you want to just start writing stuff out.
But the main thing is when you're using these

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.670
softwares, they'll do almost everything for
you. When you're writing your action scripting,

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.060
your action lines, your heading, your dialog,
your characters, It'll actually space things

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.980
exactly how they're supposedto be. So that's
why you want to use these and not Microsoft

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.780
Word. And have to go back and try to format
everything and move your margins over, because

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.320
that can be a real pain in the butt.
So go out and either invest in something really

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.560
fancy, go to that website and download it
for free, install it in your computer, play

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.230
around, learn your characters, develope your
characters, develope your story, write your

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.320
script, print it out in these software programs,
and you're pretty much ready to go. So good

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.810
luck in Hollywood!
