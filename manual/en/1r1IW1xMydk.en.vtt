00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.030
 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.060
 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.140
 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.180
Hi, I'm Dr. Matheson Harris with Utah Oculoplastic consultants in Salt Lake City. 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.240
I see a lot of people with drooping eyebrows, which give the face a tired 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.280
and sometimes angry appearance. They can also cause the upper eyelids to droop

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.330
blocking their peripheral vision. Often, it is necessary to raise the brow 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.390
and forehead in order to correct the problem. 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.410
Very often insurance will cover the procedure when it is shown that the vision is being affected. 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.460
There are several ways to lift the brows 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.510
and forehead. The most common procedure we perform is called 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.570
an endoscopic forehead lift. This is performed 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.620
by making small incisions behind the hairline and elevating the entire forehead 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.670
and brow to a higher position. The forehead skin is held in place 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.700
with small dissolvable anchors placed in the bone. The incisions are closed 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.740
with skin staples which are removed after a week. 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.790
Very often we perform this procedure together with upper eyelid blepharoplasty surgery or eyelid lift

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.840
I like the endoscopic forehead lift technique because it is minimally invasive,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.870
the incisions are well hidden in the hairline 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.960
and there’s no large removal of skin.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.070
Scarring is usually very minimal and in most people is undetectable.	

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.160
The hairline will move up by a centimeter or two, but this is usually not very noticeable. 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.240
This procedure may not be appropriate for people with very thin hair,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.330
receding hairlines or baldness.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.420
The brows can also be lifted by a direct approach where an incision is made above the brow hairs. 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.450
This works very well to raise the eyebrows, but it does cause 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.540
a very noticeable scar and is not used very often these days.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.600
Another procedure called a pretrichial brow lift is used to raise the brows 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.680
without moving the hairline. This works very well for people

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.740
who always wear their hair forward and who are concerned about making their forehead 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.810
more prominent. Incision is made right along the hairline 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.840
in an irregular pattern, which hides well. A portion of the forehead skin 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.870
is removed which raises the brows. 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.920
The incision is then closed with a long row of stitches, which are removed after about a week.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.960
The most powerful but most invasive way to raise the forehead and brow 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.000
is through a coronal brow lift. This is performed by making 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.040
an incision from ear-to-ear across the top of the head 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.060
removing a large portion of the skin and some of the hair. 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.100
This is the longest lasting way to raise the forehead and brows, 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.210
however it does cause a significant scar and the recovery time can be several weeks or longer.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.280
Most of these procedures are performed under general anesthesia. 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.320
You come and go from the surgical center on the same day.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.390
After surgery your head will be wrapped in a pressure dressing,

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.450
which you leave in place for 3 to 5 days depending on the surgery.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.500
You’ll be getting pain pills and will be instructed to take it easy for a few weeks. 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.540
If the surgery is performed at the same time eyelid surgery, you will use ice and ointment

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.570
on your eyelids as we describe here in our other videos. 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.610
After one week we will remove the staples or stitches. 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.650
It’s important not to wear a hat for a few weeks

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.700
to avoid pulling down on the forehead. 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.740
Bruising usually takes 2-3 weeks to clear up

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.830
and swelling may take a bit longer. 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.880
Complications from these surgeries are rare but can occur. Bleeding and bruising 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.960
can vary with patients but can be significant. Patients who are on blood thinners may have 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.000
significant bruising which can travel down into the face. 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.070
It is also not uncommon to have bleeding that occurs after surgery.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.140
Holding direct pressure on a bleeding area will stop it within a few minutes. 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.230
If bleeding doesn’t stop, call our office.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.320
Brow lift can be transformative procedure, making your face appear years younger 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.400
and potentially improving your peripheral vision. 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.500
