Hey guys this is Austin. There have been a
lot of great consoles over the years but here

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.220
are my top 5 most underrated. Kicking things
off we have the Nintendo GameCube from 2001.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.219
As the fourth home console from Nintendo the
GameCube had some big shoes to fill. It had

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.279
fairly powerful hardware, so much so that
when it came time to make the Wii Nintendo

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.919
largely just reused the specs of the GameCube.
It had a solid lineup of games as well including

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.179
the always great first party Nintendo titles
like Luigi’s Mansion along with a fair few

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.219
third party games. This was important as one
of the major problems with the Wii and Wii

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.600
U was the lack of major games like Call of
Duty, leading a lot of people to go buy an

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.710
Xbox or PlayStation. It also shipped with
a fairly controversial controller that’s

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.300
aged fairly well, so much so that when Nintendo
launched Smash 4 on the Wii U they started

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.699
selling the 13 year old GameCube controllers
again. As the first Nintendo console to drop

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.100
cartridges the GameCube uses mini DVDs which
are a lot smaller than a traditional disc

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.300
but only had 1.5 gigabytes of capacity compared
to up to 8.5 gigs on the Xbox and PS2. And

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.120
it was ultimately the PS2 that hurt it the
most, selling a massive 155 million consoles

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.110
compared to just 22 million for the GameCube.
Still though, it holds up as one of the most

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.040
underrated consoles ever. Coming in at number
four we have the Sega Saturn from 1994. Sega

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.720
was all over the place in the 90s. The Genesis
put up a serious fight against the Super Nintendo

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.140
but then they released a series of weird add
ons before moving on with the Sega Saturn.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.700
Even though the Saturn was the worst selling
Sega console it actually had a lot going for

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.040
it. It featured a design that was ahead of
it’s time with dual CPUs ten years before

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.830
this became the norm in consoles which was
a big deal, it gave the Saturn the power to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.970
play games straight from the arcade like Daytona
USA and Virtua Fighter. The dual CPUs gave

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.990
it a lot of theoretical power compared to
the PlayStation 1 but it was incredibly difficult

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.830
for developers to take advantage of. Unfortunately
things went wrong almost immediately. Sega

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.920
did a surprise launch four months early...without
letting some stores know, prompting them to

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.640
drop the Saturn or indeed Sega altogether.
Oops. Couple this with the lack of big name

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.090
titles like Sonic and Sony’s new console
outsold the Saturn by a massive ten to one

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.090
ratio. The Saturn was a great console but
things just didn’t work out for Sega this

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.609
time. Next at number three we have the Sony
PlayStation Vita from 2011. Nintendo just

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:15.069
launched the 3DS, the followup to the massively
successful DS and Sony was coming off the

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.459
PSP, the first handheld to really challenge
Nintendo ever. It’s rocking a big, high

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.099
resolution five inch touchscreen with some
of the best physical controls ever put on

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.760
a portable and even cool features like a rear
touchpad. There’s just one problem: a little

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.379
thing called smartphones came along. With
most people already having a decent gaming

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.819
device in their pockets portable consoles
have hit some serious issues. The 3DS has

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.319
handled the transition reasonably well thanks
to it’s library of excellent first party

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.319
titles like Mario, Pokemon and Zelda but the
Vita hasn’t been so fortunate. It has some

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.040
decent games, especially Japanese titles but
in North America the big games like Minecraft

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.469
are nearly all available on other platforms.
It still has some life in it but Sony has

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:57.620
been focused on things like PS4 Remote Play
and PlayStation Now instead of pushing major

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.629
titles to the Vita. It’s a shame because
the Vita really was awesome but it was the

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:07.299
wrong console at the wrong time. At number
two we have the Nintendo Wii U from 2012.

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:13.420
The Wii U...yeah. Like the Saturn Nintendo
had just come off the enormously successful

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.939
Wii and immediately into big problems. The
big draw of the Wii U is the tablet like GamePad

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.819
which is legitimately cool but most people
thought it was an accessory for the original

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.069
Wii rather than an all new console. To add
insult to injury where the Wii was priced

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.469
significantly lower than the Xbox and PlayStation
the Wii U is only slightly cheaper than the

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:36.260
technically superior Xbox One and PS4, mostly
due to the expensive GamePad that’s included

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.769
with every Wii U. Like the Wii it’s been
hamstrung by a lack of third party support,

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.079
making the Wii U almost entirely reliant on
first party Nintendo games. Thankfully there

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.310
have been quite a few terrific titles such
as Smash 4 and Splatoon but with an install

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.029
base of less than 10 million consoles it’s
behind both the Xbox One and PS4 even with

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:58.400
an extra year head start. Nintendo has already
started talking about their next console,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.430
the NX which we should find out more about
next year. The Wii U is shaping up to have

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.299
one of the shortest and most disastrous console
runs ever which is a shame because it really

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.629
is a good console. Unfortunately that’s
just not enough. Coming in at the number one

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:17.140
spot is the infamous Sega Dreamcast from 1998.
The Dreamcast had so much potential. Sega

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.630
learned from the overly complicated Saturn
and designed a clean, easy to work with console

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.540
that had a big head start on the other consoles
of its generation. It brought a lot of firsts

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.220
as well including a built-in modem for online
play years before it became popular. With

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.220
the VMU it brought an early second screen
experience way before the Wii U that doubled

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.880
as the memory card for the system and some
games were powered by Windows three years

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.540
before Microsoft launched the Xbox. It even
had several big games like Crazy Taxi and

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.320
Sonic Adventure which were a big step up graphically
than anything available at the time. The Dreamcast

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.690
had a big, successful launch but surprise
surprise, Sony pulled the rug out from under

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.500
Sega with the hugely popular PlayStation 2.
The already weak Sega crumbled and less than

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.340
two years after they launched the Dreamcast
in the US Sega entirely pulled out of the

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.500
console business and the rest is history.

Ohh so close! This video will never be done.
