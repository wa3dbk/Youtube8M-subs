00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.087
- Why, hello, everyone,
my name is Tyler Oakley,

00:00:02.087 --> 00:00:04.142
and y'all always have so many questions,

00:00:04.142 --> 00:00:05.848
and I always have so many answers,

00:00:05.848 --> 00:00:08.867
which means it is time for another

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:10.539
Q and Slay.

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:12.808
Now, I normally do Q and
Slays by asking you guys

00:00:12.808 --> 00:00:15.078
to submit questions on
Twitter, but today I was like,

00:00:15.078 --> 00:00:16.011
"You know what?

00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:17.238
"We just got done with a full month

00:00:17.238 --> 00:00:18.597
"of collaborations with YouTubers,

00:00:18.597 --> 00:00:20.327
"I wanna collaborate with you guys."

00:00:20.327 --> 00:00:23.786
So, I asked you to submit
questions to me on Skype.

00:00:23.786 --> 00:00:26.584
You had to add me and then send
me a video of your question,

00:00:26.584 --> 00:00:28.221
and I'm really excited
to see you guys' videos

00:00:28.221 --> 00:00:30.021
because I'm like, "This
is finally a chance for me

00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:32.260
"to put some faces to
some of your user names,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.454
"and get to know you guys
a little bit better."

00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:35.883
So, let's hear what you guys had to ask.

00:00:35.883 --> 00:00:38.344
- Hey, Tyler, my question
for the Q and Slay is that

00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:41.445
when is Troye going to meet Queen Jackie?

00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:43.819
Because you've met up
the (mumbling) family,

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:48.819
so we wanted Troye to meet
Jackie, and get a selfie.

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:51.299
- Oh, this is a good question.

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:53.285
So, yeah, as you guys know
I have gone to Australia

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:55.543
to meet Troye's family.

00:00:55.543 --> 00:00:57.690
You know, the times are uh...

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.549
They're coming, is all I'll say.

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:00.987
I don't know exactly when,

00:01:00.987 --> 00:01:04.411
but we have plans for him to
come to Michigan in the future.

00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:05.664
I know you guys hate the word "soon,"

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:06.702
so I'm not gonna say, "It's soon,"

00:01:06.702 --> 00:01:09.176
but in the near future. (laughs)

00:01:09.176 --> 00:01:12.160
- My question is out of
all of your August videos,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.494
which one was the most fun to make?

00:01:14.494 --> 00:01:17.698
Which one was the most
mentally scarring to make?

00:01:17.698 --> 00:01:20.055
And which one was the most messy to make?

00:01:20.055 --> 00:01:22.881
- The messiest had to be by far

00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:25.795
the one I did with
SUPERFRUIT, Scott and Mitch,

00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:28.279
where we (laughs) had to put
our hands behind our backs

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:30.682
and eat a whole bunch of spaghetti.

00:01:30.682 --> 00:01:34.434
And then the funnest might have been

00:01:34.434 --> 00:01:36.262
the one I did with Connor.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:38.145
Him and I just have always so much fun,

00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:39.721
and so we did a whispering challenge

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:41.463
where we whispered pickup
lines to each other,

00:01:41.463 --> 00:01:42.682
and we were just laughing the whole time.

00:01:42.682 --> 00:01:43.948
Also, the one with Zoe,

00:01:43.948 --> 00:01:45.782
we just always have fun making videos.

00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:49.021
And then the most mentally scarring

00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:51.666
would have to be the one I made with Dan.

00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:53.305
(laughs) It was like...

00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:56.705
We had to watch just the weirdest stuff.

00:01:56.705 --> 00:01:58.621
This month was so fun,

00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:00.455
there were a couple
that put me through it.

00:02:00.455 --> 00:02:03.484
- My question for you is
what is the smelliest thing

00:02:03.484 --> 00:02:06.480
you have ever smelled in your entire life?

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.975
- Okay, so this is (laughs)...

00:02:07.975 --> 00:02:11.312
This question is really asking me a lot.

00:02:11.312 --> 00:02:15.307
But, the smelliest thing
that I've ever smelled

00:02:15.307 --> 00:02:16.792
would have to be...

00:02:16.792 --> 00:02:18.556
(laughs) I don't know.

00:02:18.556 --> 00:02:21.331
I've smelled some things
in my times, girl,

00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:25.848
you don't even know where
my nose has been. (laughs)

00:02:25.848 --> 00:02:27.111
I'm not gonna answer that.

00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:28.242
You guys can...

00:02:28.242 --> 00:02:29.331
I mean, I'm sure you can come up

00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:31.200
with something even
stinkier for me to smell

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.637
in a fan-fiction, so you go hog-wild.

00:02:34.637 --> 00:02:37.440
- Hi, Tyler, my name is Benji,
and my question for you is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.585
besides Darren Criss, who is
your next celebrity crush?

00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:41.659
- Hey, Benji!

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.909
Well, I have a couple celebrity crushes.

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.336
I'm very thirsty.

00:02:45.336 --> 00:02:47.171
If you don't know that
about me, learn it now,

00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:48.889
because it is overwhelming

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.933
and my thirst needs to be quenched.

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:53.893
I love Zac Efron, I love Nick Jonas,

00:02:53.893 --> 00:02:57.097
(sighs) Big Sean, I just
have a lot of thirst,

00:02:57.097 --> 00:03:00.778
and nothing seems to be quenching it.

00:03:00.778 --> 00:03:02.635
So, if y'all know any of
those boys, hook a brother up.

00:03:02.635 --> 00:03:03.888
- [All girls] Hi, Tyler.

00:03:03.888 --> 00:03:05.909
- So, we have a question for your

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.777
- [All girls] Q and Slay.

00:03:07.777 --> 00:03:08.996
- So, our question is

00:03:08.996 --> 00:03:10.912
if you had a movie
written about your life,

00:03:10.912 --> 00:03:11.853
who would play who?

00:03:11.853 --> 00:03:12.816
We love you.

00:03:12.816 --> 00:03:13.896
- [All girls] Bye.

00:03:13.896 --> 00:03:16.055
- Hey, ladies, (laughs) I
feel like this is so fun

00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:17.657
that I finally get to
see your guys' faces.

00:03:17.657 --> 00:03:20.280
But, if I had a movie about myself,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.129
I would be played by none other obviously

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.230
than Ellen DeGeneres.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.529
And then my mother, it
would have to be somebody

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:31.225
with like expertise acting
skills, just the right look,

00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:33.652
and that would obviously
have to be none other than

00:03:33.652 --> 00:03:34.871
Miranda Sings.

00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:37.030
- Okay, so my question for you

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.747
is what is the weirdest
collab you've ever done?

00:03:39.747 --> 00:03:42.267
- Okay, so I have done
millions and millions

00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:43.817
of collabs, obviously.

00:03:43.817 --> 00:03:45.233
I am the Collaboration Queen,

00:03:45.233 --> 00:03:48.252
but my favorite weirdest that got me

00:03:48.252 --> 00:03:50.985
most out of my own box
collab that I've ever done

00:03:50.985 --> 00:03:52.904
would have to be something that I did

00:03:52.904 --> 00:03:55.529
when I had only 4,000 subscribers,

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:57.584
and this was a few years ago,

00:03:57.584 --> 00:04:01.078
and it was none other than Grace Helbig.

00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:02.806
We did a video on her channel

00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:04.768
where I had to kind of do a skit,

00:04:04.768 --> 00:04:07.560
and as you guys know, I don't do skits.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.537
So, it was kind of weird for me to do,

00:04:09.537 --> 00:04:11.817
but it came out really cute

00:04:11.817 --> 00:04:14.000
and the looking back now,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.635
considering all the things
that she's accomplishing

00:04:16.635 --> 00:04:17.690
and all the things that
we have done together,

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.524
me and my people,

00:04:19.524 --> 00:04:21.544
it's just crazy to look back at us

00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:23.378
when we were just like baby YouTubers

00:04:23.378 --> 00:04:24.481
collaborating together.

00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:26.525
- How do you get your favorite
YouTuber to notice you?

00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:29.287
Because I don't have any luck,

00:04:29.287 --> 00:04:30.610
except for when you favorited my tweet,

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.864
thanks by the way.

00:04:31.864 --> 00:04:33.698
- Girl, it is easy to be noticed by me!

00:04:33.698 --> 00:04:35.392
I feel like I am like on the internet

00:04:35.392 --> 00:04:36.878
all day long every day.

00:04:36.878 --> 00:04:39.049
So, all you gotta do is
maintain your regular level

00:04:39.049 --> 00:04:41.336
of fine, fresh, fierce fabulousness,

00:04:41.336 --> 00:04:44.111
and keep slaying the game,
and I'll see everything.

00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:45.874
- Hi Queen Tyler, my name is Kaitlyn,

00:04:45.874 --> 00:04:48.708
and my question for you if you
got offered your own TV show,

00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:50.298
would you give up YouTube to do it?

00:04:50.298 --> 00:04:51.378
- Now this is really interesting,

00:04:51.378 --> 00:04:54.176
because I actually have
gotten a few offers like this.

00:04:54.176 --> 00:04:56.510
Even back after I graduated college,

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.890
I was applying for jobs
and they were all saying,

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.037
"If you get this job,
would you quit YouTube?"

00:05:01.037 --> 00:05:02.431
It's just the hardest thing,

00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:04.391
and it's probably why
I didn't get any real

00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:06.910
aspirational jobs that
I wanted out of college,

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.362
was because I said, "No."

00:05:08.362 --> 00:05:09.824
Because I feel like to be my best self

00:05:09.824 --> 00:05:12.784
in another environment, whether
it's a job or a TV show,

00:05:12.784 --> 00:05:17.515
I still have to maintain who
I am outside of that career.

00:05:17.515 --> 00:05:19.953
And that is very much
me being the YouTuber,

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:21.532
and so for people to not get that,

00:05:21.532 --> 00:05:24.015
they don't get me, and they
don't deserve to work with me.

00:05:24.015 --> 00:05:26.374
- If you weren't a famous YouTuber,

00:05:26.374 --> 00:05:28.370
what would you be doing instead?

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.035
- So, if I weren't a YouTuber,

00:05:30.035 --> 00:05:33.900
I would probably be a model. (laughs)

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.851
I sometimes get to do these
like fun little photo shoots

00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:38.119
and I feel ridiculous in every way,

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:40.674
because I'm like smizing
and like giving angles,

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:43.194
and like working every
single fib of the camera.

00:05:43.194 --> 00:05:45.933
But, I am not cut out for it,

00:05:45.933 --> 00:05:47.882
but I would love to try (laughs).

00:05:47.882 --> 00:05:49.752
Like I said, I get the
opportunity sometimes

00:05:49.752 --> 00:05:51.843
when photographers want to do something.

00:05:51.843 --> 00:05:54.641
I once did a little
photo shoot that I did.

00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:55.720
I think like a month ago,

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.694
and I have a whole bunch
of fun pictures from it

00:05:57.694 --> 00:05:59.377
that I am not gonna post all over Twitter

00:05:59.377 --> 00:06:01.513
and Tumblr and everywhere,
because that's a bit much.

00:06:01.513 --> 00:06:03.300
I've been showing you guys
a few of the pictures,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.880
but if you wanna see some more of them,

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.677
I will put them in a little
folder that you can download.

00:06:07.677 --> 00:06:09.581
All you gotta do is click the link below

00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:10.754

00:06:10.754 --> 00:06:13.599
It's got some exclusive
pictures, if you wanna get those.

00:06:15.143 --> 00:06:16.222
But that is all I have for you guys today.

00:06:16.222 --> 00:06:17.453
If you like this Q and Slay,

00:06:17.453 --> 00:06:18.672
be sure to give it a thumbs up,

00:06:18.672 --> 00:06:21.052
and I might do more Q
and Slays just like this.

00:06:21.052 --> 00:06:22.956
But yeah, thank you so much

00:06:22.956 --> 00:06:24.331
for all of your support this week.

00:06:24.331 --> 00:06:25.921
I have had tons of fun little projects,

00:06:25.921 --> 00:06:28.122
as you guys know, from my last video.

00:06:28.122 --> 00:06:30.445
My Slumber Party Tour is kickin' off.

but there may be, there might not be.

Click below, you will see.

00:06:38.695 --> 00:06:41.726
And then, my podcast has been such a hit.

00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:43.466
