00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.529
Hi I'm Steve Ledin from Optics Planet and I'd like
to speak to you about the Nikon

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:15.419
ATB Binocular ATB is all terrain binocular

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:16.820
it is truly a

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.050
versatile binocular and absolutely one
of my favorite products to use out in

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.139
the field.

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:26.220
the Monarch ATB binocular

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.249
certainly comes with ocular and
objective lens caps the objective lens

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:37.199
caps are attached securely to the uh...
to be objective lens housing that's a

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:38.690
nice idea.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.320
The eye cups

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.410
Move in lockable increments for eyeglass wearers you certainly turn them

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.430
all the way down. The

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.990
focus wheel moves very smoothly.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.120
It's a lightweight fully multi coated
waterproof fogproof binocular.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.100
You can carry 'em all day.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.700
It has a dielectric multilayer prism coating
and a wide field of view.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.890
I personally have access to

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.700
many binoculars that are quite
expensive and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.840
more often than not

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.330
my very first choice is this particular binocular it's the Monarch ATB

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.920
by Nikon.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.760
It comes in 8x42, 10x42

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.040
and 12x42 power.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.479
This happens to be a 10x42.

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.280
I absolutely love this binocular.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.270
First of all it's lightweight.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.270
Secondly it's

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.620
reasonably inexpensive it's a moderately
priced binocular.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.090
It comes with

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.390
a soft case with of belt loop comes
with a neck strap.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.250
The difference in performance between
this medium price binocular and

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.390
a thousand-dollar binocular is so
minuscule it takes someone uh... a lot

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.350
of effort to realize the difference
between the two.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.700
This is the best bang for the buck that
I know of that in a modern binocular today.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.650
I feel

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.830
assured that you will absolutely love
and enjoy this monarchy ATB binocular

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.299
I recommended very highly

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:19.299
I'm Steve Ledin with Optics Planet
thanks for listening.
