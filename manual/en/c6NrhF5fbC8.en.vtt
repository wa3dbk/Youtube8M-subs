Gold Leaf:
This Venetian goblet made in the early-1500s

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.210
was decorated with enamel and gilding.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.980
The gilding was applied in the form of gold
leaf, which was attached to the surface of

00:00:20.980 --> 00:01:58.570
the glass and then cut away and carefully
incised with a stylus 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:23.270
to add pattern.
