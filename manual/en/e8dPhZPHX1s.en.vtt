00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.640
I need to know how to get my banned PSN account
back.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.030
Before you freak, wait a day or two and see
if you’re still banned.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.810
After all, the error message says banned or
suspended, and suspended is not forever, whereas

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.950
banned may be.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.030
I’ve already been trying every day for a
few days.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.770
That’s why I’m asking how to get a banned
PSN account back, not how long a suspension

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.220
lasts.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.680
Sometimes you get banned because of charge
backs, because the checkout did not work right

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.969
and tried to purchase multiple items several
times and exceeded a limit.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.410
That’s something to take up with customer
service.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.710
I do not think I’ve ordered much recently,
though I’ve bought a thousand dollars of

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.390
games and content, if not more.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.109
If your credit card number expired and you
tried to order a bunch of stuff, or if you’re

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:57.059
trying to use already used PSN codes, that
may trigger a ban.

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.760
Again, that’s something to talk to customer
service about.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.070
Assuming customer service does not tell me
it is banned on account of suspected fraud.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.820
If you stayed logged onto someone else’s
system and it looks like you’re logged on

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.229
a couple of places, buying content on each,
that looks like fraud to them.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.590
Then again, if someone else got your credentials
and ordered things as you, they’ll ban it.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.259
Though the latter case would be fraud.

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.299
You can call the bank to shut down the credit
card tied to the account if you’ve been

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.049
a victim of fraud.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.770
After all, someone who hacked your PSN account
and ordered five hundred in games and codes

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.789
may be buying whole laptops elsewhere.

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.779
If they exceeded my credit card limit and
that made my PSN purchases bounce, that would

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:46.860
explain an account ban too, though not by
my own fault.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.399
But what do I do if my credit card account
looks normal?

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.179
See if you paid and then got charged back,
getting PSN games and content for free.

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.579
Call Sony customer service or accounting with
a way to pay and get unbanned; if there’s

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.549
fraud on your account, you may get unbanned
once you prove it.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.549
May?

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.240
I can check, but I do not think the financial
reasons are why I was banned.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.730
Sharing your account with friends can get
you banned.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.180
You can also get banned for using custom firmware.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.290
If I could do custom firmware, I’d be playing
on a Linux box, not PS4.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.260
I’d ask customer service why I’m banned,
and if it is financial, send them a certified

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.130
check or cashier’s check for the amount
you need to solve it.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.540
Otherwise, short of citing fraud and ignorance,
there’s little you can do to get unbanned.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.959
Here’s my ransom, free my games!
