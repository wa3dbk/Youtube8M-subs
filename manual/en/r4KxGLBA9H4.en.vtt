Hi.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:16.000
I’m Bob Sinton of Sandler Training.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.780
I’m here today to talk to you about rule
#14, a prospect who is listening is no prospect

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.780
at all.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.740
You may have heard this before but Dave Sandler
told me a long time ago that you should follow

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.490
the rule called 70/30 rule where the client
talks, or the prospect talks 70% of the time

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.400
and you, the salesperson, talks 30% of the
time.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.310
Most salespeople I run into in my 30 years
of doing this understand that.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.780
The problem with it is, how do you go about
doing it?

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.400
Well, most if not all salespeople know their
features and benefits and the uh, the power

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.480
of what their company can provide clients,
um so it’s easy for them to uh, explain

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.430
their features and benefits to a client.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.770
The problem with that is it doesn’t necessarily
elicit responses from a client.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.120
So what we have to train ourselves to do to
be more successful and more professional is

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.190
take your features and benefits and phrase
it and structure it in such a way where it

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.940
actually elicits a conversational response
from your client.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.740
For example, a feature and benefit your company
may, may uh, include uh, you can reduce expenses

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.860
and save them some overhead and, and save
your client some money in the uh, long-term

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.860
or short-term.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.549
Well, a lot of people can say that that’s
on your website, it’s on your brochure.

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.531
A more effective way is to say, "Hey Ed, can
I ask you a question?

00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:34.860
Um, what we’ve done with companies and individuals
like yourself is help save them money with

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.750
some software that helps them reduce expenses,
uh, get rid of waste and add more money to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.750
their bottom line.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.610
Uh, do you have anything like that happening
here and if so, can you tell me a little bit

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.610
about it?"

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.220
Um, what that question does is it obviously
elicits initially a yes or no response but

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.090
then it quickly goes down the tunnel of what
I like calling a conversational, uh, dialogue

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.400
if you will between salesperson and client
and you find yourself talking only 30% of

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.820
the time and the client ends up talking 70%
of the time and that creates a, a more of

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.500
a win-win relationship and that’s Sandler
rule #14, a prospect who is listening is no

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.780
prospect at all.
