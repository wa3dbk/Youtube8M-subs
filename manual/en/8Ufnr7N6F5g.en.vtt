00:00:08.314 --> 00:00:11.858
The challenge that most dog owners face when training their dog

00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:14.534
is not only knowing exactly where to start

00:00:14.534 --> 00:00:18.074
but there's way too much conflicting information out there.

00:00:18.074 --> 00:00:22.442
I have one goal; to help you learn step by step training method

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:28.993
that focuses on positive reinforcement and rewards that will literally transform your dog's behavior.

00:00:29.678 --> 00:00:33.539
Hi, my name is Jean Cote and this is Onyx.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.512
And we'll be your instructors for the next eight weeks.

00:00:36.512 --> 00:00:40.032
Think about your dog's behavior, and ask yourself this question

00:00:40.032 --> 00:00:43.358
Does my dog behave the way that I want him to?

00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:50.071
When I think about my first dog, I think 
 about him eating shoes, chewing on remote controls,

00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:54.303
and pretty much doing anything he wanted, whenever he wanted.

00:00:54.303 --> 00:00:58.717
I've learned a lot since then about what dogs actually respond to.

00:00:58.717 --> 00:01:00.717
and the quickest way to get them to 
 do what you want them to do.

00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:08.493
Because I think your dog's behavior is a reflection 
 of you, and your commitment to training.

00:01:09.226 --> 00:01:15.625
Everything that I know about obedience training is packed into 
 an eight week step by step video training course.

00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:20.015
In it, you will learn some very powerful lessons such as...

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:26.400
How to reward your dog in such a way that gets 
 him to do exactly what you want him to do.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.688
A very powerful clicker system that makes it much easier 
 for you to reward the behavior that you want.

00:01:33.688 --> 00:01:40.030
How to get your dog to respond to a 
 single command on the very first try.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.920
How to build a strong training foundation that you can 
 keep building upon for the lifetime of your dog.

00:01:46.925 --> 00:01:53.020
This is literally one of the highest valued training courses you'll find anywhere.

00:01:53.016 --> 00:01:59.540
And all you have to do, is follow the instruction and 
 complete each step before moving on to the next level.

00:01:59.544 --> 00:02:03.900
It's fun, it's informative and it works!

00:02:03.897 --> 00:02:12.960
I highly encourage you to read below and learn what could easily 
 be the greatest investment in your dog's life, and yours.

00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:14.790
Good dog!
