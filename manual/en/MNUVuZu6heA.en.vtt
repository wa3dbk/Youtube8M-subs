00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.500
Let's think a
little bit about why

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.250
credit default
swaps, or famously

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.780
referred to by Warren
Buffett as financial weapons

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.785
of mass destruction.

00:00:11.785 --> 00:00:13.160
At the center of
it-- and there's

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.466
not just one credit
default swap writer,

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.590
but I'll put one in the
middle because each of them

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.210
are writing many, many
credit default swaps.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.880
AIG is the most famous.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.670
But you have some writer here.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.080
They're given some
good credit rating.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.580
Maybe in the past
that credit rating

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.560
was actually earned by
a credit rating agency.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.460
And then frankly, the
credit rating agency

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.970
got a little sloppy and really
wasn't willing to downgrade

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.500
them given all of
the credit default

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.420
swaps, all of the obligations
they are taking on.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.310
And as you could tell, I kind of
view these guys and these guys

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.830
as the main culprits,
and maybe a little bit

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.770
of the regulatory agencies
saying, hey, look,

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.145
these guys are
writing insurance.

00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:53.090
Maybe we should
actually regulate them.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.060
But with that said, you
have companies over here.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.610
I'll do the companies
in this pink color.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.280
And they want to borrow
money from other parties,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.260
let's say, investors.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.880
I'll do the investors
in this orange color.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.300
So the investors are
lending them money.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.260
The companies give
them interest.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.370
So investors lending money,
giving interest, lending money,

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.460
giving interest, lending
money, giving interest.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.880
And then these investors--
it seems pretty reasonable--

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.230
say, hey, look, there's a
guy over here with a double A

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.650
rating.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.233
The people that we're lending
to don't have a double A rating.

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:28.040
Maybe this guy has a B, maybe
this guy has a double B,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.480
maybe this guy only has a
single A. And so he says, look,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.386
I want to be
completely safe here

00:01:33.386 --> 00:01:35.260
so I'm going to pay a
little bit of a premium

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.760
to AIG or to the writer,
whoever the writer is,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.540
and in exchange I will get
insurance on this debt.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.460
And it seems pretty
reasonable except for the fact

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.940
that this player right over here
did not put out any money aside

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.860
or did not put the
appropriate amount of money

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.210
aside to properly account for
all of these liabilities, all

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.900
of this risk that its taking on.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.190
And also, all of these
risks are correlated.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.190
You can imagine a situation
where the economy goes bad.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.320
Now, all of a sudden
this company defaults

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.840
on its debt and this company
defaults on its debt.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.330
In fact, when the
economy's good,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.930
it's likely that very
few of these companies

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.055
are going to default and
when the economy goes bad,

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:27.570
it's likely that many
of them will default.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.120
But the real problem is is as
soon as these defaults start

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.850
happening, then the
credit default swap writer

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.420
is going to have to actually
start paying for the defaults.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.420
They'll get the bad debt
and in exchange they'll

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.910
make the other side
of the credit default

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.820
swap, the holder of it, they
will pay to make them whole.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.600
And so this could take
them out of business.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.820
And all of a sudden,
the people over here

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.030
who thought that they had
insurance no longer do.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.600
And they might
actually say, wait,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.570
I can only hold double A
debt and they might actually

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.260
have to dump this
debt on to the market.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.620
Even worse, you have all
of the people over here

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.404
who didn't lend any
money to anybody,

00:03:06.404 --> 00:03:08.320
but they really just
wanted to make side bets.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.890
Either the side bets might
have been pure directional bets

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.348
on the state of
the economy saying,

00:03:12.348 --> 00:03:13.779
hey, I think a
bunch of companies

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:15.320
or I think this
company in particular

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.090
is going to default on
its debt, and they too

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.420
could get credit default swaps
really as just side bets.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.260
So just for maybe this right
here is $1 billion in debt,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.630
maybe all of these parties
took side bets on this guy.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.260
So even though there's only
$1 billion of debt here,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.950
there might be $4
or $5 or $10 billion

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.860
worth of insurance on
that $1 billion bet.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.000
So if all of a sudden
this one company

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.920
can't pay its $1 billion,
now AIG is on the line

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.070
not for $1 billion, but
for $4 or $5 or $6 billion,

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.680
however much it insured it for.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.910
So it allows people
to insure for things

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.920
that they don't have the
offsetting liability for.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.490
And so you can imagine,
some of these people--

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.749
if this guy fails will just take
a loss and that's bad and all

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:02.790
of the rest because they
were expecting that they

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.280
wouldn't-- but some of
these players might have had

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.700
offsetting hedges.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.120
The only reason why they
might have felt comfortable

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.870
taking on some
other liability is

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.420
they said, look, if the
economy goes really bad,

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.529
I have this insurance over here.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.920
And they did that transaction
with another third party.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.130
Now all of a sudden,
if the economy goes bad

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.480
and these guys say, hey,
look, I'm in a lot of trouble.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.020
Good thing I have this
credit default swap,

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.603
but then it turns out that they
don't because the counterparty

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:32.080
here fails, the credit
default swap writer,

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.240
now all of a sudden this
guy becomes insolvent.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.359
But this guy was dependent
on this guy paying

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.400
and he thought he was good
because he even looked

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.020
at this guy's books and said
this guy had offsetting hedges,

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.770
and now this guy might fail.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.550
And so you could have
this entire cascade

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.590
through the entire
financial system.
