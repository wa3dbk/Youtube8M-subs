00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.130
Here at Station Safewater, we are here

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.260
to help. So you can have a good time on the beach

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.340
or a boat. But sometimes

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.540
you may get into trouble and you will need some help, then

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.710
we'll be there to save you because that's our job. We're in the Coast Guard

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.740
and saving lives is what do.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.830
So bring you friends for a visit and we'll show you around.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.010
So come one down to Station Safewater.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.100
You kids

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.270
almost done with your icecream? -- All most.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.360
What are you doing Glen? We don't litter.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.560
We need to keep our beaches clean. Trash on the beach can go in the water

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.740
and once it's in the water it can hurt the animals and the fish that call the ocean their home.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.930
Oh, sorry I didn't realize it could hurt the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.960
fishies. --That's okay Glen, now you know how bad it is.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.070
Chief Brown, could you teach the kids about beach safety?

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.240
Sure thing, sir. -- Chief Brown, I'm going to help

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.270
make sure no one hurts the fishies and pick up all the trash on the beach.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.380
Hold on a minute, Nikki. I really like how you want to help the fishies.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.540
I mean, the fish. But picking up the trash

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.630
on the beach might not be the safest idea.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.230
What do you mean Chief?

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.320
The garbage you pick up might be covered in icky chemicals or be sharp

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.530
enough to cut your hands. Maybe you could get your school or church to organize

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.170
a beach cleanup day. Your parents could also help find a local community

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.250
group that does activities to help protect our environment.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.440
Teach you what kind of stuff not to touch and make sure you have gloves

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.600
and clothing that can protect you. -- That sounds cool.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.620
Could I do that too?

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.660
Everyone can help keep the environment clean.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.890
We just want you to be safe when you do it.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.960
What's an evironment. -- He said environment.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.050
It means the earth, the air, the beach and the water

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.110
Oh, I like the enviornment.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.310
Another thing you should never touch on the beach is a hurt animal.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.340
Sometimes oil is spilled in the water and gets on birds and animals

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.430
otters, or turtles or pelicans, seaguls.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.570
Seals, walruses, sea lions, manarays, hermet crabs.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.750
Giant squids and mermaids. If you see an animal with oil on it, never touch

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.960
The animals are all ready scared and might be sick. Just have

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.340
an adult call your local wildlife expert.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.400
But I would want to help the animal if it was hurt.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.540
I know Nikki and the best way to do that is to have an adult call an expert.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.730
They can make sure the animal gets clean and gets the right medicine.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.770
Okay.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.670
Hey Chief, it sure is hot out here.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.730
It sure is. Have you been drinking

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.660
enough water?

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.730
I had a soda on the car ride.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.780
When you're going to the beach on a hot day, you want to make sure you drink plenty of fluids, like

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.840
water or juice. That helps your body. If you don't drink enough

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.940
water, too much sun can make you feel sick. You also want

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.970
to wear sunscreen or sunblock, so you don't get a sunburn.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.070
But I hate when my mom puts that gunk on me.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.250
Well Glen, she does it because she knows a sunburn hurts and isn't good for your skin.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.370
Oh, fine. -- Playing at the beach is fun.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.450
Oh, Nikki that's not a good idea.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.580
When logs wash up on the beach, they're called drift wood. Water makes them soft making it

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.750
dangerous to walk on becuase your foot could break through the wood.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.830
Logs aren't very stable either. That means the drift wood could move

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.930
or roll when you're on top and throw you down. -- That would hurt.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.730
And getting hurt isn't fun at all.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.770
You also don't want to climb on big rocks because

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.840
they can move when you're on them. -- But I'm not very big.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.920
Am I heavy enough to make a big rock move? -- You could be.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.000
And we don't want to find out. Cliffs along the beach are dangerous

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.190
to. So be safe and just enjoy the sandy beach.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.240
Well now that you kids know about beach safety, who wants to

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.840
swim? -- We do. We do.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.900
swim? -- We do. We do.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.060
A boat is sinking. A boat is sinking.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.480
Sounds like someone needs out help Chief.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.520
Petty Officer Haley, ready the boatcrew. -- Aye, aye Chief.
