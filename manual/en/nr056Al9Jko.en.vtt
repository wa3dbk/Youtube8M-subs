00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.440
My name is Justice Hollis, I’m from Pontiac, Michigan and I’m coming to Ferris for psychology.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.540
My name is Nicholas Sumpter, I’m from Baldwin, and I came to Ferris because I heard that

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.020
it’s, you know, good people, and they have a good program for the field I’m going in to.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.320
My name’s Thomas, I’m from North Hill Michigan, and I’m going into heavy equipment.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.920
Hi, my name is Courtney Ankrapp, I’m from Buchanan, Michigan, and I am going into the pharmacy program at Ferris.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.320
Here at orientation I’m a team leader, so essentially I’ve just been helping other

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.840
student employees get to know families, and help orient students just, to campus.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.520
My role as an orientation leader is to just make sure everybody goes through the process,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.360
and make sure they get everything ready for the oncoming year.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.880
Orientation has been going really good, we’ve had tons of students coming in, and they’re

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.700
all really excited to start the next chapter of their lives here at Ferris State University.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.479
Everyone’s just been really excited.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.280
It’s a lot, it’s nerve-wracking, but it’s exciting at the same time.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.100
It’s confusing, it’s stressful.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.380
It’s going great, it’s very organized and I appreciate that.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.340
I’ve been waiting for this for a long time, waiting to be, you know, on my own,

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.140
to see what life is like out there.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.299
I don’t know, something new, different from high school.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.820
Didn’t enjoy high school, looking forward to college a lot.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.260
A lot of freedom, making a lot of new friends, knowing a lot of new people.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.740
I’m not really sure, I just want to have fun, and learn I guess.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.100
Meeting new people and developing an education that I’ll have to deal

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.280
with for the rest of my life.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.440
I seen a poster about it in my school, and just something said something about going

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.800
there, it just stood out from everything else.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.400
Good in the heavy equipment program, really, like, well known for it.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.460
Because they have the best pharmacy program.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.120
Because it wasn’t that far from home and it’s a really good school.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.440
I’m excited, go Bulldogs
