00:00:12.547 --> 00:00:15.282
One of the most contentious of climate crocks

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.719
is the role of water vapor in climate change.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.358
And climate deniers are always trying to "fog the issue".

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:28.152
But don't be scared -

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:34.134
Crock of the Week is here to make sure you don't get

00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:36.015
sucked in.

00:00:39.413 --> 00:00:42.893
Water vapor is the most abundant Greenhouse gas

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.510
but climate deniers often distort how and why it's important.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:51.388
Often you'll see the claim made that water vapor is responsible for

00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:56.218
95 or more percent of the greenhouse effect.

00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:01.951
"These ideas are almost certainly wrong"

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:05.771
The dry atmosphere, not including water vapor,

00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:11.018
is made up of about 78 percent Nitrogen, and 21 percent Oxygen

00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:14.425
neither of which is a greenhouse gas.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:18.461
And another one percent is trace gases, including carbon dioxide.

00:01:19.553 --> 00:01:23.113
But water vapor is not evenly mixed in the atmosphere,

00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:25.976
and varies by temperature, latitude,

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.986
and even time of day, as the cycle of day and night

00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:32.466
produces regular pulses of evaporation.

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:36.819
Warmer air can hold more moisture than colder air,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.510
so in hot humid regions, just above the surface,

00:01:40.815 --> 00:01:44.215
water vapor can make up as much as 4 percent of the atmosphere.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:47.574
In cold polar regions near the surface,

00:01:47.937 --> 00:01:50.937
it may make up only 2 tenths of a percent.

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:53.731
The radiation wavelengths trapped by water vapor

00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:57.531
sometimes overlap with those of other gases.

00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:02.817
Clouds further complicate the matter, sometimes reflecting, and sometimes trapping heat.

00:02:03.386 --> 00:02:08.729
So best estimates of the warming effect of water vapor, including clouds,

00:02:09.613 --> 00:02:13.813
are between 66 and 85 percent.

00:02:19.814 --> 00:02:23.054
An important factor in radiative heat transfer,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.470
is at what altitude absorption and emission take place.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.640
Higher altitudes are colder,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.950
and most water vapor freezes out as rain or snow.

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:37.233
Satellite studies show much greater concentrations of water vapor

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:40.794
at lower altitudes than in upper layers.

00:02:42.062 --> 00:02:44.264
If we look at a cross section of the atmosphere,

00:02:45.024 --> 00:02:49.157
we can see the troposphere, where human beings live and work, the lowest layer.

00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:54.474
Higher up is the stratosphere, and above that, even higher, thinner, layers.

00:02:55.155 --> 00:02:57.995
Water vapor has most of its effect in the troposphere.

00:02:58.555 --> 00:03:01.049
CO2 is evenly mixed,

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:05.588
and maintains the same concentration from the surface to the top most layers,

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:10.290
the earth's radiative heat boundary with outer space.

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:14.946
This greatly magnifies CO2's power, relative to water vapor.

00:03:15.856 --> 00:03:22.859
Over time, mankind has added to atmospheric CO2, which remains for decades or even centuries.

00:03:23.404 --> 00:03:26.804
But water vapor stays in the air only a few days,

00:03:27.044 --> 00:03:30.284
and cannot increase, without increasing temperature first.

00:03:33.974 --> 00:03:39.006
If it were possible to add water to the air with some giant cosmic spritzer bottle,

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.556
or as sometimes happens, a volcanic eruption,

00:03:43.104 --> 00:03:45.304
without an increase in temperature,

00:03:45.694 --> 00:03:49.756
the additional  water vapor would very quickly condense and drop out.

00:03:50.837 --> 00:03:57.671
That's why climate scientists say, water vapor is a feedback, not a forcing.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.230
One common denier canard, is the saturation issue,

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.590
where it is said, CO2 is not a significant greenhouse gas

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.470
because water vapor saturates the long wave spectrum

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.046
and leaves no energy left for extra CO2 to absorb.

00:04:17.878 --> 00:04:21.758
This antique idea dominated climate science

00:04:22.078 --> 00:04:25.318
in the early part of the 20th century, when crude technology,

00:04:25.558 --> 00:04:28.478
and lack of interest, limited research in the area.

00:04:29.723 --> 00:04:32.723
"These ideas are almost certainly wrong"

00:04:33.146 --> 00:04:36.941
With the advent of the cold war, the US military poured money

00:04:37.226 --> 00:04:40.858
into sophisticated research using new instruments and computers

00:04:41.178 --> 00:04:44.506
to investigate radiative transfer at high altitudes

00:04:44.746 --> 00:04:48.306
helping create a new generation of heat seeking missiles.

00:04:49.997 --> 00:04:51.957
By the early 1950s,

00:04:52.357 --> 00:04:55.917
the absorption bands were well resolved, and Popular Mechanics noted

00:04:56.237 --> 00:05:00.354
that the essentials of the CO2 greenhouse warming were now understood.

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:04.908
Gilbert Plass, of Johns Hopkins University, was a leader in this effort,

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:08.392
having used newly available computers and technology to show

00:05:08.712 --> 00:05:12.112
that adding more CO2 to the atmosphere

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:15.412
did indeed soak up and radiate more heat.

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:27.060
A more recent denialist claim has been the idea that, as the planet warms,

00:05:27.612 --> 00:05:31.972
exotic feedbacks will create more reflective cloud effects,

00:05:33.673 --> 00:05:37.553
that the earth's atmosphere will react like a giant iris,

00:05:38.033 --> 00:05:42.553
opening and closing to preserve planetary heat balance.

00:05:44.027 --> 00:05:47.027
"These ideas are almost certainly wrong"

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:50.927
These theories have not held up to peer reviewed scrutiny,

00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:53.927
in fact more recent studies suggest

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:57.167
that cloud feedbacks may be strongly positive

00:05:59.706 --> 00:06:02.759
with fewer clouds over ocean areas to reflect heat

00:06:03.266 --> 00:06:07.044
increasing incoming radiation and warming.

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:10.934
One effect that has been predicted for decades

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:15.454
is that increased global temperature will increase moisture in the atmosphere,

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:19.631
and the result will be more extreme precipitation events.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.882
This prediction is being born out,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.920
in record rain and flooding events, from the American midwest

00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:31.157
to Europe and Asia.

00:06:38.292 --> 00:06:41.334
Finally, as more moisture enters the air,

00:06:41.887 --> 00:06:45.432
the greenhouse effect of the water vapor itself will increase,

00:06:46.023 --> 00:06:50.329
a much quoted study confirmed this effect in 2008, noting,

00:06:50.927 --> 00:06:55.553
"The existence of a strong and positive water vapor feedback means

00:06:55.793 --> 00:07:00.727
that projected business as usual greenhouse gas emissions over the next century

00:07:00.993 --> 00:07:05.472
are virtually guaranteed to produce warming of several degrees celsius.

00:07:05.753 --> 00:07:08.593
The only way that will not happen is

00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:11.833
if a strong, negative, and currently unknown

00:07:11.993 --> 00:07:15.153
feedback is discovered somewhere in our climate system.

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:20.640
Climate deniers know they have long ago lost the scientific battle.

00:07:21.534 --> 00:07:26.479
They seek to delay action with wishful thinking, fuzzy logic, and deception.

00:07:27.454 --> 00:07:30.583
To keep your head above water, and help stem the tide,

00:07:30.934 --> 00:07:33.854
