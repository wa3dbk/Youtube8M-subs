00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.440
Hello, I am Tamara and today I will prepare

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.600
Cocoa slices.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.020
Here we mixed eggs with sugar and vanilla sugar

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.680
and now we will add milk.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.220
We will add sunflower oil

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.220
and we will mix it a bit...

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.720
In a seperate bowl we will mix

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.560
flour and

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.580
cocoa

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.460
and baking powder.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.300
Again, use whisk to sift flour and get rid of lumps.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.720
We add this dry mixture into our wet mixture

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.660
and mix it all up.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.880
Our mixture is finished

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.760
and we will pour it into

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.200
casserole dish that we

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.800
smeared with butter and sprinkled with cocoa powder.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.200
Instead of cocoa powder you can use flour

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.600
what ever you prefere.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.440
And, that's our cake...

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.060
We will put it in oven at 180Â°

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.060
for about 20-25 minutes

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.560
and when it is baked,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.300
we will glaze it with chocolate.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.560
So, we need to melt the chocolate, preferably on steam,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.040
add sunflower oil

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.300
and pour it all over your hot cake.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.780
Then leave it to cool off

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.500
before making your slices.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.220
That's it. Enjoy! :)
