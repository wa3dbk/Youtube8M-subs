I'm Amelia Smith and on behalf of Expert Village,
I'm going to talk to you about how to do the

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.390
perfect blowout. My paddle brush, I'm actually
going to use around her hairline since she's

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.500
got some natural curl here and that's going
to help me smooth that out. Also I'm going

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.210
to use it by lifting her hair at the scalp
so I can get underneath with the dryer and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.859
get a lot of that moisture out of there. Her
hair is probably about 50%-60% dry, so it's

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.849
not quite where I want to bring in the round
brush yet. So this paddle brush is going to

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:38.240
help me get it there faster. So I'm just lifting
it at the scalp. Getting right underneath

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:47.980
and right into that hair to get a lot of that
moisture out. I'm also brushing her hairline

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.840
using the round of her head. Brushing her
hair up and around with the paddle brush and

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.440
that's going to help me pull this curl out
and get nice smooth hair here. Plus I am lifting

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:16.560
it in the opposite direction that she's going
to where it, so I'm also imparting volume.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:25.520
In the back of the hair I'm lifting up so
I'm imparting volume back there as well plus

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:51.550
I'm drying at the scalp. Now I'm not focusing
on the ends, I'll do that with the round brushes,

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:14.990
right now I'm just getting that scalp area
mostly dry. So now it's to the point where

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:24.810
I can bring in the round brushes. And I'm
going to start with the larger one,

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.370
and usually you start in the back, it's just
easier if you pin everything up and just start

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.010
in the back taking everything section by section,
it'll just make your work easier.
