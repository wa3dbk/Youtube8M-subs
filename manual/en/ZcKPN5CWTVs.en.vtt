00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:09.389
What's going on everybody, welcome back to
Fairgrounds TV.

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.410
I'm your host Peter Moeller.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.580
Excuse the noise in the background there's
some construction going on.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.510
Today we have something from Angry Orchard.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.270
This is their Iceman cider it comes in at
10 percent alcohol.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.420
It's an ice cider, so what they do is they
freeze it to make it a little bit smoother.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.110
They're, it's a philosophy that they do a
lot in Canada, in Quebec I believe it originated.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:38.320
But 10 percent alcohol and actually oak-aged
so let's see what we got here.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.460
*sniffs*
Oh, nice, smells slightly tart like some of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.340
the ciders that I've had in the past have
the aroma.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.010
It's got a nice carbonation, it's not too
dark, it's got a nice maybe copper color,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.570
nice copper color.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.570
No head, it's just cider.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:10.090
So let's give it a sip.
*sips*

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.470
Wow.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.860
Wow.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.150
It's coating my tongue and it's absolutely
delicious.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:25.450
It's like a sweet, it's like a sweet, nice
and sweet apple flavor.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.840
And you're getting these hints of that oak-aging.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:40.590
And it's very smooth, wow.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.060
I'm getting like a caramel.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.950
And like a little bit of a coating, like a
smooth coating on the sides of my tongue.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.850
But this is unbelievable, this took me by
surprise.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.490
This is fantastic, and actually last night
they have this Iceman, they have another one

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.490
called Strawman.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.009
And I actually drank it last night with my
wife and it has this, like this, almost like

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.009
this slight tart cherry to it.

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.470
It's not an ice cider so it's not actually
as smooth as it would be.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.310
But it was very good and very delicious, again
sorry for the noise.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.450
Definitely check this out.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.170
This is a very different cider and this is
something that we have a bunch of.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.000
But come check it out for the holiday season,
bring it to somebody's house.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.830
Bring it to my house, and I will enjoy it
with you.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.500
I hope you like it as much as I do.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.790
Enjoy.
