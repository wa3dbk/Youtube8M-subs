00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:08.086
An important message from Mod MMG
Mark Gerhard, Jagex CEO

00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:13.833
Hi guys, my name's Mark Gerhard, many of you already know me as Mod MMG, I'm the CEO of Jagex, the makers of RuneScape

00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:18.420
and today I'd like to ask you for just a few minutes of your time to talk to you about a very important update

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:19.941
that affects the future of your game.

00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:24.538
Since launch more than a decade ago, RuneScape has been struggling with gold farming.

00:00:24.573 --> 00:00:29.259
We've made some significant improvements to this in the last couple of years and I'm very proud to say,

00:00:29.294 --> 00:00:31.695
in the past couple of months, the game has largely been bot free,

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.560
which has significantly impacted their ability to run their illegal businesses effectively.

00:00:37.777 --> 00:00:43.209
This year alone, we have removed over 3.7 trillion gp from their bank.

00:00:43.244 --> 00:00:48.961
And also banned over 1.1 million gold farming member accounts.

00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:58.426
However, despite these significant blows, gold farming continues to survive and undermine the economy and harm the community.

00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:05.756
We still see 150 - 170 billion gp injected into the game, each and every day.

00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:12.632
The inconvenient truth is, that our research has highlighted that 40 - 50%

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:17.160
of our current active player base on any given month are buying gold from gold farmers.

00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:24.015
It's no wonder with demand so high and widespread that despite our very best efforts,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.820
we've been unable to be 100% successful at eradicating this problem.

00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:35.692
We've been thinking long and hard about how to permanently resolve this issue and the answer is actually relatively simple.

00:01:35.727 --> 00:01:41.252
The solution not only tackles gold farming at its very source, stabilizes the economy

00:01:41.287 --> 00:01:49.420
and crucially allows players to benefit most by unlocking the value in their account and be direct beneficiaries of their own hard work.

00:01:49.455 --> 00:01:53.676
Today, I'm very proud to announce, the launch of the RuneScape Bonds.

00:01:53.711 --> 00:02:01.916
Bonds are the equivalent of a tradable membership item that can be freely gifted or traded for any other tradable in game item.

00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:09.645
They can also be redeemed for spins, RuneCoins, RuneFest tickets and in November, even donated to charity.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:16.140
This system allows existing players to freely trade their in game wealth with any other player that wants it

00:02:16.175 --> 00:02:19.753
effectively cutting out gold farmers and destroying their business at the same time.

00:02:19.788 --> 00:02:25.549
Therefore on the flip side, any player can now pay for their membership using their in game wealth.

00:02:25.584 --> 00:02:29.983
Bonds also include a gold sink which will really help the economy to recover.

00:02:30.018 --> 00:02:39.658
This update follows months of careful consideration, analysis and discussion and I know this is a great solution that will benefit all our players.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:45.471
Alongside our other initiatives and with your help, we're going to wipe out gold farming for good.

00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:50.152
If you'd like to find out how bonds will work for you, please take a look at our website.

00:02:50.187 --> 00:02:54.552
Guys, this is absolutely the right thing to do for the long term health of this game.

00:02:54.587 --> 00:02:58.919
Thank you for taking the time to listen to me today and thank you for your support.

00:02:58.954 --> 00:03:00.072
God bless you.
