00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.660
 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.670
The first time I saw the ocean I must
have been like five years old.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.180
It was just before we boarded ferry for
our yearly family holiday on Vlieland..

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.730
one of the small islands just north
of the Dutch coast.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.710
I clearly remember that moment.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.710
I was overwelmed. I never imagined anything could be vast..

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.710
.. and I just loved it

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.340
For a child Vlieland is a wonderful place..

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.460
.. the sea the beach the dunes..

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.530
..the sense of freedom. It was the
highlight of my year and it still is.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.790
Ever since that moment, almost sixty years
ago now..

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.010
I've been getting on that fairy
again and again..

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.450
.. and I still get that buzz.  It's a
tiny island..

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.070
..but it had a profound impact on my life
and my work.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.070
Being there puts the world in
perspective.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.680
 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.980
Even hazy days like this one have been
the inspiration for quite a few paintings.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.840
It's simply beautiful in every
season and every kind of whether.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.840
 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.900
When I was younger I spent my summers
working plein-air..

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.900
..rain or shine.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.230
Now that I'm a little older I don't do that anymore..

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.230
I just watch and take pictures.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.310
W hen I get home I do my photoshop magic..

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.989
 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.989
 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.049
What a life...
