00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.380
Ninh explains - The Rules of Basketball

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.980
The object of the game is for your team to
score more points than the opposing team.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.519
Teams are made up of 15 players, with 5 players
on the basketball court at any one time.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.200
They consist of two forwards, two guards and
a center.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.670
The game starts with a tip off.
Once someone has won possession of the ball,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.060
they have up to 24 seconds to shoot the ball
towards the opponent’s basket.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.460
These baskets are 10 feet above the ground
on a court that’s generally about 94ft long

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.870
by 50ft wide (in the NBA), and varies depending
on where you play.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.519
To move the ball up the court, you can either
pass the ball to a teammate … or dribble

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.409
the ball, where you bounce the ball up and
down repeatedly whilst in motion.

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:46.079
To score points, a player must shoot the ball
into the opponents’ basket.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.579
You get two points for any shots scored within
this arc.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.039
If a player scores from a shot outside this
arc, this scores three points.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.979
Any free throws that are awarded to your team
scores 1 point.

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.179
Failure to shoot the ball within 24 seconds
results in a shot clock violation, and the

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.570
other team is awarded possession of the ball.
The opposing team will try and take the ball

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.820
off you by either blocking shots, rebounding
a missed shot, or by stealing the ball away

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.280
from an opposing player so that they can score
themselves.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.580
The game is played in 4 x 12 minute quarters
in the NBA, 4 x 10 minute quarters Internationally,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.970
or 2 x 20 minute halves in NCAA.
The highest score at the end of time wins.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.000
There are no ties in Basketball, so if the
scores are tied at the end of regulation,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.390
overtime periods will be played to determine
the winner.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.120
Wow, that was the shortest video ever!

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.460
Unfortunately, it doesn’t stop there. Whilst
Basketball is an easy game to understand,

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.610
I’ve just explained the basic concept of
the game.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.350
There are a lot of things in Basketball that
you’re not allowed to do.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.390
So to make it easy for you to understand,
there are generally two types of things you

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.070
can’t do:
Violations and Fouls.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.150
Violations are generally called when you break
one of the rules. The main violations include:

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.500
Shot clock violation – as earlier stated,
your team has 24 seconds in which to shoot

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.150
the ball. If you’ve not shot the ball within
this time, a shot-clock violation is called

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.179
and the ball is awarded to the other team.
Double Dribble – In basketball, you are

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.020
only allowed to dribble the ball and stop
once. If a player then begins to dribble again,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.140
this is known as double dribble, and the ball
is awarded to the other team.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.420
Travelling – If a player takes too many
steps without dribbling the ball, this is

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.880
travelling, and (surprise surprise) the ball
is awarded to the other team.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.819
Three in the key – A player cannot stay
in the key, which is this section of the court,

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.280
for more than three seconds.
Charging – A violation in which an attacking

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.420
players runs into a stationary defender. Possession
of the ball is then awarded to the defending

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.450
team.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.940
There are other violations that I’ve included
a brief description of here, but the ones

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.709
I previously mentioned are the ones you’re
most likely to encounter in the game.

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:47.000
Eight-Second Violation - After a basket, the
offensive team has eight seconds to get the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.260
ball over midcourt.
Palming - A violation in which a player moves

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.490
his hand under the ball and scoops it while
dribbling.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.890
Goaltending - When a defensive player interferes
illegally with a shot on the rim or on a downward

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:48.270
path to the hoop; the shot is assumed in and
the offensive team receives the basket.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.500
Basket interference - Interfering with the
basket rim during a shot.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.830
Back-Court Violation - Touching the ball in
the backcourt after it has entered the frontcourt

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.040
and was not last touched by the other team.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.530
FOULS
Fouls are the most complicated thing to understand

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.530
in Basketball, but I’ll try and explain
this in the easiest way I know how.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.349
Personal Fouls occur when a player commits
illegal contact against another player.

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.500
Imagine two players, an attacking player with
the ball, and a defending player without the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.849
ball.
Now imagine two giant cylinders that surround

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.980
them that extend from the floor to the ceiling.
Neither of those two players is allowed to

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.250
encroach into each other’s cylindrical space.
If an attacking player makes contact with

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.260
a defender in his space, then it’s called
an offensive foul against the attacker.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.040
If a defender makes contact with an attacker
in his space, then it’s called a defensive

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.180
foul against the defender.
Any foul in the act of shooting results in

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.989
free throws being awarded to the attacking
team.

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.340
Two shots for fouls inside the arc and three
shots for fouls outside the arc.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.349
If the shot went in and the shooter was fouled,
the points they scored count and they are

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:48.890
awarded one extra shot.
Any team that commits 5 or more fouls in any

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.250
quarter will have free throws awarded against
them per subsequent foul, and

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.840
Any one player who has racked up 5 fouls (internationally)
or 6 fouls in the NBA is fouled out – and

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.140
can no longer participate in the rest of the
game.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.920
Flagrant Fouls –
Flagrant Fouls are severe fouls that occur

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.819
when a player has made violent contact against
another player. This always results in the

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.750
other team being awarded two free throws.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.840
Technical Fouls – Are fouls that don’t
fit the description of either a personal or

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.670
flagrant foul. Technical fouls can be awarded
for fighting, unsportsmanlike conduct, or

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.820
abuse from players and coaches against referees.
Two technical fouls equals an automatic ejection

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.820
from 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.820
the game.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.680
This is a lot to take in, especially understanding
how the fouls work, but as you watch or play

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.400
basketball, the rules will become clear.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.480

please like, share with your friends, rate

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.550
and comment. If you’re also on Reddit, please
post this video and discuss. It takes me ages

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.500
to make one of these videos and good karma
is always appreciated.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.540
Enjoy Basketball!

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.500
