00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.350
On behalf of expertvillage.com, I am Jennifer
with a Perfect Fit Alterations in Burleson,

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:15.580
Texas. Our phone number is (817) 447-3522.
Now we are finishing up with our pet coat.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.660
We've put on the one side of the Velcro and
we are going to cut a piece to go on the other

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:37.570
side so that we have completed our project.
This piece is going to go right here,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.001
put the foot down at the edge of the Velcro.
Now remember this backstitching right here

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:47.350
is very important because you are going to
pull this coat on and off right here. This

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:54.380
is going to be used quite a bit; a lot of
stress on that area. You can do a flying backstitch

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:04.030
right here at the end, stop at the corner
with your needle down, another bit of backstitching,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:39.461
go to the edge, backstitch the edge, turn
your fabric, we are almost done and backstitch

00:01:39.461 --> 00:01:58.530
on the end. Now we've got our fasteners to
fasten the pet coat on to the pet. Now this

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.249
Velcro right here you see how that is hanging
off the edge there but we can trim that away.

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:09.420
It doesn't hurt Velcro to trim it and now
we've got our pet coat fastened.
