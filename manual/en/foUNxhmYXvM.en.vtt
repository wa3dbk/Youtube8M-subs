Hey guys so this video is gonna suck

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.500
just letting you know

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.360
so i was supposed to film today and hopefully post a video by tomorrow

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.520
which we all know is FRIDAYYY

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.180
ok so that joke got old fast

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.160
that was supposed to be like, you know a fast car sound

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.860
like Doppler effect...

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.980
 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.860
science.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.240
ANYWAY, so as i was saying, until i so rudely interrupted....

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.000
HI

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.900
...myself, i was going to film today but i needed a costume, and that costume was going to be delivered to me,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.500
but sadly that didnt happen

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.000
i dont want to point any fingers or name names, so lets just call this company, Fa-dex

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.960
i paid fadex extra money just so that they could overnight it to me

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.960
and three days later i still dont have it

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.100
which honestly wouldn't have been that bad if they atleast let me know

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.520
but no i tracked it and it said it was coming so i waited,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.680
i waited by the window like a dog

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.840
(dog sounds)

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.400
a badass dog

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.680
(dog sounds)

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.700
i even woke up extra early just so that i could receive the box myself

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.000
because aparently if you dont answer the door they're just gonna leave your package underneath your welcome mat

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.400
no matter how big the package is

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.080
and im sorry i dont want to sound like a complainer but im just fed up with fadex

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.220
next time im just gonna use a different delivery service like... UPs

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.780
but really the real reason why this upset me so much is because ive been trying to post videos

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.240
more frequently for you guys and i put so much time into planning and making sure this video would go out by this weekend...

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.080
but sadly you're stuck with this crap

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.140
sorry

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.640
but i promise you that as soon as i get my costume i will film edit and post the video as soon as possible

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.920
for those of you that want to know what the video is going to be about well...

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.760
(EPIC MUSIC INTENSIFIES)

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.520
it has nothing to do with that clip,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.860
i just got interrupted again

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.420
HI

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.180

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.860

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.480

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.600

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.580

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.780
