00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.290
This episode of Dnews was proudly made possible
by the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.540
It’s not just a sedan, it’s a Subaru.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.410
A new study finds that women are better drivers
than men!

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.009
Finally, science gives us a win!

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:23.250
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and we’ve
all heard the old adage that women are terrible

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.250
drivers.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.390
The problem with that, though - aside from
being horribly sexist - is that it’s just

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.390
not true.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.260
According to a 2012 study, men are responsible
for more traffic violations than women, in

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.399
almost every single category - from reckless
driving, to failure to yield, to speeding.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.070
Even scarier, is the fact that 80% of all
fatal and serious car crashes are caused by

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.070
men.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.230
And when it comes to DUI violations, male
drivers outnumber females 3 to 1.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.429
As far as statistics go, those are pretty
damning - but a new study out of Kansas State

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:57.409
University, breaks it down even further - showing
exactly what kinds of crashes are more likely

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.269
to be caused by which gender.

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.789
Researchers looked at data from every motor
vehicle crash in Kansas from 2007-2011, to

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:09.540
see if there were any gender discrepancies
amongst drivers age 16-24.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.360
Past studies have repeatedly shown that age
is the single more important factor in highway

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.360
safety.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.149
Young drivers and old drivers, are involved
in more car crashes than any other age group.

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.360
But there are some new statistics in this
study, that shed light on the specific behaviors

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.630
of men and women.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.789
Young females, for example, are 66% more likely
to wear a seatbelt than young males, and 28%

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.009
more likely to drive on a restricted license.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.630
Women are also involved in more pedestrian
collisions and crashes at intersections, while

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.710
men are more likely to be involved in off-road
crashes.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.950
Interestingly, time of day also seems to makes
a big difference.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.689
Young men, for example, seem to be worse night
drivers - as they’re significantly more

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.450
likely to be involved in an accident after
sunset.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.759
They also get into more crashes on the weekend
- while young women, are the opposite - they’re

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.450
more likely to have an accident on the weekdays.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.179
It’s not totally clear what the reason is
behind these differences - but a lot of the

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.899
statistics in this study appear to be interconnected.

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.820
For example, the fact that men are involved
in more off-road crashes, could be linked

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.409
to the fact that they’re more likely to
speed on rural roads.

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:13.780
Of course, men and women DO have different
behaviors and attitudes when it comes to driving,

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.000
but those differences seem to be especially
pronounced, the younger you are.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.520
Let’s face it - if there’s one thing teenagers
are good at, it’s making poor decisions.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.540
While we’re on the topic of driving, we
wanna extend a quick thank you to Subaru,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.810
for making this episode possible.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.120
And especially the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy
- it offers a safer and more dynamic ride

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.390
than ever before, and it goes where other
sedans simply can’t.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.920
In the meantime, let us know in the comments
below what you think of this study - and if

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.750
you agree with the notion that women are better
drivers than men.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.120
That’s all for me, but as always - thank
you guys for watching!
