00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.330
Hi I'm Trish an organic gardener I grow
organically.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.330
For a healthy and safe food supply, for a
clean and sustainable environment,

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.410
for an enjoyable and rewarding
experience.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.980
Have you always wanted to compost but have been afraid

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.380
of brown green ratios or nervous about
turning your

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.599
compost pile? Or maybe you're in an urban area.

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.160
We have a method of composting that's
probably perfect for you.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.939
The Bokashi method is a Japanese
technique

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.910
used with anaerobic fermentation.
Traditional composting

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.430
is an aerobic process, meaning it needs
oxygen.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.610
That's why you need to turn the pile.
Fermentation is an

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.380
anaerobic process meaning to keep the
air away

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.680
therefore no pile turning and the
secret to this is

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.020
EM or effective microorganisms.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.100
This mix of lactic acid, yeast

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.870
and phototrophic bacteria was perfected
by doctor

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.390
Teruo Higa, a professor of
Horticulture at the University

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.549
of the Ryukyus in Okinawa.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.860
This Bokashi composting kit has
everything you need to start composting.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.520
It contains an airtight bucket with a
spout for draining of the Bokashi tea

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.079
and a bag of the Bokashi starter.
You can order single bags of the starter

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:20.810
as well.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.810
To start just add a layer of about three
inches a food scraps to the bucket.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.509
Make sure and chop up any large pieces
before adding. with Bokashi composting

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.590
you can even add meat, cheese and small bones.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.119
Continue layering and adding the starter.

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.029
Sprinkle the top layer with starter and
stir to coat the food.

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:47.630
Be generous with the starter if you're
composting tough foods

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.929
like meat, bones and coffee grounds.
Normally you would use a third of a

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:52.689
bag for

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.380
each full bucket. Place a plate

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.130
or some other flat object on top to make
sure that air doesn't get to the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.549
fermenting scraps.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.060
Then put the lid on tightly. Make sure it's

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.929
sealed. Every few days

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.110
open the spout and drain off the Rich
Bokashi tea.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.970
Dilute this at a rate of 1 tablespoon to
one gallon of water

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.480
and use it on your house plants

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.190
and in the garden. Repeat this process
until your bucket is full

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.770
and then set it aside for about two
weeks to further ferment.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.150
I like having two buckets going at one
time so that I don't have to

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.920
stop and wait. Don't add water because excessive liquid can make the mix

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.640
rot. Also you want to keep your bucket out of the sun. When the bucket is ready

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.680
the food won't really look that
different

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.210
but it will have a sweet and sour pickle
aroma and maybe some white growth on

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.910
the top.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.070
These are all good signs. If it smells foul,

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.340
something went wrong and you're gonna have to either add more starter

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.970
or throw it out and start all over. This one smells good.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.400
After the two weeks did a 12-inch trench.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.630
Drain off the tea, then bury the Bokashi.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.120
If you live in a rural area you might
have to bury it

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.410
a little bit deeper. wash the bucket
thoroughly

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.830
and then you're ready to repeat the
process. After two weeks

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.900
the Bokashi will be broken down even
farther and then you can plant whatever

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.780
plants you'd like right on top.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.480
If you growing in containers you can use
your Bokashi

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.700
by filling a container a third of the
way with potting soil.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.720
Fill it another third with Bokashi.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.340
Mix them together thoroughly and top
with the final third potting soil.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.460
Cover with plastic to encourage and
anaerobic environment.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.360
Wait two weeks and then plant. You can
also add your Bokashi to your regular

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.060
aerobic compost pile.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.250

"Bokashi Composting"

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.750
