00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.410
When linking to a media volume, you can choose
to consolidate the media that you would like

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.540
to use.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.210
The term consolidate means that you will be
creating a new clip within a bin that will

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.450
point to .mxf media inside an Avid MediaFiles
folder structure.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.190
Here’s a quick example of what I’m talking
about.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.460
Navigate to the file menu and choose Link
to AMA volume.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.330
Click on the root directory level of the volume,
and press the open button.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.620
The clips from the volume will automatically
appear within the selected bin window.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.839
Select the clips that you would like to keep,
and right click on one of them.

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.639
Choose Consolidate / Transcode from the contextual
menu.

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:52.639
Select the drive you would like to consolidate
to.

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:55.109
Then press the consolidate button.

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:00.239
A dialogue will appear which affect how the
new clips will be named.

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.780
Then press okay.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.040
This will create new clips that no longer
have a link icon.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.780
Which means at this point you can eject or
remove the volume and have access to your

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.240
consolidated media.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.990
However, notice the clips there were linked
to the volume are now offline.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.700
Now, it’s also possible to consolidate just
a portion of a linked clip.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.960
To do this, you need to first create a subclip.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.950
It’s best to create a new bin called subclips.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.070
Then, load a linked clip into the source window.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.540
Mark in and out points for the area that you
would like to keep.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.190
Click in the source window area and drag the
clip area into the sub-clip bin.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.190
Notice that the icon has changed into a smaller
sub-clip icon.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.420
Right click on the sub-clip and choose consolidate
/ transcode.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.440
Now, you’ll notice an option for handle
length.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.700
This value represents extra frames outside
your original in-out points as a safety net

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.689
in case you need some extra media.

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.870
Go ahead and press the consolidate button.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.750
So now you have a new clip that has been ingested
into the Avid MediaFiles folder on your hard-drive.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.930
And what’s interesting is the Avid will
also create a new sub-clip representing your

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.629
original in-out points without handles.

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:41.290
So, it’s up to you, it’s safe to delete
these extra sub-clips, and you’ll be safe

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.200
with your newly consolidated media.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.329
If you use this workflow, it will provide
you with additional options for media managing

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.120
your media later.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.459
And I recommend this workflow if you plan
on working with longer projects.

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.870
Otherwise, you will need to manage the media
on your own by keeping track of the locations

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.329
of all your volumes.

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.420
Okay, now you have the basics of consolidating
media.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.489
