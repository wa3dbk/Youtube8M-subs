Hi Toby Danylchuk with 39 Celsius Web Marketing
Consulting and thsi week's online marketint

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.900
tip we're going to talk about
how to get Google start sending you traffic

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:45.190
sooner on any new content you produce on your
website or blog.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.300
Getting your content into Google's index quicker
is a great way to start getting traffic and

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.650
leads to your website sooner.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.970
And I'm going to show you how to notify Google
you have new content.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.899
So the reason we're notifying Google that
we have new content is that we want to rank

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.740
sooner rather than later and get traffic
sooner rather than later on any of the new

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.470
content that you produce.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.710
Google does a pretty good job of inexing the
web, but

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.799
depending on how often you produce new content
on your site, it could take Google some time

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.889
to find the new content and
put it into their index.

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:25.209
So we can help them.

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:30.899
It is really quite simple, what you need to
do is create a GOogle Webmaster Account, if

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.929
you
have nto already done so.

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:40.389
Creating a Google Webmaster Account has many
additional benefits too besides just notifying

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:41.770
Google you have new content.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.409
If you're serious about online marketing,
and your website, and marketing your website

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.829
you really need to set this up.

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.849
For example, Google will notify if they have
issues with your site, perhaps there is

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:59.899
malware, or they are finding 404 page errors,
or they can't load the site.

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.209
In addition to that, they will tell you
if there are issues with Title tags and Meta

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:09.429
Descriptions, they will also give you feedback
on page load times, which

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.689
is a variable to rank your site, and rank
content on your site.

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:19.610
So, ok back to submitting your content, which
is what we really want to talk about here,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.040
once you've set up and
verified Google WEbmaster Tools Account, you

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.019
need to go to the Health section on the left
hand side, open that up

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:36.379
and go to Fetch, Fetch as Google, and here
is where you're going to submit the last part

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.040
of your url of your new
content.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.530
All you have to do is take the last part of
the URL, everything past the .com and paste

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.150
it into the box.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.150
Then
hit the red fetch button, Google will then

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.939
go out and fetch the page.

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.730
This process may take a second or two, but
not

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.730
long.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.709
Then you will have the option, it will ask
you if you want to submit this page ot the

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.060
index, or submit all linked
pages.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.870
Unless your site is new, just submit the current
page to the index.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.299
If you submit all pages that are linked to
that page

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.299
in essence you are submitting your entire
site, and if your site has been around they

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.099
have probably already indexed
the majority of the pages.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.640
Again the goal is to get the content into
Google's index as quickly as possible.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.790
So give it a try.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.659
Right now go create Google Webmasater Account,
submit any new content you have, and while

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.970
you're in there
check out the data they have for your site.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.799
And if you just created the account you might
have to wait a couple of days

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.220
for it to populate some of the data in Google
Webmaster Tools.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.519
