00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.040
(Erickson:) We've always had a very strong interest 
at Penn State in taking the results

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.630
of our research and applying it.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.220
That goes back to the earliest days of the University 
when our first president was engaged in

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.880
various kinds of agricultural research that was

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.280
then taken forward to improve agriculture in the country.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.530

(Foley:) When we look at the world today, 
we are not isolated into our individual nation states.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.480
We have international corporations; we have international universities; the world in a sense, is becoming a smaller place.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.180
As a result, we have to engage in that.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.980
(Erickson:) Penn State is one of the finest universities in the world.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.770
We do a tremendous amount of cutting edge research here.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.890
(Foley:) We are now enrolling 86,000 students on a resident basis.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.900
We have an additional 10,000 students who study online.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.380
We do funded research on the order of $800 million a year.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.940
(Adewumi:) We receive about $300 million, give or take, 
from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.280
In turn, we generate more than $18 billion in economic activity.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.040
So, to me, that is a lot of multiplying effect.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.330
(Hanes:) What is unique about this university, 
unique among any university in this nation,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.300
is that, throughout the state, we serve the communities that have invited us in

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.180
to be an education provider and an economic engine.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.220
We have 24 campuses including the University Park campus

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.680
(Crane:) and 160 different majors, so whatever you want to do, 
Penn State does it.

♪ (upbeat music) ♪

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.480
(Crane:) If we think of poverty reduction, 
we think of climate change,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.640
lots of the issues that we're interested in, have a global impact.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.680
They're too big for one person, one group, one research group, to work on

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.690
and so you really need collaboration.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.810
What International brings to it is a very different perpsective 
on the same problem.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.820
(Song:) The energy and environmental issues really have no national borders.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.830
We work with faculty members and researchers 
in several other countries

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.660
For example, we have developed a joint energy center in China

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.940
where we work in areas important to both the U.S. and China.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.480
(Adewumi:) There is no question that faculty normally work 
with colleagues from around the world.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.430
It happens accidentally, incidentally, they meet at a conference and they begin to work.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.070
(Crane:) In the past, once a particular research project ended, 
those connections died.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:48.100
Part of the advantage of focusing on institutional connections 
is that connection stays.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.130
That global society is here and everything we do

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.140
is going to be dictated more and more at the global level, 
less and less at the local level.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.150
(Foley:) I think it makes much more sense for us to 
work with an organization, an institution,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.200
that's already in the country and has been educating in that country

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.210
and understands their culture and their education culture.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.240
(Erickson:) The opportunity to partner with 
other institutions is critically important.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.880
because no one institution, including ours, 
has all of the resources 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.730
that are necessary to research and to address 
the significant global challenges that we face.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.980
But, working together, we can combine those resources 
to make a big difference in the world.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:43.840
