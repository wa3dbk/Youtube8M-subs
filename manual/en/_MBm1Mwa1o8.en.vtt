00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:07.170
Hi my name is Joe, I'm at Break Time Billiards
in Wilmington North Carolina. Today I'm going

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.010
to explain to you the rules for playing nine
ball. Nine ball is played with nine balls

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:21.460
racked in a diamond shape. The person will
break the balls and then if he makes a ball

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.310
he will continue shooting, shooting at the
lowest numbered ball first. He has to hit

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.850
the lowest numbered ball. If he does this
and another ball should accidentally fall

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.180
in, that ball counts and he continues shooting.
He will continue shooting until he misses

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.281
and then the next person will come up and
he will take his turn at the table. Whoever

00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:50.079
makes the nine ball is the winner of the game.
Whether you make the nine ball by a combination

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:57.250
like the one into the nine, or whether you
make the nine last. You win the game. Now

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.530
when the person breaks if he does not make
a ball in the break, the next person or the

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.459
next shot, after the break, whether it be
the person who just broke and make a ball,

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:18.399
he has the option of pushing out. If he pushes
out to any place on the table then his opponent

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:24.990
has the choice of whether he will shoot that
shot or whether he will give that shot back

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.340
to the person who broke the balls. If it's
your turn to shoot and you don't have a shot

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.179
that you want to shoot at, because it's too
hard to make the ball or it's too hard to

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.390
play a shape you can do something called the
safe. What you do there is you have to make

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.789
a good hit on the lowest numbered ball and
you have to send that ball to a rail or another

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.939
ball to the rail or the cue ball to the rail.
If you do this then you made a legal safety.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.840
What you are trying to do is to put the cue
ball behind some blocking balls or put the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.689
object ball in such a position that it can
not be hit head on with the cue ball, it has

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:13.680
to be kicked by going to a rail. They play
a thing called Texas express, if in Texas

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.490
express if you are shooting at a ball and
you were to foul, a foul would be not hitting

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.920
the lowest numbered ball, scratching in one
of the six pockets, knocking the ball off

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:33.180
the table, knocking the cue ball off the table.
Then the person that is his turn to shoot

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.060
will come to the table with cue ball in hand.
What that means is he can put the ball anywhere

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.510
on the table that he wants to and then proceed
to shoot. So those are pretty much the rules

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.370
of nine ball and as I said you shoot them
in rotation, you shoot the lowest numbered

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.690
ball first and whoever makes the nine ball
wins.
