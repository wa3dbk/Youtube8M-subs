00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:01.488
- Hello there, you lovely gem.

00:00:01.488 --> 00:00:02.503
I hope you're doing well.

00:00:02.503 --> 00:00:04.108
Personally, I am doing very well.

00:00:04.108 --> 00:00:06.506
I am feeling better than
I have in a long time.

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:07.482
For the first time in a while

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.309
I'm not feeling super
stressed about everything.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.037
I'm actually feeling very motivated,

00:00:11.037 --> 00:00:13.130
and I'm excited about making things again.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.548
I have taken a long break
of not making things,

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:19.365
but I'm ready to get back
in the stream of creativity.

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:22.245
Partially I believe
that I felt unmotivated

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:23.667
and didn't want to make things

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:25.862
because I tried to force
myself to make things

00:00:25.862 --> 00:00:26.715
when I didn't want to.

00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:28.381
I made it feel like an obligation.

00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:30.088
And it just never worked out.

00:00:30.088 --> 00:00:32.200
Another thing that I did
was I would plan so many

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.643
projects and ideas that
it was physically too much

00:00:34.643 --> 00:00:37.160
for me to do in the time
frame that I gave myself.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.906
And I ended up not doing anything at all,

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:41.061
and then I just felt more unmotivated.

00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:43.539
And it was just not a good deal.

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:44.941
I believe I'm in a really good place now,

00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:46.161
and I'm glad to be in the present.

00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:48.903
And I'm excited to see
what the future holds.

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:50.670
Time is truly a weird thing.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.983
This second right now is now in the past,

00:00:53.983 --> 00:00:55.941
and it was once the future.

00:00:57.693 --> 00:00:58.730
If you've been watching me for awhile

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.111
then you know that I was in a car accident

00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:02.570
when I was 14, in June of 2013.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.625
What I learned from that car accident

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:04.967
is that your life is temporary

00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:07.080
and you should only do
what makes you truly happy.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.229
Even more recently, in
January of this year,

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.444
I was in another car accident.

00:01:12.444 --> 00:01:13.500
What a life.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.734
The second one wasn't nearly
as bad as the first one.

00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:18.294
The first one, I wasn't
even supposed to live.

00:01:18.294 --> 00:01:21.749
The second one, I just had a concussion

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:22.906
and it was all OK.

00:01:22.906 --> 00:01:24.492
Even though the second
car accident wasn't nearly

00:01:24.492 --> 00:01:25.547
as bad as the first one,

00:01:25.547 --> 00:01:27.316
I still learned something very important,

00:01:27.316 --> 00:01:28.900
and that was that no everything is as bad

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.140
as you make it out to be.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.662
And that goes with everything.

00:01:31.662 --> 00:01:34.019
It goes with making new friends.

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:37.615
It goes with going to public places,

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:38.855
stepping out of your comfort zone

00:01:38.855 --> 00:01:40.165
in any way shape or form.

00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:42.318
For me, I was afraid of driving

00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:44.126
because of the first car wreck.

00:01:44.126 --> 00:01:46.068
And now I'm able to drive

00:01:46.068 --> 00:01:48.242
because the second car
accident wasn't as bad.

00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:50.517
And hopefully I'll get my license soon.

00:01:50.517 --> 00:01:52.793
The funny thing about the day
of the second car accident

00:01:52.793 --> 00:01:55.068
was that my sister and I
were at a Mexican restaurant

00:01:55.068 --> 00:01:56.754
and the waiter brought us free flan.

00:01:56.754 --> 00:01:57.770
If you don't know what flan is,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.330
it's a Mexican dessert
and it's very tasty.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.524
From that I learned that
sometimes the universe

00:02:02.524 --> 00:02:03.743
will give you free flan,

00:02:03.743 --> 00:02:05.491
sometimes it'll give you a car collision.

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:06.771
Sometimes it'll give you free flan

00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:08.518
and a car collision all in one day.

00:02:08.518 --> 00:02:09.838
You just have to learn to take everything

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:11.037
the universe gives you

00:02:11.037 --> 00:02:12.988
and use it to grow as a person.

00:02:12.988 --> 00:02:14.186
Whatever bad thing you're going through,

00:02:14.186 --> 00:02:15.121
you can get through it.

00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:16.604
Like I said, you can use
anything the universe

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:18.453
throws at you to grow as a person.

00:02:18.453 --> 00:02:19.448
One day you may even look back

00:02:19.448 --> 00:02:21.053
on the bad thing that you're
going through right now

00:02:21.053 --> 00:02:22.740
and you'll be thankful
that you went through it

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.243
because it helped mold you into the person

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:26.600
that you will be, or are.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.900
Whatever, you get my point.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.238
I'm Elijah Emerald and you're a gem.
