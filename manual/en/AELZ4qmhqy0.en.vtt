[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:06.026
MIKE SPINELLI: Hey, welcome
to Drive Central.

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:08.876
Put down your crack pipes, wipe
off your Insane Clown

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:11.686
Posse makeup, and get ready for
some previews of what's

00:00:11.686 --> 00:00:13.046
coming up on Drive this week.

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:14.866
Hit us up on @drive
on Twitter.

00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:19.096
And we're also on Facebook
at drivetv, so do

00:00:19.096 --> 00:00:20.206
that Facebook thing.

00:00:20.206 --> 00:00:23.076
Anyway, on RideApart this week,
you know Roland Sands,

00:00:23.076 --> 00:00:27.886
the ex-racer who became a bike
builder and also fashion

00:00:27.886 --> 00:00:28.726
designer?--

00:00:28.726 --> 00:00:31.256
that's where Wes Siler went.

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:34.826
And, apparently, he went to hoon
around in the dirt with

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:37.146
some Harley Davidsons.

00:00:37.146 --> 00:00:41.086
Did he grow an equally fat,
what do you call, Harley

00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:42.226
Davidson tummy?

00:00:42.226 --> 00:00:44.181
I don't know what that means.

00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:45.426
[BLEEP].

00:00:45.426 --> 00:00:46.576
Go ahead-- just watch.

00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:47.826
I don't know.

00:01:07.946 --> 00:01:09.686
That's RideApart,
every Monday.

00:01:09.686 --> 00:01:12.896
And on Tuesday, Driven
is back.

00:01:12.896 --> 00:01:13.376
See?

00:01:13.376 --> 00:01:15.306
It's back, finally.

00:01:15.306 --> 00:01:18.846
JF Went to Sweden to visit the
Koenigsegg factory and found

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:21.766
out a lot of things
about Koenigsegg.

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:24.820
Why don't you check
out some of them?

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.196
MALE SPEAKER: When I started
the company, I was only 22.

00:01:27.196 --> 00:01:27.996
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:27.996 --> 00:01:32.866
MALE SPEAKER: So I've always
had a keen interest for

00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:36.876
engineering technical things
and worked with cars, and

00:01:36.876 --> 00:01:40.096
mopeds, and boats, and
electronical things, but I

00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:43.926
never really started
it officially.

00:01:43.926 --> 00:01:46.286
So we have, of course, a bunch
of engineers here that are

00:01:46.286 --> 00:01:47.346
trained engineers.

00:01:47.346 --> 00:01:52.516
But I'm more like an event
or something like that.

00:01:55.946 --> 00:01:57.886
MIKE SPINELLI: That's Driven
every Tuesday.

00:01:57.886 --> 00:02:02.296
And this week on Chris Harris On
Cars, Chris does something

00:02:02.296 --> 00:02:04.206
obviously completely mental.

00:02:04.206 --> 00:02:05.296
I don't know what it is,
but you're going to

00:02:05.296 --> 00:02:07.592
find out right now.

00:02:07.592 --> 00:02:11.520
At least part of it.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.512
CHRIS HARRIS: Dear God.

00:02:15.512 --> 00:02:17.508
All right, that is
really fast.

00:02:27.987 --> 00:02:32.478
It's just got so much torque.

00:02:32.478 --> 00:02:34.256
MIKE SPINELLI: That's
Chris Harris

00:02:34.256 --> 00:02:35.616
On Cars every Wednesday.

00:02:35.616 --> 00:02:41.576
And on Big Muscle this
week, Mike Musto

00:02:41.576 --> 00:02:43.716
drives a 440-6 pack--

00:02:43.716 --> 00:02:45.516
not that-- that's the engine.

00:02:45.516 --> 00:02:50.276
It's the 1970 Plymouth
Barracuda 440-6 pack.

00:02:50.276 --> 00:02:51.526
Take a look.

00:03:02.454 --> 00:03:03.916
MIKE SPINELLI: That's
Big Muscle's

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:05.176
marinara here on Drive.

00:03:05.176 --> 00:03:10.126
And this week on Shakedown, Leo
Parente is out in Detroit

00:03:10.126 --> 00:03:12.606
ahead of the Belle
Isle Grand Prix.

00:03:12.606 --> 00:03:15.366
You'll find out what he's doing
out there pretty soon.

00:03:15.366 --> 00:03:17.676
But you will definitely
get his pointed racing

00:03:17.676 --> 00:03:19.236
analysis this week.

00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:24.726
So this has been
Drive Central.

00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:26.816
Drive safe.

00:03:26.816 --> 00:03:29.003
Keep the shiny side shiny.

00:03:29.003 --> 00:04:28.768
