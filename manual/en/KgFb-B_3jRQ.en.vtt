Craig Johnson is a combat veteran when it
comes to Kansas fisheries management. As fisheries

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.929
biologist for ElDorado Reservoir, he was first
to go through the fire with Kansas zebra mussel

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.380
infestation, and now, white perch have invaded
ElDorado as well. Between aquatic nuisance

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.859
species, drought, and limited shad production,
fishing at ElDorado has been sporadic for

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.540
the past seven years.
Fortunately though, things are looking up,

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:36.750
and Johnson expects better angling in 2011.
“The lake’s been through a lot of different

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.280
phases in the last number of years going back
to about ‘03 when zebra mussels were discovered

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.039
here. But this most recent summer, we’ve
got quite a few white perch coming on in the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.219
lake. We did have a really good shad spawn
this year, so we’ve got a lot of food in

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.220
the lake.
“Once we got past ’06, our shad production

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.340
started to pick back up. We got through the
drought cycle, we started having inflows,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.859
we got more nutrients washed into the lake,
so shad production in 07, 08, 09, and again

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.630
in 2010 continued to improve each year. So
once we got our shad back, our wipers, our

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.440
white bass, our crappie, our walleye really
started to take off and come back up to the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.730
levels that the lake was known for.”
“The lake right now for 2011 is looking

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.190
really good. Last year was the first year
of our 2-and-21 inch length limits that we

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.100
imposed on both wipers and walleye in response
to the white perch infestation here at the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.600
lake. The good thing is, we’ve got some
really good strong year classes of walleye

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.931
coming up. We stocked 200,000 fingerlings
in the lake last year, we had good shad production

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:44.530
that produced a lot of forage for those young-of-the-year
walleye to eat. I saw a lot of young-of-the-year

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.470
wipers in the lake as well, we stocked 80,000
wipers last year, and the reason for all these

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.780
stockings is to try to get numbers bolstered
up to keep control of the white perch out

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.190
here.
“Crappie populations, we don’t have great

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.250
numbers of crappie here, but the fish we do
have are of quality size, fish 13-14 inches

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.470
long aren’t uncommon, fish up to 15 inches
are seen. We don’t have great numbers of

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.390
them, but we do have enough to interest anglers,
and especially during spring spawn, crappie

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.640
anglers will do well.”
“White bass populations are looking good.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.110
As long as we can keep pretty consistent shad
production at the lake to feed our predators,

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.390
ElDorado’s in pretty good shape right now.
Give Eldorado another try this year. It’s

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.450
headed back in the right direction, and that
can mean good fishing for Kansas anglers.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.890
And remember, always Clean, Drain, and Dry
your boat, and use safe baitfish handling

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.980
practices to avoid infesting new Kansas waters
with aquatic nuisance species.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.570
