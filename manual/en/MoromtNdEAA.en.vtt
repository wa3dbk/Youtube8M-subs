Hello my friends and welcome to
another Tuesday of tutorial!

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.840
I am Leonardo Pereznieto and
I love London at night, actually

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.680
I love London anytime!

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.240
Today we will do a sketch of
the beautiful Saint Paul´s Cathedral,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.300
trying to give the night effect
with the illumination from the sides.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.000
For this we will use
a white pencil on black paper.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
First we are going to place measurements
as reference points.

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.960
And we start giving shape.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.960
Because of the perspective, I think
it will look something like this.

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.030
Having the line form,
we can start giving the light.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.020
Remember that we are drawing
in negative, normally we draw

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.630
shadowing but in this case
we are going to draw

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.549
placing the lights.
This gives a nice effect.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.039
From this particular angle
that I chose, we can see it illuminated

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.819
from the sides and the center
a little bit darker.

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:45.819
Let´s try to do this effect!

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.829
I like how it is appearing.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.300
Let´s do some soft clouds.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:26.519
I´ll correct the little tower on top because
the perspective looked to me a little bit wrong

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.519
and let´s continue with the detail.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.269
Now I see it slightly crooked, I´ll move it
just a little bit to the right,

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.909
that´s better.

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.030
Now what I see is that
the columns in the center

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.720
have too much light,
I will make them darker

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.720
with the eraser.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.170
That is better, now I am happy.
If you too are happy, please give it

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.680

And I will see you on Tuesday.
