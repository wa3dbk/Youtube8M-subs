00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:09.360
Hello friends of vlog do zack. Today with
the Canon EF 14mm f/2.8L II USM which is the

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.369
widest retilinear wide-angle lens that Canon
makes. With a 114º of vision it is considerably

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:23.900
wider than the EF 16-35m zoom, or the
17-40mm, or even the EF-S 10-22mm

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.140
exclusive for the crop, revealing much
more dramatic compositions with the

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.860
frame lines. So let’s being by opening
the box, this a L series lens, so

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.530
we’re talking about Canon’s specialty line-up,
all which are optimised from corner to

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.920
corner, all EF, state of the art built,
complete kit, this one comes with

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.420
the carrying pouch, doesn’t come with a hood
because its design is built-in, released in 2007;

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.420
it’s been a while, but this is the Canon
EF 14mm f/2.8L II USM. The first

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.239
thing we’ll notice is that it’s one
of Canon’s gems, completely made out of

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.560
metal, extremely robust, and, except
for the plastic cap, nothing feels loose,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.560
it’s extremely well built at 645g of
14 elements in 11 groups. Also its design

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.090
have a lot of character with a convex element
in the front, the built-in metal petal shaped

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.729
hood, you can’t remove it,
and it’s also extremely

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.729
easy to use. It just have a AF/MF
button, the AF which is USM,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.689
completely silent, very quick and
sporting full-time manual, even on

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:46.240
AF mode you can use the MF ring and
one of the best constructions we’ve seen,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.570
there’s no play when you turn from side
to side, extremely smooth up to 20cm of MFD.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.570
Behind we can see a metal mount with
a rubber gasket,

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.640
to protect it against dust and water,
it doesn’t accept front filters,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.399
gelatin filters are accepted in the back,
which is a bad thing because wide-angle

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.120
photos benefit from graduated NDS,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.760
polarizers etc, and this lens just don’t
accept them. There are some third party adapters

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.739
that you mount around the front, but
they are hard to use, so unfortunately

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.200
this one doesn’t accept filters. And this

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.620
Canon’s L series red ring, so
let’s mount it on the 5D Mark II to so

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.150
you get an idea of its size, the only
UWA prime that Canon offers,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.430
it’s 114º of vision, much higher than
the 16-35mm, it very well balanced,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.430
a compact lens of just 9.4cm, 645g,
so it balances well on full frame bodies,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.730
it is a pleasure to use. The ultra-wide
angle that is special for dramatic compositions,

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.730
in which the lines converge on the vanishing
point, so you get broad compositions,

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.269
from corner to corner,

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.590
which is very interesting for creative effects,
wide landscape, or even product photography,

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.519
like cars or other industrial pieces
in which you photograph from the inside.

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.730
And the image quality
is one of the best

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.750
on ultra-wide angle lens
because it delivers resolution

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.700
in every frame, contrast and sharpness, besides
it suffers from lateral CA on the edges,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.200
that are easily fixable via software.
From f/2.8 contrast and sharpness are excellent

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.230
in every shot, and a great performance
in low light too. Resolution around

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.970
the corners is good without much difference
between f/4, f/5.6, f/8 on full frame cameras,

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.760
with the main difference being the DoF.
Landscapes and architecture demands a

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.709
deeper focal plane and up to f/11,
f/13 this lens keep its IQ

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.700
suffering very little from diffraction.
Cons goes to lateral CA on frame edges,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.329
which is almost unacceptable
once Nikon AF-S zoom 14-24mm

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.520
just doesn’t show them that much.
That is a much more complex project

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.719
that controls CA much better, proof that
Nikon knows what it’s doing on wide-angle

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:35.460
whilst Canon is better at telephoto.
Anyway an excellent IQ for most jobs,

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.659
that brings us to the question,
who is the EF 14mm f/2.8L II USM for?

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:46.659
Well, the 114º look is not for
every photographer

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:51.749
and those who needs it
knows who they are.

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:57.029
Interior design, architecture,
extreme landscapes,

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:01.569
or tight spaces like industrial machinery
will benefit from the wide angle

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:06.599
of view. Crop users will be committing a
crime investing in this lens because

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:12.490
APS-C sensores won’t use the full circle
of full frame that you’re paying over

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.020
US$2000 for, and options like the

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.879
Sigma 8-16mm, although not as bright
nor in the same league, offer

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:28.129
the same angle of view for crop sensors.

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:32.149
So, creative photographers that want to
use the best Canon produces on UWA lens

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:39.149
we’ll see on the Canon EF 14mm f/2.8L II USM
the best prime on their line-up.
