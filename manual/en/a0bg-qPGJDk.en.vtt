00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.460
Everything I do is evolved. I might teach you a teep

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.449
kick

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:15.509
uh...

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.820
out of Muay Thai. Which is a foot jab.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.939
but the way I apply it

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.240
is probably a bit different to the way Thai's apply it,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.130
because of

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.390
the way

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.580
Freestyle Combat has evolved.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.929
In the beginning

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.029
when I first had to register a business name

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.840
I called it Freestyle Combat Karate Australia.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.260
But now I never use the word karate

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.920
because I call it Freestyle Combat because that's exactly what our system is.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.930
It's a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.350
freestyle system of pure combat.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.810
It's not designed for competition 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.930
or sport. It's design purely as a personal protection system to teach you how to look after yourself.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.840
At the same time,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.300
there's

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.640
I haven't been exposure to too many systems that have got a full syllabus from white belt

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.150
to seventh degree black belt. And I mean a full syllabus.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.340
A syllabus that you can be learning
constantly.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.670
A lot of traditional systems you get taught a new kata

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.670
and some bunkai out of that kata for your next dan level.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.450
and maybe a weapon kata.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.650
uh... We're still evolving. You're still doing all of the different weaponry, you're doing open hand

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.080
you're doing trapping out of the JKD. You're doing

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.040
Krav concepts uh...

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.460
and because i don't say this 
technique is out of this system and this technique is out of this system.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.060
We teach it as our system.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.240
they integrate so solidly together.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.690
I might do a move that starts off

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.630
uh...

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.270
as a karate move

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.100
and then all of sudden it's got some Filipino stepping and Thai elbows and

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.980
some Krav mentality.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.350
so it's uh... The thing that I have done might be from five systems.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.369
But I don't call it five systems, it's Freestyle Combat.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.560
It's the way it's integrated together 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.830
into one system

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.470
so, you know it

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.139
That the, what I basically do is all the good stuff.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.469
Under my opinion.

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.059
out of those systems.

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.059
uh... It's probably out of my western boxing background.

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:17.949
Because Panatukan is boxing

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:23.489
but then you incorporate head butts, open hand strikes, edge of hand strikes, forearm striking

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.949
elbows, knees and foot trapping.

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.309
uh... as well as sweeps.

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:32.249
uh... It really takes western boxing to the next level

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:33.719
as a street art.

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:38.029
um... and then you mix some of the other stuff we do and it makes it even better.
