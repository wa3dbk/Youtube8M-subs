We're going to go ahead now and do a stroke
specifically for growing pains. What it is

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.839
is we're going to massage the calf as you
notice, Riley now is sitting on a comfy little

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:16.090
cushion, a little chair. For this type of
a stroke you're going to want the child to

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.980
be sitting in some fashion where you can easily
reach the leg and it's important that they're

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.140
sitting up where the leg is kind of suspended
if you will. It makes it easier to reach the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.390
muscles we're trying to simulate, so we'll
take our warm hands, and like you're kind

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:39.370
of fluffing a pillow, you're using this whole
fat part of your palms, we're going to fluff

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.109
right here on the leg, fluff, fluff, fluff.
Does it feel like it's a fluffy pillow? You're

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:51.780
laughing, you must like it, I don't think
it tickles, does it? No, okay, so we're fluffing

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.329
right here, fluffing right here in this area
right here on the calf, fluffing that muscle,

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:10.729
and then we roll. And roll all the way down
the muscle. And again we fluff it up like

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.990
a nice pillow, we're using a gentle but firm
pressure. We're actually using some pressure

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.180
here, how does it pressure, does it feel like
it's massaging you? Does it feel tickly? Okay,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:31.960
good. So we have some pressure here, doing
our nice fluff and then we roll. When you're

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.960
rolling too you're not just getting skin to
skin, you're actually rolling the muscle,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:54.917
so you feel the muscle move, okay. Glide down
that leg, and then we'll move over to the

00:01:54.917 --> 00:02:00.270
next leg. Okay. Okay. Would you like me to
massage this leg? Sure, why not? Maybe sorta?

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:09.470
Okay, we'll try it. So, warm hands, just the
beginning, start our fluffing. Fluff it up,

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.830
not too slow, this one's a little bit more
vigorous with our stroke, a little more speed,

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.440
a little bit more pressure. Just fluffing
again, thinking about cupping using this part

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.920
of your hand, when you're doing this stroke,
we're not pinching, we're just really getting

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:34.819
a nice warm, loose fluff, and then we roll.
Is rolling your favorite? Looks like you like

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:47.650
it. Okay, we're rolling all the way down,
all the way down, and fluff. Fluff. And what's

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.740
next? Roll. Roll. Hey, you could become a
massage therapist, you already know the strokes.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.560
Okay, we're going to roll all the way down,
all the way down. After we finish rolling

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.070
and fluffing on both legs go ahead and stroke
both legs all the way down, our nice finishing

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:16.800
stroke for our massage. How do your legs feel
now, Riley? Sleepy. Slippy from the oil? No,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.520
sleepy. Sleepy, oh are they relaxed? Awesome,
that's what we want. We want Riley to feel

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.870
relaxed after his massage, and I'm glad. Thank
you for letting us have you here for our wonderful

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.080
example today, I really appreciate it. Thank
you. I'm Tina Allen from Little Kids, thank

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.930
you so much for watching my series on how
to massage a child with growing pains. I hope

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.230
this was very useful and I look forward to
seeing you soon.
