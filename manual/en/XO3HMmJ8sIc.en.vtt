00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:03.300
Haiku deck is a free
slideshow creating app

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.266
where you can create
unique presentations that

00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.367
have some artistic flair.

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:09.500
The app lets you pull
from its large database of

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.767
striking backgrounds
and images from the web.

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:15.767
Haiku lets you view these
slideshows on your ipad or

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:18.767
email them to yourself
to use on a PC or other

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:20.266
devices.

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.667
Haiku is best for viewing
a chart, image, or

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:26.567
screenshot with few
words to describe it.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.033
If you want to make an
account, you can use

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:33.934
email, facebook,
or twitter.

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.967
To create a new slideshow,
tap the + button and name

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:43.667
your new deck.

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.567
From this screen, you
can see the basic editing

00:00:56.567 --> 00:01:02.100
tools: The theme selector,
the text editor, the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.033
background image selector,
and the layout options.

00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:12.100
First, let's
select a theme.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.367
You can choose from the
five free themes in the

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:19.033
app or do an in-app
purchase for more themes.

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:22.200
Remember that what makes
this app special is that

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.500
you can use unique
backgrounds for your

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.166
slides.

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.834
So in my opinion, the
theme isn't the most

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:30.333
important part.

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:41.166
To add text, simply
tap the slide and type.

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:59.700
Now, to access the
background, click this

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.066
blue icon.

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:04.066
On the right, you can
choose to use a simple

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:10.133
color for the background
and whether or not to have

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:13.767
highlighting
behind your text.

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:17.867
You can also choose
pictures based on keywords

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:20.300
haiku finds in the text
you've typed of keywords

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.166
you can search for.

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:24.367
It also makes suggestions
for you based on what

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:26.266
you've searched.

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:42.500
As you can see, with just
these few searches, haiku

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.033
has lots of cool
images to liven up your

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:46.367
presentation.

00:02:46.367 --> 00:02:48.467
You can also add photos
from your own library

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:51.367
here.

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:57.233
This is where you can
change the layout of your

00:02:57.233 --> 00:03:00.867
slide.

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:04.066
To add a new slide, just
press the + icon in the

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:07.800
bottom left corner.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.100
To view your deck, press
this icon in the upper

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.700
right corner, and then
you can swipe through your

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.066
slides.

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:26.934
Double tap to return
to the editing screen.

00:03:26.934 --> 00:03:29.500
From the main menu screen,
you can view and edit all

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.800
of your decks.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.533
This is also where you can
share or export your deck.

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:40.100
You can post your deck to
facebook or twitter, email

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.500
a link to view the deck
online with the email

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.600
option, or
export the deck.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.900
When you export the deck,
it will send an email with

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.533
the slideshow attached as
a powerpoint file which

00:03:50.533 --> 00:03:53.200
you can further
edit on a PC.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.467
You have to be signed
in to share your decks.

00:03:56.467 --> 00:04:00.667
Also, when you view the
powerpoint file on a PC,

00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:02.934
each slide of the deck is
simply a picture so the

00:04:02.934 --> 00:04:04.800
text cannot be moved
around or edited in

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.834
powerpoint.

00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:11.767
Also, if you want some
quick tips, the question

00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:17.400
mark icon in the corner
shows you what you need.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.767
Tap again on the screen
to return to normal view.

00:04:22.767 --> 00:04:24.333
Those are the basics
of haiku deck.

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:27.000
This app is great for
adding some spice to

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.133
simple presentations.

00:04:29.133 --> 00:04:31.166
The creative images haiku
gives you access to and

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:34.066
the simplicity of the deck
creation makes this app an

00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:36.066
efficient and fun tool.

00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:38.567
We hope you found this
tutorial helpful and that

00:04:38.567 --> 00:04:40.734
you will use haiku
for some exciting

00:04:40.734 --> 00:04:42.500
presentations.
