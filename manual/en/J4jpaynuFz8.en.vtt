00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.289
One might assume that deeply personal and
captivating single-player experiences are

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:25.400
dying out.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.750
It’s easy to think this way when we live
in a world saturated with first-person games

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.530
about shooting where campaigns continue to
grow shorter and have superficial multiplayer

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.090
tacked-on as a crutch in an attempt to elongate
or cling to relevance.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.710
Well, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is here
to take a stand and let the gaming world know

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.010
that amazing single-player experiences are
still here and very-much alive.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.320
This stand begins surprisingly with a lot
remaining the same since the gates of Oblivion

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.710
were closed.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.560
Much like its predecessors, you can still
look through every nook and cranny, you still

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.920
have a gigantic world to explore, horses are
still all-terrain vehicles and you still kill

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.520
enemies and strip them down to their unmentionables.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.200
But for how much that has remained, even more
has changed; most notably with character creation

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.749
and customization.

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:19.310
As in Oblivion, there are still the traditional
Elder Scrolls races of Argonian, Nord, Dark

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.570
Elf, and so on.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.320
The difference being that during character
creation you no longer choose from primary

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.000
and secondary skill, attributes or a birth
sign.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.380
Now, that might sound like it’s missing
all the character customization and RPG elements

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.080
you care about; but it’s not.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.709
Those elements are still in the game, they’ve
just been changed a bit.

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:40.649
Like birth signs for example, are placed around
the open-world on stone obelisks; one can

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.229
be activated at a time for specific beneficial
effects, or some birth signs from previous

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.649
Elder Scrolls can simply be found in the skill
trees as a perk.

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.819
Perks points are distributed to benefit specific
disciplines; like improving weapon damage

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.200
or lowering the cost to cast spells.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.379
Perks have also made previously broken or
intangible gameplay styles either much more

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:02.959
fun or impressively realized.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:11.700
Like the ability to take a breath to slowdown
time and zoom-in with a bow 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.190
or huge damage multiplyers for daggers; making
the previously mundane weapon-type extremely

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.020
lethal.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.550
To acquire perk points you have to level up.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.200
As is accustomed in the Elder Scrolls franchise,
level increases come with practicing and honing

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.310
abilities through their usage, not with experience
points.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.200
So, if you want to be a great blacksmith,
then go hit the forges.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.589
You wanna have crazy lightning spells, then
get all Darth Sidious on some faces.

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:45.409
Just as in real life you get better at stuff
the more you do it.

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.849
Now more than ever, with the use of the vastly
improved dual-wielding system, you can hone

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.129
multiple skills simultaneously.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:56.650
The system allows a weapon to be clenched
in each fist or a healing spell in one hand

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.670
while frost flies from the other.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.769
The play-styles and character customization
are very malleable which really pronounces

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.370
the attitude The Elder Scrolls series has
always tried to express, which is the idea

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.050
of open-endedness.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.930
The ideals of being an open-ended experience
don’t stop at character customization and

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.459
combat, your gaming freedoms are also ingrained
in the very way you go about taking your created

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.700
character through the land of Skyrim to reveal
the legend of the Dragonborn.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.980
The legend, of which, is tied directly into
that combat and adventuring.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.800
In Skyrim, you are the Dragonborn; the mortal
with the blood of dragons who is able to kill

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.680
the great winged serpents and absorb their
souls to perform powerful shouts.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.389
These shouts do more than just tie into the
story however.

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:44.170
As they’re obtained, shouts allow a range
of new abilities like spanning gaps previously

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.560
inaccessible or tearing dragons down from
the sky.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.060
With the way shouts become part of the adventure
in addition to gameplay, this is easily Bethesda’s

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.840
best main storyline to date; making the narrative
feel fully realized and less of an afterthought.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.150
Really, all the content in general is superior
to previous entries; I could seriously write

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.939
a review for every major story arch in the
game.

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:13.359
Like, the Thieves’ Guild, the Dark Brotherhood,
the Mage’s College, the many different Demi-God

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:18.590
quests with the Daedric Princes, the school
for the Bards or the Civil War brewing over

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.620
religious suppression; Skyrim is simply a
lively nation filled with substance and a

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.919
countless amount of fruitful endeavors to
become part of in a beautiful land to do it.

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.110
Throughout Skyrim’s entirety, developer
Bethesda has really found a harmony of design

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:41.250
choices that all coalesce into a single, united
identity of gameplay, art and execution.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.310
From the way the main story is filled with
metaphor of how powerful speech and language

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.000
can be which is then tied into the gameplay
through shouts as the dragonborn shapes the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.870
nation of Skyrim with a powerful voice, to
the beautifully foreign structures of a Gothic

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.870
and Viking stylization that populate the landscapes,
to the very way the music meshes with harmonious

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.150
harp strings that are complimented by a primal
Viking choir; every aspect of Skyrim brings

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.620
all its ideas and intentions together to create
an individual experience that becomes the

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.199
player’s unique world.

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:18.750
Simply put: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is
one of the greatest single-player role-playing

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.770
games ever created.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.699
You shouldn’t miss it.
