00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:06.350
Now I'm going to show you how to clean your
clarinet without disassembling it. First of

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.903
all, we're going to start off by using my
little paint brush here. I'm going to go in

00:00:10.903 --> 00:00:20.240
between the keys, get out any dust particles
and whatnot in there. Usually you get some

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:28.119
little bit of dust or some stray fabric from
your case that'll shed off on to your instrument,

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:35.640
get that all out of there. Next off, we'll
take our Q-tips and I'll spray those with

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.890
a little bit of Windex. You never want to
spray your clarinet with Windex. It will put

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.429
moisture in your keys. It'll really wreak
some havoc. So I do not ever suggest that.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:56.719
Want to try to get in there as best you can,
taking great care and not getting any on your

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:08.750
pads or bumping the pads for that. It'll tear
the pad. You kind of get in between there

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:17.320
and take the time to get in between the chimney
tone holes here. It's usually wear a lot of

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:29.760
stuff hides. Same thing with the lower here.
Get all of that out. Another thing we want

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:37.530
to do after we're done playing, we'll go ahead
and take our paper towel and wipe off the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:47.500
excess cork grease on our tenons, keep those
clean, help the longevity of them. Now we

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:57.560
want to take our swab here and we'll put a
little bit of Windex on that too. This is

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.749
perfectly fine to do while the keys are on
the clarinet; it won't hurt them at all as

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:21.830
long as you don't saturate it so the pads
get wet. Go ahead and pull the swab on through.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:32.100
This one is a little bit smaller. Pull that
on through. And that is how to clean your

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.850
clarinet without disassembling.
