00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.500
hey I'm Joel Rush your spokesperson here at
3D Printlife today we're at the home of the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.099
Golden Bears Hockey Club it's a youth team
here in Southern California now what I've

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.789
heard is that these guys take their game pretty
seriously what we've done is ask them to replace

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.789
their regulation pucks with our 3D printed
pucks let's step inside the rink and see what happens

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
these hockey pucks were printed on
a Hyrel System 30 3D printer the only printer

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.799
that we offer that prints in up to four extruder
heads in multiple materials

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.799
(Joel) Have you guys ever seen a 3D printer before? (Shaw)
No (Joel) This is your first time seeing it?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
(Shaw) I didn't even know it existed (Joel)
so I want to ask you guys when you were out

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:46.929
there Conner did you hit the pucks too? You
were playing with these? What did it feel

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:53.929
like compared to a normal puck (Conner) it
was kind of easier to get up and it was lighter

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.909
(Joel) because Shaw didn't you say when you
went back to a regular puck it seemed so much

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.909
heavier? Conner, if you could print anything
what would you print? (Conner) A flat screen TV (Joel) You'd

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.220
print a flat screen television? I'd print
a flat screen TV, that's what I need to do

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.220
when I go home get a couple of those going
(Shaw) OK I'm going to print a Creeper actually

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.299
I'd like a giant Creeper two feet tall (Joel)
hey I'm Joel Rush with 3D Printlife (Together)

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.010
where we invite you to print things with us
(Joel) yeah buddy
