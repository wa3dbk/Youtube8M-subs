00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.940
Hey, look there.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.640
Snow!

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.660
Serah!

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.540
Daddy!

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.400
Come on.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.060
Okay.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.700
It's her knife.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.240
I found it near the base of the pillar...

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.640
Snow!

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.900
Serah, I'm sorry. She must be inside the pillar.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.900
Lightning's holding up Cocoon,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.260
along with Vanille and Fang.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.660
Wait, what are you talking about?

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.080
She was right here a second ago!

00:01:05.874 --> 00:01:08.874
I saw her. We talked.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.640
She gave us her blessing...

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.100
Serah...

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.100
I won't forget that moment.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.840
Lightning was happy.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.640
Happy that Snow and I were getting married.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.560
She laughed and said congrats.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.540
But then, all of a sudden, Lightning disappeared.

00:01:52.634 --> 00:01:56.074
She was gone, like she was never there to begin with.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.420
No one else remembered her smiling and laughing.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.520
No one, but me.
