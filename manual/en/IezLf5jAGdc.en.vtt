00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.960
We'll take out our pink, and the pink, again,
you hold it in the same way, and you're squeezing

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.800
with your fingers, and the palm of your hand.
You're holding with your thumb, and the edge

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.980
of your hand, there, and again, you just want
to squeeze out a little, and clean off the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.490
tip. Remember, this is the one that we didn't
use. We just used a disposable bag. We didn't

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.539
use the special tip, and it still works just
as well. Now, if you want to practice, I always

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:39.130
find it's good to practice a little bit, on
a piece of paper, until you get the right

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:47.360
look, and the right size, and just kind of
get an idea of how you're going to finish,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.850
or make your design, and once you feel confident
about doing it on the paper, then you do it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:06.329
on your cookie, or your cake, or whatever
you're decorating, and

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:16.681
we'll make a nice heart, right here on this
piece. Another method is to take a knife,

00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:23.139
and just score your cookie with the design,
before you do the frosting, and that will

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:28.869
also guide you. So if you're afraid you're
going to make mistakes with the decorating,

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:43.359
and now I'm just going to make a little arrow,
with my red,

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:50.979
and sticking out of the heart, like this,
and to finish off the cookie, I'm going to

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.429
separate our pieces a little, because I don't
want the frosting on the edge, to make the

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:05.390
cookie stick together. So I'm going to finish
up by just putting a, squeezing out a little

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:13.200
line about a quarter of an inch wide, all
along the edge of the cookie. Just on the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.840
outside edge of the cookie, not the inside
cut, puzzle pieces, just the outside edge

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.640
of the cookie. Just put a little bit of icing,
like that. Now, you can finish with that,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.569
or you can take some nice little sprinkles,
and you have to do it quickly, while the icing

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:43.280
is still wet, and just sprinkle on a little
extra color, ok? And just continue that with

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.549
the rest of your puzzle pieces and you'll
knock off these extra pieces of nonpareil,

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:56.340
after it dries a little bit, and just continue
on with the rest of your puzzle pieces. When

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.370
you've finished your trim, we'll just let
this dry overnight, so that the Royal Icing

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.040
gets really nice and hard, and nothing will
stick, when we put it in our packaging. Let's

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.329
go finish our packaging.
