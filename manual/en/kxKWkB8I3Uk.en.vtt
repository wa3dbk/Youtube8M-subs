00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.650
Hi this is Julie with Beadaholique.com and I
want to show you how to use memory frames

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.350
today

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.059
If you followed some of my videos before you know that I love

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.450
mixed media. I love artwork and so this
is right up my alley and I'm super

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.670
excited to show it to you.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.170
So every frames come in all different
sizes and I've opened up

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.440
one that's 1.5 by 1.5 inch here

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.910
and you can see there's no glass in when you get them

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.480
and they have a jump ring already attached

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.490
the top and they're just a frame. What you're going to do with them is you

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.640
take some glass which you buy separately

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.590
it comes like this. I'm going to show you

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.650
there's a bunch of glass right there. I'm going to take

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.940
two panes of glass because for every memory frame, if you're going to do

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.860
kind of the traditional application how to use them, your going to need two panes of glass

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.970
you can do other things with them as well where you may be just want one

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.409
piece of glass for the back and then you want to build with polymer clay

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.469
or you want to to do some type of embroidery
like

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.800
a covered fabric you're going to put in there, you might not want the top piece but if

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.400
you're sandwiching ink paper or artwork you
want the two pieces of glass

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.610
go ahead and find some pretty images

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.890
and I've got this here basically a collage book

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.990
of images that just cut out some that I like

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.430
that I'm gonna make a little vignette

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.540
and then I'm going to sandwich it between my two pieces of glass. I'll

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.560
show you how to do that and then put it into the frame

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.340
Let's begin. We're going to do one together
here

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.479
so you can get an idea of how it's going to work. So I've already pre cut these

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:50.030
out

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.060
except for the one that's going to be my
back piece

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.439
and I want to not pre cut that because I want it to be pretty exact

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.619
so I'm going to just go ahead take some
white glue, I've got Nunn Design glue

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.540
right here

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.079
and I'm just going to use my fingers because

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.459
it's a little easier and quicker for me

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.300
if you're handling glass there are sharp corners and there might even be a little bit

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.560
rough on the edges. So make sure you handle it with care

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.370
I'm just going to take my glue and carefully

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.640
smear all over my back piece of glass

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.230
disk and then take my

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.610
sheet of paper and put it on top of there and
lineup

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.610
two of the edges. Press that into place

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.450
and let that dry.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.420
While that's drying I'm gonna go ahead and show you how to

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.710
open up an memory frame

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.590
you see there's a little tab on the top left corner

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.959
just going to basically open that tab

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.209
and pull the frame apart

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.320
and that's all there is and it's hinged

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.070
just the way it's been cut and scored and makes it this nice open hinges so that I

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.930
can open it

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.250
be careful with it, you don't want to distort it too much

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.170
you do you want to just be gentle with it and now I'm gonna go back to this

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.370
I'll probably let it dry a little bit longer if I
was not doing this on

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.580
camera but I do wanna speed up the video so
I'm just going to

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.110
very carefully because it is glass and we
don't

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.310
ever ever want to cut glass so use

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.750
every safety precaution. Trim my paper

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.160
and now that back sheet

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.220
is perfectly fitted and I've pre-cut this. I'm
just going to layer them

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.020
on top

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.060
I think I'm like it like that. Remember you're gonna have

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.270
just a little bit at the edge that's
covered with the frame so keep that in

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.070
mind when you're layering your paper

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.480
if it's something that is really important and you want it to be seen

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.480
just don't put it right up against the edge

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.340
like I said before, you can put all different sorts of things sandwiched

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.200
between these two panes of glass. You can
do your child's artwork, you can do your own

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.950
artwork

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.950
you can do a pressed flower

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.850
even some lace or textile, whatever you want

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.990
to feature in your pendant. Im just going to
trim this

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.270
again if I wasn't doing this on camera I'd
probably wait until it was fully dry

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:04.270
I do want to speed up the process. Now I'm
going to take the top pane of glass

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.250
put it on top of our images. We are just
going to put this

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.370
into the frame and when you are

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.810
creating these take into account

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.500
how much space you have, how wide is that
frame, how deep it is I should say

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.380
because you don't want to put too many layers of paper or two think of a piece a

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.180
lace where it

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.500
won't actually fit in the frame. Now then

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.660
just go back, make sure all of our corners

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.830
are tucked within the frame and slide it in place

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.980
I'll show you that one more time, see how
that's coming together

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.050
now we're just gonna fold over

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.500
the tad and then I've got a popsicle stick here

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.790
I'm just going to press it down just to
make sure

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.940
it's a nice tight fit and there we go

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.140
we just filled our memory frame. See how it looks from the back and that's

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.640
because we use paper that was printed on
the back so it looks really nice

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.710
and there's the front and then you just
attach that to a chain

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.360
any have a ready made necklace. For other
