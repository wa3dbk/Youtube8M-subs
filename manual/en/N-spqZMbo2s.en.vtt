Hey goalies, this is Mike, in this video let's
take a closer look at the new CCM Extreme

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.400
Flex 2 760 Leg Pads.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.259
The 760 leg pad has many of the same features
as the Eflex Pro II leg pad, but it's obviously

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.810
built for a lower level of play, an intermediate
to lower advanced level.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.579
If we take a look at the face of the pad you'll
notice that it's got the traditional knee

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.820
rolls you've come to expect from the Eflex
pro II. You've got a single break here below

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.700
the knee and a break here at the boot. And
obviously these are pretty soft flexes, if

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.260
i turn the pad to the side here you'll see
that both flex very easily and the pad also

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.120
has a good amount of torsional flex as well.
So that means it will stay really close to

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.690
your foot as you move around the net.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.620
If we take a look at the knee cradle you'll
see it's nice and wide so it can acomadate

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.350
any size knee guards. You've got your traditional
double velcro strap which is actually adjustable

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.980
on both sides so you can adjust the length
here on this side and of course you can adjust

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.560
the length here on the other side as well.
And it's got 2 attachment points, one here

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.369
directly across the knee and you can also
put it down here to the calf to open the knee

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.340
up a little bit.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.889
The calf lock is lined entirely with nylon
both here on the flaps and also here on the

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:25.899
leg channel. It's got a narrow design so you
can really cinch your leg in the pad and again

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.259
you've got a double elastic strap that comes
across and is adjustable again on both sides

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.679
so you can wear it as tight or as loose as
you want it. You can even take the entire

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.780
strap off if you'd like to create a little
more open feel.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.959
The boot channel has a shallow depth to it,
this powerpush technology again means that

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:49.039
the pad can twist and has good torsional flex
so it allows your foot to move in any direction

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.490
and of course you've got your standard toe
tie here made of hd foam and skate lace.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.999
The strapping setup of the 760 consists of
this nylon webbing strap which also has another

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:03.630
attachment point for the buckle up here if
you choose to wear it there. If we slide over

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.310
to this side you'll notice the exit point
for the strap here at the knee block has been

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.850
moved a little bit lower so that it doesn't
run directly behind your knee this is a bit

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.470
more of a comfortable set up. You've got one,two
leather calf straps, and one leather boot

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.560
strap as well.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.780
The CCM Extreme Flex II 760 leg pad comes
in senior, junior, and youth sizes in a variety

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.320
