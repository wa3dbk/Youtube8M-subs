00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.880
Ectaco is scheduling a launch of their industry
leading e-reader with color e-ink in their

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.240
second model.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.230
To offers users a more seamless experience,
the new model will use the second version

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.750
of e-Ink Triton technology.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.150
The Jetbook Color 2 features are as follows:
1.)

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.520
A 9.7 inch e-ink Triton 2 touchscreen with
1200 × 1600 resolution.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.500
The unit will display close to 4096 colors,
which should really bring PDF documents to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.500
life.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.500
2.)

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.970
It will be powered by a Freescale i.MX508
800 MHZ processor and 512 MB of RAM.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.890
Yes, it is identical to the original model.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.890
3.)

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.680
It comes with a standard 4 GB of memory and
is expandable up to 32 GB.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.680
4.)

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.450
Headphone jack and speakers are incorporated
to reap the rewards of the ability to play

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.100
music and the audio dictation software.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.469
Since it is built for students, it also comes
fully packed with study guides, learning,

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.829
math, spelling, and other important K12 materials.

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:22.520
Ok, so you’re probably asking what’s different
about this Jetbook Color model?

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.609
The major change with this new model is the
Triton 2 screen which provides a higher contrast

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.740
and improved page turn speeds.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.259
Ectaco removed the manual page turn buttons
that were positioned on the sides.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.420
There is also a built-in port to safeguard
the stylus, which is really convenient.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.770
Original Jetbook users will notice a drop
in refreshing, which should not be that noticeable

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.770
any longer.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.740
Overall, I think the better contrast and reduced
gray background will be a great improvement

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.139
over the current model.

00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:03.139
