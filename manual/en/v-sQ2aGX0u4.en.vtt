"How to take purikura"

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.420
Hi!

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.040
Today we - or I - am going to show you how to take purikura.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.680
Because I think a lot of you think that's fun to see.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.820
So here is Bon Bon.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.480
There're several floors with purikura machines.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.800
From the basement all the way up to the 4th floor.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.080
'Purikura' is a special kind of photo booth in Japan.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.080
There're probably hundred thousands of machines all over the country.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.180
Normally you take purikura with friends, but to show you how it's done, I'm gonna do it alone today.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.840
It usually costs 400 yen for one 'photoshoot', which is about 25 Norwegian Krones (EUR2.8, or USD3.5).

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.020
Here you apply some settings in the beginning, for example how big your eyes are gonna be, 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.300
and how pale you want your skin to be.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.760
Then, the machine will often tell you how to pose, 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.220
and your photos will be taken.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.380
When you're done taking the pictures, you go into the other part of the machine,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.140
where you can edit the pictures.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.960
You can choose from different backgrounds,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.080
you can put on stamps,

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.580
you can write stuff on your pictures,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.620
you can change your eye- and hair color,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.800
there are endless possibilities when doing purikura.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.060
Many people put a date stamp on their pictures, so you can save it as a memory from that exact day.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.780
There are some awkward stamps in most purikura machines,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.740
for example this one that says "hey hey!"

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.900
Or this one: "Look Look Look at me!"

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.080
Here's the hair coloring tool, which unfortunately works best on black/dark hair.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.700
There's a time limit, so if you have no idea what you're doing, it can be a bit stressful.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.520
I'm done, so now I can go outside and wait for my pictures to be printed.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.620
You can use the scissors provided in the building to cut your pictures, and they are often used as stickers.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.360
Thanks for watching!^^
