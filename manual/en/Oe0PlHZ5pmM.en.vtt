00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.819
Okay, so we decided to make it a little larger.

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:09.240
That's just the way things go.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.059
They say an eco-friendly house can't be build
in 150 days for $150,000, and I say it can.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.250
I'm Allen Smith, join me as I push the limits
with time, budget and creativity with the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.930
Garden Home Challenge, exclusively on eHow
Home.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.950
What a glorious day, just the kind of day
that you'd want to spend out on a big porch

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.950
like this.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.220
Well, the porch has gotten larger.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.660
It was only 8 feet from the house to this
point.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.390
And this finish floor material, I pull back,
you can see, we added another 4 feet onto

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.230
the deck to give it, well, just more room.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.670
And the reason this porch feels so much smaller
than the front porch, because they're essentially

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.879
the same size, the front porch is a little
longer.

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.749
The chimeny actually interrupts this space
quite a bit and makes it feel much smaller.

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:05.850
So the plan here is to come out to this point
here with some posts, we'll have a covered

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.850
porch.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.810
And from here on out it'll be uncovered, but
there'll be a rail there.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.600
Now take a look at the floor joists.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.140
Tony has put these together with 2 by 12 material,
so it's really solid.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.369
And it's supported by our concrete block pillars.

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:26.689
So the finished floor material is this, it's
really a 1 inch thick board that has a rounded

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.070
edge on either side, here and here.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.540
And it's 6 inches wide.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.960
These boards are 16 feet long.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.350
So you combine that length, and these will
be placed side by side.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.829
There's still quite a bit of moisture in these,
so he's gonna pack them in really close together,

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.250
one against the other.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.009
And as they drive, you'll get about a quarter
inch gap between these.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.469
But if you put a gap between them staring
out, and then they shrunk, you're gonna have

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.149
a much wider gap.

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.600
So what's really good about this material
is it'll last a long time.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.189
There's a 40 year warranty on this treated
wood.

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.270
And, you know, it's gonna age really beautifully.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.620
We don't have to put any protectant on it
or finish.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.430
I could paint if I want, but the idea here
is just for it to become sun bleached to a

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.060
kind of gray color, so it'll blend in to the
surroundings, the woods and so forth.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.030
It's really amazing what 4 feet has added
to this space.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.890
I'm glad I made this decision to make this
a little more spacious.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.810
