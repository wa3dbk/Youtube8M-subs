00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.120
Hi, we are in Rikugien Garden.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.640
Right now Hanami season is in progress,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.820
so there are a few flowering cherry trees.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.120
We are going to the Japanese tea ceremony.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.720
Please give me the food.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.180
Krzysztof, the food.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.300
Welcome to the Japanese beautiful garden.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.960
Welcome to the Japanese tea ceremony.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.560
We have here very traditional matcha

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.180
and than Japanese sweets.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.100
It is made from beans and sugar.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.460
Beautiful.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.460
The tea.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.160
Very nice. A little bit bitter but it's 
a good balance with the sweets.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.860
In the tea ceremony, 
there are these characteristic vessels.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.160
This cookie has a very subtle taste.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.720
This sweetness is very delicate.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.060
Moreover, you can feel the taste of this typical bean.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.620
We'll try some tea.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.240
We have to rotate this bowl.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.700
We rotate two times and take three sips.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.340
This is a type of green tea, 
that is brewed from a green powder.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
In Japanese it's simply called matcha.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.020
In fact, the traditional form of tea is a bit different

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.160
from the ones that are prepared in homes nowadays

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.680
because it's forthy after mixing.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.720
But it has really interesting, quite good and deep taste.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.440
We can find a lot of parks and gardens in Tokyo.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.200
This one for example, belonged to some daimyō.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.840
It was opened 300 years ago.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.880
And it looks like it is preserved in the original shape.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.940
It is supposedly 
very representative garden from the Edo period.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.860
Being in Tokyo or Japan, 
it's worth to visit some of the gardens and parks,

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.700
because they have very classical Japanese climate.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.220
You can always see the tea ceremony,
or other attractions.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.060
And mostly come and calm down,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.680
beacuse mainly that's the point.
It's so beautiful and peacful here,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.680
that you can be moved.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.840
This place is really beautiful.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.640
If someone wants to experience more traditional Japan,

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:23.040
a garden from the Edo period 
is really one of the best ideas

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.520
how to experience this kind of atmosphere.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.180
Thanks for your attention. Take care.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.080
Bye bye

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.680
