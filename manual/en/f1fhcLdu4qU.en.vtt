Hi this Kat with beadaholique.com

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.289
and today I'm gonna show you how to use
the Super New Glue

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.950
and this is the glue that we recommend
to use with our Regaliz

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.070
Corduroy Rubber Cord and the Regaliz Flat Cork Cord

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.539
Now let's start by doing the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.599
rubber cord. This is a magnetic clasp.
Now I want to show you that this clasp

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.080
is very strong so it should just click
right into place

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.470
so when you are doing your glue it is
best to separate them

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.610
so you don't bend your cork out of the glue.
So what you gonna do is take your

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.079
glue

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.899
screw it off and place a small dab

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.309
inside and as you can see

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.899
it has a really low viscosity so you can kinda tip it around a little bit

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.760
get your glue coated on all sides and
then what you're gonna do

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.149
is place your cord right in there

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.080
just hold it for maybe a minute or so

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.360
it has a pretty good seal right away and
then you can simply move to the other

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.539
side of your cord

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.619
and repeat the same process with this piece

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.390
it's the same on this one with the 5 millimeter

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.679
cork cord. Go ahead and separate your clasp
and what you're gonna do is

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.250
place a little dab of glue

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.380
now as you can see this is a little
small on the inside there

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.190
so go ahead and place it right in there

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.890
if you need to you can use a little
toothpick to get it in there but then go

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.140
ahead and place your cork

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.750
right in there, hold it snug, hold it
together

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.099
and that's it. You should be all set.

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:59.690
Now I will say make sure that you do you
close your cap as soon as you're done

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.369
to not let your glue dry up. I do recommend
waiting about 24 hours to make sure that

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.090
your glue has a really strong hold so that your bracelet doesn't pop out of

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.810
your clasp.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.879
That's the Super New Glue by Eurotool and this is the glue that you're going to use

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.650
for all of your Regaliz components and
Regaliz cord.
