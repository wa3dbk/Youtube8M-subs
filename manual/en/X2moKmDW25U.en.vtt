00:00:09.011 --> 00:00:12.611
Ski jumping is clearly
an instinctive sport.

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:17.381
What the ski-jump offers

00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:19.474
you have to feel it.

00:00:19.474 --> 00:00:20.733
Thus you can also grasp

00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.727
if a jump is going
to work or not,

00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:25.897
because at the take-off platform,
you just know

00:00:25.897 --> 00:00:28.019
when you get it right

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.372
when it "lobs you away"

00:00:29.372 --> 00:00:31.760
when you're up in the air
and it's just awesome.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.180
You can feel that!

00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:37.491
And in the end that's obviously
the feeling that gets you hooked.

00:01:09.177 --> 00:01:11.447
I'd say sports are indeed
a school of life.

00:01:11.447 --> 00:01:14.992
Because you have the great privilege

00:01:16.212 --> 00:01:18.125
of achieving so much,

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:20.555
or getting so many 
positive impressions,

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:23.252
making it all the more
a school of life

00:01:23.252 --> 00:01:24.798
in my opinion.

00:01:24.798 --> 00:01:29.485
But, of course, there's a certain
negative element as well

00:01:29.485 --> 00:01:32.765
or the odd negative experience

00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:35.060
just to have a chance
to struggle back to the top.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.715
Because then you learn once again

00:01:36.715 --> 00:01:40.010
to value even more
the other, positive things

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.655
and I think that's when you can
get the human dimension of it

00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:45.915
and reach your inner happiness.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.723
Yes, materials are a big issue
for ski jumping, actually.

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:07.001
What fits Kamil Stoch

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:10.242
or somebody else,
does not fit Schlierenzauer.

00:02:10.722 --> 00:02:13.848
That's why everybody has 
to find their individual package,

00:02:13.848 --> 00:02:18.051
which can be really 
tedious and tiresome,

00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:21.684
for sometimes you tend
to go round in circles,

00:02:21.684 --> 00:02:25.435
because there are so many
different, external factors involved.

00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:28.084
Like the wind, that you 
never know how it's gonna...

00:02:28.084 --> 00:02:31.278
Yeah, when you take off, 
you never know what will happen!

00:02:41.968 --> 00:02:43.432
In the beginning, I think,

00:02:43.432 --> 00:02:46.788
everybody feels the urge to be at the top

00:02:46.788 --> 00:02:49.313
or to achieve something.

00:02:49.313 --> 00:02:52.340
In my case, it might sound
a little bit stupid,

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.410
but I have been blessed with
so many great moments

00:02:56.241 --> 00:03:00.939
that victory no longer is
the top priority for me,

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.879
but rather the performance.

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.730
Whether you come fifth or sixth
is a minor point, in reality.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.277
But if you get to fist pump
a couple times, it's just...

00:03:09.277 --> 00:03:12.487
it's extremely rewarding
for me now!
