00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.870
Australia today is a nation of immigrants. 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.390
The first one arrived here forty thousand years ago. 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.770
It's a very beautiful country. 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.180
I love everything about it - the systems work. 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.360
There's lots of nice things about Australia. 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.550
I don't know where to begin, but the moment I came here I fell in love with it. 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.400
I've been here for six years and it was great, the first day I came straight away from 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.070
the airport, we went to the beach. 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.170
So, I thought this is not possible! 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.550
 Today we celebrate 220 years of the first European immigration. 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.440
Since then, millions of people have called Australia home. 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.140
It is a great honour for me to celebrate with you, becoming an Australian citizen. 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.270
It is always a thrill to see people from across the world, often dressed in traditional 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.790
dress as some of you are, pledging your allegiance to the new country. 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.690
 I'm happy that I'm assured of a brighter future, hopefully better than I had. 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:14.688
I was living in Germany for many years and I moved back to my country, and at that point 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.110
I was looking for a country where I could find opportunities and where I could live in a 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.550
safe environment. 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:30.230
 After today, after a few moments, you will have the same rights and responsibilities as 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.190
every other Australian. 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.460
That's something we take for granted here in Australia. 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.850
It is not the case in every country of the world, that once you become the citizen of the 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.170
nation you have exactly the same rights as everybody else, regardless of whether you were 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.530
born here or born elsewhere. 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.600
 Today is really important to me because it's official that I'm an Australian. 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.680
I think the minister being here made it that extra special. 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.870
Knowing that his signature is on my certificate, and he handed it to me personally– that 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.690
made it extra, extra special. 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.490
Oh, and I'm now a proud father of a koala! 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.840
 I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people. 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.270
It's just… it's fun being Australia. 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:33.980
I'm very proud to be Australian.
