Hi, I’m Ryoya.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.080
“Pasta” is the theme of this month.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.760
I don’t eat pasta often, but I decided to do Pasta.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.360
I’m going to show you Genovese which is made of basil leaves.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:48.440
It’s super simple and tasty. make basil pesto with basil, pine nuts, olive oil, garlic and salt. Then combine with cooked pasta.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.660
I’m going to use homemade pasta which I made the other day.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:02:01.280
It’s already dried out. Making homemade pasta is not so hard once you get semolina flour(pasta flour).

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.180
I’ll put the link to the video of making pasta, so please try it out after watching this video.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:08.800
Homemade pasta is much better than store bought one. Texture and flavor is completely different.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.220
Good, really good.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:30.280
Basil is grown in summer, so Genovese is great in summer. I hope you try this out.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.480
I really liked this.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.680
Don’t miss the other pasta.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.860
See you on next Monday!
