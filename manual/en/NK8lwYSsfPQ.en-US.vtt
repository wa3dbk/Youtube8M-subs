00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.670
Hey guys MWC 2015 and I am holding the brand
new Samsung Galaxy E5.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.900
Now this is part of the E Series.
Samsung now has divided the Series and they

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.900
have two product lines essentially.
So you have all metal A series and then E.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.640
E has more like plastic just like the traditional
Samsung devices.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.750
Now there you see it has very nice rubbery
filling.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:32.460
Also has like shinning white color looks very
very similar to the A5.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.390
Which we have out here there you see that's
the A5.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:43.850
And if you see on the back they actually looks
very similar.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.460
But when you touch them you would know that
A5 feels much more premium due to that metal

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.140
construction.
So 5 inch screen HD resolution 720P.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.300
And then you have the 5MP camera on the front.
You have 13MP camera on the back and then

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.329
your typical Samsung hardware and the soft
keys.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.009
Around there volume rocker micro USB 2.0 port
3.5mm jack noise cancelling mic.

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.080
Nano sim card slot this one you can either
have a Nano sim or you can have micro SD card

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.270
slot power button.
On top your secondary noise cancelling mic.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.860
Behind is a 13MP camera as I told you LED
flash and speaker grill and that's Samsung.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.729
So despite of being plastic back you cannot
actually remove the back here.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:40.520
So it almost has the same user interface you
would find on the A5 and even on the E7 actually.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.159
It's not much different you might have different
apps depending on which market you are based

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.350
out of.
So it's based on Android 4.4.4 and not 5.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:00.789
So out of 16GB it says about 9.52GB yeah.
So I am gonna give you detailed review when

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:07.070
this device comes to our lab.
But for now I will just quickly show you the

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:15.270
camera which I do not see should be much different
from the A5 or the E7.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:24.180
They essentially have the same sensor yeah.
To say that it's not very fast but the front

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.981
camera has good exposure compensation exposure
correction there.

00:02:30.981 --> 00:02:38.600
And we will see so it's not leggy at all you
can see.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.209
That tightening bit but it's not uncomfortable
leggy.

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:49.090
Good enough so if the A5 images and video
qualities any indication then you would see

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.599
softer images on the edges also the same goes
for the video.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.540
Under low light the details will drastically
drop.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.220
But overall to upload to the social media
the image and videos will be just fine.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.920
So that's guys the Samsung Galaxy E5 MWC 2015.
Thank you.
