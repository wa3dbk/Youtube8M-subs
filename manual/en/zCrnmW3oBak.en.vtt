00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.820
I talked yesterday about the release of
grand theft auto 5 and how

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.450
edge Schultz held up a copy of the game
the day after

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.040
the shooting that took place at the Navy
Yard Washington DC

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.309
in part blaming that and other violent
video games for the violence and we

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.310
rejected that completely saying there's
no academic evidence that

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.000
suggests a video game violence or movie
violence causes people to commit violent

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.510
acts

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.189
well we have now learned that grand
theft auto 5 earned eight hundred

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.580
million dollars

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.680
the first day that it came out around
the world 24 hours

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.500
eight hundred million dollars absolutely
incredible Louis

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.809
if you compare it to some film releases
the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.170
top three earners this year at the movie
box office or Iron Man 3

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.590
Despicable Me 2 and Man of Steel Man of
Steel

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.820
made 663 million

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.020
Grand Theft Auto in one day $800 million
of course Grand Theft Auto costs a lot

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.640
more

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.149
than it does for one ticket to Man of
Steel and I have to tell you that

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.729
this this is really starting to be
another one of the ways that gun groups

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.330
are distracting from the reality of the
gun problem for a while it was we need

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.030
mental health databases

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.380
which we discussed her somehow
implicitly racist in a way

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.460
and now that there's been a number of
other things as well

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.110
gun-free zones et cetera and now they
are starting to turn their attention to

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.600
video game so we should expect this to
continue

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.810
I got a voicemail actually about the
video game being

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.909
and I wanna play that for you now hi
David

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.430
love Michelle I just want to thank you
for actually defending

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.729
video games my vote for the entire video
game

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.820
hysteria arm I have funny

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.180
and I never hear anyone bring up are

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.460
this point that video games have been
answered

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.950
in seven days and in that time has grown
exponentially more popular more

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.130
realistic in

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.210
think is a violent videogames Warcraft X
right and yes everybody knows that

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.530
between the nineteen seventies and he
now overall violence has gone down and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.789
it has now here's the thing to play
devil's advocate

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.280
violence could have gone down since the
seventies

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.950
even with violent video games but you
could make the case maybe it would have

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.970
gone down even more without them so just
the fact

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.420
that violence has gone down doesn't
really prove any kind of causation there

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.569
but that being said we just don't have
any evidence that suggests video games

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.190
actually make people violent

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.610
and it's just an amazing amount of money
Louis for a video game to make it one

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.950
day

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.470
it is I hear the game cost about $160
million to make

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.040
I but you know what a consistently put a
great game so I think they've earned it

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.840
absolutely
