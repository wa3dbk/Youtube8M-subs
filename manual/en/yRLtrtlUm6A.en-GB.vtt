00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.300
It's not easy to paint fine lines with a brush
so we are going to have a look now and experiment

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.010
and see if we can solve some of the problems
with this little fine brush.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:22.230
I have some canvas here, it is sealed canvas
you see it's primed on one side. You do need

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.039
a good sealed surface to paint on; whether
youâ€™re using oils or acrylics we use the

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.650
same surface.
I've got plenty of undercoat there to practice

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:38.180
like this. I'm holding the brush with one
finger and thumb, that's the first thing that

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.640
is most important. If you hold it like this
you are not going to get those little thin

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.590
lines.
Now there is another thing that I want to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.980
show you and this is very serious.
It is an acquired skill, and what I mean by

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.179
an acquired skill is I've taught this hand
over fourty years to pick up the paint and

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:02.659
paint thin lines and I can paint thin lines
without looking at it. But the thing is, if

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:10.530
I try to paint with this hand, I'm going to
have a problem - not too bad but certainly

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.280
I do not have the control that I have with
this hand, because this hand has been painting

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.549
for so long, so you do have to give yourself
time to acquire the skill and the way to do

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.609
that is to keep painting.
You see this brush, I've got a rubber band

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:27.110
on it and I've loaded the tip with plenty
of paint, there is quite a lot of paint on

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.610
there, let's see what happens when I hold
the rubber band and drag the brush up the

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:43.770
canvas, it makes a nice thin line, that's
all there is to it.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.939
So it's not just the skill, there's no skill
in holding a rubber band, the skill is how

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.579
you hold the brush, very softly and bring
it up and twiddle it round to make the lines.

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.990
Practice in dark and then add the dark and
light.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.380
The thing is also, what the background is
like, if the background is porous; your paint

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:13.360
will not come off the brush properly.
Let's put some more undercoat for practicing,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:26.750
I'll load the brush with some dark. If you
want to paint a branch from there to there

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.800
and it needs to go somewhere there, you haven't
got full control of what the branch is going

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.440
to look like, if your copying a photograph,
you need to be careful and you need a lot

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.840
of skill. But to get the branch from there
to there you simple hold the brush loosely

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.360
and drag it up and twist it around and move
it over in that direction.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.480
What the final branch is going to look like
you have no idea until it's finished.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.990
And then if there is a bit of the branch missing,
that gives you the opportunity to maybe go

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.960
there and add another branch.
You will notice my brush was dirty there and

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.380
we didn't get a dark line.
Okay so it's a combination of three things.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.430
1 your brush has to be clean and loaded properly
with plenty of paint.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.630
2 you have to hold your brush very lightly
and do not try and control it too much, just

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.920
make the branch go from point A to somewhere
near point B - reload your brush very often.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.540
3 is your background. If I try and paint branches
on this bare canvas, even though it's a sealed

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.430
canvas, I'm not going to get a thin line.
So if your under paint is dry or there is

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.650
no under paint, you are not going to get thin
lines.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.570
If your undercoat does go dry, let's imagine
you have put the paint on and it's dry, thin

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:46.490
your brown paint a little bit and yes, it
comes off on the bare canvas when it's thinned

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.840
out.
So it's a matter of thinning your paint - it

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.080
should come off well over a wet undercoat,
no not always, you can see through it - you

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:00.060
can experiment with thicker and thinner paint.
That paint was a bit thick there and didn't

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.310
come off the brush, I'll add water and do
it again, yes it comes off the brush. But

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.360
don't thin it too much because you might be
able to see through it.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.769
When you're practicing don't practice with
all up strokes, practice with long horizontal

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.910
ones also. They don't have to be perfect and
when you do want to make them perfect take

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:32.751
your time, put the brush on and bring it up
slowly and twist your brush so the paint comes

00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:34.740
off well.
I hope these hints help you with your brushstrokes,

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:52.310
I know a few people have been having a problem
with it.
