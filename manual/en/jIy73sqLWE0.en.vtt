00:06:05.197 --> 00:06:09.235
Man, all this mud reminds me of my friend Keith. Yeah, he was goin' to build a shack once, ...

00:06:09.235 --> 00:06:14.601
... to live in and all, and I know most people here, they build houses and they become shacks.

00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:19.204
... but Keith, he was about jumpin' right to the shack stage. But he had no wood.

00:06:19.204 --> 00:06:23.549
So he got some mud and was makin' what we were all thinkin' was gonna be these adobe bricks, ...

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:27.364

00:06:27.365 --> 00:06:29.849
That's some tight shit, bro! I mean, look man: ...

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:34.907
