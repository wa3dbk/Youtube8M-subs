&gt;&gt;DAVIDSTRAYER: My name is David Strayer,
and I'm a psychologist.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.269
I study cognitive neuroscience.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.600
That's the study of thinking, memory, perception,
decision making, and trying to understand

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.240
how the brain is responsible for those behaviors.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.010
Science in action.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.210
When I started working, I worked in telecommunications
just when cellphones were starting to become

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.420
popular.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.089
And at that time it was pretty clear that
you could become sufficiently distracted by

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:44.329
the use of cellphone technology when you're
trying to drive a car.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.350
So, I've been studying driver distraction.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.350
Looking at what we understand about attention
and how the brain can multitask, and how that

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.429
relates to our everyday behaviors, driving
an automobile.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.460
[talking to participant] "You can go ahead
and start the car now."

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.780
Why I love this job is I can basically ask
any question I want about what makes us tick

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.210
and how we behave, and use research methods,
and the scientific method to be able to answer

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.210
those questions.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.869
That means observing, making hypothesizes,
designing experiments and testing them.

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.830
A lot of times people think, if your eyes
are on the road, and your hands are on the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.450
wheel, you'll be fine.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.880
But if you use a cell phone is that something
that actually harms driving behavior?

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.450
And how does it differ from other things like
listening to a radio?

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.200
Or talking to a passenger?

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.479
We're interested in things like handheld and
hands-free cell phones.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.869
How do those differ?

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.539
We found that if you talk on a cell phone
you are four times more likely to be involved

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.250
in a crash, that's the same crash risk as
if you were driving at a .08 blood alcohol

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.770
level -- if you're drunk.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.090
Worse is if you're texting, you're eight more
times likely to be involved in a crash.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.729
That's substantially worse than the drunk
driver.

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.340
We're looking now at some of the voice-based
technologies.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.429
&gt;&gt;DRIVER: Hello SIRI?

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:56.429
Read appointments.

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.270
&gt;&gt;DAVID STRAYER: What we I think have learned
is that some of the these voice-based technologies

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.420
are putting demands on the brain to try and
multitask in ways that exceed the capacity

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.320
to be able to do that activity and drive safely.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.200
We know that the research that's come out
of my laboratory has been influential in changing

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.349
regulatory policies and laws.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.599
At this point 41 states in the United States
now have laws that make it against the law

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.390
to text while driving.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.790
There's a number of multinational, multi-billion
dollar companies that have taken the research

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.409
that we've collected and have used that as
a basis for policies for not using their cell

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.230
phones while driving.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.269
They substantially reduced the total number
of crashes for their employees, and there

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.930
was no loss in productivity.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.850
At the end of the day, we would hope that
you're going to see fewer fatalities on the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.870
roadway because people are not distracted.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.430
That's taking psychology and translating it
directly into action -- that's science in

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.670
action.
