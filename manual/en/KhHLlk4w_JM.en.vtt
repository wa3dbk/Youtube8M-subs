00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.733
Hi

00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:10.700
In this video I'm showing you my first RF project

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.867
I'm using 2 RF Modules

00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:18.867
They cost me 22â‚¬ (expensive in Portugal!)

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:24.467
I'm using the Arduino to send data to the encoder through Serial

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:30.633
the data is sent to the Transmitter

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:37.300
received by the receiver

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.767
and decoded by the decoder

00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:42.267
to light the 4 LEDs.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.133
These wires are just the power! (no cheating :D )

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:54.867
I'll run a script that I programmed in Python

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.633
The script is reading data from my Joystick

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:10.167
printing it in the console and sending it to the Arduino

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.000
trough Serial

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:16.300
I'll try to demonstrate it simultaneously...

00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.967
As you can see, as I move the joystick

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:22.867
the console is updated with the new values

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.033
Those values are sent to the Arduino

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:32.100
transformed into digital data to light the LEDs

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:44.833
With this, I can light each LED by moving the joystick

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:52.767
to each position (up, down, left, right)

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:09.067
I also programmed it to be compatible with multiple directions

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:28.200
However, I'm having trouble

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:33.867
when my joystick is in its center position

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.300
all the LEDs light up...

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:48.433
By the way, this is just my first project...

00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:50.967
Thanks for watching! ;)
