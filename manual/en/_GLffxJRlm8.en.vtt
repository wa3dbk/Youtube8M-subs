You've 
probably heard that Windows 8 is very different
from earlier versions of Windows, and it is.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.380
But the good news is that Windows 8.1 brings
back many of the features that were missing

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.140
when Windows 8 first came out, making it much
easier to use.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.870
If you have Windows 8, you can download 8.1
for free. Just go to Microsoft.com and click

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.070
Downloads to find the most recent update.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.910
Windows 8 offers a completely new computing
experience. If you've used Windows before,

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.579
the first thing you'll notice is it looks
totally different. Microsoft has moved a lot

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.300
of things around, and it may take you a while
to figure out how to do even the most basic

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.170
tasks, like finding your files, or switching
to a different program. One reason why they've

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.420
made so many changes is they wanted Windows
8 to run on tablets, as well as desktops and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.799
laptops.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.030
There are actually two different views in
Windows 8. Right now we're looking at the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.729
Start Screen. The other view is the Desktop,
which looks very similar to earlier versions

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.700
of Windows. Chances are, you'll use both of
these views for different tasks, and you'll

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.490
get used to switching back and forth.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.200
Let's take a look at the Start Screen. You
can click on an app to open it. Unlike earlier

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.780
versions of Windows, apps don't open in a
window; they fill the entire screen. But if

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.640
you prefer multitasking, you can drag the
app to the side, and then open a second app.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.640
To close apps, just move your mouse to the
top of the screen. If you're using a tablet,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.060
you can close apps by dragging them down.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.399
Now let's take a moment to look at the Desktop.
This view is pretty similar to earlier versions

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.880
of windows, but it's gone through some changes
-- most notably involving the Start button.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.909
When Windows 8 first came out the Start button
had been removed, but a lot of users found

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:17.239
it hard to adjust to using a desktop without
a start button. So Microsoft brought it back

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.430
in the 8.1 update, but it functions a little
differently than before.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.829
Let me show you what I mean. The Start button
used to display a list of programs and shutdown

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.639
options. Now clicking it brings you back to
the Start screen so you can access your programs

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:36.529
and apps - as well as shut down options, and
a new search button.

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:40.849
While you're on the Start screen, you may
notice some tiles changing. These are Live

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.169
tiles -- they let you see information on the
tile itself without even clicking on it. That

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:50.639
means you can see the weather, news headlines,
and more right from your Start Screen.

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:56.510
To get the most out of Windows 8, you'll want
to go to onedrive.com to create a free Microsoft

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.069
account, if you don't already have one. This
will let you use Microsoft's online services.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.829
For example, you can use OneDrive to store
your documents, photos, and other files in

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:14.189
the cloud. You can also store your calendar,
contacts, and more online. Why is this important

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:19.430
for Windows 8? Well, you can log in with your
Microsoft account, and it will automatically

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.040
pull your calendar, email, photos, and more,
so you can access them easily from your Start

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.279
Screen. The coolest part of this is that you
can log in to any computer that has Windows

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:36.010
8, and all of your settings and your OneDrive
files will be there.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.260
Now if you're wondering where all of your
old files and folders are, don't worry: You

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.260
can still get to them by going to the Desktop
and navigating to the folder that you want.

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.010
And many of your existing programs will still
run from the Desktop view, although you should

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.879
do some research to find out whether they
are Windows 8 compatible.

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.540
As you can see, Windows 8 has introduced a
lot of changes.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.180
If you're not comfortable re-learning how
to use your computer, then you may want to

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.609
stick with your current version for now. But
if you're really into new technology, and

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.979
you like the idea of storing your files in
the cloud, chances are you'll feel right at

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.369
home in the new Windows 8.
