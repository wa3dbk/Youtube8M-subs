00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.290
It's time to start fishing now. In our survival
pack I kept fish hooks, we have safety pins

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:16.270
which can double for fish hooks, these things
are great. We also, have some string which

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:23.400
is great for out fishing line that we're going
to be using, we have our wire, now this wire

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.560
can actually turn into fish hooks if you don't
have any, so you can take this off, break

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.070
it, an make fish hooks. Then I have a little
weight, now this weight is just a rock that

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.159
I found next to the creek here that I'm going
to tie off on the bottom to make sure that

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:44.389
the line goes all the way to the bottom of
the creek bed. Make a nice little knot here,

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:51.069
okay, now we have our weight. Now we need
to tie on our fish hooks, now what we're going

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:55.120
to do is we're going to put on our fish hooks
at different levels on the string. This is

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.929
to make it so that we can leave it out there
and, hopefully, get more fish on our line.

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:11.100
So, go ahead, string it, just like this, find
the point that you want it at, I'm going to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:23.590
want my fish hook right there. So, tie it
off, there's one, now let's do the same with

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:41.560
this other one, I'm going to want this one
just a little bit higher, just like that.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.850
Okay, now we have our weight that's going
to go all the way down, then we have our two

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.750
fish hooks, if you have more fish hooks this
is great, put them all down the line so that

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.950
you can make sure that you catch more fish.
Now you're going to need bait, now the best

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.330
thing for bait is usually grubs or insects.
Now, you can find all of these under a lot

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.140
of wet log, if you look up, anywhere in these
mountains, you can find a dead overturned

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.180
trees, lift those up you're going to find
maggots, a really good source of protein for

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.829
fish, so their going to like maggots a lot,
any insect, six legged, anything you can hook

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.950
onto this one right here. Just be careful
of spiders because you don't want to get bit

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.889
and then have a health problem. So, all you
have to do, string on earthworms, are another

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:34.200
good thing, go ahead and string them on right
there, throw this in. If you have a little

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.270
booby, you can take a little blown up balloon
or if you keep condoms in your survival pack,

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.950
as well, you can blow one of those up, tie
it off on the top and use that as your bob,

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.730
otherwise you can extend your string and have
it tied off to a little branch or scrub on

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.209
the side of the creek bed on the side of the
lake. Now that's how you fish, so get on with

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:56.219
it.
