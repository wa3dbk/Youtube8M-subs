00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:05.338
( intro music )

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:17.049 line:0%
Jimmy: So, in terms
of free soloing,

00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:21.187 line:0%
undoubtedly the
greatest free soloist
that ever lived is...

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.391 line:0%
this kid, Alex Honnold.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.492
Pretty quiet.

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:29.562
Grew up
in the suburbs of Sacramento.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:33.699
He pretty much...
You know, you think

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.801
next generation and
next generation,

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.136
what are people going to do?

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:40.040
Well, he's kind of
skipped a generation

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.877
and started soloing things
that were unthinkable.

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:48.114
I'm going to play
a quick little video from...

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:49.382
about Alex.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:52.685
( music )

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:55.754 line:0%
Mark: Free soloing has
to be the ultimate

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:59.292 line:0%
in free climbing.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.427
Alex: So, it's a beautiful
to go out soloing.

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:03.663 line:0%
Mark: To free solo is
to go without a rope

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:05.031 line:0%
and to go without gear.

00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:08.468
To only have your rock shoes
and your chalk bag

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:11.003
and the power of the mind.

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.739
It's also very
profound ( laughs ).

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:16.575
Reason it's probably
the ultimate,

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:20.279
is one wrong move,
you fall, you die.

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:21.214
( beep )

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:23.816
Alex: Okay, let me
try that again.

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:26.485
Mark: And the person
at the top of this game,

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:28.888
and it's hard to even
call this a game,

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:31.257
is Alex Honnold.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.029
Alex Honnold is probably
a perfect example

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:39.732
is someone who's not
only trained very hard,

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:42.168
but is unbelievably gifted.

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:44.571
He is like Michael Jordan.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:53.012
( quiet music )

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.780
Alex: I spend my whole
year living in the van,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.182
traveling from one
destination to another.

00:01:57.182 --> 00:01:58.550
Yeah, I would say that Yosemite

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.219
probably is the center
of my climbing.

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.088
That all my climbing
goals, all training,

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:03.222
all kind of revolves

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:05.491
around things
that I want to do in Yosemite.

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.092
This is by far my favorite
place for soloing.

00:02:07.092 --> 00:02:08.494
Because the walls
are so inspiring.

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:09.762
Like, everything here's so big.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:11.397
That's what gets me excited
about soloing stuff.

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:13.466 line:0%
One of the most
memorable moments

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.167 line:0%
was pitch 22, of The Nose.

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:16.202 line:0%
I put my rope away

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:19.839 line:0%
and I switched to soloing.

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.808
I just had a moment of...,
like this is surreally cool.

00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:24.477
I was like, I can't
believe I'm up here

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:25.644
with no rope just climbing.

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:27.046
Like, this is rad!

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:37.590 line:0%
Mark: You know,
Alex has now done

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.960 line:0%
the regular route
on Half Dome free solo.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.795
So for most people
on this planet

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.963
who are serious climbers,

00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:46.766
doing Half Dome in a day or two

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.634
is considered fantastic.

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:53.572
Alex did it in three hours
without a rope.

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:54.773
Alex: You know, you commit.

00:02:54.773 --> 00:02:56.575
You're like, I'm
doing this, here I go.

00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:58.577
But then after a couple hours
of being all committed,

00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:00.446
you're like, man I'm tired.

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:03.082
Your mind starts
to get a little bit tired.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:05.585
So I kind of stalled out
and then I started to doubt

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:08.554
if I was doing it right
or if I had the right holds.

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:09.855
Why am I even here?

00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:11.658
You know, do I want to do this?

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:15.728
Um.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.196
Cameraman: Just come back
if you're not feeling it.

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:20.633
Alex: Well, that's the thing.
I am like...

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:22.935
Mark: That stalled him out,
that paralyzed him.

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:24.537
Then he overcame it.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.705
He didn't work that route
a hundred times.

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:29.475
He just got up, below it,
looked up at it,

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:32.744
and believed,
absolutely believed

00:03:32.744 --> 00:03:35.181
it was well within his ability.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.785
Alex: You know, it seems
like in this last season

00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:41.587
I've sort of embraced

00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:43.622
the whole experience,
you know,

00:03:43.622 --> 00:03:45.625
embraced the
unpleasant parts too.

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:47.593
It's kind of cool
to just look around,

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:49.162
you know, enjoy the exposure.

00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:52.031
Be like, this is why I'm
here, this is awesome.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.543
