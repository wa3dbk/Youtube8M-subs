00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.429
OK, here we are with Asphalt 7 Heat.

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.999
You'll know the Gameloft 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:18.619
creation fairly well.

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.339
As you can see the frame rate for 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:21.420
Asphalt 7

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.650
it's okay.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.349
I've taken off the accelerometer
just to make it a little bit easy for you guys

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:31.769
to see.

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.930
But also for me to actually
be able to play.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.310
It's quite difficult to tilt the game

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.309
while you're playing. I don't personally
find the accelerometer all that

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.769
accurate in this game you know, compared
to games like Real Racing 2,

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:48.310
also I think

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.180
this isn't the best example of a racing game
with the Samsung Galaxy S3.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.760
Real Racing 2 just seems to be 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.020
a bit smoother

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.520
better looking, better textures etcetera.
This has got really really nice 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.660
lighting going on

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.800
 etcetera and high dynamic range

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.890
but the textures are just weak and look
at that

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.080
pop up in the distance.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.750
Just feels like a game that

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.260
could have been...

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.510
you can see the frame rate is really

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.390
starting to struggle there as you
go round the corners.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.250
It just feels like a game that's just not
been well optimised.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.580
Certainly the suggestion of another
Gameloft title that isn't using the 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.480
Samsung Galaxy S3 to its fullest extent.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.310
Just like Batman and Spiderman
before it.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.799
You know, it just feels like this game engine of
Gameloft's is about done.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.310
They really need to move on now. My
recommendation guys,  why don't you just buy a 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.920
licence for Unity or 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.669
push ahead and get your own real engine
out of the door.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.270
At the moment I have to say

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.120
it's not a great example of a game. I suppose

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.240
from our perspective it's 69p

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.670
on the apps store.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.690
Play Store should I say, so it's not exactly
a bank 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.060
breaker but even so it's not the killer
title for the Samsung Galaxy S3. You can see

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.329
there the frame rate's just struggling along.

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:14.049
And for a game with such poor textures as
 well, it feels badly optimised. Gameplay

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.609
wise, it's fun, do you know what I mean.
Other than the slowdown, the 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:24.099
twenty frames a second dips that you
get from time to time the game is fun

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.529
but it's a bit limited, do you know what I mean?

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.819
The old adage of get in front, stay in front

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.939
pretty much works here, once you're in front
unless you crash into something

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.199
you're going to win the race. Easy as that.

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.469
The AI doesn't really put up much of a fight
or a challenge it doesn't really 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.179
seem to be able to 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:42.309
give me a run for my money particularly

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.049
although admittedly, I've only done the first

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.049
four or five races so far.

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.579
You see there it should do something else.

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.699
Interestingly, the faster the car goes the
better the frame rate seems to get

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:58.979
so I don't know whether they've just got a 
bad bit of optimisation going on

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:03.339
but I've noticed that the faster the car goes
or appears to go anyway,

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.399
the smoother the frame rate gets. Weird.

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:11.299
You can see there as you come round
this corner, much much smoother

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.479
than some of the others.

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:16.929
Loads of cars to unlock, loads of upgrades
for every single car, boost your handling

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:21.129
things you can see there. Seems to be on 
this corner here it has a bit of a frame

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.119
rate dip.

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.779
each and every time.

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:29.119
It's not the worst game I've ever played

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:33.169
but if they were trying to charge like Â£4.99 for it
I'd be saying avoid.

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.219
At 69p, well worth it.

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.619
You know, good bit of fun. In app purchases

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.749
are there, joy of joys!

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:45.249
When more companies learn if they are
charging for a game the in app

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:49.059
purchases should be a given or at least
give us a big bundle to start with

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:50.339
to say thank you for buying our game

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:52.599
and actually forking out for it
and not just stealing it.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.089
And here's a little prize pack

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:58.759
but no. So you get to pay 69p and  there's in app
purchases if you want to 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:02.310
buy more gold etcetera or  faster 
car boosts or a quicker car.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.249
The standard pay to win junk.

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:10.149
Asphalt 7's not a bad game

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:12.629
you're going to have fun with it.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.389
You're probably going to get a bit annoyed
at the frame rate. I know I did.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.460
That's Asphalt 7.
