yes that is me

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.950
back in 2006 when I used to live in
panama

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.490
me in my theater group lied and told the
producers apartments solace that we were

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.180
stopped men

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.140
and that's how I ended up on a boat with
my head shape taking shots at James Bond

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.670
and today I'm gonna tell you about Sony
India launching

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.290
its new Ranger Android TV's in India the
smart TVs are based on Google Android

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.170
platform

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.650
and I'm gonna tell you but our first
impression at the Sony Bravia 50 inch W

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.750
1950 see

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.210
let's take a quick look the Android TV
experience and the Sony Bravia $50

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.800
instantly ninety fifty-seat

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.580
bought the TV and you agree with the
familiar Android boot up splash screen

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.610
followed by the Andhra text logo
confirming the native Android

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.390
integration

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.080
our first encounter with the Sony
Android TV interface was pleasant and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.230
somewhat familiar

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.450
for stuff the home screen offers all the
features ass

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.770
movies and games that you can download
via the Google Play Store

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.570
the TV comes with 16 gigabytes of
storage I don't which you get

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.340
8 gigabytes of memory Fri 10 stop after
the interface is clean and offers flat

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.110
Android 5.0 style tiles and hearts clean
lines

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.680
flattened visually pleasant is the best
way to describe the interface

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.890
right below the feature aP's you get
direct access to

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.260
all inputs to quickly switch to specific
HDMI

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.690
component compas it and the analog input
it's a pity that the optional touch pad

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.690
mount comes as an add-on accessory that
need to be purchased separately

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.550
for all 1080 P models all in all the
Android TV interface in the Sony Bravia

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.810
Delhi 950 째c is pretty slick and
user-friendly

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.780
it is generally and easy to master
interface Bobby absolutely comfortable

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.129
but Android users

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.510
will feel right at home from the very
first encounter with the TV

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.819
while the overall interface and menus
are sort of similar to what you get on

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.069
Android smartphone

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.349
the aP's library in terms of the APs and
the cat urbanization is not the same as

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.200
what you get and the Android Play Store
on your phone

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.080
the absent billable are tuned towards
media consumption

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.980
enhance won't be able to get access can
install on the App Center available on

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:37.610
Play Store

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.010
what we don't like those the paltry 8
gigabytes of free memory perhaps

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.360
and the strings decision to keep the
touchpad as well as the cameras a

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.140
separate accessories that needs to be
purchased additional

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.860
disabling the use of the voice in for
facility as a default

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.920
outta the box features the Sony Bravia
Delhi 950 째c is a far cry from most

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.329
modern-day televisions that are often
dressed

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.060
in glossy chrome and shiny surfaces this
Sony TV is all about matte finish in

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.690
subtle classic looks

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.889
the side basil is extremely then at
sixteen point two millimeters in

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:10.560
thickness

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.560
and the frame is made of high quality
metal wood grain Matt

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.739
finish point edge-lit LED TV with a 50
inch be

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.819
a panel that uses frames dimming
technology we are super impressed with

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.940
the image quality the Sony Bravia w9
fifty-seat

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.560
the very first thing you notice about
the image quality is the black lips

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.470
the TV offers brilliant black levels
with almost no sign and any

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.280
ugly gray tones berle awesome detail in
overly dark scenes

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.879
the second thing that impressed this was
the contrast and brightness levels

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.470
while we suggest you wait for our
detailed review our first impressions

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.840

good

the TV handles motion very well for 60
Hertz native panel

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.739
we never faced any gender or motion blur
issues on fast-moving action scenes

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.819
the Sony Bravia EE 950 째c

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.269

couple with the supplied sound more like
to offer that houses to sidebar and 10

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.769
what plus 10 watt bass drivers work
together to deliver a satisfying aural

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:14.599
