00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.140
Hi, I'm Shawn Schaefer on behalf of Expert
Village and today, we're going to learn the

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:12.980
basics in rock drumming. I like to call it,
"Rock Drumming 101 - The Basics". So, now

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:20.560
that we know how to play a basic quarter note
drum beat - one, two, three and four - we're

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.850
going to move on to what are called, "eighth"
notes. Like quarter notes, there is four in

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:33.090
one bar. You have this one bar. Well, let's
take that same one bar, and let's play eighth

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.829
notes, for an example. Well, eighth notes,
there's eight in a bar, right? But you don't

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.460
count them one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight. Basically, each quarter note,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.030
the four quarter notes - one, two and three,
four - they get a second note, if you will,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.879
or a second eighth note. And you count it
like this: one and two and three and four

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:04.449
and... okay?. So, the quarter note beat, to
count one bar would be one, two, three, four.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.790
Eighth notes would be counted as one and two
and three and four and. So you still have

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.600
your four quarter notes, one, two, three and
four. But each quarter note consists of two

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.840
eighth notes: one and, two and, three and,
four and. Now it's important to note, we were

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.259
talking about a puzzle earlier, that an eighth
note - the "and" if you will, like say, "one

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:37.700
and" - the "and" of "one" is exactly in between
beat one and beat two. So, if you have one

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.909
 - well, let me do it this way - one and two,
right, "and" would be exactly in the center.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:52.280
So you would have one and two. Right? One
and two. It's exactly in the middle, or symmetrical.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.850
So let's practice counting bars of eighth
notes, or measures of eighth notes. It would

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:07.520
go like this: one and two and three and four
and one and two and three and four and one

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:15.480
and two and three and four and. Keep practicing
counting those eighth notes. Like I said,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.220
practice makes perfect, and that's going to
be instrumental in what we're going to be

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.350
doing next. As a drummer, you always have
to count, and this is just an extension of

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.280
counting quarter notes. We're learning how
to count eighth notes. This is very important.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.120
So keep practicing, and let's see what we've
got next.
