00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.985
On your right upper arm,
to tell friend from foe.

00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:09.154
Davies, this arm.
Starboard arm.

00:00:09.222 --> 00:00:11.489
Your right arm.
The arm you got
or the arm you don't got?

00:00:11.557 --> 00:00:13.491
All right. That's enough
cheek, davies.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.429
&lt;i&gt;Take your neckcloths&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and put them 'round&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;your right upper arm.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:21.133
Make way for the captain.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.685
Congratulations, lieutenant.
Right, lads.

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:27.788
Now, I know there's not
a faint heart among you.

00:00:27.856 --> 00:00:31.610
I know you're as anxious as I am
to get into close action.
[ all muttering agreement ]

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:35.046
But we must bring 'em
right up beside us
before we spring this trap.

00:00:35.114 --> 00:00:37.849
That will test our nerve.

00:00:37.917 --> 00:00:41.036
&lt;i&gt;And discipline will count&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;just as much as courage.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:44.472
&lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; acheron &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a tough nut to crack.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.691
More than twice our guns.
More than twice
our numbers.

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:49.161
And they will sell
their lives dearly.

00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:53.531
Topmen,

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:56.534
Your handling of the sheets
to be lubberly and un-navy-like,

00:00:56.602 --> 00:00:59.221
&lt;i&gt;Until the signal calls&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;for you to spill the wind&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;from our sails.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:59.288 --> 00:01:02.307
This will bring us almost
to a complete stop.

00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:06.377
Gun crews, you must
run out and tie down
in double-quick time.

00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:08.880
With the rear wheels removed,
you've gained elevation,

00:01:08.948 --> 00:01:11.749
But without recoil,
there'll be no chance
to reload.

00:01:11.818 --> 00:01:15.253
So gun captains,
that gives you one shot
from the larboard battery.

00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:19.657
One shot only.
You'll fire for her mainmast.

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:21.993
Much will depend
on your accuracy.

00:01:22.061 --> 00:01:24.262
However,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.232
Even crippled,
she will still be dangerous.

00:01:28.634 --> 00:01:31.436
&lt;i&gt;Like a wounded beast.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:31.504 --> 00:01:34.739
Captain howard and the marines
will sweep their weather deck...

00:01:34.807 --> 00:01:37.075
&lt;i&gt;With swivel gun&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and musket fire&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;from the tops.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:37.143 --> 00:01:40.795
They'll try and even the odds
for us before we board.

00:01:42.315 --> 00:01:44.549
They mean to take us
as a prize.

00:01:44.617 --> 00:01:46.718
[ all chuckling ]

00:01:46.786 --> 00:01:50.154
And we are worth more
to them undamaged.
Their greed...

00:01:50.222 --> 00:01:52.223
Will be their downfall.

00:01:54.894 --> 00:01:57.562
England is under threat
of invasion.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.932
And though we be
on the far side of the world,
this ship is our home.

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:06.371
This ship... Is England.
