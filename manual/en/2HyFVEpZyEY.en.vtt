00:00:08.506 --> 00:00:16.096
&gt;&gt;All: Nobody likes me, everybody
hates me, guess I'll go eat worms.

00:00:16.526 --> 00:00:23.526
Long thin slimy ones, short fat juicy
ones, itsy bitsy fuzzy wuzzy worms.

00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:27.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These first graders at
Newsome Park Elementary dig worms,

00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:31.106
and they've designed an entire
project around them with the help

00:00:31.106 --> 00:00:32.666
of their teacher, Cathy Huemer.

00:00:32.746 --> 00:00:33.246
&gt;&gt;Oh, there's one.

00:00:33.246 --> 00:00:34.696
&gt;&gt;Cathy: You wanna
pick it up, Cameron?

00:00:35.226 --> 00:00:37.426
&gt;&gt;When they wanted to do
animals, they had idea.

00:00:37.426 --> 00:00:42.006
"Let's do snakes, let's do you know,
horses, let's do dogs, you know."

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:44.306
And so I keep raising
question to them, "Well, why?

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:45.426
What is it that you wanna know?"

00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:48.346
Well, they wanna know about, "Well,
where do these animals live?"

00:00:48.346 --> 00:00:49.986
So I said to them, "Are
we really gonna be able

00:00:49.986 --> 00:00:51.266
to go look for snakes, you know?

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.456
That might not be possible.

00:00:52.806 --> 00:00:55.086
Can you think of something
else that might be similar?"

00:00:55.086 --> 00:00:58.096
And someone just said,
"Let's do worms."

00:00:58.236 --> 00:01:00.366
Said, "Okay, we what
do we know about worms?

00:01:00.646 --> 00:01:02.156
What do we need to
find out about worms?"

00:01:02.556 --> 00:01:05.906
Phase one, which leads us into
phase two, which is the field work,

00:01:06.176 --> 00:01:07.566
the actual work that they're doing,

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.156
whether it's field trips,
lab work, experiments.

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:14.706
&gt;&gt;Student: We did a
experiment on dead worms.

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:19.346
We smelled 'em and
they didn't smell good.

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:25.656
And we had to pick 'em
up and feel the vein.

00:01:25.656 --> 00:01:29.316
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Worms are just one of the
subjects students explore in depth

00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:32.306
at Newsome Park, a K through
five science magnet school

00:01:32.306 --> 00:01:35.426
in Newport News, Virginia,
that has embraced the concept

00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:36.696
of project based learning.

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:40.046
&gt;&gt;See the different types
of fish that're here?

00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:42.596
&gt;&gt; Narrator: Each class picks a
topic to study for the semester.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.926
They then plan a research phase

00:01:44.926 --> 00:01:47.426
which includes field trips
to gather information.

00:01:49.836 --> 00:01:51.606
&gt;&gt;Student: Transportation,
four facts.

00:01:51.886 --> 00:01:55.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the conclusion of the
project, they share their findings

00:01:55.566 --> 00:02:01.316
in oral presentations, digital
slideshows, and display boards

00:02:01.356 --> 00:02:04.756
which are viewed and critiqued
by their parents and their peers.

00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:07.446
&gt;&gt;Peter: Project based learning
was really the delivery model

00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:11.066
that we felt would allow kids
to learn, and really learn

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:12.156
about what they wanna learn about.

00:02:12.246 --> 00:02:16.396
I mean, so many years, we've
been pumping kids full of stuff

00:02:16.396 --> 00:02:20.576
that we think is appropriate,
and really, in many instances,

00:02:20.576 --> 00:02:23.996
maybe that was successful, but it's
much more successful and exhilarating

00:02:24.346 --> 00:02:26.546
when kids have the
input that we allow them

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:27.856
to have here at Newsome Park.

00:02:28.176 --> 00:02:29.716
&gt;&gt;How do you spell "minerals?"

00:02:30.226 --> 00:02:32.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students here have
chosen to study everything

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:34.776
from space flight to homelessness.

00:02:35.386 --> 00:02:38.936
This first grade class decided
to explore cystic fibrosis,

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:41.486
a disease affecting one
of their classmates.

00:02:41.926 --> 00:02:48.126
&gt;&gt;One of our students has CF and
we're trying to learn about CF

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:52.156
to see what it is, how it works.

00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:58.716
Mucus starts getting into the
person's lungs and pancreas.

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:06.296
And we hope to find out
that there's a cure for CF.

00:03:06.396 --> 00:03:09.886
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students use programs
like PowerPoint and a series

00:03:09.886 --> 00:03:12.836
of thinking maps to turn
good project concepts

00:03:13.216 --> 00:03:15.116
into exemplary work products.

00:03:15.476 --> 00:03:18.956
&gt;&gt;Peter: The students of today are
really more in tune with everything

00:03:18.956 --> 00:03:22.006
that they have coming in at them
visually, so using the technology

00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:25.756
to represent their learning has
actually increased the quality

00:03:25.756 --> 00:03:26.256
of their work.

00:03:26.636 --> 00:03:28.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Even with the
latest technology tools,

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:31.866
project based learning can
be challenging for teachers.

00:03:31.946 --> 00:03:36.246
&gt;&gt;Patty: -- for us, and so we came up
with some questions for Miss Harbuck

00:03:36.246 --> 00:03:38.606
and she's coming in today
to tell us more, isn't she?

00:03:38.606 --> 00:03:38.946
&gt;&gt;Yep.

00:03:38.946 --> 00:03:39.976
&gt;&gt;Oh good, okay.

00:03:39.976 --> 00:03:41.496
&gt;&gt;Patty: It's easier to
teach out of a textbook,

00:03:41.496 --> 00:03:42.876
where this day it tells
me to do this,

00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:44.186
and this day it tells me to do that.

00:03:44.796 --> 00:03:46.356
So in a way, you've gotta be willing

00:03:46.356 --> 00:03:48.256
to work a little harder
too to do it this way.

00:03:48.256 --> 00:03:51.296
Even though it looks like the
kids are doing all the hard work,

00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:54.106
there's a lotta planning that
goes on behind it to make sure

00:03:54.666 --> 00:03:56.086
that the work is there for them.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.106
&gt;&gt;Do we have anybody in
this classroom with asthma?

00:03:58.226 --> 00:03:58.486
&gt;&gt;All: Yes.

00:03:59.726 --> 00:04:00.796
&gt;&gt;Patty: Yes, we do.

00:04:00.796 --> 00:04:01.086
And--

00:04:01.086 --> 00:04:03.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Since several of Miss
Vreeland's students have asthma,

00:04:03.906 --> 00:04:08.296
they're studying pets, focusing on
pets that don't make asthma worse.

00:04:09.586 --> 00:04:13.136
As part of every research
project, students seek out experts,

00:04:13.576 --> 00:04:16.596
like a guest speaker
from the local hospital..

00:04:16.596 --> 00:04:19.306
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Your lungs are made
up of different kinds of tissue.

00:04:19.306 --> 00:04:22.776
&gt;&gt;Patty: They know that they don't
have all the answers, and it's okay.

00:04:22.976 --> 00:04:25.386
They also know that Miss V
doesn't have all the answers,

00:04:25.386 --> 00:04:26.786
and it doesn't bother her a bit.

00:04:27.396 --> 00:04:29.156
And so we sit back and we go, "Okay,

00:04:29.156 --> 00:04:31.826
well who can we call,
who can we ask?"

00:04:32.066 --> 00:04:33.656
&gt;&gt;Thank you, thank you.

00:04:33.776 --> 00:04:36.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At lunchtime, students
get to test their social skills

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:43.206
and basic math, selling everything
from Walkathon pledges to marigolds.

00:04:43.206 --> 00:04:49.576
&gt;&gt;Student: We have marigolds, we have
two of these left, and mixed flowers.

00:04:50.146 --> 00:04:53.826
Those just all type of flowers,
like this flower, this whole patch,

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:55.736
it'll probably be like
that when they grow.

00:04:55.736 --> 00:04:56.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The plant business grew

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:59.576
out of a class investigation
into the stock market.

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:01.466
&gt;&gt;Robert: We talked about
what the stock market was.

00:05:01.466 --> 00:05:03.756
We actually invested in fancy stocks.

00:05:03.846 --> 00:05:06.396
We were thinking about
investing in some penny stocks

00:05:06.396 --> 00:05:08.856
and seeing how much money we
could make on the stock exchange.

00:05:09.336 --> 00:05:12.596
However, that became repetitive
and truthfully, somewhat boring.

00:05:12.906 --> 00:05:13.526
&gt;&gt;What you wanna buy?

00:05:13.786 --> 00:05:17.086
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Instead, the class
decided to create their own business.

00:05:17.156 --> 00:05:21.276
They bought seeds, grew the
plants and made sales brochures,

00:05:21.516 --> 00:05:25.566
funding the entire operation through
the sale of flower power stock.

00:05:25.696 --> 00:05:30.176
&gt;&gt;Robert: We ended up going around,
we sold ten cent shares of our stock

00:05:30.176 --> 00:05:32.936
in our company and we actually
raised over seventy-five dollars.

00:05:33.136 --> 00:05:34.196
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But the success

00:05:34.196 --> 00:05:36.536
of the fourth grade plant
projects sowed the seeds

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.756
of another lesson in
real life learning.

00:05:39.116 --> 00:05:41.936
It led to the mounting of
a hostile takeover attempt

00:05:41.936 --> 00:05:43.686
by Miss Shields' fifth graders.

00:05:44.246 --> 00:05:49.506
&gt;&gt;Student: Miss Shields' classes,
the fifth grade, is planning to take

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:53.306
and buy all the stock and leave them
for like five percent of their stock

00:05:54.076 --> 00:05:56.966
and take over their business.

00:05:56.966 --> 00:05:59.266
So we'll be in total
control of their business.

00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:03.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The process of learning
project based lessons has had a

00:06:03.066 --> 00:06:08.026
positive impact on everything from
test scores to classroom behavior.

00:06:08.026 --> 00:06:11.526
&gt;&gt;Peter: Our test scores
have improved, mainly I think

00:06:11.586 --> 00:06:13.506
because of the fact that
we've connected the learning

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:15.906
to real world problems,
and the integration

00:06:15.906 --> 00:06:19.036
of technology has helped the students
to actually product quality products.

00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:23.126
So that's the reward, and to me, it's
been probably the most rewarding way

00:06:23.126 --> 00:06:26.296
of teaching and learning that I've
experienced in my thirty years.

00:06:26.296 --> 00:06:27.566
&gt;&gt;It's a red wiggler.

00:06:30.066 --> 00:06:32.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For more
