00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.170
What's going on nation? Today I want to answer a question that I get asked all the time

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.679
Should I work out when I'm sore? Now

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.099
I actually saw a video on this topic the other day by another Youtuber and it blows my mind the amount of crap

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.270
That's out there, so this dude answers the question by BSing for a while

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.099
And then he throws in some fancy words here and there and everybody believes what he has to say

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.400
They just eat it up and in the end the stuff

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.689
He said didn't make any sense whatsoever or really amount to any

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.930
conclusion at all and this is what really gets to me nation you need to be able to tell the difference between

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.689
real-life experience and research knowledge

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.520
Versus people who know how to bs and babble about a topic for 10 to 15 minutes,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.279
but never really give you any concrete information

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.030
We're not venting and back to the topic at hand

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.099
We're going to talk about DOMS which stands for Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.999
So let's say you hit the gym ultra hard or come back to exercising after being out of the game for a while and about

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.659
A day to three days after your workout you start feeling sore

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.889
now the feeling of pain is what we call DOMS and it is caused by all the

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.289
Micro tears and inflammation that happens to your muscle tissue as a result of your workout

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.049
The process of repairing your muscles is what causes them to grow in size and get stronger

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.049
So this is all normal and a part of the process

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.438
But should you go back to the gym if your muscle is still sore the answer is it depends on how bad it is

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.799
If you're in a lot of pain, and you feel like something is wrong

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.719
And you think you might have gotten injured obviously you should not go to the gym

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.989
And you should go see a doctor most of us know our bodies

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.790
Well enough to know when something is not right, but this is not what I want to focus on today

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.729
Now if you didn't hurt yourself

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.419
but the muscle is very sore to the point that it hurts when you touch it or

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.909
Causes you not to have full range of motion

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.449
Then my answer is wait another day to work that muscle group and the key here is the muscle group

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.300
That is sore. I'm not saying skip the gym

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.199
I'm saying let the specific muscle recover and focus on another

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.419
Area for that day for example if my legs are killing me, I still train that day

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.420
But I'll adjust my schedule to work something like biceps

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.880
There's no need to rush the process nation because if you're experiencing DOMS

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.769
and can't even do full range of motion on your exercises

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.739
You're not going to have the most productive work out anyway

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.580
also

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.080
If your muscles are working on repairing the tears you inflicted on your previous workout

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.569
Creating more tears in damage will disrupt the recovery process so bottom line

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:50.669
Rest that area a little longer now if you're feeling reasonably sore but it's not as drastic as a situation

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.830
I just talked about it's actually a good thing to go to the gym and get the sore muscles moving

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.959
Just take it. Easy on the weights. This is not the time to go hardcore and try to hit a new PR

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.780
What you want to do is hit some aerobic exercises

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.780
And do some light lifting

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.440
activity in this case is good because it increases the temperature in the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.470
area which increases oxygen flow and flow of

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.799
Much-needed nutrients to help heal the damage this flow is also good because it helps take toxins away

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.089
Which are produced by the tears and subsequent inflammation of your muscle tissue

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.820
It was a mouthful

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.329
So no excuses nation even when you're extremely sore you should still go to the gym

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.699
It's just a matter of figuring out

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.730
how bad it is

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.390
So you can decide if you can hit that same area or if you have to come up with a plan b to work out

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.929
Another part of your body now knowing this you might be thinking if I get a workout in but I don't feel sore

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.209
Does it mean I'm not going to grow

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.940
Absolutely not, but I am going to talk about that in more detail another time

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.719
