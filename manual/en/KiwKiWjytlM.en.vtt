Hi, I'm Jay French from jayfrenchstudios.com
and I'm going to show you how to draw elves.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.410
Mostly we're going to concentrate on the face
because that's where most of the differences

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:19.859
are. And, we're doing the style of elves from
Tolkien, the Tolkien tall elves which are

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.419
also used in a lot of role playing games and
that type of thing, and in most fantasy. When

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.949
you get to elves, they're usually thinking
that way. Okay, well of course you have, here

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.289
we've got a basic head, we're going to do
our facial diagram. Let's get our pointed

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.309
ears in there. You can go a number of different
ways. You can make them short and pointed,

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.989
like Vulcan ears. I tend to go much higher
to make them more prominent, leaving the shorter

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.929
pointed ears for something like half breed
elves. Of course, in a lot of styles, such

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:02.589
as the Japanese Anime, the ears are almost
as long as the entire head. There's often

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:10.000
more of a slope to the forehead. There are
always very pointed and delicate features

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.100
to elves because they are supposed to be a
beautiful race, that's how Tolkien described

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:23.180
them. That's how the Slav's and the Norse
described them. They usually have long noses.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.211
One, because this kind of depicts, in a way,
age whilst still having the delicacy and the

00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:37.100
sharpness to the features to depict the beauty.
Having longer faces makes them seem a little

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:46.490
more mysterious and ancient. Of course, a
very important factor is the very angular

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:54.571
eyes. And, again, you can take this to any
number of levels of exaggeration. I tend to

00:01:54.571 --> 00:02:04.289
make eyes look over sized on elves and pretty
exaggeratively angled. Most elves are usually

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:16.160
depicted with very fair eyes, blues, greens
and golds, very angular lips, again going

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:30.010
for that whole beautiful race,
and very sharp, to continue the whole sharpness

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:44.300
of the features, very sharp and angular brows.
Perhaps give them some sharp cheek bones.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:57.590
And, they often have very flowing hair. We've
got a male figure here.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:05.480
And that adds to their, again, their beauty
and their mystery. They're usually depicted

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:15.210
as thin and lithe. And there you have our
basic lesson in how to draw elves.
