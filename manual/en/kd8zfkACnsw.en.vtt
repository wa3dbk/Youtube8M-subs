00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.550
A call came in that an aircraft had gone in the vicinity of

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.560
Morro Bay. And it was about 120 miles transit

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.600
flight from San Francisco International to the location

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.710
of the downed aircraft. We lucked out that day because

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.720
we had about a fifteen knot tailwind and we were able to get down there in about

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.800
45 to 60 minutes I'd say.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.570
It was going to allow for us to have about six to seven minutes on

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.570
station before we needed to go get fuel, so we had

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.620
opted to get down and try to get these guys as soon as possible.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.740
One of the things that we did was make a

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.760
backup plan, was that we would deploy a raft to these individuals if we had to.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.820
quickly deploy raft, go get fuel, and come back and retrieve them.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.940
Danny put me down there

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.970
swam over to the pontoon, climbed up on the pontoon

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.050
Made sure the cable wasn't going to get snagged on anything. At that point

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.200
by the time I had got down there, they had turned the engines and the plane

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.210
started listing. Both individuals had climbed

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.270
out of the cockpit onto the pontoon.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.390
Hooked up the 70

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.460
year old male first. We hoisted him up

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.590
into the cabin and we immediately set up and

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.630
it worked, so we immediately set up and did another direct deployment

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.790
back to the water, swam over to the sponson, climbed on there, hooked up the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.850
other 30 something individual

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.950
and did the same routine. Rolled him off into the

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.970
water, got away from the float plane and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:19.090
Danny hoisted us up into the cabin.
