00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.300
I'm Kendall Roberg from Burbank High School, and today we're going to learn to solve quadratic equations using imaginary numbers.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's start with this...

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.000
Let's solve x^2 = 4.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.000
This means some number times itself equals 4.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now to solve this we would take the square root of both sides, and we end up with x = plus or minus square root of 4.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The square root of 4 means some number times itself equals 4.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Well, it turns out that number is 2.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We can check this by noticing 2 times 2 = 4, and also -2 times -2 = 4.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
That's why the plus/minus is needed.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.400
Now let's try a different one.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Let's try x^2 = -1.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now, in this case, one number times itself equals -1.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:24.000
We'll start this problem the same way: take the square root of both sides, and we get x = plus or minus the square root of -1.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
What number times itself equals -1?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.500
Well, 1 times 1 is 1, and -1 times -1 is still 1, so this is kind of strange.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It turns out that we have to use an imaginary number, called i, to solve this problem.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.400
x = plus or minus i.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.700
i is a very interesting number.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It's very powerful in solving quadratics.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Let's try another one.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
In this problem, we are trying to solve x^2 = -32.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We'll start just like the others by taking the square root of each side, and we get x = plus or minus the square root of -32.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Let's rewrite -32 and see if we could find any squares.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000
x = plus or minus the square root of -1 times 16 times 2.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Now, the product of these three numbers is -32, but when written like this, we can clearly see that 16 is a perfect square, so we can pull out the root, 4, and put it in front of the radical.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.000
So let's do that...x = plus or minus 4 times -1 time 2. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Now, we need to deal with that -1.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
To deal with that -1, we pull its root out.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.500
Its root is i.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So we're left with x = plus or minus 4i times rad 2.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.000
And there's nothing more we can do with this.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.400
There's no more perfect squares we could factor out of the radical.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So now let's talk about some properties of i, the imaginary number.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Any number to the first power is simply itself.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So, i to the first power is i.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Now, remember, i is also the square root of -1, so we'll put equals the square root of -1.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.000
What about i^2?

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.000
Well, we can rewrite i^2 as the square root of -1 times the square root of -1.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And we get -1 because any square root times itself gives us the radicand, in this case, -1.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
What about i^3?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:32.000
We can rewrite i^3 as i^2 times i.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Well, i^2 was -1, and i was just i, so we end up with -1 times i, and that equals -i.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
What about i^4?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Well we can rewrite i^4 as i^2 times i^2.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:11.000
Each of these i^2's is a -1, so we get -1 times -1, and -1 times -1 is simply 1.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.000
Let's do one more...i^5.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.500
We can rewrite i^5 as i^4 times i.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:36.000
And let's see...i^4 was 1, 1 times i is simply going to be i again.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.700
And if we were to continue this with i to the sixth, seventh, eighth, etc., we'd actually notice a pattern, and the pattern goes like this.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:55.000
i, -1, -i, 1, and then the pattern starts again with i.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:02.000
i^6 would be -1, i^7 would be -i, i^8 would be 1. 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.800
Now let's see how we can use this to solve more complex - or actually, i to the higher powers.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Let's try i^20.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.000
We can rewrite i^20 as i^4 raised to the fifth power. 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:29.000
which would mean i^4 times i^4 times i^4 times i^4 times i^4.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Now i^4 = 1, so this equals 1 times 1 times 1 times 1 times 1.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.000
1 times 1 times 1 times 1 times 1 is simply 1.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Cool, so i^20 is 1.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Let's try i^21.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000
We can rewrite i^21 as i^20 times i.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Well, we just found out that i^20 is 1, so this can be rewritten as 1 times i.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
1 times i is i.
