00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.460
Of course there are people who like to show off their wealth

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.404
Such as Paris Hilton

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.560
There are people who would pay 25,000,000 KRW for a Pomeranian puppy.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.840
But they are all celebrities shown on media.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.220
(That doesn’t represent USA. Don’t judge the nation with that.)

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.160
Looking from the outside, if we go to Hollywood, LA or New York

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.720
There are people who show off their wealth there and in Europe too.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.520
But people are not criticized for that in USA.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.500
In France, you will get scolded right away.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.340
In Europe, bragging about your wealth is very inappropriate behavior.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.460
This bragging about wealth culture came in from USA.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.920
(Getting angry)

00:00:47.993 --> 00:00:49.993
So you are saying that it’s an influence from USA?

00:00:50.044 --> 00:00:52.044
Then what kind of influence is it?

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.580
Influenced by Hollywood movies?

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.720
This concept of ‘American Dream’

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:09.200
You need to show people when you wanted to have a huge success and you did in the end.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.760
That showing is ‘American Dream.’

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.420
(He is right.) Blair is right.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.020
&lt;Russia is in too&gt;

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.400
There was ‘American Dream’ in Russia, too.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.860
It is the same in Russia.
The concept of ‘American Dream’ came in when the country turned into democratic in the 90s.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.900
‘American Dream’ in Russia is

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.960
Making a lot of money and show it off to people.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.680
(Can’t take this any more)

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.880
The thing about ‘American Dream’ is

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.820
None of you are American.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.880
My father migrated to USA.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.260
He did not because he wanted to be rich.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.160
(Not all immigrant aims to become rich.)

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.680
Settling down in USA is American Dream

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.680
Not showing off wealth

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.700
That’s right.
But how it is perceived in Russia is different.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.608
And that’s because of USA?

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.080
Tyler Tyler (Ghana joins too)

00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:19.191
Atala (?) A-Tala (?) ???

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.500
Making a lot of money and showing it off is

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.242
All because of USA.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.800
(Getting out of control)

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.400
How many are against USA?

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.946
It’s all USA’s fault.????

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.040
Yes 6 vs whatever 1
