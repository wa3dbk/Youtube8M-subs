00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:26.222
What struck me most about Mongolia 
is its wide-open spaces.

00:00:26.285 --> 00:00:31.458
It's been amazing, to see all these colours
spread out across this massive landscape.

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:33.122
In thinking about how
 best to capture this,

00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:34.487
I knew that I need to choose a lens

00:00:34.487 --> 00:00:39.787
that I could have with me from golden hour
through sunset, all the way to the evening sky.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:49.139
For this reason, the AF-S NIKKOR 16â€“35mm f/4G ED VR will be the perfect lens

00:00:49.154 --> 00:00:51.974
to capture these breathtaking
 colours of this landscape.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.560
OK, right now I have a shutter speed of 1/125, 
an aperture of 5.6 and an ISO of 400.

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:03.969
What settings do I have to
 change when the night sky comes?

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.677
This lens has
 something on it called VR,

00:01:05.677 --> 00:01:08.012
which is Vibration Reduction,
 so we can turn that on,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.119
so when we're shooting at
 golden hour and sunset, we can shoot handheld.

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.277
But when it gets later in the evening,
we want to turn Vibration Reduction (VR) off,

00:01:15.277 --> 00:01:19.457
and put our cameras onto a tripod,
and then we can have longer exposures.

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:20.899
We're going to have to change our strategy.

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.200
For the night sky shots,
 we must use a tripod.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.711
It's not possible to hold a camera still
for as long as we need our shutter to be open,

00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:28.503
so we have to use a tripod.

00:01:28.503 --> 00:01:32.418
OK, so we're getting set now for the night sky,
and to be able to shoot stars over our camp site.

00:01:32.418 --> 00:01:35.202
So what I've got is the Nikon MC-36 Remote Cord,

00:01:35.202 --> 00:01:40.362
and this little device is neat, because the 
camera's default to shooting only 30-second exposures.

00:01:40.363 --> 00:01:45.599
What this lets me do is increase that exposure 
beyond 30 seconds, using the bulb setting.

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:48.897
I think for this scene, we'll start
with an exposure time of about 40 seconds,

00:01:48.897 --> 00:01:51.286
and see how the composition
 and exposure goes.

00:01:51.286 --> 00:01:53.590
So now, what we have to do
 is just wait for the stars.

00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:04.806
Let's take a look.
