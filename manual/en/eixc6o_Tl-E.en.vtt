MATT GRAHAM: When you're changing your strings,
you'll generally want to find a table or a

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:13.289
bed or I've got an ottoman here that you can
set the guitar on in front of you. I'm right-handed.

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:20.670
I like to have the headstock pointing to my
left. And I usually get a pillow or some soft

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.840
object that's not going to scratch the back
of the neck so that I can prop it up to--so

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.590
that the headstock is not laying flat on the
surface I'm working on. You can also if you

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.570
have a hard case with a compartment inside,
you can sometimes open the compartment of

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.870
the case and prop up the neck of the guitar
on the lid. So the first step that we're going

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.699
to want to do to change these strings is to
remove the old strings. And I'm just going

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:59.539
to take my string-winder tool and put it on
the low E string and start loosening the string.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:09.650
And generally, it's going to be that you will
turn the tuning key or tuner clockwise to

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.810
loosen the strings, assuming they've been
put on the right way. Again, you can also

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:25.600
just as easily use your fingers for this process.
And if you're new at this, you can look and

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:35.120
just visually see the string is loosening,
or you can also just pluck the string as you

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.829
loosen it. And you'll see if you're going
the wrong way, if you're tightening the string,

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:47.770
the note will go higher. But if you're loosening
it, it will get lower and lower until the

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.350
strings are basically just rattling against
the frets. So again, I'm going to get these

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:12.510
really loose. And now we're ready to move
on.
