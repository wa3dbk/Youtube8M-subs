Hi everybody, welcome to this short tutorial in which i'll show you how to start up the x-plane 10 default B747-400.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Here is the aircraft

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:30.000
First thing to do is to see the overhead panel.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Trying to get a good view...

00:00:41.000 --> 00:01:00.000
...and we need to open the BATTERY door and push the button. 
I show you...

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So we have the cockpit lights turned on and we can set every panel lights turning these knobs.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I show you...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Then we can activate the STANDBY POWER (doing like that) and the APU (doing like that).

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Next we have to switch our four BUS TIE on and the four generators as well.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Then we activate the APU ENGINE BLEED...

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and these other knobs too...

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.000
...and the four HYD PUMPS ones.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:30.000
As we can see, all the panels are on, but we have to wait this red sign "INOP" to desappear.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So we have to wait until these YAW DUMPER signs became "ON".

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:55.000
May we need few seconds...

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Meanwhile we can turn the "BEACON" and "NAV" lights on and of course the ANTI-ICE DETECTION.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Ok, now we have these signs on and we can turn the four HYD knobs off.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Now that every panel is perfectly working, we can turn the four engines on by pushing each knob under the throttle toggle and moving to the START section.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So take the knob number 1, pull it and release when the white light is on. Make this operation for the remaining 4, 3, 2 knobs.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:38.000
While the engines are getting power, these four generators become totally working so we have the power for the entire plane and we can switch the APU ENGINE BLEED off.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:07:05.000
As we can see, panels are perfectly workig and if we take a look from the outside we can notice that every engine is working good and by pressing the "X" key on the keyboard, we can have also a great smoke...

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So now the plane is perfectely turned on and ready for the before take off, take off and routing procedures.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Thanks for the attention and see you at a next tutorial!
