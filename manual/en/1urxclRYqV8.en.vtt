00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.213
-(Ian) Oh, you want to race?

00:00:01.213 --> 00:00:03.699
-(Ian) Vroom! Vroom! That's my engine!
Vrooooooommmm--

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:04.899
-(Anthony) SHUT UP!

00:00:05.563 --> 00:00:08.533
&lt;i&gt;Once there were two young men
 named Anthony and Ian.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.736
&lt;i&gt;They were expecting a very
 important package in the mail.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:13.896
Come on, Ian. It's probably in our mailbox by now.

00:00:14.587 --> 00:00:16.581
I don't get why we have to drive to get our mail.

00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:20.045
Is it really that hard to put
a little hole on everyone's front door?

00:00:22.013 --> 00:00:23.660
(sigh) Alright. Who's driving?

00:00:24.613 --> 00:00:25.674
I don't know. You want to drive?

00:00:26.734 --> 00:00:28.874
Not really. Can you just drive?

00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:30.646
I drove last time!

00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:33.170
-No, you didn't!
-Yeah, I did.

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:35.153
-Uh, no you didn't.
-Yes, I did!

00:00:35.153 --> 00:00:36.915
No, you didn't times infinity!

00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:39.808
Besides, I've got the logs to prove it.

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:43.778
You keep track of everywhere you drive?!

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.993
-Yeah, just for times I--
-What the hell is &lt;i&gt;Big Al's Playpen&lt;/i&gt;?

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:51.938
It's...It's a toy store, man.

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:55.080
Whatever. Either way, I'm not driving.

00:00:55.418 --> 00:00:57.839
Come on, man. Please, just drive for once.

00:00:58.254 --> 00:01:00.562
There's a creepy Sherpa living in my backseat.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.894
Right. And I'm a gay wrestler.

00:01:02.894 --> 00:01:05.234
I knew that's what &lt;i&gt;Big Al's Playpen&lt;/i&gt; was!

00:01:05.234 --> 00:01:07.663
Oh, come on, man! I was being facetious!

00:01:08.477 --> 00:01:10.459
Now, please, just drive!

00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.033
I can't.

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:13.459
Why not?

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:14.789
I broke my foot.

00:01:15.957 --> 00:01:16.529
When?

00:01:23.943 --> 00:01:25.348
Recently.

00:01:26.163 --> 00:01:29.094
Well, luckily you don't need your left foot to drive.

00:01:29.478 --> 00:01:30.574
I, however, do...

00:01:30.697 --> 00:01:32.245
Since I drive a manual!

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:39.728
Looks like &lt;i&gt;you're&lt;/i&gt; driving.

00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:42.373
I ran out of gas. I can't!

00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:45.124
Oh, really? Because it looks
like you're topped off.

00:01:45.124 --> 00:01:46.862
-Stop it!
-Take my gas!

00:01:46.862 --> 00:01:47.806
I don't want it!

00:01:47.806 --> 00:01:50.428
You're going to take my gas 
and you're going to like it!

00:01:52.826 --> 00:01:54.209
(screams)

00:01:54.586 --> 00:01:57.725
Well I can't drive if I can't see!

00:01:58.647 --> 00:02:00.316
(shrieks)

00:02:00.316 --> 00:02:03.335
Well, I can't drive if I'm not alive!

00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:04.878
(door slams)

00:02:06.814 --> 00:02:08.142
Get out of my car!

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:11.029
I'm sorry, what? I couldn't hear
you with the window up.

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.192
But the window's down.

00:02:14.114 --> 00:02:15.642
Dude, Ian! Stop this!

00:02:16.118 --> 00:02:17.874
Stop! Stop--

00:02:17.874 --> 00:02:20.276
Look what you did! 
You broke the frickin' window.

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:21.445
(sighs)

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.444
What the hell--(gasps and screams)

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:25.412
Sherpa!

00:02:26.697 --> 00:02:29.726
-Dude, there's a Sherpa in your car!
-I told you.

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:32.913
Alright. Screw it, I'll drive.

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:37.541
(engine starts)

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.674
This is ridiculous, man.

00:02:51.674 --> 00:02:53.264
You can't keep making me drive every time.

00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:58.303
Well? Open it.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.118
I didn't bring the key.

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:03.119
-Are you kidding me?! 
-You didn't bring it?!

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:04.073
(engine dies)

00:03:04.613 --> 00:03:06.312
Great. Now I'm out of gas.

00:03:06.635 --> 00:03:07.790
How are we going to get back?

00:03:09.928 --> 00:03:13.627
-Uh, I could call 9-1-1.
-No, no.

00:03:15.703 --> 00:03:19.502
I'll walk back and send rescue for you.

00:03:19.763 --> 00:03:22.140
You can't make it! It's too far!

00:03:22.985 --> 00:03:25.372
Ian, if I...(sigh)

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:26.977
If I don't make it back alive,

00:03:26.977 --> 00:03:35.632
I just want you to know that you've
been a really...really terrible friend.

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:40.816
(Ian) I know. You too, man.

00:03:47.675 --> 00:03:48.376
See ya'.

00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:52.685
Yeah. See ya'.

00:03:53.454 --> 00:03:57.796
&lt;i&gt;And so Anthony Padilla began
 his long, arduous trek through...&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:57.796 --> 00:04:02.037
&lt;i&gt;the barren wasteland, without food, 
water, or basic survival gear.&lt;/i&gt;

00:04:02.298 --> 00:04:04.383
&lt;i&gt;He barely made it home alive.&lt;/i&gt;

00:04:04.706 --> 00:04:09.775
&lt;i&gt;Unfortunately, his legs were 
severely frostbitten and had to be amputated.&lt;/i&gt;

00:04:10.097 --> 00:04:14.784
Yes. Times were tough in the 21st century.

00:04:15.598 --> 00:04:16.652
Any questions?

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:23.255
Uh, yeah. Did people from the past
really think we would dress this stupid?

00:04:24.492 --> 00:04:28.070
(helicopter heard from above) Help! Over here!

00:04:31.023 --> 00:04:32.561
Oh! (screams)

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:37.367
