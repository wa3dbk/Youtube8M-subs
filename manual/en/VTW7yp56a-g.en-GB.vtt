00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.960
Hello and welcome to Cupcake Addiction's Lady
Beetle Piñata Pop Tutorial where I'll be

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.220
showing you how to make this gorgeous little
no bake lady beetle piñata pops. They are

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.220
pretty unassuming little lady beetle. They're
very very cute, but when you bite into them,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.820
there's a hidden surprise, they're actually
full of little candies. So I've used M&amp;Ms

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.430
today but you can use any little candy you
like, Nerds, chocolate chips, whatever you

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.660
fancy.
Tools and equipment that we will be using

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.700
today:
I've got 2 zip lock bags.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.250
A pair of scissors.
I've got a silicon cakepop mold. So for those

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.840
of you that follow my channel My Cupcake Addiction,
you'll know that I use this for quite a few

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.160
different circular shapes and little candy
bombs and other things not necessarily cakepops.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.260
You can also use a sphere or round chocolate
mold to achieve a similar result.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.310
I've got some melted black candy melts.
Some melted red candy melts.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.310
Some mini M&amp;Ms or whatever your decided candy
is but make sure that it's a relatively small

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.400
candy so you can fit a little more in there.
I've got 3 spoons.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.030
I've got 2 of these little Wilton eyes sprinkles
which you can buy pre-packaged at a lot of

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.780
cake decorating shops.
I've got one unmelted black candy melt and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.939
one unmelted red candy melt.
So let's get started.

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.249
The first thing that you want to do is we're
going to prepare the actual body of our lady

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:26.950
beetle. So you want to take your spoon and
you just want to spoon in about a half a teaspoon

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.939
or so of that candy melts into a couple of
those little molds. However many you want

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.299
to make, you're going to need half a sphere
per lady beetle. So once you've spooned it

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.530
in, just use the back of your spoon just to
smooth it up the sides of that mold. And don't

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.780
worry if it's not particularly even, if you
can see a little few gaps poking through because

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.770
we are going to give that a second coat. So
pop that one off into the fridge and once

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.909
that's completely set, we'll come back, we'll
give it a second coat.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.909
Alright, so once that first coat is completely
dry, it's as simple as just repeating that

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.390
step, put in another half teaspoon or so into
each mold and just wipe up the sides so that

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.729
it's nice and even, making sure that you've
got no little gaps, nowhere you can see that

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.240
silicon mold coming through. Perfect!
Now just before I pop them into the fridge

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.990
this time, I'm just going to use my finger
and just wipe around the top edge just to

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.870
make sure you've got a really nice clean edge
on the top there which is going to give us

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.610
that nice flat base. Off into the fridge until
they're completely set.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.050
Okay, so we're back from the fridge. Now,
to get those out, you just want to sort of

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.000
release that seal around each one and just
pop them out. So you should have a nice little

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.680
half circle and that's going to form the basis
for our little lady bug.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.410
So once you put your half circles out, I just
like to sit them back in there and that's

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.520
just to give them a little bit of support.
Now we're going to just fill these up with

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.610
little mini-M&amp;Ms. The thing you want to think
about here is you don't want to come too far

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.120
over the top. So you really want to stay within
that line. You don't want to come building

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.700
out over the edges of your little piñata
there. Okay, so I've got maybe another 1 or

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:16.650
2 in this one. Perfect!
You want to take your unmelted red candy melt

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.850
and you just want to push it down so that
it's relatively level so you don't see those

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.690
M&amp;Ms - kind of just move them out of the way
a little bit. Beautiful!

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.020
Now you want to take a little bit more of
that red candy melt and we're going to just

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.370
spoon it into a zip lock bag. Make sure you
let all of that air out before you seal that

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.680
zip lock bag up and we're just going to cut
just a generous little corner, no exact size

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.140
here but don't make it too fine or it'll just
take you longer, so quite a large corner.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.980
What you want to do here is we're just going
to fill in this little gap. Now, don't apply

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.360
too much pressure because we don't actually
want to squeeze the candy melt into the gaps

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.620
in between those little M&amp;Ms. We really just
want to settle it on top so it's going to

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.420
hold that unmelted melt in place and give
us a nice flat bottom. So I'm going to squeeze

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.970
once all the way around without putting too
much pressure and then I'm not squeezing now,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.560
I'm just taking the bag just to level it all
off. I'm just sort of redistributing that

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.810
chocolate so it goes right to the edges of
that silicon mold and then kind of bring it

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.120
in a little bit over that unmelted melt and
that's going to give us that really nice flat

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.370
even bottom. Perfect! Now you want to put
that one off into the refrigerator and you're

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.470
going to let that completely set.
I've pre-prepared one of this just for the

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.850
speed of our tutorial today. So when you pop
it out, it should look just like this. So

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.270
you've got your sort of flat bottom there
and you've got your little domed top and we

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.030
know it inside are all those gorgeous M&amp;Ms.
If you happen to get a little air pocket or

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.660
anything like I've got here on your little
cakepop ball or your little round sphere,

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.320
don't worry because we're going to stick on
all sorts of detailing anyway.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.960
So to decorate, we want to take our zip lock
bag and we're going to add in some of that

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.380
black candy melt, all the way to the corner
of the bag, letting all the air out and sealing

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:07.170
it up. For this one, you want to cut off a
little bit of a smaller corner than what you

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:13.850
did for the other bag. So it's quite small
and when I squeeze it out, you can see there

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.620
that's about the size line that we're getting
out of it.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.840
Now, to do our main body line and this is
the first thing that we're going to do. It's

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.760
better off if you don't try to be too precise,
the slower you go, the wobblier it's going

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.820
to be. So turn him on to the side that you
want. I want the head to go here to cover

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.350
up that little air pocket. So I'm going to
go across like this.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.650
Whenever I paint on chocolate or whenever
I pipe on anything, I try to start about a

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.220
centimeter or so before and finish about a
centimeter or so after. It kind of stops me

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:48.620
getting speed wobbles along the way. So I'm
just going to start squeezing straight across.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.380
Look at that! The slower you go, as I said,
the more likely you are to get speed wobbles.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.330
Pick it straight up, turn it around and you've
got that beautiful straight line. And take

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.080
it from me, I'm not the best piper so it's
pretty easy to get a straight line if you

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.470
do it that way.
Now you want to take your unmelted black candy

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.940
melt, we're going to just squirt on a little
bit of that melted candy melt and we're going

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.060
to use that to attach it or to glue it on
to the front of our lady beetle's head, like

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.220
so. Perfect!
Now you want to do your little dots. I just

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.330
did 3 on each side, and once again I'm just
going to paint those on using the zip lock

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.580
bag. Don't make this too thick or too heavy,
particularly the ones on the side because

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.860
you don't want them too dribble down and become
more like ovals. You want to stay nice round

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.870
little circles.
I love these because you can make them up

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.871
to a week in an advance, just store them in
an airtight container. Do not put them in

00:06:39.871 --> 00:06:43.850
the fridge because that's going to cause those
M&amp;Ms inside to sweat and lose their color.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:49.560
They're going to be fine just at room temperature
- just keep them in an airtight container.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.550
So you've got all your little dots. You might
have some little spikes on top of your dots,

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.460
just leave them for now. Once that chocolate
starts to set, you can just go and dab them

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.040
down. But don't try to dot while that chocolate
is wet or you're going to make a big mess.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.540
So taking your 2 little Wilton eyes, little
dab of black candy melt on the back of each

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:11.870
and we're just going to pop those on to the
top of that unmelted black candy melt that's

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:17.979
forming our lady beetle's face. Perfect!
Now, wait until the dots are completely set

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:23.130
before you try to do this. I'm going to pick
him up and just give him his little smiley

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:31.290
face, just piping on a little half circle.
As I said with those candy melt dots, once

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:35.290
they start to set a little bit, so once they're
starting to firm up, you can just use your

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.740
finger and you can just dab them down and
it will actually take the little spikes off

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.810
them.
So there you've got your gorgeous little piñata

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:48.150
pop lady beetle, perfect for so many different
occasions. I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.720
I hope you'll use this technique in a party
coming up soon.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.189
Thanks very much for tuning in to My Cupcake
Addiction.
