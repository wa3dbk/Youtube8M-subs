00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's really lively. I was really surprised
and it's really, really, really lively: it's

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.000
got everything you need.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.740
Originally I did apply to do my Masters at
some universities in London, but I don't think

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.330
I would be able to go, here is a perfect size.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:39.330
I like personally Nottingham: the night here,
it's a green city. I play cricket and whatever

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.700
I want, I can do it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.900
I have been to the UK like when I was younger
to learn a language, all those things, but

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.410
I've never lived abroad and I thought it was
going to be quite difficult but in here, it's

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.830
like actually quite the opposite.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:01.730
It's an international city, I could fit in.
You see you can find people from different

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.100
places and they're all friendly and jolly.
That's the first thing that struck me.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.860
I not only do this as the engineering faculty,
amazing, but I also like the campus, I like

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.000
the town. I just like the whole feel.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.530
I like that I can cycle everywhere really,
same time have a very effective transport

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.310
system with you know trams, the train.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.890
And also there's, there's a lot of social
things and lots of gigs. You can come into

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.539
town and you've got the Trent Arena and Rock
City and, I don't know, there's ballet, some

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.790
theatres and cinemas. Lots and lots of pubs
and clubs, so yeah it's great.
