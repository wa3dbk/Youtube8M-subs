00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.919
What do you think I'm eating?

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.009
This is....

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:16.139
plain...

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.339
white bread!!!

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:20.970
White bread in Japan

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.119
is sooo good!! 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.640
You don't need to put anything on it!

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.970
I'm always eating it like that

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.600
Canadian white bread is kinda...

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.380
dry

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.610
and gross

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.510
It's pretty much tasteless

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.900
and it doesn't have a nice texture

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.310
Well,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.350
overall not very good.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.640
Japanese white bread is really

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.480
fluffy and delicious

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.110
You don't need to put butter or anything on it.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.030
People who have been to Canada

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.400
Let me know what you thought!

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.850
How was the cheap white bread there?

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.390
But, in Canada

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.600
there are many types of nice bread! 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.540
So that's the good thing.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.910
But in terms of cheap white bread... 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.870
Japan WINSSS

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.120
The one I'm eating right now is

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:32.120
from Yamazaki bread company

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.290
It's called "Funwari"

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.670
SO GOOOOOOD

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.390
It really tastes like cake or something!

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.210
I was so surprised when I tried it

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.680
SO DELICIOUS

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.890
