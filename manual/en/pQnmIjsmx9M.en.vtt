00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.139
Whether you're new to the iPhone, or you just
need a refresher, learning how to navigate

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.650
iOS is a great place to start.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.340
In this video, I'm going to show you some
of the basics, including how to operate your

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.289
device using multi-touch gestures.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's begin with the Home screen, which is
the screen you see here.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.720
It includes shortcuts to all of your apps…
and several different screens to help you

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.110
stay organized.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.379
You can navigate between them using the swipe
gesture.

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.940
There's also the dock at the bottom… and
the status bar at the top.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.230
Here, you can swipe down to view your notifications.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.649
Notifications can alert you to many different
things on your device, including new messages,

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.899
emails, reminders, and more.

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.180
To open a notification, tap the one you want.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.589
You'll be taken straight to the source—in
this case, the Reminders app.

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.750
From here, it's easy to return home using
the Home button on your device.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.140
Keep this button in mind, because you're going
to use it pretty frequently.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.560
After all, the Home screen is sort of like
the desktop on your home computer.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.399
To open any app, all you have to do is tap
the icon.

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.470
Why don't we try Maps?

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.610
Sometimes it can be difficult to see the screen
on your device because it is fairly small.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.670
Luckily, there are two different ways to zoom
in and out.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:41.590
For example, in some apps, all you have to
double-tap… and the app will adjust automatically.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:50.220
In other apps, you may find it easier to use
the pinch gesture.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.270
Let's go back to the Home screen.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.069
There are certain settings that you might
want easy access to while using your device;

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.679
for example, Bluetooth or wi-fi.

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:06.780
You'll find these things in the Control Center—just
swipe up from the bottom of the Home screen.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.270
Here you can adjust your screen brightness,
turn on airplane mode, and even set your device

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.870
to "do not disturb."

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.760
This will temporarily silence any calls or
alerts you receive.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.500
To close the Control Center, swipe down again.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.069
The last thing I'd like to show you is how
to use the search feature.

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.819
This feature is great for finding apps, media,
and other items on your device that you're

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.819
having trouble locating.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.079
All you have to do is swipe down anywhere
in the middle of the Home screen.

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.430
Now type what you're looking for using the
on-screen keyboard.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.430
The keyboard appears any time you're in a
text field.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.739
It's even sensitive to what you might be typing,
and sometimes offers shortcuts; for example,

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.299
a key that inserts ".com," if you're typing
a web address.

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:56.650
To navigate to the item you're looking for,
tap it on the list.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.620
That covers the basics of iOS for the iPhone.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.379
Now that you know your way around, you can
start using your device, and taking advantage

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:04.849
of everything it has to offer.
