00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.939
in this model you will learn how to identify
the elements of a citation

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.120
specifically a book a chapter in a book
and an article I know what you're

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.670
thinking why do I need to learn about
citations I already know

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.500
everything about them if so then this is
just a refresher module to help you

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.480
because you're going to need to know how
to find articles and books from

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.359
citations

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.619
there are three years of data demonstrating that the majority of freshman Appalachian

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.410
students can't find a source from a
citation

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.420
nor identify the difference 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.779
between a
citation for a book 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.850
and a citation for an article right now I'm going to tell you all you need to know to change that data

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.280
citations are primarily used to give credit to the author for his or her
ideas

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.800
For all those people who quote music lyrics unless it is 
a well-known song

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.370
no one knows that those inspirational
funny or romantic lyrics

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.770
are yours or 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.890
the artist Lorde its same with a paper or
presentation

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.170
if you use information you need to give
credit to the author

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.910
the second use for a citation is listing the source

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.579
or where the researchers information comes from this is an example

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.650
of a works cited page 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.880
The third use for a citation is to allow the reader to be able to follow the author's research trail
help

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.049
even if you don't think people care where you got your resources

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.350
a strong opinion needs valid resources
also

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.100
little do you know your teachers actually check your resources

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.290
 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.290
citations take two basic forms

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.810
which can be called a works cited or a bibliography

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.850
a second use of citations is In-text or
parenthetical citations

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.770
that are used with a paper to give
credit for ideas this is an example of

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.250
several

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.790
in text citations within a paper
regardless

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.549
of the style differences in a list of work
cited elements of a citation for a book

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:45.990
are

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.939
authors and or editors, 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.130
title, publisher, 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.930
date of publication 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.630
and place of publication

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.390
the tricky one is a citation for chapter
in a book for MLA look for the mention of
editors and 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.390
and in APA look for the word IN. in addition to the
typical

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.880
elements a book citation look for the
title of the book 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.460
and the title of the chapter of the book 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.310
article citations include 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.970
authors, title of the article, title of
the source, 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.120
year of publication, volume and issue number and page numbers 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.550
depending on style article citations can also include a DOI  

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.010
If you need to know more about a DOI check out OWL at Purdue 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.430
after watching this module you
now can identify the parts of a citation so you can find the sources you need
