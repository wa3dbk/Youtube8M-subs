00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:11.679
Auctioneer chatter…
Eisenhower State Park is located in southern

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.609
Osage County just east of Emporia, and if
you’re lucky enough to visit whenever Desoto

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:22.619
resident Paul Pingleton is there, you’re
in for a treat. Conservationist, photographer,

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.199
naturalist, auctioneer, knife-maker, and modern-day
muleskinner, Pingleton travels the Midwest,

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.760
riding and filming the outdoors.
Eisenhower, with its equestrian campground

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.840
and scenic horse trails, is a temporary home
for this storyteller a month each spring and

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.590
a month each fall. And if you aren’t convinced
that horse, or more correctly for him, mule

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.960
riding, isn’t the best way to see the beautiful
Kansas landscape, then you simply didn’t

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.700
talk to him.
“This is my hobby, my passion is riding

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.330
my mule, and trail riding…”
And Eisenhower is his favorite Kansas state

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.570
park.
“What I like about this park, Eisenhower,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.320
this state park, is that it’s so well managed…
Everybody can come out here and enjoy this.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.720
They’ve got a lot of good programs here.
“It’s within a hundred miles of Kansas

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.410
City, and people don’t realize our natural
resources here in Kansas, that, we’re sitting

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.920
in something here, this is just the start
of it, that no one else in the world has – these

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.630
flint hills and this tallgrass prairie.”
And no one enjoys the area’s beauty more

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.610
than Pingleton.
“I take pictures of the flowers, you know,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:49.460
and the prairie changes every week, and its
just so nice and quiet. And I meet people

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.220
out here and take them on trail rides and
things, and explain the flint hills to them.”

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.641
Partly for the romance of what he does, and
partly from experience that suggests to be

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:06.220
always prepared, Pingleton saddles up with
enough gear to let him spend a night or two

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.350
on the trail.
He carries necessities – dry clothes, a

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.170
space blanket, a tent, a few tools, and food
and water, along with his ever-present camera.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.900
“Theres always somebody on the trail that’s
hungry, and I just always happen to have a

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.610
little bag of this health food, and then of
course I’ve got crackers and cheese for

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.780
a guy like me.”
Pingleton works and donates materials to make

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.420
the horse trails better at Eisenhower, and
a recent winter project has installed culverts

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.459
he provided at steep trail breaks to make
it easier for horses with riders to navigate

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.190
the miles of scenic pathways.
What’s his favorite time to ride?

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.170
“Well the prettiest time of year I guess
is when the flowers come up, and the flint

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.720
hills grass after the burn, but this is my
favorite time here, because it’s cooler

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.580
and the tallgrass prairie has the seeds on
it, and my mule likes to eat it, and it’s

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.670
just a good time of year. We’ve got to take
care of it for future generations for sure.”

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.500
There’s something for everyone at Kansas
state parks, and horse riders are in for a

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.140
treat at Eisenhower. Individual riders are
always welcome, and the park hosts major riding

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.480
events as well. The next is scheduled for
Memorial Day weekend this May.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.720
Call Eisenhower State Park at (785) 528-4102
for more information, and plan to see this

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.840
beautiful area in a unique way.
