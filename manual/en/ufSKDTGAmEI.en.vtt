00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.210
*car horn*

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.880
CAIRN: I told Vicki to be ready a half hour
ago 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.180
and she’s still fooling around in there.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.540
LOUISE: She likes to look nice.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.690
CAIRN: I can’t be late on the first day of
spring training. 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.450
The team won’t respect me.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.990
LOUISE: And smell good.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.480
CAIRN: Oh my gosh. 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.710
*incessant car horn* 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.180
LOUISE: Hi Victoria! 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.250
VICTORIA:  Hello, Louise.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.330
CAIRN: What took you so long?

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.750
VICTORIA: I had to fix my hai... 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.890
*tires peel out*

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.990
LOUISE: Wheee! 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:16.540
CB: Oh, Hi Cairn. I was just getting the
girls situated. We’ve already run laps 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.790
and had batting practice.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.370
CAIRN:  That’s impossible CB...I’m only 5
minutes late.  

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.930
CB: Yeah... I called everyone last night

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.830
and rescheduled for earlier. 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.790
I guess I forgot to call you.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.710
CAIRN: You can’t reschedule practice...
you’re not the coach. 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.250
CB: Actually...I am.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.490
The gals voted me in... 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.910
‘cause they wanna win this year.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.120
CAIRN: Oh. 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.790
CB: I’ve also reworked everyone’s
position, 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.540
so you probably won’t be playing

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.100
the same positions as last year.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.290
CB: Cairn... I pitch...

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.160
so you have been replaced. 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.120
You are now left field...and 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.790
bench warmer.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.370
CAIRN:  What in the heck?

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.370
I’ve always been the pitcher. 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.370
*sad music*

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.420
CB: Louise, you didn’t do so good at 1st
base last year...

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.080
and my cousin’s in town...

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.520
so you’re gonna just warm the bench.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.960
CB: Anyway, moving on... 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.240
Victoria...
your old position was 3rd base...

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.230
now...
you’re our catcher.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.180
VICTORIA: What? Why? 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.060
CB: Well, #1... 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.710
nobody would slide
into home, with you standing there. 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.500
And, #2... 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.230
we’ll get a better turnout in the stands...
because of the view...

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.870
if you know what I mean.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.580
VICTORIA: Ewww. 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:04:12.540
*sprightly banjo music*

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.710
VICTORIA: I’ve had it. 

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.240
And frankly, it pains me
to say it...

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.370
but we need Cairn back.  

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:25.880
LOUISE: I’ve already talked to
everyone...

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.080
it's goin’ down NOW! 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.930
*dramatic music*

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.250
VICTORIA: You’ve been voted back in. 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.540
LOUISE: You’re the coach, again!

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.310
CAIRN: I’ll have to think about it. 
That kind of fickleness hurts my feelings.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.620
How am I supposed to ever get past this?

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.830
VICTORIA: They’re taking you to pizza!

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.460
CAIRN: Okay, I’ll coach!

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.460
LOUISE: I like green peppers and
pineapple!

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.290
CAIRN:  I’ll make sure you get that! 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.870
And...because trust has been compromised,

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:22.000
I’ll need to go for burritos next week...
just to make sure.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.710
LOUISE: I like margaritas!

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.570
VICTORIA I’ll let them know.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:37.210
*Rumba music*
