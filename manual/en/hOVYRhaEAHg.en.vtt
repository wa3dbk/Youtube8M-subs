00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:44.030
Though I want you, though you want me,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.004
nothing can come of it,

00:00:47.092 --> 00:00:53.073
to the main mast of the ship we are tied fast.

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:55.092
Though I want you, though you want me,

00:00:55.092 --> 00:00:59.030
nothing can come of it

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.086
to the main mast of the ship we are tied fast

00:01:05.056 --> 00:01:10.072
With your arms in the air, alone, you're dancing,

00:01:10.072 --> 00:01:13.009
and you bind me and unbind me

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.075
and always you trick me

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:22.033
On feet drunken and without shoes

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:28.022
in a play without an ending you are always rehearsing

00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:30.045
Though I want you, though you want me,

00:01:30.045 --> 00:01:34.000
nothing can come of it,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.077
to the main mast of the ship we are tied

00:01:39.077 --> 00:01:42.009
Though I want you, though you want me,

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.054
nothing can come of it,

00:01:45.054 --> 00:01:49.064
to the main mast of the ship we are tied

00:02:14.068 --> 00:02:20.040
With your arms raised high you are reaching for somewhere,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.012
an invisible ribbon you are stretching to catch

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:31.066
With your eyes closed you look right through me

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:37.036
like a wide open book you are reading me

00:02:37.036 --> 00:02:39.051
Though I want you, though you want me,

00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:43.005
nothing can come of it,

00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:48.094
to the main mast of the ship we are tied

00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:50.097
Though I want you, though you want me,

00:02:50.097 --> 00:02:54.042
nothing can come of it,

00:02:54.042 --> 00:03:00.017
to the main mast of the ship we are tied

00:03:31.056 --> 00:03:33.085
Though I want you, though you want me,

00:03:33.085 --> 00:03:37.032
nothing can come of it,

00:03:37.032 --> 00:03:43.005
to the main mast of the ship we are tied

00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:45.014
Though I want you, though you want me,

00:03:45.014 --> 00:03:48.065
nothing can come of it,

00:03:48.065 --> 00:03:55.027
to the main mast of the ship we are tied
