00:00:56.656 --> 00:01:00.527 align:start size:97% position:3% line:76%
ACTUALLY SERVES A PORK BARBECUE
SIMILAR TO BRIDGES.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:03.763 align:start size:94% position:6% line:76%
SO THAT'S EVEN MORE CREDIT TO
THE TAR HEEL STATE.

WHAT EARNED BRIDGES ALL THOSE

ASK RETIRED FORMER EMPLOYEE
LESTER VINSON.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.270 align:start size:94% position:6% line:76%
&gt;&gt; THE WOOD REALLY MAKES THE
DIFFERENCE.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.306 line:71%
THE WOOD IS THE RECIPE.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:17.410 line:76%
SO MANY PEOPLE DONE GOT AWAY
FROM THE OLD-TIMEY WAYS, YOU

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.113 align:start size:97% position:3% line:76%
KNOW, UNTIL THEY JUST GOT THIS
FAST COOKING NOW.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:22.515 align:start size:97% position:3% line:76%
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA TAKE YOUR TIME
WITH BARBECUE.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.851 line:76%
YOU HAVE TO PUT SOME TIME IN IT
AND LISTEN -- I LIKE LISTENING

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.353 align:start size:97% position:3% line:76%
AT IT, HEARING IT FRY A LITTLE
BIT THERE, YOU KNOW.

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:30.556 align:start size:94% position:6% line:76%
YOU CAN TELL BY THE SMOKE AND
STUFF HOW IT'S DOING.

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:32.325 line:71%
THAT'S THE KEY TO IT, THE WOOD.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:36.062 align:start position:0% line:76%
&gt;&gt; MOTHER LYTTLE BRIDGES AND
DAUGHTER DEBBIE BRIDGES WEBB PUT

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.436 align:start size:94% position:6% line:76%
BUT NOW DEBBIE IS PASSING
MANAGEMENT ALONG TO THE THIRD

00:01:44.536 --> 00:01:48.508 align:start position:0% line:76%
GENERATION, HER CHILDREN NATALIE

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:50.175 line:71%
&gt;&gt; I WAS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED.

00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:52.411 line:76%
WE -- AT 9:00 AT NIGHT, YOU STOP
VOTING, AND YOU DIDN'T FIND OUT

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:53.646 line:71%
TILL THE NEXT DAY.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:55.748 align:start size:97% position:3% line:76%
AND THEY NORMALLY POST AT 9:00
IN THE MORNING.

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:56.816 line:71%
DIDN'T DO IT AT 10:00.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:57.950 line:71%
DIDN'T DO IT.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.219 line:71%
BUT AT 10:30, MY PHONE RANG.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.253 line:76%
MY SISTER-IN-LAW CALLED AND
SAID, "YOU ALL WON, HONEY."

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:02.488 line:71%
WE WENT CRAZY.

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:04.423 line:71%
EVERYBODY WAS SO EXCITED.

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:07.293 line:76%
&gt;&gt; UM, I WAS HOPING TO MAKE IT
HALFWAY, THREE-QUARTERS OF THE

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:08.527 line:71%
WAY THROUGH.

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.929 align:start position:0% line:76%
I WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT, BUT
WE ACTUALLY WON.

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.899 line:76%
SO I'M JUST NOT ONE TO GET THE
BIG HEAD AND THINK WE HAVE THE

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.134 line:71%
BEST.

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:16.635 align:start size:97% position:3% line:76%
I'M NOT -- I CAN'T STAND PEOPLE
LIKE THAT USUALLY.

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:19.005 align:start size:94% position:6% line:76%
SO I DON'T WANT ACT LIKE THAT
MYSELF.

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:21.307 line:76%
&gt;&gt; WELL, IF CHASE DOESN'T BLOW
HIS OWN HORN VERY LOUDLY, NORTH

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:23.910 align:start position:0% line:76%
CAROLINA HOUSE SPEAKER TIM MOORE
OF NEARBY KINGS MOUNTAIN CAN

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.479 align:start size:97% position:3% line:76%
CERTAINLY BE COUNTED ON TO STEP
IN.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.648 align:start size:97% position:3% line:76%
&gt;&gt; WELL, WE WERE THRILLED THAT
BRIDGES BARBECUE WON THIS

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:31.451 line:71%
RECOGNITION.

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.286 line:76%
AND, ACTUALLY, I MADE SURE MY
COLLEAGUES WERE VOTING FOR THAT

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:34.687 line:71%
ALSO.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:36.822 line:76%
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE OF THE
FEW THINGS THAT ACTUALLY STILL

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:38.924 align:start size:94% position:6% line:76%
DIVIDES EAST VERSUS WEST, IS
BARBECUE.

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:42.762 line:76%
BUT IT WAS GOOD TO KNOW THAT
NORTH CAROLINA CAME OUT ON TOP.

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:45.498 line:76%
&gt;&gt; THIS 67-YEAR-OLD BARBECUE
STANDBY HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:49.135 align:start size:91% position:9% line:76%
MAINTAINING CONSISTENCY AND
CONTINUITY.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:52.338 align:start position:0% line:76%
&gt;&gt; 45 YEARS AGO, WE STOPPED HERE
ON OUR WAY TO OUR HONEYMOON.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:56.509 align:start size:97% position:3% line:76%
AND 25 YEARS LATER, WE STOPPED
IN AGAIN, AND THE SAME LADY

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.480 line:71%
WAITED ON US.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.250 align:start size:88% position:13% line:76%
BUT WE CAME MANY TIMES IN
BETWEEN.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.053 line:76%
&gt;&gt; BRIDGES' SMOKY PORK SHOULDER
BARBECUE, ITS RED BARBECUE COLE

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:10.889 line:76%
SLAW AND IT'S GRAINY TEXTURED
HUSH PUPPIES ARE JUSTLY FAMOUS,

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.993 align:start size:97% position:3% line:76%
BUT THE FAMILY BOND AND THE
ATMOSPHERE THAT CREATES IS WHAT

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:16.496 line:71%
REALLY MAKES IT A CHAMPION.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:21.000 align:start size:94% position:6% line:76%
FOR "NORTH CAROLINA WEEKEND,"
I'M BOB GARNER.
