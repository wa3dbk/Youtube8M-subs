Hey everyone, it's Lunden, and
this week we're doing water aerobics!

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.860
Ok, we're going to be, obviously,
in the shallow end of the pool.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.199
And, we're going to get our heart rate up

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:17.289
and our bodies moving with this low-impact

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.899
exercise: water aerobics. We'll start off
with running high-knees in the water...

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:28.720
20 on each side.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.319
And then open-close your legs...

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:37.830
20 times.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.150
Then we're gonna go back to

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.790
running knee-highs, but this time you'll
reach your hands up at the same time. So, every time...

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.390
your right knee goes up, your hands go up.
And you don't want your elbows...

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.360
to go under the water.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.920
Keep them above so you can keep your shoulders working.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.950
Then you'll go back to

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.450
to open-close with your legs and
do the same thing with your arms.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:02.450
But try not to drop your arms.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.520
Then pick a side, any side,
and start at one end of the pool.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.520
Do arm circles forward while
side-stepping in one direction.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.380
The key is to keep your arms
above the water the whole time...

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.640
because they'll get really tired, really fast.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.240
Then go back the other direction with

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.240
forward arm circles.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.240
And then one more time,
but with backward arm circles.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.100
And now we're gonna do sprints
across the pool! Up and back.

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.269
Last but not least we'll do push-outs out of the water 
using the edge. Pool-edge push-outs!

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.680
For those of you who are beginners:

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.919
just put your hands on the edge here and
push yourself all the way up out of the pool...

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.010
and then drop right off.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.010
If you're more advanced you can add
some more - push yourself up, down, up,...

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.409
And then also you can finish it off with...

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:51.709
an ab exercise, by sitting on the edge of the pool here.

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.919
Okay, so here is an added ab exercise
that you can do on the edge of the pool.

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.970
But you can also do this at a bench at the gym

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.659
or another step as such.

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.559
So, sit on the edge of the step,
brace your core, belly button into spine,

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:08.379
shoulders down and away from your ears,
bring your knees into your chest and then extend

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:15.379
all the way out - and in. Out, and in.

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.539
So, now you have some water exercises that you can do

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:30.339
at home in your pool or at a friend's pool!
