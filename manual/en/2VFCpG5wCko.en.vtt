00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.639
Hi and welcome to Steve' Kitchen. The
English language is a strange thing

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:05.009
whether you say tomato

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.349
or tomato it really doesn't matter
they mean the same thing

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.700
unlike the biscuit. Now when I was in
Louisiana I think it was

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.570
in the USA, the wonderful USA I

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.350
first came across the aAmerican biscuit
now here in Australia

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.820
and in the UK for that instance go and
get a biscuit you know it's going to be

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.840
covered in chocolate

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.769
it might have raisins in it we call
biscuits what the Americans call

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.509
cookies so I was a little disappointed
when I went to get biscuits

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.690
something to dip into my coffee and I
end up with something that looked a

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.130
little bit like a scone

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.670
it was a savory scone actually, that's
the American

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.010
biscuit now I was disappointed but I've
learned to absolutely love them

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.739
and today I'm going to share with you one of my favorites it's a cream biscuit

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.690
come on let me show you how 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.059
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.230
Now this is a very simple recipe. I've
got two cups

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.649
of self raising flour. Now a lot of
people don't have self raising flour you

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.409
can use all purpose and add

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.520
a little bit of baking powder and salt
into it.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.119
I'll leave a little explanation down in the
description. I'm going to add a tablespoon of

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.420
sugar in there as well

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.400
and then we're just going to pour in some
double cream a cup and a half

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.420
of nice thick double cream and I think in
some places they would call this

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.560
a heavy cream and then I'm just going to
take a fork

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.780
and start to pull these together then I'm
just going to start using my hands

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.819
and one of the important things with
a biscuit is not to overwork

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.170
the pastry you want that lovely crumbly
texture. So just pull this together until

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.940
you've got a nice firm dough

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.090
then when it's drawn together like that
we just pop it out

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.149
onto our work counter dust the surface
with a little bit a flour

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.580
and as I say we don't want to overwork
this dough but I'm just going to square

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.549
it up now

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.840
and then sprinkle a little bit of flour
again

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.840
over the top of our dough and take a rolling pin

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.170
and we just going to roll this out until it's
about

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.070
half an inch thick then when your happy
you've got the thickness you want I've got a

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.790
3-inch

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.799
cutter here and I'm just going to use it
to cut out

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.160
my biscuits and that's what we're
looking for

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.440
and whilst we lay out our biscuits on a
non-stick tray or cookie sheet we'll just

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.000
 preheat your oven to 420'F that's 220

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.840
degrees Celsius

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.709
it's a pretty hot oven leave a little
space about around each one

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.290
and the last thing we want to do before
these go in the oven I want to take a

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.829
little bit of melted butter

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.510
and just brush it over the top and now
we're just going to pop these in the oven

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.970
for about 10 minutes until they're
lovely golden brown

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.480
Now there they are out of  the oven and they're beautiful golden brown

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.200
What I am going to do before they
actually cool down is I'm just going to

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.750
brush

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.420
again a little bit of melted butter now I'm
using salted butter

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.840
it's up to you whether you use salted or
unsalted and then I'm going to lift these

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.080
biscuits onto a cooling rack and just
let them completely cool down

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.750
now you look at those they look
absolutely delicious now

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.050
I like to have these with a little
something sweet so I'm just going to

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.880
take one of these and look at the way

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.000
that pulls apart its absolutely
beautiful

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.870
and that's because we haven't overwork
the dough lovely and crumbly

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.050
now I'm just going to pop a little bit of
raspberry jam

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.280
on top of that now the English in me
wants to add a big dollop of fresh cream

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.930
as well but I'm going to have it just

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.910
as it is. So there you have it American-style biscuits albeit

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.550
a cream biscuit. I'm going to try this because it's smells delicious

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.070
mmmm

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.000
and it tastes delicious. Now what a delightful and light and fluffy biscuit that is

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.020
it's fantastic. Now I'm going to be using
this for another recipe so keep them  Peeled

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.200
because that's coming up very soon

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.540
as always I'd love to hear your comments
down below, please share the love, give this the

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.209
thumbs up

I'll see you in the next video be good.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.100
Now that's a wonderful and simple and delicious recipe very easy
to make.Now when I was in Louisiana

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.170
we had those with biscuits and gravy, it was a slightly different biscuit it was made with

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.530
 shortening and butter

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.910
but it was absolutely wonderful. I'll leave a
couple of links here to some other videos

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.430
