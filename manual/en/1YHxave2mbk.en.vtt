00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.440
I do I do, my hair I don't wash myself 
 so I go to the salon every other day.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.470
And um... I take care of my skin, 
 I do facials every once a month.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.000
I wax my whole body once a month.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.500
I use Estee Lauder skin products only.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.840
And my makeup is sponsored by MAC.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.600
And yah, and be happy. I think when you are happy,

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.300
I think it shows on your face and you'll always look younger :)

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.400
um... it's my 20th year in this business so 
 I came up with a book 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.100
to commemorate my whole career, my life and all that.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.160
So that when I reach 60 I can 
 remember I did a book at 40.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.000
Um and I think people all should do that.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.950
I mean if you have gone through alot of obstacles 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I think it's high time you let people know.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.440
That's its not been a bed of roses lah.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.400
So that's why I came up with the book.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.560
I want people to understand the real me lah.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.640
Everything else is just.. a FACADE.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.000
But there is a real person behind this 
 whole... behind the dress and the makeup.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.920
I really don't know, I'm very busy now.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.960
So I will think about it next year.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.320
So many things on my mind. 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.680
I'm doing 2 plays, I'm doing TV show, I'm doing THREE stage productions.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.360
And I'm doing a TV show.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.840
So I'm in the midst of recording and rehearsing, so...

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.120
hang in there, surprise is on the way!

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.920
I think what pisses me off is just generally the misconception that people have.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.640
The things that they take for granted.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.920
Singaporeans are very pampered and we still complain.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.640
And we never stop complaining.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.000
I think all these small small things pisses me off. You know.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Cause I think we are very lucky, very very lucky.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.000
But we don't see it, you know. So this... really pisses me off.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I'm very happy the way it is now.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.000
I will never look back.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.000
I think it's perfect the way it is now.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.000
And um... there are small regrets.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.600
But it comes... with life.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Regrets are part and parcel of life.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.000
Revelations are part and parcel of life.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.480
Turning point is part and parcel of life.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.760
So, um... I will not change anything.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.720
I'm blessed and I'm very lucky so I should not complain.
