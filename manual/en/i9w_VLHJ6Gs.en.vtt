00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.200
What can you see? 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.920
What do you see beyond the coordinate plane?

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.040
The equation that will bring the end is diverging

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.880
Where are you now? 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.380
Where in the matrix do you stand?

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.140
THE INTEGRATION UNDER THE MOON OF CODES,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.480
Dances over binary

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:05.540
Under silently raining electrical charges, magnetic fields slack and tense

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.160
In an instant discharge, a cathode emits light

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:20.080
Particles halt in defined space, organic rings suspended

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.360
The network spread across this plane is destroyed in a torrent of emotion

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.600
The changing landscape included in such a simple world as this

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.960
Shines into our irises, becoming a series of voltages pulsing

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.160
Racing through time, frozen in our so discrete world,

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.840
THE DIFFERENTIAL OVER THE SPEED OF LIGHTS,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.440
Dances on processors

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.520
Can the emotions of unbound electrical waves be solved with lambda functions?

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.300
Does the gravity which strokes the earth’s ground dream?

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:33.060
Will your voice arrive at the platinum spheres suspended in midair?

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.580
The moon sits on the earth with its eyes forever shut

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.460
A fork races down a spiral, a gluon twists and fades away

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:54.080
An anode fires charges grazing along a four-dimensional lattice

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.880
An endless dirac sea extends over contradicting theories

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.840
The alignment grid is everywhere, filling the blue sky

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.440
What can you see? 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.000
What do you see beyond the coordinate plane?

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:22.220
The equation that will bring the end is diverging

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.860
Where are you now? 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.540
Where in the matrix do you stand?

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.180
THE INTEGRATION UNDER THE MOON OF CODES,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.860
Dances over binary

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.380
What can you see? 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.820
What do you see beyond the coordinate plane?

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.240
The equation that will bring the end is diverging

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.940
Where are you now? 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.420
Where in the matrix do you stand?

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.100
THE INTEGRATION UNDER THE MOON OF CODES,

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.780
Dances over binary

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.820
Can the emotions of unbound electrical waves be solved with lambda functions?

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:52.680
Does the gravity which strokes the earth’s ground dream?

00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:00.380
Will your voice arrive at the platinum spheres suspended in midair?

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.760
The moon sits on the earth with its eyes forever shut
