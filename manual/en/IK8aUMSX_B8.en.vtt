There are some many different kinds of papers
you can use that I couldn't possibly display

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.839
them all for you. So, let me just give you
a couple of hints about paper. When I'm doing

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.880
very professional work like let's say I'm
doing a document or something what I want

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.810
to use is something that is not even really
a paper. It's actually rag. We call it a paper

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.570
because it's convenient to call it a paper
but it's a hundred percent rag. It's a hand

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.800
make rag paper one hundred percent and if
I were to hold this up to the light, you'll

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.760
see a watermark and in this case, the watermark
is Fabriano. I don't think you can see it

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.809
with the camera but in any event handmade
papers high quality handmade papers will have

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:55.489
a watermark and I happen to prefer the Fabriano
paper but there's also Arches and other papers.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.260
This is a very thick paper. This is a hundred
and forty pound hot press hot press meaning

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.570
that it has certain surfaces. It's not a rough
surface. Some calligraphers for certain jobs

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.730
like the very texture surface but I have a
tendency to like this better. This is the

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:22.670
same paper only this one is a little bit whiter.
You can get different shades of white or different

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:30.619
colors and you can see how beautifully this
kind of paper takes paint. Now, then there's

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.170
a whole range of enormous range of papers
that are different colors. I'm only showing

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.570
you the black here but trust me when I tell
you that you can just get just about any color

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.630
paper and this is a Canson paper. There's
also Stratmore. There are a lot of different

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.689
brands and these are really fun. It's really
fun to letter on color paper. So, here's an

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:00.650
example. You know I love the letter R and
here's an example of very pre-brushed letter

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.350
R with a couple of different colors on here
and I also want to point out that it also

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.690
has a metallic. This is a copper metallic
paint.
