00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.830
Let's take a look at the SiriusXM SXV200V1
in-dash tuner.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.690
It's a great streamlined solution to get SiriusXM
in your dash.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.160
It used to be a little tougher — you would
have to buy a translator box for Sirius or

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.640
XM, based on whatever subscription you had.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.580
And then, depending on whatever brand of aftermarket
head unit you had, you would then have to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.840
buy an adapter cable for that brand.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.840
Not anymore.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.630
Now as long as your radio says SiriusXM radio
on it somewhere then you can plug this new

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.879
one in the back and just go.

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:34.879
It's great.

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.289
So this new tuner brings a lot of what's good
about Dock and Play radios right here in your

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:40.729
dash.

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:47.010
One of my favorite things, I think, is the
fact that you can pause and play live programming.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.410
It kind of records constantly, like a DVR,
so if I've got something playing up here and

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.350
I need to pause it for any point in time,
I can just do that.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.039
And you can see here it's recording while
we're going so, you know, something important

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.310
is going on and I have to take my attention
away from what I was listening to, whenever

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.450
I'm ready I can hit a button here and go right
back to the moment that I paused it, or if

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.229
I change my mind, I can go right back to the
end and it takes us right up to the present

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.450
state.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.180
Let's say you're driving around and you're
listening to something but you really want

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.840
to listen to the Packers game that's coming
on later, but you don't know when, maybe you're

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.400
changing time zones, what's going on, so what
you can do is set up an alert so when that

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.420
game comes on, it'll flash up on the screen.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.009
It'll say, "Hey, the Packers game is playing
over on this other channel."

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.930
You just tap it and you go right to the game.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.409
You can also do that with your favorite artists
or even individual songs that you're hoping

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.409
to hear.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.590
I really like iTunes tagging also.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.429
So I've got my iPod hooked in, and I'm listening
to something on SiriusXM, and a song comes

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.619
up that I really like.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.619
But it's not on my iPod.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.259
It's on satellite radio, but I want it on
my iPod.

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:10.000
So I can hit this tag button here and it'll
tag it — and what that does is next time

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.030
I plug my iPod or iPhone into iTunes, it'll
remind me of all the tags that I pushed and

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.110
say "Hey, do you want to buy these now?"

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.210
So it's a nice feature.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.630
It's a great way to get new music onto your
iPod.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.130
The SXV200V1 also lets you tune in the SiriusXM
Xtra Channels.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.330
These are new channels that were created when
Sirius and XM merged their programming together.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.470
There's more than twenty of them, so you get
more sports, more news, and Spanish speakers

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.460
will be happy to know that there are many
new Spanish language channels included in

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.460
that also.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.840

or SiriusXM in general, just give us a call.
