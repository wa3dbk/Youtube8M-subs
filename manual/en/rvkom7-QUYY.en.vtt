00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:04.279
[Intro music]

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:05.950
Hi everyone, and welcome to episode two of

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.860
Make Thrift Buy. A show where you guys send
me in cool clothes that you find on the internet,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.849
and I try and recreate that item either through
DIY or thrifting, or a combination of the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.919
two.
Today I’m going to attempt to re-create

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:21.939
a clueless inspired outfit. So the original
outfit is from a store called: Glitters For

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.469
Dinner, and it’s $85 for a coordinated set,
BUT I’m pretty confident that we can get

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:31.099
away with making this ourselves for under
$10. So, let’s get started!

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.570
So I start with a stretchy tartan fabric that
I got second hand, and I folded it in half.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.579
So to make the template for my top I just
take this tight fitting dress whose shape

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.679
that I like and I place this on top of the
fabric, with the middle of the dress on the fold.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.480
[Annotation: I am adding an extra “seam allowance” of ½ an inch]

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.320
I trace around the top part of the dress,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.039
and then I simply cut through both layers
of fabric. Then I unfolded this and I have

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.949
a top…looking…thing.
Then I repeat this step so I have two identical

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.289
pieces. One will be the front and the other
will be the back.

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.100
Now I’m going to make some darts on my top
(you totally don’t have to do this). Start

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.979
by making a marking right in the middle of
your top, and then make two more markings

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.100
three inches out or however wide you want
your darts to be. So on one of your darts

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.409
(and you’ll do this with both), but on one
of them do a dot that us about five to six

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.719
inches away from the bottom of your top. And
then make this into a triangle by making two

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:35.719
marks half an inch apart connecting this with
the top dot, and making a pretty triangle!

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.390
Also draw a line straight up the middle of
the triangle, and then simply fold the fabric

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.369
on this middle line, and using a straight
stitch on your sewing machine sew along the

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.770
edge of the triangle.
And you should end up with a pretty dart like

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.290
this! Repeat this on both sides.
And if I did this again, I would do the dart

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.540
on the side rather than the front, but it’s
up to your own personal preference.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.179
[Annotation This is your lining fabric. It
doesn’t have to be the same pattern but it *MUST* be stretchy]

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.710
Then I placed each of these pieces face down,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.710
on another piece of fabric and I pin it on,
and cut around it. And leave them pinned together.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.030
So I do this with the front and I also do
this with the back piece as well and…ughhh…I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.980
haven’t cut enough fabric…
I’m not cutting another piece of fabric

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.129
so I’m just going to pin this together,
cut the excess off, and hope for that my seam

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:36.690
allowance was wide enough.
So now that I’ve got both of the pieces

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.580
pinned together, I sew them together like
this.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.960
[Annotation: sew around all the edges EXCEPT
for the bottom!]

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.700
And I use a zig-zag stitch.
Using a small zig-zag stitch on stretchy fabrics

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.159
is best because otherwise your thread will
break.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:53.190
Now here comes the fun bit!
Turn this piece inside out, and you have a

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.590
top kind of thing! Or a hat! Yeah, I think
by this time I might have contracted sewing

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.439
madness.
In any case you should now have both a front

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.739
and a back piece sewn together with their
linings.

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.900
So you need to place these on top of each
other, front sides together, and pin them

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.900
together at the shoulders and the sides. And
then you just need to sew like this. And again,

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.019
use a zig-zag stitch.
Turn it inside out.

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.360
Wait for it.
Wait for it.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.960
Anddd, you’re done!
Well, almost. You’re going to need to hem

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.010
the raw edge at the bottom here. So you’ll
have two layers, the lining and the front

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.640
part. You need to fold both of these up about
an inch or so and pin them together, and you

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.620
need to do this on both the front and the
back, and then sew an inch away from the edge

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.540
all the around the front and back sides.
Now the top I was basing this off also had

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.849
a collar, but as I was feeling lazy I just
got this dress with a white collar that I

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.799
got from the Op shop, and I cut the bottom
off. Made it into a cropped kind of thing,

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.019
cut the sleeves off so you wouldn’t see
them underneath an- wore it under my top.

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.819
[music plays]

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.339
And that’s it! That’s my Clueless outfit!

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.340
Oh, and I also made a matching skirt which
I did using my circle skirt tutorial which

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.570
you can visit here to learn how to do.
So, my conclusion?

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.800
[Scissor snipping sound effect]
You can totally make this yourself. It only

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.650
took me two hours and all you need to know
is some really simple stitches.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.650
Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you all
next time!

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.840
