00:00:00.043 --> 00:00:04.614
- Today we're making the
Long Island Iced Tea, woo!

00:00:04.614 --> 00:00:06.605
- So for this drink you'll need,

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:10.201
- Vodka, Rum, Gin, Tequila,

00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:12.619
Triple-Sec, Sweet and Sour, and Coke.

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:13.816
- What's this, this a herpe on your hand?

00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:14.529
What the hell is that?

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.995
- No, I burned my myself
with my curling iron!

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:17.816
- Really?

00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:18.579
- I mean--

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.543
- Look like a herpe to me.

00:00:20.543 --> 00:00:21.860
No, but that's a good cover.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.546
You know it's a burn!

00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:24.908
That's right girls, no no no,

00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:26.655
I was curling my testicle hair,

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:29.188
and I burnt myself, that's not a herp!

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:32.026
Rum, Vodka, pour!

00:00:32.026 --> 00:00:33.306
I don't need to tell ya how much,

00:00:33.306 --> 00:00:35.658
you claim to be a bartender, go ahead.

00:00:37.013 --> 00:00:38.126
Stop.

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:40.197
Tequila, Gin!

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:43.461
Little bit more, 'cause
(mumbling) on the other one.

00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:45.369
- Oh my goodness.
- [Skyy] Okay, stop.

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:47.594
Triple-Sec, pour!

00:00:47.594 --> 00:00:48.752
- I forgot how much it is.

00:00:48.752 --> 00:00:49.971
- [Skyy] Just go same amount.

00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:51.077
Okay.

00:00:51.077 --> 00:00:52.732
Sweet and Sour, pour!

00:00:52.732 --> 00:00:54.733
Keep going with the Sweet
and Sour, that's incorrect.

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.306
Darling, keep going!

00:00:58.936 --> 00:01:00.713
Okay, now you can stop.

00:01:00.713 --> 00:01:04.334
Because dude, that'll just
be straight alcohol, okay?

00:01:04.724 --> 00:01:06.294
- Whoo!

00:01:06.908 --> 00:01:08.834
- [Skyy] Splash of Coke!

00:01:09.672 --> 00:01:10.809
Just to get that little...

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:13.251
Okay, okay, homeboy, okay!

00:01:13.635 --> 00:01:15.966
- [Jessica] Why is there like, a black...

00:01:16.585 --> 00:01:18.536
- [Skyy] It's a pube, shut up, here.

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:19.933
(laughs)

00:01:21.096 --> 00:01:22.114
- [Jessica] Ooh, yah!

00:01:22.114 --> 00:01:22.921
- [Skyy] We're gonna let it drain all

00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:24.964
the way down the side, okay?

00:01:24.964 --> 00:01:26.061
- [Jessica] 'Ay!

00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:26.984
- [Skyy] That's how you pee, right?

00:01:26.984 --> 00:01:28.808
Miss the whole toilet.

00:01:29.097 --> 00:01:30.621
My mom used to tell me,

00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:32.470
"Skyy, stop missing the toilet like that!"

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.527
(laughs)

00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:35.710
"You got to aim straight
boy, what's wrong with you?"

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.827
"Okay?"

00:01:36.827 --> 00:01:38.757
"You're 12 years old, you should
have better aim than that!"

00:01:38.757 --> 00:01:40.419
(laughs)

00:01:41.155 --> 00:01:42.597
A lot of people would be surprised that

00:01:42.597 --> 00:01:45.503
we never made this drink
before on this channel,

00:01:45.503 --> 00:01:47.250
considering that this
is such a popular drink.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.830
I did Daddy O's, but I
never did the original.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.668
And there you have it!
(Jessica whimpers)

00:01:51.668 --> 00:01:55.366
The Long Island Iced
Tea, go ahead, Jessica.

00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:57.438
- Oh man, pray for me!

00:01:57.438 --> 00:01:59.567
I heard this is strong.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:04.886
Wait...

00:02:04.886 --> 00:02:06.216
- You can't really taste the strength.

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:10.816
It there though, that
sweet and sour hides it.

00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:12.726
- Yeah, I can't taste it, it's good!

00:02:12.726 --> 00:02:16.630
- (laughs) See that boys?
- [Jessica] Dang!

00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:18.443
That's crazy!

00:02:18.443 --> 00:02:20.352
- And so when you go out,
if you're on a budget,

00:02:20.352 --> 00:02:22.953
this the ideal budget drink for most bars,

00:02:22.953 --> 00:02:25.411
if you're looking for
a ton of booze, okay?

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:26.416
'Cause you can sip on this,

00:02:26.416 --> 00:02:27.940
that's like two, three drinks right there,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.717
of something else.

00:02:29.717 --> 00:02:31.719
And it's good to go.

00:02:32.426 --> 00:02:33.869
Okay, huh?

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:34.474
- It's pretty good, I like it!

00:02:34.474 --> 00:02:35.460
- Know you like it?

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.801
'Cause you hood, ratchet
girls love Long Islands!

00:02:38.801 --> 00:02:40.285
I would take a sip, but I can't.

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:42.285
'Cause I know that would
fuck up my whole night.

00:02:42.285 --> 00:02:44.337
- I mean, do you have
any plans for the night?

00:02:44.337 --> 00:02:45.922
- Yeah dude, I gotta edit shit,

00:02:45.922 --> 00:02:48.929
I got to find new drinks, I
got all kinds of shit to do!

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:50.656
Shit, I gotta play Grand Theft Auto!

00:02:50.656 --> 00:02:52.240
Lotta stuff going on here tonight!

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.927
I got to get up past this mission, okay?

00:02:53.927 --> 00:02:56.943
This mission got me all
fucked up, okay, huh?

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:58.649
You know how long I've been
on this particular stage,

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:01.681
tryna get, I'm tryna
steal some shit, okay?

00:03:02.661 --> 00:03:03.636
I should just go on a--

00:03:03.636 --> 00:03:04.621
You know what, maybe I'll just go

00:03:04.621 --> 00:03:06.583
on a shooting spree and
just call it a night.

00:03:06.583 --> 00:03:07.895
Tipsy Bartender!

00:03:08.347 --> 00:03:09.920
- Okay, I call him Mino, okay?
- [Brunette] Mino!

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.941
- Taste the damn drink, okay?

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:13.912
Yeah, get the ice cubes
to melt a little bit,

00:03:13.912 --> 00:03:15.619
because that is gonna be potent.

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:18.377
- Okay, yeah this is like pure alcohol.

00:03:23.834 --> 00:03:25.069
Oh my God it's delicious.
