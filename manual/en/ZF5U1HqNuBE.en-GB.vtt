00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.590
I'm Luke, and I'm eight years old. And I'm
in second grade!

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.110
Hi, I'm Mark, and I'm five years old, and
I just started kindergarten.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.710
It's the moment every video game maker dreads,
when their work is put in front of the critics.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.220
I sat down with the developer of new game
Lego Marvel and asked how he was feeling.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.279
Are you nervous about how it will be received?
We're always a bit nervous about how it's

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.120
going to be received, but we've had such great
feedback from events like Comicon or Gamescon

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.500
or even just here in New York, seeing kids
play it. They just can't put the controller

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.780
down.
So you're not bricking it?

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.280
No, I'm not bricking it. That's awesome.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.270
Yes, I've come to New York, the concrete jungle
where dreams are made, and the home of Marvel

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.860
Comics for a preview of the latest video game
in miniature, Lego Marvel Superheroes.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.920
Is it any good? Hell, I don't know. I don't
even have opposable thumbs. So I got some

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.100
experts together and asked them.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.200
It's a good game. Because you get to choose
any superhero you want.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.200
Thor. Black Widow. Deadpool. Loki.
Iron Man. Spiderman. Hulk. Wolverine.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.160
Avengers. Wolverine. Black Widow.

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:33.249
Gosh, I get so excited here.
But it wasn't all compliments. I put the criticisms

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:39.399
to TT Games' Arthur Parsons. Luke, 8, said
I don't like that the Sandman keeps coming

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.039
back.
Haha. Well, like any villain, he's always

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.380
going to come back.
Oh no! I'm melting. Melting!

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.439
Jack, 5, said I don't like the Legos.
I don't like the Legos.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.009
I don't like the Legos?
I don't like the Legos.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.859
Oh dear...I think it's probably from a traumatic
childhood experience.

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.450
Maybe he trod on a piece, and it hurt his
foot.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.919
That's exactly what happened.
Um, yeah. Well hopefully we can make him like

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:07.749
the Legos.
So have Arthur and his British team managed

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:12.880
to make a perfect pie out of the Big Apple?
Judge for yourself when Lego Marvel hits consoles

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.620
later this year.
