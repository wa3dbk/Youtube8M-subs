Hi my name is Lauren and today I'm here to
discuss how to manage curly hair. Curly hair

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.630
by texture is a little bit more unruly and
it's a lot drier so therefore it is more prone

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:15.580
to frizz. When the humid weather kicks in
your hair will actually kind of try to expand

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.910
and will swell. That is your cuticle opening
and trying to grab that moisture and let the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:27.260
moisture in. Curly hair does this more often
because your curly hair needs water in order

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.301
to create stronger bonds. The bonds that create
your curly hair are called disulfide bonds

00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:37.300
and it is two sulfur atoms attracting to each
other. A lot of products will really kind

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.011
of help with curly hair. With curly hair as
you put your product in you are going to put

00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:46.440
a little bit in your hand and then you are
going to emulsify it within your hands very

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.090
well. You are then going to do more of a scrunching
action and you are going to actually scrunch

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.629
the product into your hair. Another thing
that you can do while you are styling your

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.660
hair is literally take your pieces and twirl
them around so you can actually create your

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.880
own definition by twirling your curl around
itself and then doing the scrunching motion.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.910
Another great way to kind of help with your
curly hair and help manage it is that a lot

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.110
of times people get a lazy curl or curls that
actually fall a lot straighter than what the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.380
rest of the hair is doing. If you happen to
have a lazy curl what you are going to do

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.580
is just hit it a little bit with the curling
iron right before you leave the house. It

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.430
will help integrate the straighter pieces
within your curl plus it will also give you

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.570
a little bit more of a different kind of curl.
The beauty of naturally curly hair is the

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.330
difference in curls and the different texture
of each curl. Some pieces are going to be

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.920
curlier than the others and some are going
to be straighter. So you can help your lazy

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.710
curls by lifting them up and you can also
help your tighter curls by forming them by

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.710
using your fingers and using good products
that are made for curly hair and which will

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.030
actually help hydrate your hair in order to
prevent your hair from being curly and unruly

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.990
and that is how to tame curly frizzy hair.
