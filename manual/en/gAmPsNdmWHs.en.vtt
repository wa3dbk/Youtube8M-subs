00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.690
Today we are going to review part number TH45050
from Thule.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.080
This is Thules Complete Crossroad Kit with
50-inch Long Bars and Locks.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.300
What this is designed for basically is, if
you have got a factory roof-rack system that

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.660
does not have crossbars, just the bars that
go from front to rear, this will complement

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.779
what you have, and you can use a variety of
Thule components on top of it.

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.779
This is all you need.

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:23.779
You have got the factory roof rack.

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.400
You do not have to buy any other parts, aside
from the objects that you want to attach to

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.400
the bars themselves.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.910
This is the part that actually sits on the
bars on your factory roof rack it does not

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.700
do any scratching to your vehicle.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.610
This strap wraps around it, around the bar,
and goes to this slot right here, and then

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.760
gets tightened down into place.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.920
There is this little Allen bolt here that
you tighten up to take up the tensioned here

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.180
so it tightens onto the bar.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.860
There is a little arrow molded in to tell
you where to center the roof-rack bar on the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.860
pad.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.190
Also, the mounting pads on here also move
back and forth to suit the width of the bars

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.550
on your vehicle.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.360
Next are the components that come with the
crossbars.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.410
These contain the tool to actually tighten
down the bars onto the roof rack.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.290
And also, you can see on the end here they
actually have a little cap here where you

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.049
can install the locks.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.049
And these are the lock cores themselves.

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.920
They are all keyed alike, plus they come with
a lock core key.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.000
Now we will go ahead and install these bars
and give you a good idea of how they fit,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:02:14.230
how they look, and how they work 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:24.900
for you.
