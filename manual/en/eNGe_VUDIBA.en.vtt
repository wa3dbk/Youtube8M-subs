Steve: Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:05.690
Today we are going to show you how to change
the water inlet valve kit in your refrigerator.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.690
Pretty easy job, you need a quarter inch nut
driver and a sharp utility knife.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.870
Let me show you how it’s done.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.010
The first step in this repair will be to pull
the refrigerator forward enough so that you

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.830
can get in behind it and change the part.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.400
Disconnect the electrical supply, pull plug
out and turn off the water inlet supply.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:36.140
Now located in the right rear corner we need
to remove two or three screws here to allow

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.190
us to pull the cardboard cover out of the
way.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:51.870
And so we are self tapping quarter inch hex
head screw, this back cover is an integral

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.999
part of cooling system, so we need to reinstall
it when we finished our job, so take care

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:12.600
not to damage it, that should give us enough
room to work easily.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.939
Water valve is located right here with two
more quarter inch machine screws that are

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:33.580
holding the water valve to the cabinet, remove
those.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:50.580
Now we can pull the fill valve out of the
cavity, we can gain access to it.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:02:00.189
We need to disconnect the two electrical harnesses;
they have different size pins, so you can't

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:07.460
really mix them up.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.780
This type has a compression type tubing on
it, so we need to press it on the collar and

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.680
the tubing will pull out.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:30.950
Probably get a little bit of water that will
spill in here but it won’t be any amount.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:40.099
Now the next thing we need to do is clean
up our tubing, we will cut off a little bit

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.000
off the end there where it’s roughed up
from being installed in the old valve that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.350
will ensure we get good clean tight fit.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:58.319
The block of wood to protect your floor with
a sharp knife cut it nice and square so there

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:06.569
is no burst.

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:24.910
Now the replacement valve you get may have
this extra piece on it.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:32.220
If your existing valve has that on it, you
don’t need to do anything special just reinstall

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.220
it the same way.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.989
Now the case with this refrigerator, it does
not have that extra piece in the back that

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:49.489
simply snaps away break it away, discard that.

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:57.519
Now we just need to reinsert tubing into the
new valve.

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.930
There will be a little resistance with the
old ring in there and then it will eventually

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.590
bottom out.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:20.489
Little tug to make sure its firmly in place.

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:49.710
Make sure they bottom out then pull them back
to make sure they are nice and tight.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.639
Reconnect our harness; again there are two
different size terminals, so you cannot mix

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:55.639
them up.

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:42.300
Reinstall the two mounting screws; tuck water
tubing in place out of the way, to make sure

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.479
there are no kinks on it.

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.340
This is a good time to turn your water supply
back on to make sure we have no leaks.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:57.139
Once you’ve verified that we have no leaks
then close up the back cover.

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:15.669
And again, this cardboard cover is important
for proper air circulation, we need to reinstall

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:22.539
it.

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:48.290
Now we are ready to plug the refrigerator
back in, push it back in its proper location,

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.900
making sure not to kink the inlet water line.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.920
And our repair is complete.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.539
That’s how easy it was to change the water
inlet valve.

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:58.650
Thanks for watching and good luck with your
repair.
