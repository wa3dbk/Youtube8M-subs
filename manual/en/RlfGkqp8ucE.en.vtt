Hello everyone and welcome to my tutorial

00:00:47.138 --> 00:00:50.231
Today we will change the air filter

00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:55.855
This is a fiat punto mk2 and in this case the filter is located in here

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:07.156
This one is panel shaped but other versions may have different shapes or be in a different position

00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:20.996
Today we will see how to change the air filter on this car but&nbsp;even in other cases the procedure is similar and very simple

00:01:25.093 --> 00:01:31.954
The first thing to do is to unscrew the 3 screws that hold the cover closed

00:01:32.873 --> 00:01:40.370
The filter should be replaced every 10 to 15,000 km or approximately once a year

00:01:41.276 --> 00:01:44.020
 

00:01:41.276 --> 00:01:44.020
but it depends very much on the roads you practice

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:51.570
If you practice mainly dusty, unpaved roads change it more often otherwise less

00:02:07.738 --> 00:02:13.880
Once removed the screws, pull the cover towards&nbsp;you and you can clearly see the air filter

00:02:16.164 --> 00:02:24.620
This is the old air filter and we're going to remove it this way

00:02:28.026 --> 00:02:35.260
It is not so dirty but it is&nbsp;mounted from more than a year

00:02:42.504 --> 00:02:50.660
If you want you can clean inside the air-box&nbsp;before installing the new air filter

00:02:51.614 --> 00:02:57.330
We are now mounting in the new air filter this way

00:03:06.828 --> 00:03:11.180
Fit it well in place

00:03:16.317 --> 00:03:26.310
To reinstall the cover properly you have to enter its 3 hooks in these 3 holes

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:35.690
Hook it correctly inside the holes and push

00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:40.570
Then pull it in order to close it properly

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:58.020
And finally screw in the 3 screws

00:04:16.557 --> 00:04:21.220
Tighten the screws but not overtighten it

00:04:21.338 --> 00:04:24.960
And we're done!
