00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Alois: Hi, I am Alois Rosario.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.070
Jeff:And I am Jeff Plumb and
we are from PingSkills.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.110
And now, we are going to
teach you the backhand counterhit.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.360
Alois: So, let's have a look at Jeff
playing the backhand counterhit.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.120
There is three things that we need to
consider with the backhand counterhit:...

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.520
The first one is the feet position.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.320
You will notice that Jeffs' feet are facing
towards where he wants the ball to go.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.200
So, he is really square on and
his body faces forward.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.840
The second thing is the start position of his bat.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.280
So, the bat is in front of his body
facing towards where he wants the ball to go.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.300
Then he comes through, hits the ball
and his finish position...

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.200
is up and forward at shoulder height.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.520
And, you will notice now that
the forehand side of his bat...

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.990
faces towards the roof at the end of the shot.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.640
So, now that Jeff is showing you the technique...

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.300
you can see that Jeff will be able
to use the same technique...

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.680
to hit the ball slowly or fast.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.600
All he does is he just moves his
bat through the stroke faster,...

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.760
if he wants the ball to go faster.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.480
And slower, if he wants the ball to go slower.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.080
So, that is why it is really important
to get a good technique with your strokes.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.280
So, the main things to consider when
learning the backhand counterhit:...

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.720
Firstly, starting with your feet.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.520
If I want to the ball to go in that direction,
that is where I am facing with my feet.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.270
If I want the ball to go across court,
then that is where I need to face with my feet.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.240
The second part of the stroke that
you need to consider is your start position.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.760
Make sure that your bat is nice and flat,
facing towards where you want the ball to go.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.240
So, it needs to be in front of
your belly and nice and flat.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.840
And, the final part of the stroke is
you need to hit the ball and follow through.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.240
And, turn your bat over, so that now the
forehand side of your bat is facing to the roof.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.300
You need to finish up at around shoulder height.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.720
So, some things that I see
as common errors with the backhand:...

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.000
Firstly, a lot of players 
tend to change their grip.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.280
So, they turn their bat
around in their hand like that.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.360
It is easier for backhand but it is
going to be really difficult later for forehand.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.560
That is why it is important
to keep a nice central grip,...

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.920
so that you will be able to play both
backhand and forehand with the same grip.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.520
The second thing with
the backhand that I often see...

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.840
is that players tend to
push their right foot forward...

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.160
and play their backhands like this.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.120
That is okay, again, if you are only
playing backhands that works fine.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.400
But when you are playing a game of table tennis,
you have not got enough time to be doing...

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.880
backhands with your feet side-on this way and...

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.280
then turning all the way around

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.920
to play your forehand.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.110
So, that is why you want
to be nice a nd square on,...

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.080
facing towards where you want the ball to go.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.960
And, the third thing that I see with backhands...

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.800
is that often players finish over
on the left hand side of their body,...

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.000
instead of finishing over on the right hand side.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.500
So, an easy way to fix that problem
is to just make sure that...

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.760
you are waiting for the ball a little bit longer,
wait for it and hit the ball closer to your body.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.280
And then, you stroke will
tend to come out the right way.
