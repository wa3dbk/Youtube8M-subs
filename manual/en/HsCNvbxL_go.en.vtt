00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The M16 and the G11 are the only burst fire weapons in the game.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.500
"But which one is better?" You may ask.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.520
In this video we're going to have a look at the 
 burst fire goodness of the 
M16 and the G11.

00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:17.017
Well statistically they are both very alike in terms of damage output.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But as with any gun in the game, 
each rifle 
 has it's own advantages and disadvantages over the other.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.750
First thing you will notice is the difference in 
 crosshair size, without 
steady aim of course.

00:00:27.725 --> 00:00:29.725
Now onto some hip fire spread tests.

00:00:29.536 --> 00:00:32.536
And here you can see the differences in spread are quite clear.

00:00:33.037 --> 00:00:38.037
From this you may now realise why the G11 has that 48 
 round mag and slightly
lower damage per shot than the M16.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.300
The smaller crosshair of the G11 makes it a half 
 decent run and gun weapon,
the spread is quite low.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.150
The M16 could easily be used for the same purpose, although you may 
 not be
guaranteed the kill due to the spread being somewhat large.

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:58.737
At point blank range, then you should'nt really have any issues 
with getting the kill, although you may need 
 all 3 shots to connect for the 
guy to go down....unless they have already been injured beforehand.

00:00:58.723 --> 00:01:07.723
Also due to both weapons being burst fire, it may be slightly uneven 
 ground
when going against other players using fully automatic weapons
...or the Ak74u.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.250
Accuracy is everything when using these weapons and we all 
 know that getting 
shot throws off your accuracy.

00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:21.607
Ideally you want to be at a decent range from your enemy to have a better
chance of 
 getting the kill but you'll barely get any kills from firing from
the hip at range.

00:01:28.131 --> 00:01:31.131
Well there's iron sights for a reason so let's use them.

00:01:30.627 --> 00:01:34.627
As you can see that each rifle is pretty 
 accurate, and the recoil is quite 
manageable

00:01:33.878 --> 00:01:39.878
If you were to shoot someone at this range while looking 
 down the sights,
theres a 9/10 chance they will die.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.940
If they don't...then it's probably lag or somethin'...I dunno.

00:01:42.982 --> 00:01:49.980
If you choose to use either gun like this, then I would go for the 
 red dot
sight or reflex sight or maybe even the ACOG scope for the M16.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.500
The G11 on the other hand, has only 2 attachments 
 available so I would go
for the low power scope.

00:01:55.405 --> 00:02:01.900
I doubt you would want to use the variable zoom 
scope 
 when you're this close...unless you can quickscope like a pro.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.750
While on the subject of attachments and pimping out your guns in 
 general.
The M16 has many more options for customising, such as:

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.250
4 scopes, a grenade launcher, flamethrower, shotgun, suppressor ,dual mags and extended mags.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So there seems to be much more versitility with the M16 due to the 
 number of
possible attachments in contrast to the 2 scopes for the G11. 

00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:26.430
But with these ADS test results then I'm guessing most people, like 
 myself 
would choose to but a scope on either rifle.

00:02:26.193 --> 00:02:31.190
But again you'll notice that the G11 seems to be 
 much more accurate due to the lack of recoil.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:45.250
Ok, I'll admit that the last test was a little pointless, chances are that 
you will be using 
 the M16 or G11 from a good distance away, so lets move 
back a little shall we?

00:02:45.183 --> 00:02:48.930
Well, not exactly that further back, but it'll 
 do for the sake of this video.

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:51.830
From here we should get a much better 
 idea of the recoil of each gun.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:03:02.250
You may already have noticed the M16 has slightly higher recoil 
than the G11 as it kicks upwards 
 more, while the G11 is a little more centered...or spreaded out recoil....or whatever you call it...

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:12.580
Going for headshots with the M16? No problem just aim for the chest and let
the recoil do the 
 rest.
With the G11 you may need to aim a little higher due to having less recoil.

00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:19.240
But really in general you shouldn't really have any issues with the 
 recoil 
on either weapon it is quite low for both.

00:03:19.462 --> 00:03:23.460
In terms of damage at this range, you may need to 
 use 2 bursts to kill 
rather than only one.

00:03:22.967 --> 00:03:34.970
With the M16 this may not be the case due it's slightly higher damage per
shot than the G11 
 and if you choose to use a suppressor with the M16, again
it's effective range will suffer.

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.240
And uh...please excuse the Atari-esque shot markings, the picture got a little pixelated.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.750
Again it can be seem that from even at this range that 
 the G11 seems to be slightly more accurate than the M16.

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:54.450
This doesn't make the G11 any better than 
 the M16.
Both weapons have there own advantages.

00:03:54.915 --> 00:03:58.920
The M16 for example can kill with less shots 
 (at range), while the G11 is more accurate.

00:03:58.912 --> 00:04:04.910
So it's up to you.
What do you prefer? More accuracy or 
 more power?
