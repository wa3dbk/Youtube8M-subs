Hi, this is Laura Turner and today we're going
to talk about how to make a story plot. A

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.459
plot is, as Aristotle says, the arrangement
of the incidents in the story or a play. So

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:16.789
think about your plot as being separate from
the story that you're telling. Your plot is

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:25.869
going to create your ultimate story. A tip
for writing a plot is to start from the end

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.589
and work your way back to the beginning because
if you know where your going, you know how

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:37.100
you have to get there. You maybe, you may
find this easy, you may find this really hampering

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.899
and strange to do, so, try it, try it from
the front, down and then from the back, up

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:49.140
and see which works better for you. But, to
write a good plot, you have to make sure everything

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.679
falls from each other. So you have to make
sure that you can actually start at one place

00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:00.890
and end up where you want to be. Make an outline
of your plot with a list of things that have

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.860
to happen only. Don't hamper yourself with
your plot when you're trying to write your

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.750
story, but make sure that you are working
toward that end. So try to accomplish in your

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.150
chapter or your scene or your act, the things
that need to happen in order to move the story

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.260
forward and then fill in thing as you feel
fit. Use characters who will get the plot

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:32.060
moving. Characters who are dynamic and take
action and characters who make things happen

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.110
when they come into the plot. If your plot
is not moving, like you feel it should be,

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.740
it could be because your characters are not
helping you with the action of it. And then

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:49.040
finally, make sure all actions have a reaction
or payoff, even if, the first sentence says

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.310
in payoff until the last sentence of the story.
If you'd learn something in the very first

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.971
chapter of your story or the very first page
of your story, if it's a short story; if it

00:01:58.971 --> 00:02:04.130
doesn't payoff until the very end, make sure
that it at least pays off in some way that

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.180
you have a end to your action; that something
starts it and something ends it. And hopefully

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.269
that'll help you get started with your story's
plot.
