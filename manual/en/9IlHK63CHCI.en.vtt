00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.420
Now that we have our material all weighed
out, we need to mix the dry materials before

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.240
we add any water. The reason we need to do
that is so that we can homogenize and thoroughly

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.320
distribute all the different kinds of materials
that we put into the bucket before we add

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.070
the water. If we just add the water now it
will solidify and kind of in strata -- in

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.780
layers -- and it will be really difficult
to thoroughly mix and get all those materials

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.420
blended once we add the water. So we want
to mix it thoroughly first. There are a couple

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.030
of different ways to do this. Behind me is
a commercial clay mixer. This can be used

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:44.100
to mix clay wet or dry. The drawbacks to using
this machine are that it's expensive and not

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.179
everybody has one, and that if you use it
to mix the dry material it's going to make

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:54.719
a big cloud of dust. So, as an alternative
we're going to use the five-gallon bucket

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.449
because with the five-gallon bucket and a
tight fitting lid we can seal the material

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.610
up inside the bucket and for a small batch
we can just shake it up. Or, we can potentially

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:13.860
roll it back and forth across the floor. It
would work better if there wasn't a handle

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.120
in the way. Shake it up in order to homogenize
this material. Now, if I was going to create

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.850
a larger batch we could do the same thing
using this large barrel. A barrel like this

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.910
that has a tightly locking lid, roll it back
and forth, you could do this with several

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.940
hundred pounds of material rolling it back
and forth across the floor. Those are easy,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.960
dustless ways to mix the dry material. Once
the dry material has been thoroughly mixed

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.750
inside the bucket we want to slake it down
in water so that it becomes completely saturated

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.680
with water. I'm not concerned at the moment
with exactly how much water I'm going to put

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.830
in it because we're going to actually add
more than we need and we're going to add it

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:09.560
slowly so that it doesn't send dust up in
our face. You're going to have to let this

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.780
sit for a while, while the water percolates
down into the material. It's okay if it ends

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.310
up a little bit chunky but it's the easiest
way to let it, to get it to be the right consistency

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.720
is just to let it sit for a while. So, I'm
going to add some water and let it sit potentially

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.050
overnight and come back to it and we'll mix
it up then once its thoroughly saturated.
