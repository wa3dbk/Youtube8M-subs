00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.519
To show printing the block of wood, I've taken
a block of wood that I've already carved.

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:10.580
And, one of the reasons why I chose this one
is because there are large areas that have

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.580
carved away and then there's also large amount
of areas of solid wood that's still remaining

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.210
on the block. It gives you an idea of how
those different areas are going to be effected

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.200
when printing. So, now that I have mixed my
ink on my pallet I'm going to use my brayer

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:34.780
again to get that nice sheet of ink to roll
onto my block of wood. Now, getting the hang

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:44.210
of the brayer and getting that nice layer
of ink on there does take some time. So, don't

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.970
be discouraged if at first it doesn't come
as easily as you would like. Now, as I'm inking

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:59.610
the block of wood you can see here that the
areas in between the raised parts the carve

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.880
marks they are picking up little bits of ink.
Now, one of the things if you are planning

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:14.850
to edition your block of wood is regulating
which carve marks pick up ink each time is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.190
difficult. I'm not going to worry about that
right now. I'm just going to worry about getting

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:27.310
a nice clean layer of ink on my block. And,
one of the things I was talking about was

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:36.709
a carving shelf. And, the reason is that my
brayer is going to seek the tallest part of

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:43.759
any area that I am rolling it onto. So, right
here even though all of this is carved if

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.679
I was to put my brayer right there it's going
to pick up all of those carve marks. So, if

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.670
I want to minimize the number of carve marks
that are being picked up with my brayer I'm

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.539
going to want to keep my brayer as much on
the surface of the block of wood that I haven't

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.099
carved away as possible so that I can make
sure that this brayer is staying on that surface

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:07.369
that I chose to keep.
