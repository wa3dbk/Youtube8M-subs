00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.260
This is, in a sense, the birthplace of all
biology.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.289
It's a magical place. I mean, you can't turn
around in a full circle without seeing something

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.250
new and something that just makes your jaw
drop.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.710
The Galapagos is like a mecca for biology
students. For people who are interested in

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.100
geology, ichthyology, or nephology, herpetology,
it doesn't matter where your primary interest

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.350
lies, it's here, and it's just waiting for
you to come over and be like, 'Look at me,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.149
count me, study me,' you know?

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.079
To see a Blue-footed Booby lift up his blue
foot and start a mating dance, like, it sounds

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.399
corny, but it's a dream come true.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.819
You're snorkeling and looking at beautiful
fish with their colors reflecting in the water

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:49.760
and you're caught up in that, and then all
of a sudden you feel a wave of water on you

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.479
because a sea lion is brushing by and playing
with you in the water and it's just absolutely

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.479
amazing, and you know you'll never forget
it, you'll never forget any of the details

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:59.120
of that moment.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.449
The thing is, it's not just that moment, it's
every moment here. This place is amazing.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.530
I'm a bio major specializing in ecology and
conservation. Bio is one of the most amazing

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.510
things that you can study because it integrates
so many other sciences and social sciences

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.900
as well, because it's not just about the ecology
and the flora and the fauna, but about the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.530
people and how the people relate to that,
which is so important.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.180
It's really cool to come here and tie it all
together. This place is the place that ties

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.570
everything together for me.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.660
After one of our hikes, we actually had the
opportunity to come to a clearing by a beach

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.600
and just stand and watch for a while and we
saw sea turtles mating in the waves that were

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.330
crashing right in front of us, probably like
10 feet away.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.610
It was definitely one of the most amazing
experiences of my life because there's just

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.740
something really magical about watching an
endangered species mate.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.250
I've been following the pre-veterinary track,
but as time goes on, and especially as I continue

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.810
on with this program, I realize that I just
have such a passion for wildlife conservation

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.070
and I think I'm going to try and use this
knowledge and see where it takes me with that.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.909
The Galapagos is a place that everyone should
visit and respect and love because you need

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.000
to preserve things like this.
