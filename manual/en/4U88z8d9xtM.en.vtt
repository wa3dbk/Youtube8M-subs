00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:08.999
Time to take a nostalgic journey. Antique
tools and machinery. I bet you, you didn't

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:14.289
know the history of antique machines. Well
if you really want to know, grab this book,

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.449
because it goes into the whole enchilada here.
Look at this. Printing equipment. Look at

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:25.230
these old saws. Can you imagine? How in the
world do you hold onto this saw? This is a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.539
two person job, where somebody like holds
one end, somebody holds the other end and

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.969
here's the important feature, nobody else
gets in the middle. Because if they do, they,

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.050
well they won't live through it. So lets see
what else we've got here. Planes. We have

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.629
got, oh look at these. These are some jacks.
These are so, not jacks like with the balls

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.570
and the jacks. These are the old jacks. They
lifted cars. If you find these, these are

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.739
very very valuable. These are very very cool.
They have tool, they have logos on them. Different

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.760
tool companies made the jacks. And these are
the, and they would use them to jack up cars.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.750
Or they also used them for railroad work.
How about this? Hay tools. Hatchets. This

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.130
is a hay tool, but these are hatchets. Hatchets
are really popular. This is an important fact,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.390
let me share this with you, I forgot to mention
this. There are some collectibles that just,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.090
just cross all collectible boundaries. For
instance, if you have a hatchet and lets say

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.400
it's got a famous tool company name on it,
like Defiance for instance. That's a collectible

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.770
hatchet. But lets say, you have a Defiance
hatchet with a boy scout logo. Oh my goodness,

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.380
what am I going to do? Is it a boy scout collectible?
Is it a knife? Is it a hatchet? Is it a tool?

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.650
I mean what do you do? If you collect boy
scouts, you go wow, should I put a tool in

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.470
there, if its? So, you know some of these
multilingual collectibles, are kind of, kind

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.479
of multipurpose. So, you know, we've got pumps,
machine. Look at these early pump machines.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.700
Aren't they wonderful? They're kind of hard
to stock in your antique stores though, because

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.630
they weight about nine thousand pounds. But
other than that, they're highly collectible.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.649
But I highly recommend that if you start collecting
antique machines, that you're very strong.

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.331
Because trying to lift them is pretty impossible.
You kind of need a crane. And hopefully it

00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:17.320
won't be an antique crane. So good luck on
this hobby. This is Jan and I'm just so pleased

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.890
to have gone through this ready reference
material for you. Reference, resource prior

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.050
to your selection. Because you have to know
what you're doing when you're collecting.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.410
Because if you start buying stuff and you
really don't know what you're buying it's

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.220
going to go bye bye in a garage sale later.
So please do the research. See ya.
