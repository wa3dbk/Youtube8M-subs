00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.550
This is a wonderful symbol of peace, the dove.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:14.030
You can make a 3D cut-out and put it in your
house, in offices and gift it to your friends

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.200
Just print this on a slightly hard paper.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.060
This printout is available on our website
and on the link below this video.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.610
Just cut it along the solid lines and fold
along the dashed lines.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.020
These birds are symbols of peace and this
is something we need most in these trying

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.019
times with violence increasing everywhere.

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:52.609
Rightly said an eye for an eye will make the
whole world blind and that one can shake hands

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.799
to the clinched fist.

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:08.090
So we need to make efforts to look for peace
within and everywhere else.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:21.520
Cut across the solid lines and our symbol
of peace is almost ready.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:33.799
This last line is a dashed line, so fold it
on both sides.

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:49.109
Make the base and decorate your workplace,
your house and gift it to your friends.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.669
May there be peace within and everywhere else.
