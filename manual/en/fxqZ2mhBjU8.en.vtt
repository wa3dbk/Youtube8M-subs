00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.533
Hello and welcome

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:09.567
to "On the Green with Alan."

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:18.633
Creating a sustainable
campus is important

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:21.767
to Gallaudet University.

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:26.800
In February, I signed a pledge
with District of Columbia.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.734
Mayor Vincent Gray

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:31.066
and eight other local
university presidents

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.633
will work together to make
Washington, D.C.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:40.100
the "Greenest College
Town in America."

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.333
To accomplish this,
Gallaudet agreed to:

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:47.633
1) Achieve LEED Silver
Certification or equivalent

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:53.333
in all new construction
and major renovations.

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.900
LEED is a system of
identifying buildings

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.900
that have implemented green
designs and construction.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.867
2) Reduce energy use
in campus buildings.

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:15.400
3) Increase our use of
energy from renewable sources.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.467
4) Increase water
conservation efforts.

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:26.633
5) And, publish a
sustainability report.

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:29.633
Gallaudet must implement
these goals

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:34.066
and share our
progress by summer 2014.

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:38.934
A campus sustainability
committee is being established

00:01:38.934 --> 00:01:42.400
to lead this effort and will
keep the campus community

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.767
informed
of this important work.

00:01:52.734 --> 00:02:00.200
The 2012 Academic Bowl
competition ended on April 16.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.600
Congratulations to the
National Championship Team,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.333
Maryland
School for the Deaf!

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:13.300
Our own Model Secondary School
for the Deaf won 2nd place.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.400
University High School
from Irvine, California

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.500
won 3rd place.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.133
Florida School for the
Deaf and Blind won 4th place.

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:27.467
And Indiana School for
the Deaf won 5th place.

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:31.667
320 talented deaf and hard
of hearing high school students

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:36.000
from 79 schools throughout
the country and Canada

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.633
came to
Gallaudet to compete.

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:44.734
The Academic Bowl is a great
opportunity for those students

00:02:44.734 --> 00:02:47.633
to see Gallaudet and
experience the university

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:50.567
and Washington, D.C.

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:52.867
Thank you to everyone who
organized and volunteered

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:55.200
at the Academic Bowl!

00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:04.567
In April, Gallaudet
held a ceremony

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:11.467
for the new Thomas O. Berg Track at Hotchkiss Field.

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:18.967
The track is named for Thomas
Berg, an alumnus who served

00:03:18.967 --> 00:03:25.233
as the Gallaudet track
and field coach for 30 years.

00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:27.533
Gallaudet alumni were
asked to help donate funds

00:03:27.533 --> 00:03:31.066
to the new track.

00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:33.033
And the response was amazing

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:37.033
and the support from
alumni was generous.

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:39.667
Thank you to all the
alumni who contributed

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:43.333
to this memorable project.

00:03:48.467 --> 00:03:51.467
The University Council
recently held the last meeting

00:03:51.467 --> 00:03:57.400
of the Spring 2012
semester.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.767
The University Council
is a group of students, staff,

00:04:01.767 --> 00:04:05.533
faculty and administrators
who advise and counsel

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:11.800
my office on important
university decisions.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.767
Director of Campus Design
and Planning, Hansel Bauman,

00:04:16.767 --> 00:04:21.567
provided an update
on the 2022 Campus Master Plan.

00:04:21.567 --> 00:04:26.967
The Campus Design group
is presenting the plan

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:29.400
at several
community forums this month

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.000
to collect feedback from
our neighbors.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.033
We expect to finalize the campus
plan by the end of the year.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:48.900
Dr. MJ Bienvenu provided
an update

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.333
from the Gallaudet University

00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:54.633
150th Anniversary celebration committee.

00:04:54.633 --> 00:04:57.367
The committee is
gathering ideas

00:04:57.367 --> 00:05:02.133
from the Gallaudet community
to recognize the anniversary.

00:05:02.133 --> 00:05:07.166
The committee is looking
for ideas for activities,

00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:13.133
presentations,
speeches and exhibits

00:05:13.133 --> 00:05:15.633
As part of the
celebration, Gallaudet is

00:05:15.633 --> 00:05:17.834
collecting diplomas
from alumni to be featured

00:05:17.834 --> 00:05:25.567
in an online gallery
and in the Archives.

00:05:25.567 --> 00:05:27.967
Our goal is to collect at
least one diploma

00:05:27.967 --> 00:05:30.900
from each university
commencement.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.333
The Gallaudet University
143rd commencement is on May 11.

00:05:52.333 --> 00:06:00.700
The commencement speaker
is Markku Juhani Jokinen,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.767
the past president of the
World Federation of the Deaf.

00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:08.433
Mr. Jokinen is committed
to improving the lives

00:06:08.433 --> 00:06:13.633
of deaf people
around the world.

00:06:13.633 --> 00:06:16.367
His work with the World
Federation of the Deaf

00:06:16.367 --> 00:06:19.967
led to the development of the
United Nations Convention

00:06:19.967 --> 00:06:26.433
on the Human Rights of
Persons with Disabilities.

00:06:26.433 --> 00:06:29.066
We look forward
to hosting Mr. Jokinen

00:06:29.066 --> 00:06:34.166
and all of our graduates from
the class of 2012!

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.900
Finally, be sure to explore

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.033
our upcoming summer
programs here at Gallaudet!

00:06:46.033 --> 00:06:50.567
Thank you for watching
"On the Green with Alan."
