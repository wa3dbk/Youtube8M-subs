00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:23.000
Audi was the first premium brand
with a smaller car.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.748
Premium are the more expensive brands.
but for the Germans it's the other ones.

00:00:28.748 --> 00:00:31.222
There are no other brands, really.

00:00:31.538 --> 00:00:34.086
Audi was the first to release the A3.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.662
BMW followed with the 1-Series,
Mercedes with the A-Class.

00:00:39.432 --> 00:00:41.604
They were very successful with it.

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:47.014
They've sold a lot. Not just in the
Netherlands, but in Europe as well.

00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:48.950
That means there's a large number.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.600
This 2nd gen A3 has been in
production for a long time.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.292
From 2003 'til 2012,
depending on the edition.

00:00:57.292 --> 00:01:03.766
It's parallel to the VW Golf 5/6.
The A3 shares a lot with these.

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:07.453
The platform, technics,
but not the looks of course.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.500
It has been in production
for a long time as well.

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:15.300
There was a facelift in 2008.
We're driving a facelifted one.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.800
Different headlights, a few changed
details, other tail lights; nothing wild.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.503
The A3 has three body types. The
normal 3-doors, the Sportback-- 

00:01:27.738 --> 00:01:33.718
The 5-doors is the most boring type
with other brands, but Audi was smart.

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:38.900
They introduced the name "Sportback"
and gave it trims on top,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.004
so it looks more like an Avant.

00:01:41.344 --> 00:01:43.872
This makes it wanted.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.597
There's also a convertible
for in the sun.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.551
But that's a different car,
of course.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.600
About 5% on offer is a convertible.
About half is the 5-doors Sportback.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.100
A popular body in the Netherlands.
There's about 1,500 on AutoScout.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.300
Of course there's also a Quattro
version, but these are the exotics.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.500
They have larger engines. The S3
and RS3 always have Quattro.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.040
Only 2% of the A3s in the Netherlands
have AWD, so you'll have to look hard.

00:02:22.395 --> 00:02:27.800
The features are good. There's
the standard luxuries.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.544
A third of the cars has satnav.
20% has an S line sport package.

00:02:34.544 --> 00:02:39.000
There are different editions,
but there's other seats, 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.495
a lowered suspension
and prettier rims.

00:02:41.893 --> 00:02:45.174
It completes the A3.

00:02:45.453 --> 00:02:49.600
Because the A3 was on the market for
a long time, there's different prices.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.984
It starts at 7,000 euros and goes
up to 25,000-30,000 euros.

00:02:54.984 --> 00:02:57.736
If you want an S3 or RS3
it may be even higher.

00:02:58.262 --> 00:03:00.300
PRICES
minimum, average, maximum

00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:06.013
There are some points of interest.

00:03:06.013 --> 00:03:10.200
There's different engines from
the start of production,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.865
also atmospheric 1.6 en 2.0 liters.
The basic 1.6 had 101 hp.

00:03:16.645 --> 00:03:21.800
It doesn't really suit
the luxurious feel of the A3.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.700
Keep looking for a more powerful car.
Later on came the TFSIs.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.805
1.2, 1.4, 1.8, 2 liters,
and even a 3.2 V6 was available,

00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:39.059
but CO2 regulations prevented
inclusion in the range.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.509
Regarding the transmissions
there's two things to beware of.

00:03:47.038 --> 00:03:57.079
The manual (with clutch pedal) has
a dual mass flywheel which may break.

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.700
You'll notice when there's vibrations
in the clutch pedal.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.553
If it doesn't feel right,
it may be broken.

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:10.200
Moreover, an S-Tronic
gearbox was available.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.177
A DSG at Volkswagen, but it's
called S-Tronic at Audi.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.100
A double clutch automatic gearbox.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.344
The clutch plates wear down faster
than you'd want.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:25.891
At 100,000 km you may have
to change the clutch plates.

00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:27.726
It depends on the use.

00:04:28.303 --> 00:04:34.169
A more sporty driven car or one
that's been in reverse a lot;

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.868
they wear out sooner.

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:44.500
The hinges of the glovebox
are fragile in some cars.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.387
If you close it after stuffing,
they may break off.

00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:52.000
So don't put too much junk in
the glovebox and try to close it,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.032
because you may end up with
the lid in your hands. That sucks.

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:56.815
Especially when you
still have to drive.

00:04:57.193 --> 00:05:00.892
The diesel's EGR valve may clog up.

00:05:00.892 --> 00:05:07.100
It can be cleaned, but if it gets dirty
again it needs changing or extraction.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.900
That's another option. The Audi
dealer won't like it, but it's possible.

00:05:12.347 --> 00:05:14.901
Turbo's wear, keep that in mind.

00:05:14.901 --> 00:05:20.140
The 2-liter TDI needs a new
timing belt every 100,000 km.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.778
This car is a nice, tidy Audi.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:30.907
A lot of features. The Pro Line S
package, which Audi had up on offer.

00:05:30.907 --> 00:05:38.734
The S line has pretty rims. It's
darker, with RVS-like roof rims.

00:05:38.734 --> 00:05:40.322
In this case they're darker.

00:05:40.697 --> 00:05:46.834
Satnav, but no Park Distance.
Fortunately there's a clear view.

00:05:46.834 --> 00:05:49.762
It shouldn't be a problem
with parking.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.700
Thanks to
