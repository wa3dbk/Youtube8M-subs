00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.100
Drawing holograms by hand...

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.389
In mid-1994 I started drawing much 
more complicated holgrams than before.

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.549
This one's my first

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.029
fully three-D object: 
a tilted plane.

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.099
Like a little checkerboard that 
actually tilts downwards in space.

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.159
And here's my first

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.939
fully three-D

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.269
complicated object:

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:30.789
a cube!

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.789
with cross-hatch lines drawn 
on it's surface.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.970
This little tetrahedron is the 
first object I drew where

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.600
the lines come through the film plane 
and stick out into space.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.730
So the tip of the little pyramid

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.290
goes right through the plastic.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.170
Here's the first object 
I drew that's opaque:

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.030
a black square with the 
letter "B" hidden behind it.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.870
Later on I made a transparent 
hole in an opaque plane

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.870
With the numbers "1 2 3" peeking through

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.550
Here's a curved surface of a cylinder,

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.840
made with the trig function

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.780
square-root of R-squared minus X-squared.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.479
(Let's get a close-up,) and the 
little line above it

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.480
I just drew freehand

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.120
like a firecracker with a fuse.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.380
Here's a square hole made of stars,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.980
with a flashing triangle.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.980
The inner part of the triangle turns
on and off as I rotate it.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.230
If you experiment with "Hand-drawn 
holograms, you'll find that

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.720
they look much more realistic if you 
lay 'em on the ground in the sun,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.850
and then move your head.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.229
Don't tilt the plane itself,

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.020
tilt your viewing position

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.039
And if I turn it upside down,

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.820
we get a "pseudoscopic" image:

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.280
an inside-out cube that

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.260
floats in space above the plastic.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.479
This cube has a point that 
sticks through the plastic,

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:20.179
And it also is my first full 
words: "secret message"

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:25.290
This one's a test, 4000 DPI

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.869
copper-etched plate to see

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:32.219
what kinds of resolution I could get:
a bunch of letter-"A"s,

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:36.589
and some radial stripes.
Some of them stick up

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.539
and some are slots.

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:42.159
And I found it works much better 
if you give it

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.489
a coat of glossy black spray-paint.

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.590
It fills in all of the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.769
rough surfaces, and 
makes them shiney.
