00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.500
I gave you everything I had

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.200
You took my heart
and broke it bad

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.300
I am not the kind who
can take it alone

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.200
I have got nothing
more for you

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.800
I want somebody who
needs me too

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.000
I have given up, boy

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.800
I am chasing my joy

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.800
And you can make your own

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.500
Go out and have your fun

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.800
Because my time will come

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.800
You can shatter glass

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.800
With your heart of stone

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.200
But you will not get far
on your own

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.000
You keep running hot
and blowing cold

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And everything you hold
Just falls apart like
shattered glass

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.000
It really does not
matter to me

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.500
Where you are going
and who you see

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.000
I know that I can make it
this time

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.000
It does not matter anymore

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.500
Since you have gone and
walked out that door

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.800
I made a new start

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.500
I found a true heart

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.500
I am going to make it mine

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.500
Go out and have your fun

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.500
Because my time will come

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.800
You can shatter glass
With your heart of stone

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.570
You can shatter glass
With your heart of stone

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580
Go out and have your fun

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
With your heart of stone

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600
You keep running hot
and blowing cold

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610
It really does not
matter to me

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620
I know that I can make it
this time

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630
Since you have gone and
walked out that door

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640
I found a true heart

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650
Go out and have your fun

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660
You can shatter glass
With your heart of stone

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.600
But you will not get far
on your own

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.600
You keep running hot
and blowing cold

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.600
And everything you hold
Just falls apart like
shattered glass

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.600
You can shatter glass

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.600
You can shatter glass

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.800
Go out and have your fun
Because my time will come

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.800
You can shatter glass

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.800
With your heart of stone

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.000
But you will not get far
on your own

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.000
You keep running hot
and blowing cold

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And everything you hold
Just falls apart like
shattered glass
