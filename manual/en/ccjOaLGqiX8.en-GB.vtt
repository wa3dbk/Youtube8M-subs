00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey guys.
In this video, we will prepare Nigerian Moi Moi

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.210
with beans flour.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.259
Here are the ingredients you will need.

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.650
We all like our Moi Moi to taste a certain
way.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.900
So if you already know how to prepare Moi
Moi with peeled beans,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.640
use your own quantities of ingredients for
this one.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.529
If not, use my quantities of ingredients and
see if you like the resulting Moi Moi.

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.079
You can then adjust the quantities of ingredients
in subsequent preparations if you wish.

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.160
First we prepare the ingredients.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.640
Boil the eggs till hard and cut into pieces
like this.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.489
If using corned beef, bring it out from the
container and divide into small pieces.

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.739
This is ground nutmeg.

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.739
It is what gives Nigerian Moi Moi its classic
taste so it is very essential.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.390
Cut the habanero pepper into small pieces.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.750
You can also use cayenne pepper.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.859
Always add pepper to your taste when cooking
Nigerian food.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.250
These are crushed stock cubes.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.690
Like I said earlier we all like our Moi Moi
to taste a certain way.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.850
I prefer more stock cubes in my Moi Moi than
crayfish.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.030
If you prefer more crayfish,

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.340
increase the quantity of crayfish and reduce
the quantity of stock cubes.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.630
If you don't have crayfish, just skip it and
use only stock cubes.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.020
Cut the onions into small pieces.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.500
You can also use red onions.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.210
This is watery tomato puree.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.280
This gives the Moi Moi its appetising peach
colour.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.480
If you are in Nigeria, use Tatashe.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.570
It's the best for adding colour to Moi Moi.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.510
I will not use red bell peppers for Moi Moi
because it does not give the same effect as

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.030
tatashe.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.280
Do not use raw tomato because it gives Moi
Moi a tangy taste.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.250
We will also need salt and vegetable oil.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.990
Any tasteless and odourless vegetable oil
is good for Nigerian Moi Moi.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.840
Next, we mix the beans flour with 500 mls
of cool water.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.850
Mix it very well so that there are minimal
lumps.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.850
This is achieved by adding small quantities
of water at a time.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.950
When done, cover and leave to soak for 3 good
hours.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.719
After 3 hours, we mix the crayfish,

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:08.799
stock cubes, nutmeg,

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:15.799
pepper and tomato puree with a small amount
of water.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.500
Add this to the soaked beans flour.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.349
Add the onions and stir very well.

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.599
Blend the mix very well.

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.919
This makes the Moi Moi fluffy.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.900
When done, pour the blend into a bowl for
the final mixing.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.110
Set a small amount of water in a big pot to
boil.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.450
Note that this water is not part of the water
in the list of ingredients.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.190
Now, add the remaining water from the list
to the bowl of Moi Moi.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.010
I like my Moi Moi soft that's why I used
1.2litres of water.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.880
You can reduce the quantity but I recommend
that you use a

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.420
minimum of 1 litre for the 250g of beans flour.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.040
Anything less, the Moi Moi will be too hard.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.160
Add salt to taste and vegetable oil.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:58.160
Then mix everything very well.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.580
By now the water should have boiled.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.190
Add a base for the Moi Moi bags.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.400
If you don't have this, use pieces of aluminium
foil or plastic bags as base.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.400
Scoop the Moi Moi mix into the bag,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.400
add a piece of egg or corned beef or sardine
... whatever you're using ..

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:40.470
and fold to close the bag.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.540
Make sure it does not leak.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.930
Very important.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.180
Gently place the bag into the pot of boiling
water.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:08.180
Repeat the process for the rest of the mix.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.440
When done, use a big piece of aluminium foil
to cover the bags.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.110
This helps keep the heat in.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.020
Then cover the pot and start cooking.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.490
Check it constantly and add water like this
when necessary.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.150
Cook for at least 1 and half hours on medium
heat and it's done.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.970
Once done, take the bags out of the pot.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.900
Please do not try this with your bare hands

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.960
because this is extremely hot.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.690
My hands are kpako hands o! :D

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.730
Spread out on a tray like this to cool down
completely.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:54.170
Serve warm with all Nigerian rice dishes,
fried plantains, steamed vegetables

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.330
or you can eat it as a snack with a chilled
drink.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:05.330
Bye bye, see you soon!
