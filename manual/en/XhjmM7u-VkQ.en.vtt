hello guys, this is youjustpreviewed and I'm coming to you today with a brief multi-media update from Garden City, NY

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.660
today I went to a second-hand store, bought three VHS tapes and one DVD

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.460
which I'm gonna show you

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:26.120
first one I got is South Park: Volume 2, with Weight Gain 4000, and Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.020
this is from season 1 of the series

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.260
one of the best seasons

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.060
here's the tape with an ink label, and this has a print date actually

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.300
April 19, 1998

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.660
so next one is Die Hard, with Bruce Willis

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.780
and other people

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.800
ooh Alan Rickman I didn't know he was in it

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.640
CBS/FOX release..

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.860
there's the label, quite a bland label

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.560
there's something printed here

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.620
it's mostly just nonsensical ramblings

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.300
(like what I was just doing then lol)

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.580
*don't even know what I just said*

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.860
Last one I have is a very sought-after one, Dumbo.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.520
it's an original "Classics" one

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.300
actually this is a later reprint

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.860
but it's still the Classics release

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.220
it's been very well used

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.360
print date May 15 1988

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.240
(sudden jumpcut here due to me ma deciding now would be the opportune moment to check up on me)

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.480
sorry that was just my mum wondering what the hell I'm doing

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.940
anyway here's the DVD, Weird Al Yankovic's UHF

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.820
which I have yet to see

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.660
I wanna find The Compleat Al but that is a very rare find

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.640
it's double sided

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.780
this is the widescreen side and the other side is the normal side

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.780
anyways that's all I gotta show you in this multimedia update

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.400
that's all for now, youjustpreviewed out
