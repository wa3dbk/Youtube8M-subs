00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:07.930
There are some key differences between a cash
game and a tournament game. And the biggest

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:16.120
difference is that in a cash game is that
you can lose all your chips and then buy in

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:23.470
again. In a tournament, most tournaments are
played in whats called freeze out style. There

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:31.640
are rebuy tournaments. But the rebuy periods
are only gonna last so long. So actually all

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.870
tournaments in the long run are freeze out.
Because of this and because tournaments are

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:49.149
structured such that in a cash game the betting
structure never changes. If I buy into a two

00:00:49.149 --> 00:01:00.719
for cash game that is ultimately no limit
the blinds are two and four and then I can

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:10.549
play the rest of my stack and if I lose it
I can buy more. In a tournament the blinds

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:19.490
might start out at two and four but after
a while they will go up to four and eight,

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.970
ten and twenty, twenty and forty, fifty and
a hundred, and then antes will come in. And

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.240
once more I can only lose what's in front
of me on the table. Once it's gone I am out

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.369
of the tournament. Because of that difference,
because of those differences that I just mentioned

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.170
you need to open your game up usually a little
bit over time in a tournament. Early on, you

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.049
will play a tournament the same way you would
a cash game. Play kind of tight. Hold out

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.470
if your hands are like this, your premium
hands, your aces, your kings, queens, jacks,

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:08.090
ace king suited, but you know what, as time
goes on your gonna wanna play ace ten, the

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.420
right situations you'll play jack ten suited.
What we're gonna do now is discuss how to

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.980
know when to do that and other elements of
tournament play.
