00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:24.070
I’m a 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.370
Paul Heyman guy.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.770
You know who else is a Paul Heyman guy? Brock
Lesnar.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.920
Only he’s not in Supremacy MMA.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.440
And neither is Paul.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.440
No.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.850
Instead, you have a whole bunch of people
the casual MMA fan will have never heard of.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.480
In fact, I’m not going to lie.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.360
I’m not even sure if all these people are
real.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.550
I’m pretty sure Jens Pulver actually exists,
obviously.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.350
But some of these guys...I mean, Dante Algearey?

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.329
That’s not real, is it?

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.110
He’s been dead for centuries.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:10.890
Nonetheless, that’s kind of the point of
Supremacy MMA.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.440
To give you an MMA game without all the glitz
and glam of major organizations like UFC.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.750
This is a game for fans who dig deeper into
the sport than just listening to Joe Rogan’s

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.750
commentary.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.570
It prides itself on being hardcore in spirit
and simple in execution.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.350
Too bad it’s kind of mediocre in everything.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.260
Supremacy MMA counters its competition with
a reversal in tone.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.280
Where THQ’s UFC games go for a realistic
vibe with really complex controls and gameplay

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.030
mechanics, this one takes a slightly different
road.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.130
Supremacy is more like an arcade fighting
game with an MMA coat of paint.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.220
It’s kind of like Ryu stepped into the octagon.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:08.140
Only, you know, without the hadouken.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.729
And personally, I love that approach.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.490
I find the controls in UFC Unleashed to be
a little much.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.860
I vastly prefer a game with accessible controls
that let you jump in and play without the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.140
steep learning curve.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.400
So conceptually, Supremacy MMA’s heart is
definitely in the right place.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.450
The problem is how that concept has been realized.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.129
If you’re going for that arcade-like vibe,
fast and responsive action is essential.

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.379
This is something Supremacy lacks.

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.000
Button inputs seem to have a bit of a lag,
which can make matches feel a lot slower than

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.400
would be ideal.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.090
The fighting just doesn’t feel very fluid
or responsive, and again, that’s detrimental

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:58.040
to what the game is trying to be.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:09.090
Fortunately, the game does succeed in other
areas.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.459
For example, Supremacy does a better job portraying
the brutality of the sport than any other

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.840
MMA game on the market.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.220
The animations are kind of jerky, but the
attacks can look devastating at times.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.379
And as each fight wears on, you can actually
see the physical toll it takes on the characters.

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.650
They bruise, they start to bleed...it’s
really cool to see that gradual effect.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.940
But in addition to the unresponsive attacks,
Supremacy also stumbles over its own strange

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.940
gameplay emphasis.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.930
See, you spend a lot of the game waiting to
counter.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.300
You can’t really make a move effectively
until your opponent makes one, which you have

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.300
to counter.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.830
It’s realistic, sure, but Supremacy MMA
deliberately strives to be unrealistic in

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.280
every other area.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.150
So it’s a strange system to implement in
a game that wants to be a fast-paced counterpoint

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.990
to its competition.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.510
But even with its flaws, I did have fun with
Supremacy occasionally.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.730
Locking in a nice submission move after a
simple chain of attacks was really satisfying,

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.190
as was getting a guy to tap out with a sweet
triangle choke.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.799
But I really wanted more from this game.

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.499
As it is, the presentation is lacking and
the execution doesn’t match what the philosophy

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:24.580
seems to be, leaving fans with an average
MMA game that just isn’t ready for a title

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:35.240
match.
