00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.750
There are so many factors to consider when
thinking about planning for the flowers for

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.750
your wedding.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.770
A really important place to start is, what
is the wedding venue?

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.820
Are the flowers going to be an element that
are outside?

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.119
Are they inside?

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.279
Some combination?

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.810
Is perhaps your ceremony outside and your
reception inside?

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.429
What kind of venue is it?

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.289
Is it a very traditional, grand ballroom setting?

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.960
Or is it a more rustic, outdoor setting, perhaps
by a river or a lake?

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.440
So, the venue, as it dictates a lot of the
elements of your wedding, like your dress

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.700
or your guest list, can also dictate the flowers.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.140
So, start with your venue, and also think
about what is it that I really can spend on

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.140
flowers?

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.269
It's sometimes an uncomfortable conversation
to have with yourself, with your family, and

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.290
even with your florist or other vendors, but
it's perhaps the most important conversation

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.090
to be having, to be very realistic about your
budget so that your expectations can be set

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.090
realistically.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.420
So, when you sit down with the florist to
have that conversation, be very, very straightforward

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.000
- this is my budget, this is what I can spend,
this is what I want to spend.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.950
And, if you can be somewhat flexible, you
can allow your florist to let you know: these

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.369
are the things that are in season, these are
the things that I can do little tricks to

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.869
give you more bang for your buck, and let
them come up with some ideas for what works

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:37.930
within your price point.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.130
That's very, very important.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.270
And also, in terms of the style of your wedding.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:51.520
If you have a venue that's a traditional ballroom,
and you come to your florist with ideas using

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.829
found objects, and containers, and funky wooden
and things like that, and you want to put

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:05.020
those ideas to work inside a very traditional
setting, your florist might say to you, "look,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.020
we need to make a different choice here.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.959
And you need to decide to have a line through
design style for your wedding that makes sense."

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.320
And so, as you're planning for your wedding,
and certainly as you're planning for your

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.459
wedding flowers, think about pulling all of
the ideas that you've been inspired by into

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.510
one singular vision.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.202
And if you're having trouble doing that, sit
down and talk to your florist about it, and

00:02:28.202 --> 00:02:32.250
let them, as a designer, help you plan that
out.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.170
Venue is incredibly important, price point
is very, very, important, and also picking

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.980
and choosing the things that are most high-priority
for you.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.150
If your bouquet is an incredibly important
element of the wedding - which for many people

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.659
it is, it's in a lot of your pictures, it's
a memory that lasts forever, what did my bridal

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.099
bouquet look like - spend money there.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.760
Spend money on centerpieces, because that's
a place where your guests spend a lot of time,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.920
at your wedding reception, and the majority
of the time is there, and frankly, sitting

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.280
at their table, enjoying their meal, socializing,
right in front of that centerpiece.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.790
That's where the majority of the time is spent,
so spend the money where it's important and

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.549
where it's important to you.

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.920
And that also might be very different for
you.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.110
Perhaps you are having a very lengthy ceremony,
or you feel like, this is my wedding day,

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.050
the ceremony is why we're here, so spend the
money on the flowers for the ceremony.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.269
But, be very clear about what your goals are
and how you want to enjoy the day, and how

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.840
you envision your guests enjoying the day,
and then communicate that as effectively as

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.010
you can with your florist.
