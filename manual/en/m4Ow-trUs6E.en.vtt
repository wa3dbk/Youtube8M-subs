00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:05.380
I'm Dr. Joe Neely, and I practice with the
Barton Oaks Dental Group. We're going to discuss

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.830
what the best toothbrush, or which is the
best toothbrush. The best toothbrush is the

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:22.630
cleaning aid that would best clean the eating
utensil that we're trying to clean. I doubt

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:34.219
seriously that you would select this brush
if you wanted to clean this little item here,

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:43.270
or clean off this nice glass. You would be
more likely to select a brush that fit into

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.219
the enclosure, and was soft enough that it
would get around the little nooks and crannies

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:58.850
of the glass, and the the bumps and humps
on the glass. So, the toothbrush that's going

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:08.060
to work the best would be a toothbrush that
is, has even, soft bristles, and a small enough

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:17.000
head that it can actually get in around one,
or at the very most, two teeth, and be flexible

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.220
enough for the bristles to flex in between
the teeth, and soft enough that when you rocked

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:34.909
it back and forth it would clean the tooth
without cutting the gum. Toothbrush manufacturers

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:47.500
like lots of color, lots of little indentations.
They have a variety of different things that

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.229
that when you first look at them, make a lot
of sense, but all of the unevenness of the

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:02.909
bristles means that they work well if you
get them in exactly the right spot. If you're

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.940
off a little bit then they're actually in
your way, which for the average person, or

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.440
even the average dentist; we're not paying
close enough attention when we're brushing

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.690
our own teeth to adequately use a toothbrush
like that. Interestingly enough, the electric

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.280
toothbrush people have made a brush head that's
very, very small, because they recognize that

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.040
it's much more efficient. So, instead of using
something that looks like that, you'd be far

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.900
better off using something that looks like
that. The best toothbrush is the smallest

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:50.260
toothbrush, the softest toothbrush that you
can use efficiently in an area. There are

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.760
some places where because of the the space
that you're trying to clean, that even a specialized

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.950
toothbrush that's even much smaller, in between
teeth where there's some spaces is the best.
