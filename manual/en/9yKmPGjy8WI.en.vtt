00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:08.310
So the paintings, the painting from Josef
Danhauser, the title is Game of Chess is from

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:19.739
1839. It's a very interesting painting from
the period of Biedermeier, which was all really

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:28.650
concentrated in Germany, Austria, Hungary
and the Czech Republic. It was in the first

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:40.679
part of the 19th Century and it had a big
difference to Neo-Classicism which was at

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:48.700
the last part of the 18th and the beginning
of the 19th Century. It was dealing rather

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:57.539
with the private life. The name of the period,
Biedermeier comes from a kind of a mocking

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:12.050
word for a citizen, a so called "little citizen"
and so that's why we can feel that the main

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:22.810
topics, the main themes which were displayed,
painted by the artist at that time were especially

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:33.150
portraits, genre scenes or some historical
scenes as well. Danhauser, he was working

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:41.630
in Vienna. Vienna was the center of this,
of this style. He was very important because

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:53.200
in his life we can recognize that Biedermeier
was not only a painting, a kind of a style

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:02.370
of painting, but also for everyday life, stuff
like furniture or, or, or other applied arts.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:11.570
Because the Danhauser family had a kind of
furniture workshop and he was working in this

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:22.310
as well. But we can see on that picture that
he was an expert of portrait painting. The

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.520
other thing which is important about this
painting that it was a real story, a real

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:40.120
happening, which happened a year before as
he painted. In 1838 there was a special chess

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:53.960
game between the banker Escales and a Hungarian
noble woman. And they played because the lover

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:04.819
of the noble woman had a big debt to this
banker and that was the way she could gain

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:18.290
back the debts. At the end, she won the game
against the banker. Not only this living personalities,

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:29.840
we can see on that pictures but other famous
composers, like for example, Franz Liszt or

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:46.290
piano players from that time in Vienna. What
is special about this group portrait, it can

00:03:46.290 --> 00:04:01.930
be called a kind of a group portrait because
the figures on the pictures are very accurate

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:12.099
and detailed and the change of the portrait
are very, how to say, very rich in details.
