00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.580
Today I will be making aloo gobi.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.760
Spicy potato and cauliflower.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.320
This is a very favorite dish in India.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.619
You can eat this with any kind of bread like

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.919
roti, paratha, poori, naan or make the sandwiches.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.640
So this recipe I am giving it’s for 2-4 people.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.460
I have 2 cups of cauliflower.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.200
Which I have cut them and I do use the soft stem.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.980
Cut it about this size.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.360
And I am going to use 2 medium red potatoes.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.080
I have already washed.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.940
I like to use the skin.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.400
And I like to cut them in long ways.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.740
And I will use 3 tablespoons of oil.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.780
I like to use canola oil.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.500
Pinch of hing

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.090
1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.220
2 seeded green chillies

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.700
2 bay leaves

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.179
1/4 spoon of red pepper

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.470
1/4 spoon of turmeric powder

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.599
3 teaspoon of coriander powder

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.260
1 teaspoon of mango powder

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.420
And about fist full of green cilantro, chopped.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.640
So here I will use about 1/2 inch of ginger.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.260
It is hard to make ginger paste every time in the blender and

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.010
I don’t want to chop it because my family does not like bite of it.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.280
So I use the zester and it’s so easy and it comes out like a paste.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:03.540
So I am going to put 3 teaspoons of coriander powder.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.890
Turmeric

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.580
1/4 spoon of red chilli powder

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.670
And some water and make a wet paste

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.760
by doing this you don’t burn the spices and they cook very good.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.980
I already have my heat on.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.320
So I am going to add 3 tablespoons of oil.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.640
It should be hot oil but not smoking.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.980
I have to wait for few seconds so oil is hot.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.800
My oil is hot. I am going to put pinch of hing.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.260
Cumin seeds

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.780
Bay leaves

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.880
And green chillies.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.580
Just stir it for few seconds.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.860
And add the paste.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.100
Stir this paste till you start seeing leaving the oil from the side.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.280
It has start leaving the oil.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.540
So it is ready to add the cauliflower.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.140
And potatoes.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.900
This is the time we will add 1 teaspoon of salt.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.300
Or adjust to your taste.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.220
Mix it well.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.700
And cover it and let it cook for about 15 minutes.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.320
After about 5 minutes you do have to stir it one more time.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.420
It has been about 5 minutes.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.480
So I will check the sabzi if it is ready or not.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.660
Stir it from the corner so you don’t break the pieces.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.740
So it will take about another 10 minutes to cook.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.880
This has been about 15 minutes so let me check it.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.620
It looks good but it looks little bit dry.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.940
So I will put couple of spoons of water.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.660
I did stir it one time in between.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.740
It is smelling really good.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.700
It’s time to add the mango powder.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.420
And mix it slowly.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.980
And cilantro.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.960
It’s ready to be served.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.180
My aloo gobi is ready.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.980
Smelling and looking really good.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.630
My husband is waiting. This is his favorite dish.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.190
He can have any time with roti or paratha.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.980
Thank you for watching my recipe.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.440
