Hi this is Eunyoung Kim from South Korea on
behalf of Expert Village today I'm going to

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:19.600
make Korean spice chicken stew. Now I'm going
to try some taste it's good but I like the

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:30.099
strong taste it's up to you, it's up to your
taste so since I'm Korean I like spice taste.

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:58.930
So I'm going to add more chili use a spoon
okay, it's to much little bit and little bit

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:08.410
more soy sauce it's up to your taste you don't
want to strong taste you don't have to add,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:15.360
always feel free to add some more ingredients.
And if you want some sweet taste of it you

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:34.320
can always can add the little more honey,
and lets check the potatoes okay, can't push

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:47.310
it in the end so it's not cooked yet. Okay
let me try one more time ya, it's good and

00:01:47.310 --> 00:02:02.540
let's check the potatoes yes, it's very smooth
so it's done, and I would pour in the big

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.890
bowl and you can have it with the rice and
you can take some of the stew on your rice

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.280
so that's how we eat this.
