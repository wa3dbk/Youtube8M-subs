Hi I'm Evan from Gregg's Cycles and I'm going
to go over with you how to help fix or slightly

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.300
repair a rusty bicycle chain. There isn't
really any way to completely remove rust from

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.550
a bicycle chain unless you were to use some
type of rust remover but then in that case

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.640
you would strip all of the unnecessary oils
out of the links and the pins kind of in between

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.190
there and then you would get stiff links and
have a whole other problem on your hands.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:40.040
So if you do have a chain that looks pretty
rusty and crusty like this one the best solution

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.170
is to just go ahead and leave the chain on
the bike and put a little bicycle specific

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:55.580
chain lube on the chain, what we use specifically
is just your average run of the mill lubricant

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.350
that is called triflow. You can also use white
lightening or T 9 or anything that a bike

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.939
mechanic would recommend to you and the way
you would do that is just put the nozzle of

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:15.149
the dispenser or whatever and then just squeeze
lightly and back peddle just a little bit

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:23.450
and get kind of an even spread there on the
chain, just go ahead and saturate it. Once

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.510
it is kind of or you can see it is kind of
on there you take your rag and again back

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:38.530
peddling, just hold it on the chain. Also
do the sides of the chain as well as the top

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:51.439
and the bottom and then just kind of work
that lubricant into the links on the chain

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.439
and that will loosen up the pins and the links
as well and get your chain performing better

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:05.600
than it would be if it were just straight
rusty and gross so that is how you lube and

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.309
kind of repair a rusty bicycle chain.
