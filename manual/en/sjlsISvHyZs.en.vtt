00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.420
The setup is going to be standing with your feet about shoulder width apart your toes pointing forward

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960
You're going to make sure your core is nice and tight for the entire exercise

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.130
Your shoulders are down in the back

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.699
Chest is up you're maintaining a neutral spine and you're holding those dumbbells with your arms straight and your arms

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.979
By your side the entire time

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.519
As you step back make sure you keep your chest up, and then your feet are always in alignment

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.930
You don't want your footing step up to a level to the right you want to step directly straight back

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.240
Going to the ball of your foot the lower is going to be my mostly the front leg as you do the exercise

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.130
Once you been on the ball of your foot

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.409
Your knee should be under your spine from there go back to the starting position and alternate

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.818
Go back with the other leg, so let's do a couple reps real quick to go over the form

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.519
As I perform the exercise and ensuring that the dumbbells are staying by my side and not swinging forward or backward

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.789
Chest is up the entire time and as I step back

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.859
I'm making sure all my joints are in alignment my knees underneath my spine

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:36.649
I'm landing on the ball of my toe and as I push forward the majority of the load is on my front foot
