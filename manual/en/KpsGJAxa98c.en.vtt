00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.100
cook the potatoes in water with salt

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.760
for 30 min

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.140
cook the cod fish just in water for 10 min

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.300
let is cool down

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.480
clean the cod from skin and bones and break it in little pieces

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.480
 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.120
in a frying pan put the olive oil

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.340
the shopped onion

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.080
the garlic

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.040
after 10 min add the cod to the pan

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.880
let is cook for a few minutes until the cod starts to get in smaller pieces

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.460
more or less after 5 min you could shut down the stove

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.820
after cooked, take the potatoes out of the pan into a boll

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.040
and smash them

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.780
(a fork can be used too in this process)

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.340
to the potatoes add the cod

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.800
the parseley

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.960
some pepper at taste

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.340
mix everithing together

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.740
add one egg at the time to the mix

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.880
repeat the egg process for all the eggs

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.540
after everything well blended together, is time to fry

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:48.260
with two spoons, take some of the mix and roll it on the spoons

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.900
this is the correct shape

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.020
put them to fry in hot oil

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.820
you can also roll them and put them in a tray with four so you can freeze them for later
