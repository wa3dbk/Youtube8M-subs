00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.270
In this section we will talk about diamond
reports or appraisals that are issued with

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:16.340
colored stones or diamonds. These reports
are issued by known laboratories throughout

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.251
the world be them from the United States which
our most important laboratory is the GIA the

00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:32.039
Gemological Institute of America and in Europe
it is the European Gemological Laboratory

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:40.000
and probably the two most important appraisal
firms in the world. Others exist but we just

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.430
only are talking about these two at the moment.
This particular report as all others do identify

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.530
a stone to its very close fingerprint. It
will identify the weight of the stone as in

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:05.840
karats and it further identifies it by its
millimeter sizes by its depth, its height

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:15.499
and its roundness. You can also break those
parameters down into percentages of what the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:22.950
facets, the girdles, the table, the pavilion,
you have all of these things that make this

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.689
stone do what its doing and there are parameters
that stand for ideal and then there are some

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.749
that stand for less. Then you go into finishes
as to how someone took the care or not the

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:48.450
care to polish the stone and that is given
in very good fair medium. Also the reflective

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.909
surfaces are very important. The culet meaning
is a point to the very bottom. Some, especially

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:04.090
in Europe, some polishers will bob the culet
to keep it from chipping because a diamond

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:11.069
has plain and it will splinter like a piece
of wood. Further you go into the grade and

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.500
clarity. A grade clarify will be measured
by those inclusions in which we earlier talked

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.680
about and the size of those inclusions and
how many. The next issue is about color grading

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:33.579
where we use a standard grading set of stones
to judge the color of this before we assert

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:42.209
a classification. All of this is signed by
a person within the industry with whom has

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.419
credentials to support these appraisals.
