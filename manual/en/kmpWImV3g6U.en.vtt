Hi, I’m Jackie from Vegan Yack Attack.

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.200
I’m here for Vegan Cuts to show you an awesome
desert recipe featuring the new Coco-Mon Coconut

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.630
Oil from Ziggy Marley’s, orange almond flavor--super
aromatic.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.130
I can’t wait to use this in baked goods,
but it’s summer… it’s too hot to use

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.130
the oven.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.849
So I’ve come up with this raw cheesecake.

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.770
It’s a tropical cheesecake for you guys.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.710
Easy to put together, all you have to do is
wait and put it in the freezer to prepare

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.710
it.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.710
It tastes awesome…

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:46.079
So aside from the coconut oil, what you’ll
need is some bananas, dates, raw almonds,

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.719
raw cashews, agave nectar or maple syrup,
if you’re into that kind of thing, fresh

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:59.609
oranges for besting in orange juice, a little
sea salt, and some very hot water.

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.129
This makes it so that soaking the cashews
doesn’t take as long.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.120
For equipment what you’ll need is a food
processor, a high speed blender or, if you

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.000
don’t have one, you can use a food processor
for both, but it just won’t get as smooth,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.360
and we also need a cupcake tray with cupcake
liners.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.450
I have reusable silicon ones; you can use
paper ones, that’s fine, but I just like

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.140
these because they’re easy to peel the cheesecakes
out of, and you can wash them and reuse them.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.110
And, lastly, you’ll need a zester to zest
some oranges.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.070
I love this micro plane, it’s good.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.780
The first thing that we’re going to do is
take the raw cashews and put them in the boiling

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.930
hot water.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.439
This way they can get soft enough to blend
and it’ll be a smooth mixture instead of

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.920
chunky.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.560
Now you can set that aside because we are
going to make the crust.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.159
We’re going to take the almonds and the
dates and put them in the food processor.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.659
Make sure you pit the dates beforehand or
you’re going to have some really hard chunks

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:03.659
to chew on.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.820
But these two components make up the crust.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.930
Also, this gets very loud at first.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:24.700
What you want it to look like is like chunky
sand, and then when you press it together,

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.700
it sticks together.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.209
Next, we’re going to take this crust and
we’re going to put about a tablespoon and

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.840
a half in each cupcake liner.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.000
And you can press it down with either a spoon
or some moist fingers—if you wet them down,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.040
the mixture doesn’t stick to them – or
the back of a measuring cup.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.480
For the filling, what we are going to do is
take the bananas and put them in the blender.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.810
Then we’re going to take the melted orange
almond coconut oil and put it all in there.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.000
The agave – I use this to preference, so
you can use less or more than the recipe calls

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
for.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:28.709
And I put a pinch of salt, juice this orange
a little bit, and then zest it as well, for

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:39.610
that full orange flavor to go with the coconut
oil.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.920
Next, we’re going to drain the cashews to
put them in the blender.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.086
Now that we have drained the cashews, you
can go ahead and put them on top of everything

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:53.086
else; make sure you get all of those.

00:03:53.086 --> 00:03:56.810
I like to keep a couple of tablespoons of
water on hand, especially if you are using

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.370
a blender that is not high-speed that can’t
deal with the mixtures, just to thin it out

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.319
a little bit, so that it doesn’t burn out
and explode.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.489
And we’ll just puree it until it’s completely
smooth, and we can go ahead and pour it on

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.000
top of our crust over there.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.250
We’re just going to fill these cupcake liners
close to the top with the cheesecake filling.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.810
You can also use a spoon to do this; it might
be less messy.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.810
Lastly, before we put it in the freezer to
set, we’re going to be tapping it.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:40.650
By “tapping it” I mean kind of slamming
it on your countertop.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.060
That’s really just to get some of the major
air bubbles out of it.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.970
Now, we go to the freezer.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.210
It’s been about two and a half hours, so
taken them out.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.130
They’re firm, and they’re cold, but they’re
not too hard to eat.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.570
And if you want to leave them in overnight
and serve them the next day or something,

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.300
just leave them out for about 10 or 15 minutes
so they can soften up.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.180
Now I’m going to show you how to make just
a cute little garnish with this orange.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:17.190
Alright, we’re just going to slice off the
end--make sure you have a very sharp knife

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:25.530
for this—and do about an eighth of an inch
thin orange slice.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:34.280
So you take this, and you just cut a line
halfway through, and then you can twist it

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.070
and set it right on top of your cheesecakes.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.720
You might need to press down and make it a
little less flexible.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.360
So, you just repeat that 12 times—you might
need a couple small oranges—or you could

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.220
just zest orange on top of it for fanciness
and maybe some coconut flakes since there’s

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.290
coconut in it… be extra tropical.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:07.229
So, now you know at least one use for this
new orange almond coconut oil and you have

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.930
some nifty mini tropical cheesecakes that
are no-bake, so you don’t have to turn on

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:10.930
that oven in the summer heat.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.060
And you can serve them right in the cups for
low-mess.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:21.510
