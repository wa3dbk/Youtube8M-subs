Hi I’m Jason and this is Dosatron University.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.740
Today, Dosatron’s troubleshooting video series features the D25RE2 11GPM injector.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.320
The information pertains to the blue standard and the white versions.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.480
In this video, I will use a strap wrench and a small tip phillips head screwdriver.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.240
The three key areas to troubleshooting are:

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.550
1. The unit is not drawing the concentrate,
but is clicking

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.309
2. The unit is pushing water down into your
concentrate container, but is clicking and

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.769
3. The unit is not clicking

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.780
The first two are the most common.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.600
If your injector is clicking but not drawing
the concentrate it could be as simple as the strainer being plugged with debris.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.980
Take a look at the strainer, if it is clogged, clean it out and retest your Dosatron.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.900
If there is still no suction, turn the water on.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.980
If the unit is clicking, unscrew and remove the suction hose nut and hose and see if you feel suction on your finger.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.920
If you feel suction, just cut half an inch
off the top of the suction hose and reattach.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.220
You should see the liquid begin moving up
the tube.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.380
If you don’t see liquid move up the tube
or you don’t feel suction on your finger, turn the water off.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.280
Press the air bleed button on the lid a couple of times to release the pressure.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.720
Using the strap wrench, loosen the lid and unscrew to remove.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.560
Set the lid aside.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.320
Grasp the white valve support and pull the
piston straight out of the body.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.160
Set the body aside and take a close look at
the plunger seal for knicks, scratches, or wear.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.040
If you do see damage or you don’t remember the last time you changed the seal, just replace it now.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.140
To replace the seal, pinch and roll it off
of the plunger.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.880
Install a new seal into the groove.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.700
Carefully install a piston into the body and replace the lid, hand tight.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.120
Your injector should now be drawing the concentrate.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.960
If your injector is pushing water down into
the concentrate container, it’s time to investigate the check valve.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.820
To do this, remove the hose nut and hose and set aside.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.160
Unscrew and remove the check valve barb and remove the check valve seal.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.860
Then, carefully pry the check valve assembly down and out of the stem.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.780
A small flat blade screwdriver or pick should will this easier.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.140
Inspect the seal and check valve assembly.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.780
If they are dirty, you may be able to soak,
brush off, and reinstall.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.180
If you see damage or don’t remember the
last time you changed these parts, just replace them now.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.740
To reassemble, press the check valve assembly into the stem as far as it will go.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.300
Place the check valve seal with the groove facing upward into the barb.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.420
Thread it onto the white stem and hand tight.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.140
Thread the suction hose nut onto the hose.
Slide it onto the barb and tighten the nut.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.300
This should stop water from dripping back
into the concentrate container.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.120
If the unit isn’t clicking, unscrew, remove
the lid and set aside.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.420
If it’s tight, just use a strap wrench to
loosen it.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.580
Grasp the white valve support and pull the
piston straight out of the body.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.920
Inspect the white valve support on the top.
Press the push rod down and check the two actuator springs on the bottom.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.220
If they are broken or missing, just replace them.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.100
You can visually inspect the upper and lower flanges on the piston shelf.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.740
If they are worn or have deep scratches the piston shell needs to replaced.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.400
Also, check the piston shells fit inside the body.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.560
To do this, invert the piston and slide it into the body.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.600
It should be a snug fit.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.660
If it feels loose, the piston shell and push
rod O-ring need to be replaced.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.740
To replace the piston shell, use a small tip
phillips screwdriver and remove the valve support screw and the plastic retainer.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.900
Press the push rod up and slide the valve support off of the inlet valve and set aside.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.480
Next remove the four screws in the center of the piston shell to release the actuator
assembly.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.960
Pull the actuator assembly out and discard
the old piston shell.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.280
Put the new push rod O-ring on the top of
the push rod and slide it down as far as it will go.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.600
Then position the actuator assembly in the shell as shown and hold firmly.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.280
Now, reinstall the four screws and hand tighten them in a star pattern.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.540
Press the white plastic portion of the actuator side to side.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.660
If there’s movement, retighten the screws.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.740
Reinstall the valve support by sliding it
onto the inlet valve.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.940
Next, position the retainer and hand tighten
the screws.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.050
Test the piston by pressing the push rod from
the top and bottom.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.700
It should click each time.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.160
Insert the piston back into the body and hand tighten the lid.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.600
Your injector should now be clicking and drawing concentrate.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.880
That’s all for now.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.780

troubleshooting your D25RE2 Injector.
