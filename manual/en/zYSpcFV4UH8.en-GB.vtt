00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.900
Hi everybody and welcome back to the Get Ready for University Channel.

00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:14.006
As you can tell by the presence of a dog, who's sniffing a lot and the change of a background, I'm home for summer!

00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:18.384
Which means one thing - when I go back, it's Freshers' Week!

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:26.500
Now, Freshers' Week is an experience for people who have already been to university and people who are going for the first time.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.040
I have a few things to inform you of what to expect from Freshers' Week.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.840
So, every university has a different time for Freshers' Week, but they typically happen from the start of September to the middle of October.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.980
The latest one I've heard of has been the middle of October.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.540
You have one at every university in the UK

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.062
Every university has a different kind of set-up for their Freshers' Week, but I'll just tell you what I know, based on my experience.

00:00:55.062 --> 00:01:01.405
When I went to Bangor University, we had a Welcome Week diary and it outlines what to expect for that week,

00:01:01.405 --> 00:01:05.834
what you need to make sure you bring with you when you're moving in, because obviously that's a big event.

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:09.743
And different things that you might not have thought of to do.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:17.400
Freshers week will start with moving in to Halls or your house and meeting your flatmates.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.940
You should be given information about that from your university, with regards to what time you should arrive, what day you should arrive.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.940
Have you gone through and booked your room correctly, where you need to collect your key from.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:36.180
So make sure you find out those things before you get there, because otherwise you'll have 200 people asking the same question and it could get stressful!

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.960
It's very likely that there will be people at your Halls when you move in to give you advice.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.300
Past students telling you about their experiences and what's coming up over the week and how to go about things.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:58.100
One of the main things that will probably be there is a Freshers' Fair, which is where you get to learn about societies and what will be going on throughout the year.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.280
It's your chance to sign-up for taster sessions which will happen throughout Freshers' Week if not a little bit afterwards.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:13.460
So try as much as you can. You haven't got lectures, you've just got nights out, which is when you need to learn to recover from a hangover!

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.980
Otherwise you don't get to do your free taster sessions!

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.240
You'll also have taster sessions for your course so you can get an idea about what you're going to do.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.680
I regret not going to enough taster sessions in my Freshers' Week.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.400
I know of someone who went to two every day and loved it and got to try pretty much everything.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.760
Because that week you haven't got anything else on and it's just focusing on getting to know the uni.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.360
That week you can also learn how to cook. Don't binge on takeaways, you can learn to cook that week as you have the time.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.236
You should sign-up to your doctor and learning where those kinds of things are.

00:02:52.236 --> 00:03:00.556
Learning where the nearest hospital is, just in case of an emergency. So you don't have to find out when it's necessary.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:13.280
So make sure you're registered to your local doctor, because it's very unlikely that you'll want to travel a couple of hours back home just to have an appointment about Freshers' Flu!

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.640
(which is something I'll get on to)

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.560
You'll want to work out where the police station is, where your security is for your Halls.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:29.000
Work out where the hospital is, in case you ever need it.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.680
Familiarise yourself with your surroundings, so learning where the local shops are, where the cheapest shops are

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.640
where the best clubs are and stuff like that.

00:03:36.648 --> 00:03:41.389
Welcome Week is also a time to meet your course mates and your flatmates.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.880
So make sure you spend a lot of time getting to know them.

00:03:45.548 --> 00:03:54.908
This is the first bit of freedom a lot of people have had, so don't waste it sitting inside playing computer games moaning about your hangover.

00:03:54.908 --> 00:03:59.591
Get out and meet people and see who's on your course and see what you're going to be doing for the next year.

00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:04.351
It's also a really good opportunity to talk to people who are years above you and have already done it.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.360
Another thing is to familiarise yourself with what your uni has.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:18.349
So for example with student services if you have a DSA, Disabled Students Allowance, and you need a personal support plan

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.120
go in and sort that out in Freshers' Week so it's ready for when you need to start your lectures.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.436
That week is to settle in so it can be done in that week.

00:04:31.436 --> 00:04:35.876
So I'm just going to read you a few things that were on here as activities.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:44.280
So we had a big meet up in our Hall area. We had a barbecue and bouncy castle, sumo wrestling and stuff like that.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.665
Just to get to know each other and break the ice.

00:04:46.665 --> 00:04:52.900
We had lots of nights out. We had a formal welcome from the Dean and people who are in charge as it were.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.004
In the main lecture hall, which everyone went to to welcome you to the university.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.960
We also had a quiz night.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.000
There were walking tours of Bangor so you got to see different places.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.839
Fancy dress is a must in Freshers' week.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.000
One of the main things that will probably happen to you in Welcome Week is that you'll get Freshers' flu.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.440
I did, and mine turned into bronchitis, which isn't very nice. But you're meeting that many different people

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.320
from many different areas, and you're not looking after yourself very well, you're drinking a lot, not eating right

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.480
and yeah, it's very likely you're going to catch the flu.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:42.080
So, it's just a cold. It's fine. Just come stocked with medicine. When the time is right you need the paracetamol and lemsip so make sure you have it.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.320
Also, it's very likely that you'll get free pizza from a certain pizza company. Watch out for that one.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.760
One final thing I'll talk about in this video is feeling homesick when you get to uni.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.840
So it's likely in Freshers' week that you'll be wrapped up in all your activities

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.840
and it's towards the end, when things start to slow down that you'll start to feel homesick.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.840
If that happens there are many student support systems available at most universities.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.240
There was definitely at mine. And peer guides as well are available to talk to.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.440
You'll regret it if you miss a lot of  uni so you may as well enjoy it while you're there.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.040
So I hope you have a great Freshers' week when the time is right.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.560
So me and Barney hope you have a lovely summer and we're looking forward to hearing your freshers' stories.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.120
Make sure you check out my previous video on making your Halls homely, if you're worried about packing and things.

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:39.959
And a few previous videos from Olivia and Ashley about stress and housemates.

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:42.458
And we'll see you in our next video. Bye guys!
