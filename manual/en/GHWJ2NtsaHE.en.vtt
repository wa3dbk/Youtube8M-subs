00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.160
Hello..

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.400
We know that you guys are fasting right now, so we're going to show you

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.220
What?

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.600
Sweet desserts, sweet just like us!

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.980
PD: Previously, Yoora and Michi have always dined in posh restaurants

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.980
This time, we're taking them to the roadside!

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.220
We're going to take you guys to the top 3 Martabak!

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.720
-We're going to take you guys to the top 3 Martabak!
-(Top 3 Most Delicious Martabak!)

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.040
-The first one?
-Where is the first one?

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.420
It's very close actually! Do you know where it is?

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.680
It's here. Come, come!

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.440
PD: Starting from the 3rd position, Martabak Boss

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.940
The most favorite menu here is Martabak Ovomaltine

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.120
Why? Surely because they use Ovomaltine as their chocolate

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.180
The place is also cozy

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.760
Miss, which one is the most favorite menu?

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.540
Ovomaltine.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.980
-Isn't that Ovaltine?
-Ovomaltine Missy..

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
-Ovomaltine Missy!
-Ovaltine Boss

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.180
Ovomaltine one, please Boss!

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.380
Finally, we're waiting for something sweet

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.240
It's best to break the fast with sweet stuff, right?

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.100
Right

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.420
Speaking of sweets,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.900
What kind of sweet actions did a guy ever do to you?

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.480
You know, he doesn't have to say a word

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.980
(Yoora Nakal)

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.820
-I was not allowed to have a boyfriend back then, but I was close with this guy
-(Michi's experience on her junior high school years)

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.700
And then this guy was such a gentleman,  he was very kind

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.420
And I told him that I was not allowed to have a boyfriend,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.340
We had been very close for 2 years, up till we were in high school

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.720
And he had been waiting for me

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.360
But unfortunately we never dated

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.760
But for me it was very romantic!

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.960
No, no. That is okay..

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.841
It's okay?

00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:37.487
Yeah, he's sweet and okay

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.400
Sweet! Injeong (approved)

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.640
Martabak! Martabak!

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.980
PD: Look at how much they spread the Ovomaltine

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.540
-Open!
-Thank you Mas~

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.180
Thanks~

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.300
PD: Yummy!!~~

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.740
PD: Wow, look at that Ovomaltine. Martabak Boss sit in the third place.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.040
Cheeerrs~~

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.480
It's really good

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.220
The chocolate works really well

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.400
The best

00:02:27.754 --> 00:02:30.294
By the way, how do you think it is?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.460
The taste...?

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.600
-Oh, Nyamnyamnyam. Go!
-(Nyam = Average, Nyamnyam = Good, Nyamnyamnyam = Excellent)

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.940
1, 2, 3 Nyamnyam!

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.360
Let's go!

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.540
Aaah I'm stuffed~~

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.260
-(Let's move!: Martabak Bandung Raya)
-PD: In the 2-nd place, Martabak Bandung Raya

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.180
They open 24 hours and have been established since 20 years ago

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.680
Waaaah… looks delicious!

00:02:53.836 --> 00:02:55.836
Seriously, they look so tasty!

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.920
So, we have talked about the sweet acts,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.700
How about pickup lines?

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.360
I got one, it's quite common actually

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.700
Look at me, look at me

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.140
Look at me

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.800
I'll be the guy

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.040
Babe,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.600
(You're calling me??)

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.020
I'm sure that your parents are thieves

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.380
What? Why thieves?

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.580
Because they stole the stars above and put them in your eyes

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.240
PD: They are generous in when it comes to the topping

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.680
What to do? I'm hungry~

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.960
Me too, I'm hungry as well

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.738
Seriously, this is not an acting

00:03:41.738 --> 00:03:43.401
I'm starving!!

00:03:43.401 --> 00:03:45.036
Me too, what to do..

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.820
(Yummy!)

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.280
(Green Tea Cheese)

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.100
PD: Here is Green Tea Cheese Martabak! Signature menu of Martabak Bandung Raya which sits in the second place

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.300
Cheeerrs~~

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400
Okay, Nyamnyamnyam

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.920
1, 2, 3.. Nyamnyamnyam!

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.640
PD: FYI they have been fasting all day in order to be able to eat a lot of Martabak

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.200
(How cute)

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.220
Just like Italians say..

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.520
Delicioso!

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.660
I think it's enough

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.200
We're gonna be late, it's gonna be dark soon

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.960
Enough already

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.260
-I'm still eating!
-Come one, come on

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.020
-(Ready to eat the best Martabak?)
-Finally, we're coming to the winner here

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.040
PD: You should come here earlier

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.140
Beside it's always full with queues and crowds, this place is also the pioneer of Toblerone Martabak

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.420
While we had green tea as the topping previously, now it's the batter that has green tea flavor

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.860
Therefore it's green. Michi and Yoora surely are going to love this Martabak

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.300
Looks absolutely delicious!

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.380
Seriously, I can't even breathe..

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.040
(Toblerone Cheese with Green Tea batter)

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.560
PD: Pioneer of the most happening menu, Toblerone Cheese with Green Tea batter sits in the first position!

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.560
1, 2, 3.. Cheeerrs~~

00:05:18.143 --> 00:05:20.143
Really delicious!!

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.280
-This green tea is like,
-It's combined very well with the Toblreone!

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.700
How is it? Let's rate 1,2,3 Nyamnyamnyam

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.060
1...2…3

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.220
Nyamnyamnyam!

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.680
The green tea is different here

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.960
Yeah, way better

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.920
It's like the green tea topping is different with.. really it tastes really good

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.940
PD: Okay, now Yoora is going to give clue about the next episode!

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.320
I'm gonna give you two questions

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.560
Which do you prefer, big or small?

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.640
(Wondering)

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.540
-Big
-Long or short?

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.820
Big and long

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.400
Really? Big and long?

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.840
Big and long? Alright, we're going there tomorrow

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.360
PD: Big and long? Hm.. what place will it be?
