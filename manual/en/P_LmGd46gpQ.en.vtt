00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.590
Hey, everybody!

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.889
It’s Carl Taylor here, author of Red Means
Go and founder of Business Builders Academy

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.870
where we teach you how to buy, build and sell
businesses profitably.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.030
Today I want to talk to you about a question
I was recently asked by Troy in New South

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.030
Wales.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.120
He asked, I’m an eighteen year old, and
can I get a loan from the banks for a million

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.790
dollars to buy a business?

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.730
Now the short answer is yes, but it will be
challenging.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:41.130
The longer answer is I recently had a financial
expert come in and speak to my class at Buying

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.510
a Business Master Class.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.230
And I asked Kevin Lee to come in and speak
because he’s written over a billion dollars

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.020
worth of loans and he deals with the banks
every single day.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.450
And what he shared with the class is that
there are four key things that the banks are

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.670
going to want to know and look at when it
comes to lending you money.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.250
The first thing they’re gonna look at is
can you service the loan.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.880
Do you have a job that’s paying you an income
that you’ll continue once you buy the business?

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.010
Do you have investments that are bringing
you an income?

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.749
What cash flow and profits and income can
you take out of the business you’re gonna

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:27.710
buy, and combining all of that, can you service
the loan?

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.799
Will you be able to make the repayments?

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.829
The next thing they’re gonna look at is
what skin are you putting in the game.

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.229
You see, a bank is not gonna come to you and
go here’s a million dollars to buy a business

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.100
for a million dollars.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.469
Why?

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.419
Because you haven’t put any skin in the
game, you haven’t put in anything to show

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:49.240
how serious you are about buying this business.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.669
Because if you don’t put any of your own
cash in, what’s to stop you, if you’re

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:57.430
thinking from the banks point of view, what’s
to stop you from buying this business, they

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.119
put all this money up, and then you decide
“Na, I’m gonna call myself bankrupt,”

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.850
and walk away from this business.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.859
And now the bank’s stuck with a business
that they’ve got to try and get rid of.

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:12.069
So they want to know what skin are you putting
in the game.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.230
The next thing they’re gonna look at is
what is your character like.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.230
What is your history?

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.330
What is your credit rating?

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.090
You know, have you been late in paying credit
card payments?

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.640
Have you defaulted on loans in the past?

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.090
Have you declared bankruptcy recently?

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.340
Have you successfully run a business before?

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.620
What preparation have you done to get a million
dollars?

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.769
You know if you’re gonna go for a million
dollars, you’re gonna have to do a very

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.530
thorough business plan to show your character
and show your ability to research and understand

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.569
the industry you’re about to buy into.

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:51.040
The next thing they’re gonna look at is
what can they take if you don’t pay your

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.040
loan.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.000
What are they gonna be able to just take and
sell and get their money back?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.540
Now thinking about if they take your business
of your hands but you don’t have a lot of

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.249
assets, they’re gonna be worried about that
because how easily can they sell that business

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.769
again and make their money back.

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.209
If there’s a lot of stock and things they
can possibly liquidate that’s probably gonna

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.720
help you a lot more in getting that finance
from a bank.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.010
Now the thing is that I teach that, as entrepreneurs,
I teach my students this, as entrepreneurs,

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.459
we are creative.

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.260
And as such, I teach creative strategies to
financing buying a business.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.889
At my How to Buy a Business for a Dollar intensive,
I actually shared five different ways that

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:36.200
you can creatively buy a business without
requiring the money from the banks, either

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.150
at all or in a lot less.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.060
So be aware that as entrepreneurs, you are
creative, think creatively, think how could

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.790
you buy this business without involving the
banks.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.829
I hope that served you.

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.280
I hope that answered your question, Troy.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.980
And if there’s anything else, until I see
you next, go out, live life a hundred and

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:15.620
ten percent.
