00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.800
this is mikey with videomissile.com
and I have another

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.590
five minute after effects tutorial. now if you

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.730
and updates that I post

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.869
in this video i'm going to be talking
all about

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.119
titles or text or words on the screen

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.340
and there's lots of things you can do
and animate and work with these

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.730
things so lets dive right in and
show you what to do

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.240
so first of course we need text so up at
the top is the text or committee will

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.159
get to that and yet click

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:41.940
and loves type

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.220
text

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.860
now what can we do with this text

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.260
we can animated we can move it around

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.850
weekend rotated

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.530
all the same things you can do

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.050
with any later

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.740
rotate

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.330
change the position

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.210
change the anchor point

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.260
now again with the anchor point

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.660
and that is the position that is the
point at which things will be scaled

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.690
from

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.260
and rotated around

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.180
but text has any me you had no other
features etc monolayers don't have

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.130
and as you can see here

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.720
down my timeline

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.150
i got this little but missus and the
name of the triangle excellent

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.970
sala click on that as all these things
that we can do that look familiar like

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.830
addition and scale

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.370
homeowner skew rotations us a little bit
different

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.880
and enable protectors three death talk
about the letter

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.299
so let's try on these things with strom
scale

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.700
and it brings up some new options here

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.280
animator one

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.040
range selector scale learn these things
so let's test it out on the skills up

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.890
and you can see the text is scaling up

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.540
and they're all kind of running into
each other

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.950
who i can do is in this range selector
what this is as you can see these three

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.550
new lines here

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.850
this is the range sandwiched in between
these two lines that is being affected

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.309
by this parameter the scale

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:17.040
so i can change the and

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.079
do you see what happened that hasn't
sweeps across to had scales it up

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.939
sankey frame that saw starbuck efrain

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.599
go for it in time

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.759
and ended

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:35.009
i can also do the same thing with

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:40.609
to start point

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.249
before in time

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:43.369
and then

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:45.900
bring that across as well

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.180
this is a bulk across the same time does
nothing

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.569
if i go in here highlight both is key
french and move them over

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.739
then do you see how it people sweep
across so only in between those two

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.809
lines is being affected by the scale

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:03.849
so that's pretty cool

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.919
now what i can do as i can add more
animation

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.109
parameters i can have an effect week
appear

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.879
i can't have now rotation

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.999
and it hasn't here to this

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:21.579
range selector so i bring up irritation
and now

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.469
sky rotate along that same

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:26.659
spike approached

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:31.189
click here harkens click add over here

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:38.189
and different properties

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:44.180
and now

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.919
of these things are going to be

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:51.019
tied to this start and end point

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.369
but the range select

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:57.799
so and the last thing i want to show you
before we are done with his tutorial

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:58.659
is

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.549
deeper character three-d_ so if i'm able
that

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:03.929
now

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:06.829
let's go in here and they have

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.159
a position

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.019
i couldn't

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.219
i can change these

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.829
and three d space

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.799
position

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.299
i can have it

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.509
rotation and i can have these rotate

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:28.520
and three space

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.430
and it'll all work per character and
serve the word as a whole

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.649
and you can do that

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:36.389
unless you are using these animate

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.490
feature in the text

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.740
now if i want to go back and then

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.459
rotate the whole thing

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:47.669
i can you can see what it's doing

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.469
it's actually move in the text in three
d

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:54.020
by going here too accustomed view

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.240
and zoom out you can see where the texas
flying away

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.129
and then popping back in

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.199
so

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.399
unhappily isolated that have already
makes you subscribe to the channel

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:11.429
