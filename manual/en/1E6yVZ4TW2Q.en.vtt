Hey guys, its Aaron from MobileReviews-Eh.ca
and this is our second Incipio Atlas Case

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.989
because the first one, at the bottom here,
there was a hole and so it was not waterproof.

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.489
So Incipio was nice enough to send us another
case so we're going to dunk it in this tiny

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:34.090
tank of water and hopefully its waterproof.
So the problem that we had before was this

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:41.090
little plug beside the speaker port wire mesh
but there was a hole in this one. This one

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.460
does not. Got a little tub of water, there's
a piece of facial tissue in here to see if

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.460
its going to get wet on the inside of the
case and we're going to dump it in there and

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.149
we're going to weigh it down using this nondescript
bottle of hand sanitizer. So we're going to

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.290
let it sit there for 30 minutes and then we're
going to crack it open and see how well it

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.600
performs.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.530
(Bouncy dance music)

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.799
So we've just pulled the case out of the water
and initially looking at the tissue it looks

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.799
like it is completely dry so we're going to
crack it open and see if there's any water

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.060
on the inside. This test actually looks way
more promising then the last test that we

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.060
did since, you know, there's no water in it.
From what we can tell. Now this is the case

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.899
that actually has a flappy-flap, its a little
weird that way. It comes with a flappy-flap

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.920
but also comes with a glass screen protector
which makes it a little different than the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.920
other cases that we've reviewed. Ow! Bahhhh,
that really hurts, it tells you to put your

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:02.049
finger in the hole and I did and it really
hurt! Looks dry so I think we're going to

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.050
find a puddle to toss this into, or a larger
body of water or something. River, well, actually

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.720
this is actually a small river. Big river
is over there, big river is dangerous right

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.720
now, little river, safe. So we are going to
toss the iPhone inside an Incipio Atlas case

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.030
into this, this really groudy looking water.
It's not stale water but its definitely not

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.810
nice looking water. Alright, so, camera is
going, my beautiful mug. That camera is going

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:54.270
and we're going to, my shoes aren't water
proof, it's in! I'm poking it with a stick.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.340
I think its waterproof iPhone case. One of the neat things
about this case is that it has a glass screen

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:18.570
protector which is one of two cases that has
a glass screen protector. Thanks for watching

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.760
this waterproof testing video for the Incipio
Atlas. So after Incipio sent us a replacement

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.760
case, well, there case is definitely, Ahh!
it's blurry! So after Incipio sent us the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:42.250
replacement case, well, it is definitely waterproof iPhone case,
definitely water resistant. So if you have

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.870
any questions or if you have any other cases
you want to have us take a look it, leave

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.880
them in the comment section below. Find us

social media platforms that we are on. I'm
@Aaron_The_Ho, I'm a reviewer at MobileReviews-eh.ca

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.940
and generally keep your phone dry with this
one, just check that there's no holes in it.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.940
And if there is, send it back to Incipio.
