WALTER: My collection means the world to me,

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.700
it is basically anything and everything I
could have ever wanted as a young child.

COMM: Walter Krueger has amassed a massive

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.410

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.849
00:29
WALTER: This is my main Oz room, I have things

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:38.849
such as replica crystal balls, to life size
wicked witches, all the way to a miniature

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.110
model of Dorothy's house when it first dropped
into Oz, all the way to the Emerald City.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.320
00:44
COMM: Now he hopes to inspire a new generation,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.199
by fulfilling his dream of turning his life's
work into a museum.

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.500
00:52
WALTER: My collection means the world to me,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.199
it is my escape.

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.969
00:56
COMM: Growing up the Wizard of Oz story helped

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.579
Walter cope with his biggest challenges, and
personal tragedy.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.780
01:02
WALTER: When I was younger I was bullied and

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.780
then in my teenage years my mom passed away
when I was 16. My mom was the person who ignited

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.130
this passion, would fuel it for me.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.320
01:14
COMM: And the jewel of the collection was

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.590
a present from his mother.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.579
01:17
WALTER: These are a pair of replica ruby slippers

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:27.119
made by the Western Costume Company for the
50th anniversary pif the Wizard Of Oz in 1989.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.549
These are probably one of the most recoils
items in my collection. As not for monetary

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.149
value but because they were given to me by
my mother.

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.130
01:34
COMM: And Walter's 10,000 piece collection

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.619
is gaining value every day.

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.380
01:39
WALTER: A current appraisal which I've had

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.479
recently done by another collector appraised
my collection for about five hundred, six

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.869
hundred thousand dollars as a collectors value,
I'm always adding new pieces to my collection

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.869
that's something that I do on a daily basis.
I've gone under some criticism with my Oz

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.360
session as I call it.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.479
02:01
WALTER: But his amazing horde of memorabilia

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.299
is quickly outgrowing his home.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.690
02:07
WALTER: It's kind of taking over my house

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.180
at the moment.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.980
02:09
COMM: And Walter dreams of turning his collection

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.860
into a museum.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.480
02:13
WALTER: I wanna have a museum, and I wanna

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.670
preserve these things for children to see
in the future. Never lose your dream, never

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.770
lose sight of your dream, and that's something
I believe and I want to share that. It's a

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.080
yellow brick road I'm on and my own journey.
