hello, it's Klaudia

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.360
Today I will show you how to make a star with paper wicker

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.580
We willl need:

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.500
done, woven tube,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.320
I I painted before, but it can be done later by painting the finished work

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.320
I use the tubes in two colors to better show weaving

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.560
in addition we need clips for washing,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.580
glue,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.880
end scissors.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.720
Let's start

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.420
The first tube is divided into five equal pieces

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.820
and sixth, the shortest

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.660
one piece is 10 cm.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.920
The tube is best to wrap inside, one way.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.000
3,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.760
4,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.420
5,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
and 6.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.980
In the thus prepared tubes

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.680
we create a star

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.760
The tip can be a little crop

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.220
The sixth piece combine with the first tube in tube

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.260
we are doing so the star is closed

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.760
To such a scaffolding of star well kept

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.700
we use glue,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.980
which glue tubes together

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.360
Glued star clench clips

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.620
and wait until the glue dries

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.480
When the glue is dry

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.220
remove clips,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.880
take the tube, here in a different color,

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.820
and we begin to weave.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.880
I hooked up here on the first leg tube, so that it was stable

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.060
This is the first arm

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.840
And I go to the top of the second

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.640
I do a loop on it

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.540
and goes to next arm

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.760
I do the same loop on it

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.040
over and over again

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.000
each arm and each vertex

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.820
This piece can be cut off later

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.060
if it will be very disturbed

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.760
Next we continue the same

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.600
over and over again

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.700
when we run out, we take another tube and connect

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.680
as well as the weaving baskets

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.500
tube in tube

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.080
and continue

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.340
star is completed.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.960
Cut off the tip,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.040
glue

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.380
and it's done.
