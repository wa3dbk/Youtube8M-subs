00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Have you ever hiked a mountain or trekked in the woods, and wondered,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
“Where in the world am I?”

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
YAMAP will turn that wondering into wanderlust.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
YAMAP is an app for your smartphone.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Using the GPS already built into every smart device,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.500
YAMAP enables you pin-point your location,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.000
all without the need for data&nbsp;connection.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
where phone signals can't be received.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Know exactly where you are on the trail so you can focus on having fun,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
instead of worrying about getting lost.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.500
The proprietary map also shows the necessary information needed for trekking in the mountain.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.000
YAMAP shows you what you need to know about your hike,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.500
such as your trekking time, travel distance, and altitude.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.600
You can take pictures of your adventures and upload them on YAMAP

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.000
to personalize your trip.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.500
All this is made possible through one app.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
YAMAP!

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.000

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.000
And it doesn’t end there.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.500

where to find scenic routes and photo opportunities.
