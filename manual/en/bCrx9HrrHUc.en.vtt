Hi! I'm Mark Middlebrook. And I'm here in
the Paul Marcus Wines warehouse. And in this

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:08.270
segment, I'm going to talk about the different
sub regions of Rioja, the Spanish wine growing

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:15.509
region. Rioja has three different sub regions.
Rioja Alta, this brown shaded area here. Rioja

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.500
Alavesa, the two red, smaller areas at the
top. And Rioja Baja, over on the Eastern and

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.029
the lower side. And these are three examples
of wines from those three sub regions. Rioja

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.150
Baja is the largest and the hottest of the
three sub regions. Generally, the wines of

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.060
the least prestige, come from this area. Although,
there are some very good wines that come from

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.540
there. And also, some very particular good
value wines. Since Rioja Vega 2001Reserva

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.870
from Rioja Baha. Because of the hotter climate,
you get a little more ripeness in the grapes.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.740
Which translates into more body in the wine.
Sometimes more alcohol and sometimes a little

00:00:51.740 --> 00:01:00.811
less finesse. This second region is Rioja,
I'm going to talk about Rioja Alavesa. This

00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:06.260
is the Northern most and the coolest of the
three. And also the most minerally of the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.130
soil. So you tend to get a wine that has a
lot of structure. Acidity and tannin, maybe

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.260
a little more grip in the wine. A little more
austerity. It's probably the most fashionable

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:23.740
Rioja region, right now. A lot of new, young
kind of, hot shot producers are making wines

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.730
in this area. Including Remirez de Ganuza.
This is one of the top and newer style Rioja

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.730
from Rioja Alavesa. And then finally Rioja
Alta which is kind of, the classic part of

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:44.310
Rioja. It's not quite as cool as Alavesa but
certainly cooler that Rioja Baja. You tend

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.409
to get wines of great finesse from there.
Not as rich or kind of burly as Rioja Baja.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.820
But maybe, not quite as lean and structured
as sometimes as the Rioja Alavesa wines. I

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.870
like drinking them all. It's just a matter
of trying different things. And also understanding

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.040
that many producers blend the grapes from
the different regions. So integrate bottling

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.730
may, may have wines from two or three of the
different sub regions.
