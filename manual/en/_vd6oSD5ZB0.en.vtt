00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.630
So if you're anything like me, you're blind
as a bat.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:15.770
Which means, I literally can't see anything
with my glasses on or my contact lenses in.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.400
But until that day, I'm gonna show you how
to a natural makeup look that makes your eyes

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.739
look big and beautiful with your glasses on.

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:28.690
And yes, my book is actually, in large print.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:40.570
So to start off my makeup, I'm gonna fill
in my eyebrows.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.760
I'm starting with that gel side first, to
underline my eyebrow and make sure it's nice

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.240
and defined and then I'm gonna take the powder
side and fill it in.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.460
Now I'm filling in my eyebrows a little darker
than usual because when I wear my glasses

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.460
it tends to flatten out my face.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.460
By defining my eyebrows, it gives my face
more depth.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:04.149
As always, I'm gonna prime my eyelid and I'm
just going to rub that in with my finger.

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:10.040
I want my eyes to look nice and bright behind
my frames so I'm taking this MAC "Let's Skate"

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.050
Paint pot and I'm just taking a synthetic
brush and putting that all over my eyelid.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.350
This is a nice shimmery pink color and I'm
just gonna take a doe foot shaped eyeshadow

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.710
brush and I'm just gonna take the flat side
of the brush to pack on that eyeshadow onto

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.710
my lid.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.830
I'm gonna take the point and use that to put
color on my tear duct and run that color along

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.750
my lower lash line.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.410
In using a color like this, it brings light
to our eyes instead of being hidden behind

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.710
our glasses.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.000
Next, taking this matte taupe-y brown color,
I'm not going to put it right in my crease,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.630
but instead, I'm going to hold my brush upward
and put it right above my crease.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.903
The reason I don't put this color right in
my crease is because by putting it above my

00:01:54.903 --> 00:01:57.940
crease, it gives the illusion that my eyes
are a little bit bigger than they actually

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.940
are.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.450
Sometimes with certain prescription lenses,
it can shrink your eyes, but this makes sure

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.010
your eyes are natural and nice and big looking.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.500
I then just take a clean crease brush and
make sure it's all blended out.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.280
Taking this deep slate brown shimmery color,
I'm going to take a pointed crease brush and

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.730
run this right in my crease.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.500
This also gives my eyes more depth, because
like I said before the glasses kind of flatten

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.500
out your eyes shape.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.819
So this makes your eyes look nice and beautiful,
big, round, all that good stuff.

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:35.430
I'm just gonna take that brush that has some
of that matte brown left in it and belnd all

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.790
the colors together.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.790
It's eyeliner time!

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.200
So, I'm taking a liquid liner and giving it
a little shake and I'm gonna make sure there's

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.170
not a lot of product on the tip of the brush
because we don't want it to get gloopy and

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.569
I'm gonna try to line my eye thin on the inside
and go thicker on the outside.

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.659
Oh what...the...who does that?

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:03.329
Oh my gosh, so I'm just gonna wipe that off,
pretend like nothing happened, and keep lining

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.059
my eye.

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:11.599
You want your eyeliner on the top to be a
little thicker because you want your eyes

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:12.599
to stand out.

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.359
And now, of course, my hands are all dirty.

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.719
So I'm going to go watch them but of course,
I'm going to put my glasses on because I'm

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.769
seriously blind enough where I will run into
the wall.

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:27.769
Woo-hoo!

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:28.769
Clean hands!

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:29.930
Alright, let's get back to it.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.519
I'm just gonna line my tightline with a little
bit of black eyeliner, this makes my eyelashes

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.269
look thicker behind the frames.

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.970
And I'm also gonna run half way along my lower
water line.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:47.180
Taking a shimmery white eyeliner, I'm going
to put this in my tear duct.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:56.733
This keeps my eyes looking open and awake
and nice and bright.

00:03:56.733 --> 00:03:57.733
Now I'm going to move on to curling my eyelashes.

00:03:57.733 --> 00:04:02.249
This is extremely important because if your
lashes stand outward, they'll tend to hit

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:04.219
the rim of your frames are you blink.

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.469
So you want to curl them upwards so you don't
get that problem.

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:12.549
If you're a glasses wearer, you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.880
Now taking a mascara that's a volumizing formula
versus a lengthening one, I'm just gonna wiggle

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:26.530
that along my lashes so they look nice and
full.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:33.030
I'm also gonna put a teeny tiny bit on my
lower lashes but only on the outward ones.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.120
Next, I'm going to take a concealer that's
a couple shades lighter than my natural skin

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.900
tone and a flat liner brush and I'm gonna
run that along my eyebrow and above it.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.690
This really, really defines your eyebrow and
gives it a good shape and really frames your

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.690
face.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.440
This makes sure your eyes don't disappear
behind your glasses.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.400
Alright, onto skin.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:01.100
So, now you want to make sure that your face
is matte as possible so that your glasses

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.810
aren't sliding around on your face.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.400
So I'm just taking an oil blotting sheet and
I'm just blotting my skin.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.680
Oooh, yuck!

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.840
Next, I'm gonna apply my liquid concealer.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.540
I'm gonna put this under my eyes because you
want to make sure that your eyes are nice

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.650
and bright and also on any marks on your face
which of course is on the bridge of my nose.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.170
So I'm just gonna put that on my skin and
I use my finger to blend it out.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:32.810
It just melts it onto the skin and makes it
look nice and natural.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.552
You then want to put your glasses on and make
sure that your concealer isn't where your

00:05:35.552 --> 00:05:36.552
glasses sit.

00:05:36.552 --> 00:05:38.900
This gets kind of gunky if it is.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.260
Next taking a mineral foundation, I'm gonna
buff this onto my skin.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.120
I like using a mineral foundation versus a
liquid foundation because again if you have

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.960
any type of liquid or anything sitting underneath
your glasses, it tends to get slippery and

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.720
gunky and we don't want that.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.470
Now to add definition back into my face, I'm
taking this brush, which is a pointed contouring

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:04.190
brush and my bronzer and I'm going to contour
into the hollows of my cheeks.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.840
I'm also going to run this color along the
temples of my forehead, and of course I'm

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.840
going to do the same on the other side.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.900
Now to make sure that these lines aren't too
harsh I'm just taking that kabuki brush and

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.700
blending over the bronzer.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.610
Taking a matte blush because there's so much
shimmer going on on our eyes, I'm just gonna

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.610
apply this onto my cheeks.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:30.980
Phew, ok I'm gonna put my glasses back on
because now I don't need them off.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.220
And I'm gonna apply my lips, which I'm using
this color from Revlon in"Coquette" which

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.080
is a nice pink color.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.200
This goes well with the black frames.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.270
Okey-Dokey so that's it.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.890
That's my natural makeup look for glasses.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.450
This goes well with both black frames and
brown frames, which I'm modeling here.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:55.190
