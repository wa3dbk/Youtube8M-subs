00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.020
"I just wanna watch app all night, and now
you have me throwing chum in the water?

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.360
You Jerk."

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.710
[French accent] Ah, here we have the humble
sheep.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.380
Watch, as the predator approaches, we see
nature at work.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.380
LAZERRRSSSSSSS.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.339
In Color Sheep you play Sir Woolson, who must
change his color in order to blast the flesh

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:29.880
off of wolves.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.000
This game becomes really difficult as you
have to quickly blend colors together to match

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.079
the incoming enemies in order to fire a blast.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.969
The lasers are the fleecet of their problems
though because Sir Woolson can also get insane

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.769
power-ups.

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.670
With a lot of power could come some HueBrix,
a really fun puzzle game by Yellow Monkey

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.670
Studios.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.230
The grid needs to be filled completely with
the different colored brix, but what makes

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.489
this game really fun is the variety of modifiers.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.789
There are ones that teleport your line, ones
that add more or less blocks, and ones that

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.570
force you to go into pre-determined directions.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.820
But nothing will ever be as challenging as
Backflip Madness, one of the most frustratingly

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.220
difficult games I've ever played.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.560
There is one button.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.000
Only one freaking button, but Backflip Madness
don't care.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.730
Backflip Madness don't take nothin' from nobody.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.910
I'm fairly certain that doing a backflip off
of a shipping container and over some oil

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.820
drums would be easier in real life.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.590
However, this game is incredibly fun and addictive
if only because you keep trying again and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.900
again to land that elusive perfect back flip.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.810
But if you can't, let out your frustration
by blowing zombies away in Dead on Arrival.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.710
This top-down shooter has you killing your
way through an undead-filled hospital.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.170
If you've played Call of Duty Zombies then
this game will feel really familiar.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.090
The more you annihilate, the more cash you
get to buy a better weapon off the wall, or

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.490
to open new areas.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.700
You even have to repair broken down barricades.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:03.930
What makes Dead on Arrival really cool is
the graphic novel styled cut scenes.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.000
But instead of painting the walls arterial
red with a shotgun, use PhotoViva.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.580
This image editing app allows you to do basic
photo correction, but its coolest feature

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.580
is the brushes.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.440
You can paint over your images with different
brush types at different angles, and choose

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:27.580
what colors you want to pick up on so you
can create images like this:

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.550
Then test your memory with Trid.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.590
Recreate the patterns quickly before you run
out of time.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.960
It seems easy enough until the board you're
suppose to replicate starts to rotate and

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.960
turn.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.860
But for something really infectious there's
Sporos.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.420
In this awesome cellular puzzle game, you
have to place these Sporos across all of the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.960
cells in the level.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.030
The lines in the Sporos tell you which direction
it will spread, and you have to experiment

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.780
with different placements to find the most
effective route for infection.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.569
But instead of synthesizing and sequencing
scientifically, do it musically with Nanoloop,

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.200
a powerful music creation tool that is also
available for your Game Boy.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.420
It has a sampler, sequencer, synth, and you
can modulate and manipulate to your heart's

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.570
content to create incredibly full-sounding
tunes.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:17.610
You can also share project files across Android
and iPhone to create something like this:

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:27.180
Evac HD is the rave version of Pac-Man, but
in a good way.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.901
You collect dots and avoid enemies that chase
you, but instead of just running from them,

00:03:30.901 --> 00:03:35.380
you can hide from them, create traps, or just
crush them.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.370
Just be careful what path you take because
a wrong move might release swarms of villains

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.180
that ultimately lead to your demise.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.760
But instead of running from your fears, face
them head on in this episode's app of the

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.760
week: Year Walk.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.490
Year Walk is a beautiful, engaging, and creepy
adventure game.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.770
The main focus of the game is puzzles and
exploration with a heavy dose of Swedish folk

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.770
lore.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.290
The premise is that you are on a vision quest,
or, as the ancient Swedes called it, a Year

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.270
Walk, which, according to legend, if successful,
would allow you to see the future.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.000
But in order to see the future, you have to
brave the woods and the many creatures it

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
holds.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.490
To add to the experience, there is also a
free companion app that gives you the history

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:21.930
behind the creatures and lore you encounter
in the game.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.680
Links and prices can be found in the description
below.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.250
I'm Jake and, as always, thanks for watching.
