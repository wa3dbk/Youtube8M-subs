00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.500
This first technique is called saisa mai.
Saisa is this traditional seated position

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.390
that I'm in here with my legs underneath me.
And my mai means forward. So, essentially

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.529
I've got an opponent right in front of me,
perhaps negotiations have gone awry, and I

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:24.519
need to defend myself or maybe I have an order
from my lord to do something such as move

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.060
forward in negotiations, maybe a little bit
more aggressively. First I'll demonstrate

00:00:29.060 --> 00:01:03.089
it and then I'll walk through and show each
of the pieces.

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.689
So essentially what we're doing, again I've
got an opponent in front, it looks like he's

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:13.450
going to draw his sword. As that happens I'm
going to grab my sword, bring my knees together,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.740
come up on my haunches, come forward. Never
want to lean back, I want to come forward,

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.910
have my energy moving towards him. I'm going
to draw the sword straight out this way, almost

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.409
as if I'm going to hit him with the skagashia.
At the last instant, I'm going to saia, and

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.119
cut all the way across. I want to aim for
the eyes, because when I'm very nervous it

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.460
will tend to drop, and actually I want to
get his peck. That way he can't use his sword.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.420
I'm going to cut all the way across. Not too
far, I want to keep it in here, so in case

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.369
he decides to move I can still lean forward
and stab. From this position, I'll bring it

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.771
over the top, grab the sword, and make a pretty
major cut--going to cut all the way down.

00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:58.560
Want to finish about one fist away from my
knee, we're going to turn the blade, pause

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.659
a little bit, make sure that he's not moving,
allow some of the blood to drip off, and then

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.320
we're going to turn always putting my hand
back on my saia when I'm doing one handed

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.760
work. From here, I just follow the curve of
the blade. It goes all the way up until my

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.260
shoulder and my arm becomes in line with my
shoulder, at which point I'm going to do a

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.910
salute, I'm going to come up, cut straight
down. My feet are together, okay, kind of

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.980
making a V. Knees are still bent so I've got
some cushion. This comes down and we finish.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.340
It's going to be out just a little bit. Again,
because he's down there, just in case I need

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.599
to lean in. From this position I'm going to
draw my right foot back, leaving the blade

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.959
at that same angle. Again, pausing, making
sure that he's not coming back up. Once I'm

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.330
pretty sure, then I'll bring it to here, draw
the saia back, put the blade away. As I'm

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.110
placing this down, or putting the sword back
in, I'm going to drop my knee. That's called

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.489
noto. Noto means to, again, encase the blade.
Bring this all the way in, thumb comes over

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.390
the top. Make sure it doesn't come forward.
And I put my hand over the top again, covering

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.050
everything, making sure that you can't see
anything. The reason I would hold this is,

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.510
again, I want to make sure he's done. He comes
back up, I can just bring this up and stab.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.030
Probably not a likely thing after waiting
that long, but just in case. So once we're

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.569
here in this position, and we're pretty secure
that he's not coming back up, we're going

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.390
to again go back to the same standing position,
feet at ninety degrees making a V. We're going

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.900
to bring this back to our center, always having
the tsuba right in front of our belly button.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.650
We're going to put our hand down, walk back
the three steps, and then finish.
