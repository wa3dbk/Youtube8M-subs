How to get rid of fleas naturally.
Hi, this is Coreen from Capn America Projects.

00:00:03.472 --> 00:00:10.472
And I just want to show you a natural remedy
to fleas. It is called diatomaceous earth.

00:00:12.232 --> 00:00:19.232
It is made up of little tiny sea shells and
different sedimentation from the ocean. What

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:27.841
happens is you apply it to your pet and it
has little itty bitty tiny sharp edges that

00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:37.032
aren't harmful to a larger animal or a person
or anybody except for the fleas. The fleas

00:00:41.112 --> 00:00:48.112
crawl through the diatomaceous earth and they
get tiny cuts on them and since the substance

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:55.782
is so dry already it acts to suck out all
their water and dehydrate them so they die.

00:00:56.662 --> 00:01:03.662
And this also happens when their little babies
are born. So this is a great way to control

00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:10.951
fleas but not have to pay large amount of
money, every three months for the flea control

00:01:13.682 --> 00:01:20.682
that is chemical, possibly harmful to the
pet. Some pets have bad reactions to these

00:01:22.612 --> 00:01:29.612
medicines. And it just costs way too much
money. What this costs is for a box of diatomaceous

00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:38.631
earth it costs 15 dollars. So this is highly
recommended by me. So I will just show you

00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:46.591
how I am going to apply it and send the little
pet on their way. So I got a little bit of

00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:54.631
food to distract the little pet while I apply
the diatomaceous earth. And see its a bunny!

00:01:56.081 --> 00:02:03.081
because the earth can be used on any type
of small animal whether a dog or a kitty cat

00:02:05.842 --> 00:02:12.842
or even a rabbit it can be used on. So you
just sprinkle it on liberally and then just

00:02:13.712 --> 00:02:20.712
try to rub it in to the coat of the animal.
This is Ziggy. I don't know if Ziggy knows

00:02:30.492 --> 00:02:37.492
how to take this. He hasn't had this applied
to him before but I noticed that he does have

00:02:41.592 --> 00:02:48.592
fleas. So I am just rubbing it every which
way I can. Try not to get it in the eyes of

00:02:50.062 --> 00:02:57.062
your animal because it would sting. Now I'm
trying to rub it on to his tummy. And I will

00:03:09.032 --> 00:03:16.032
try to get it on all his hopping legs. And
you can even apply this to the carpet or pet

00:03:40.072 --> 00:03:47.072
bedding and then vacuum it up about an hour
later. This is a good remedy if you already

00:03:47.422 --> 00:03:54.422
have fleas in your home. This should last
Ziggy about two weeks and then we will need

00:03:55.722 --> 00:04:02.722
to reapply it to make sure that we got all
of the fleas off. Ok that's all. Thanks for

00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:49.781
watching!
