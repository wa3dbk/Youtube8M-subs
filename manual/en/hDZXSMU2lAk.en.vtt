00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.280
Yeah!... Time to brush!
Why do we brush?

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.039
We brush to remove plaque and stay clean.
What's plaque?

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:19.449
Plaque is yucky stuff that can stick to teeth.
Plaque is bad because it's full of nasty

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:26.449
germs. These germs can hurt teeth by making
little holes called cavities. Plaque and cavities

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.730
make teeth weaker. That's why it's super
important to brush all the plaque off every

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.730
day. To keep healthy teeth we have to brush
for 2 minutes every morning and 2 minutes

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.460
every night before bed! It's really important
to brush your teeth the RIGHT WAY! First make

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.410
sure to use a special kid's toothbrush when
you brush. Kid's brushes fit little mouths

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.410
and have soft bristles. Put a little dot (about
the size of a pea) of fluoride toothpaste

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.060
on your brush. Moms have to help babies brush
their teeth and babies can't use fluoride

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.020
toothpaste. You have to be able to spit to
use fluoride! Once you have the toothpaste

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.510
on your toothbrush...open your mouth wide!
Start with the teeth in the back of your mouth

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.840
and brush in little circles. Work your way
to the teeth in the front of your mouth and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.280
don't forget to brush the gums! Move the
brush back and forth gently in short strokes.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.270
Brush the top, front, and back sides of each
tooth. Make sure you get the inside of all

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.920
the teeth. When you're done be sure to spit
out all the toothpaste. Don't swallow the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.920
toothpaste...it will upset your tummy. When
you're done brushing it's time to floss.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.009
Flossing can help remove food and plaque from
in between teeth and along the gum line. Parents

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.040
should start flossing their children's teeth
as soon as they have two teeth that touch

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.979
and they should floss twice a week. When you
floss, break off about 18 inches of floss.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.860
Wind the floss around your pointer finger.
Hold the floss tightly between your thumbs

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.459
and fingers. Guide the floss between your
teeth using a gentle rubbing motion. Never

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.059
snap the floss into your gums. When the floss
reaches the gum line, curve it into a C shape

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:29.489
against one tooth. Hold the floss tightly
against the tooth. Gently rub the side of

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.510
the tooth, moving the floss away from the
gum with an upward motion. By the time you're

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.309
7 or so, you should be flossing every night
at bedtime with your mom and dad's supervision.

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:44.099
One other way we can help keep teeth clean
and healthy is by eating and drinking healthy

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.359
foods. Eating healthy foods for breakfast,
lunch and dinner is the best way to keep your

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:56.499
teeth and whole body in good shape. If you're
hungry and want a snack, try foods like fruit,

00:02:56.499 --> 00:03:03.499
raw veggies and low-fat cheese. Stay away
from sugary soda and sweets. If you're thirsty

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:11.209
drink water or low-fat milk. If you brush,
floss and eat right you'll have a beautiful

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:20.459
smile for your entire life! Find a My Kid's
