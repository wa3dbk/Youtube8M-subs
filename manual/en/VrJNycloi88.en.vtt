00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:10.933
Organisms that can live longer than
any other creatures on Earth, the PLANTS

00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.866
The tactic that plants choose...

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:26.866
"Use messengers!"

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:38.266
Messengers for the plants

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:45.366
After surviving cold winter,

00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:52.400
they are ready to sprout.

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:59.633
The first buds of spring
come into the world.

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:08.933
Jeffersonia dubia,
whose flowers appear before the leaves.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.400
Its flowers are relatively huge
compared to its body size.

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:25.133
After the flowers wither, ovaries grow

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:31.233
and then the buds of Jeffersonia dubia
is full of seeds.

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:43.800
The seeds ripen gradually.

00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:50.166
Jeffersonia dubia has a tactic
to disperse its seeds as far as possible.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.533
"Use messengers!"

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.633
Sweet fat globules
that stick onto the seeds tempt ants.

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:13.066
Holding the seeds,

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:18.166
ants move to faraway places
where the plant can't go.

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:21.333
They are messengers.

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:28.333
Once the food for ants
is delivered to their home safely,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.866
they eat only sweet honey
and throw away the seeds.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.233
While transferring,
the seeds drops sparsely.

00:02:49.433 --> 00:02:53.800
And Jeffersonia dubia sprouts
again at the very place.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:03.366
As if ants jump from place to place
the flowers blossom sparsely.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.833
Jeffersonia dubia

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.566
This plant spreads its offspring
as far as the messengers move.

00:03:23.933 --> 00:03:26.200
"Although the plants always
live in the same place,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.766
they have the wisdom to reproduce
by using animals that move diligently."

00:03:31.766 --> 00:03:37.033
