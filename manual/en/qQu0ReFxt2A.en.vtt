00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.799
This is Anthony. I'm going to talk about becoming
a Corbis photographer. Corbis is, essentially,

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:12.440
a stock agency, and it's an agency where you
could get hired on for assignments and you

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.410
could essentially almost freelance. And you
can make a living at doing this, but it is

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.180
not an easy way to make a living at being
a photographer. But you can do it, and there

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.230
are other agencies out there other than Corbis,
and they're all upstanding, and the harder

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.230
you work, the more money you will make. But
this is a book that I like to use that's called

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.460
the Photographer's Market. Every year, they
come out with one. This is a great resource

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.640
to just start with to look at ways that you
can make money with your photography. Now,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.289
doing stock photography, again, I keep repeating
myself, I will repeat it again and again:

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.090
it's not easy. When people buy a stock photo...buy
stock photography, they're buying an image

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.320
that you made so that they can sell something,
and they're going to use your image to market

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.300
it. So one of the first things that you really
want to think about is: "Well, is someone

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.070
going to steal my image, or how are they going
to use my image?" I used to joke around with

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.150
some of my colleagues that you almost needed
a law degree in order to really understand

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.050
the legalese behind an image. And it can get
quite complicated. First thing I always try

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.700
to do is get a model release or make sure
the location that I'm shooting in is okay

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.350
for me to shoot in, thus, to sell my image.
If all those requirements aren't met, there's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.810
really nothing I can do. And not that those
requirements are extremely hard to get met,

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.430
but they're something that I want to think
about. The other thing that happens when you

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.950
decide you want to work for an agency like
Corbis is: "How do I approach them? Are they

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.790
going to look at my work and decide, 'Oh,
yeah, we want to hire Anthony or we would

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.200
like to hire you.'?" So I have to get together
a portfolio, and I have to professionally

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.740
approach these people because they're a corporation
 -- they're huge -- and try to entice them

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.470
to want to look at my work, or what makes
my work different? And that is probably one

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.350
of the easiest things to get right through
to your head right away is that if I have

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.840
a look or I have subject matter that no other
photographer has, chances of you selling your

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.700
images and paying the bills are pretty good.
But to do that, it's pretty hard. So those

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.041
are the factors that I always add in. There
are lots of other stock agencies out there.

00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:37.910
There are some really easy...there's iPhoto.
A lot of friends that I have love doing iPhoto,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.140
where if they have a spare day in their week,
they'll shoot, literally, thousands of images

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.760
a day. And it could be anything from a baby
rattle to a bottle of milk, and they'll just

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.560
sit in their studios and they'll think of
ways to light and to shoot these items. Now,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.390
that's not really for me, but for other people,
they do it, and they make some money at it.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.069
And it's really a great way to learn about
photography as well.
