00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.509
Today on our 2012 Chevy Silverado were going
to install the Husky liners custom molded

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.290
mud flaps part #: hl56791.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.179
This set is for the front axle.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.750
Towards installation well be removing the
old fastener.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.220
For our first step weve gone away and raised
the vehicle and removed the wheel.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.820
This will make it much easier to install our
mud flap.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.599
Weve got two screws here that hold the wheel
well to the sheet metal and one push pin fastener

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.630
that will be removed.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.789
Lets go ahead and start there with the push
pin fastener.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.390
Well simply pry the center out and then we
can remove the whole fastener.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.820
This fastener will be removed and will not
be reinstalled.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.140
The same for the two screw fasteners here
along the wheel well.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:01:58.270
We will have new fasteners for each one of

00:01:58.270 --> 00:03:48.329
these locations.
