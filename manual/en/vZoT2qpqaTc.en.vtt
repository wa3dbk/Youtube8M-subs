00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.646
(exciting, climactic music)

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:11.512
- Today we're taking a walk on the wild side

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:14.171
at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park.

00:00:13.982 --> 00:00:15.032
Let's go!

00:00:15.032 --> 00:00:20.005
(tribal drum music)

00:00:20.902 --> 00:00:22.337
Wow, this is a big place!

00:00:22.337 --> 00:00:26.215
They have over 3500 rare and exotic animals here.

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:29.346
What makes this park unique is

00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:31.204
that the animals get to roam around freely

00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:32.959
in their vast (drowned out by drums).

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:36.994
^(tribal drum music)

00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:39.596
Hi.

00:00:39.596 --> 00:00:42.157
Oh, oh they're so cute!

00:00:42.157 --> 00:00:45.460
I just pet a rhino but it was cool.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.481
It was cool to feel it.

00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:47.751
They're like dinosaurs.

00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:50.336
(tribal drum music)

00:00:50.336 --> 00:00:54.203
I'm the same size as a baby giraffe, five feet tall.

00:00:56.275 --> 00:00:57.763
Oh, look at that tongue!

00:00:57.763 --> 00:01:02.745
(tribal drum music)

00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:04.470
- On the Safari Tour we've got to see

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.134
all sorts of giraffes,

00:01:06.134 --> 00:01:08.364
and free (drowned out by drums) with species,

00:01:08.364 --> 00:01:11.441
and antelope, and all sorts of other animals

00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:13.159
that were just really cool,

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.670
and you never get to see them up that close

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.106
anywhere else in the zoo.

00:01:17.106 --> 00:01:18.348
It's just so awesome!

00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:23.199
(tribal drum music)

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:25.737
- In just a couple of minutes,

00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:28.346
we'll see the cheetah racing down this path

00:01:28.346 --> 00:01:30.694
up to 70 miles an hour.

00:01:30.694 --> 00:01:35.001
(tribal drum music)

00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:41.468
[Zoo Patrons] Whoa!
(whistle blows)

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:46.044
(tribal drum music)

00:01:46.044 --> 00:01:47.548
- I had a really good day today.

00:01:47.548 --> 00:01:49.892
I got to spend some time with the wildlife,

00:01:49.892 --> 00:01:52.191
and I really feel like I got to travel

00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:54.512
to the African Serengeti

00:01:54.512 --> 00:01:57.845
or the endless expanses of the Asian Plains.

00:01:57.845 --> 00:01:59.784
What an incredible day!

00:01:59.784 --> 00:02:04.295
