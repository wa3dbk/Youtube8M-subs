00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.304
- [Voiceover] When I podcast
or record voiceovers,

00:00:02.304 --> 00:00:04.348
I use a Shure SM7B Microphone

00:00:04.348 --> 00:00:08.179
into a Scarlett Focusrite 18i8.

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:09.932
But recently I wanted to get more gain

00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:13.566
and processing on it before
going into Adobe Audition.

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.901
After some research, I landed on

00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:19.901
the DBX 286S Microphone
Preamp and Processor.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.865
In this video I'm going to
review it and walk through

00:00:22.865 --> 00:00:24.526
what cables you need to use it,

00:00:24.526 --> 00:00:26.534
what each of the dials on it do,

00:00:26.534 --> 00:00:28.160
what to set them all to,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.701
and any pros and cons I've
seen while using this.

00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:33.036
Let's start on the back.

00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:34.963
First, you have the AC power plug.

00:00:34.963 --> 00:00:36.588
But no on-off switch.

00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:39.212
So if you plug this in, it's always up.

00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:42.585
Then there are three
input and output options.

00:00:42.585 --> 00:00:46.764
I use a regular XLR cable
to go from my Shure SM7B

00:00:46.764 --> 00:00:50.919
to the mic input on my DBX 286S.

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:53.603
Then I use a three-foot XLR male

00:00:53.603 --> 00:00:57.259
to quarter-inch TRS male cable

00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:00.731
to go from the line output
jack on the DBX 286S

00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:04.899
to an XLR input on my Focusrite 18i8.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.778
There's also a line input
jack and an insert jack

00:01:07.778 --> 00:01:11.830
that you'd use for an effects
loop or a separate mic preamp.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.418
But remember, you only have
one output on this device.

00:01:15.418 --> 00:01:17.159
On the front, you'll want
to move from left to right

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.924
as you set this up, so let's start with

00:01:18.924 --> 00:01:20.836
the mic preamp section.

00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:22.994
For the gain knob,
talking to your microphone

00:01:22.994 --> 00:01:25.260
or play whatever other
input device you're using,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.801
like a guitar, and watch the
lights while you turn the knob

00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:31.808
until you're consistently
hitting the negative-10 level.

00:01:31.808 --> 00:01:33.003
You don't really wanna hit zero

00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:35.267
and you definitely don't want to hit clip.

00:01:35.267 --> 00:01:36.717
For the Shure SM7B,

00:01:36.717 --> 00:01:39.677
I have my gain set up
pretty much all the way.

00:01:39.677 --> 00:01:41.316
For the 48-volt power button,

00:01:41.316 --> 00:01:42.605
if you don't see any levels,

00:01:42.605 --> 00:01:45.066
it's probably because
you're using a condenser mic

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:46.934
that needs phantom power,

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:48.607
so be sure to turn this on.

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:50.395
For my dynamic mic, I don't need this,

00:01:50.395 --> 00:01:52.032
so I have it set to off.

00:01:52.032 --> 00:01:54.190
For the 80-Hertz bypass, I leave this off

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.537
because it gives you less dynamic range.

00:01:56.537 --> 00:01:59.045
But if you're in a room with
a hum below that frequency,

00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:00.949
experiment with turning it on.

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:04.002
Then you have the Process Bypass Button.

00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:05.372
If you turn this on,

00:02:05.372 --> 00:02:07.427
it essentially disables
everything to the right:

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:09.180
the compressor, the DSer,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.850
the enhancer, and gate
that we're about to set up.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.055
You'd really only use this
for making a comparison

00:02:15.055 --> 00:02:18.515
between the processed
and unprocessed settings,

00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:21.557
or using this only as a dedicated preamp.

00:02:21.557 --> 00:02:24.111
We'll leave it off and we'll move along.

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:26.609
So next up we have the compressor.

00:02:27.822 --> 00:02:30.864
In the compressor settings
you have drive and density.

00:02:30.864 --> 00:02:33.581
Drive determines the
gain reduction signal.

00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:36.576
Turning this clockwise will
increase the input signal,

00:02:36.576 --> 00:02:39.421
which increases the
amount of gain reduction.

00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:42.207
Turning it fully counterclockwise to off

00:02:42.207 --> 00:02:45.632
allows the compressor to pass
all signals unattenuated,

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:48.593
basically bypassing
this compressor section.

00:02:48.593 --> 00:02:50.845
The Density Knob controls the release time

00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:52.099
of the compressor.

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.058
At zero, you get a slow
release for smooth compression,

00:02:56.058 --> 00:03:00.609
which you'd use to gate out
noise present behind your vocals

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.559
or your acoustic instruments.

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:06.028
At 10, you get a fast, or tight release,

00:03:06.028 --> 00:03:09.070
which would be used on
a kick or snare drum.

00:03:09.807 --> 00:03:13.615
Next, you see the Gain
Reduction Meter in decibels.

00:03:13.615 --> 00:03:16.773
The Meter shows you the
true peak gain reduction

00:03:16.773 --> 00:03:17.702
in decibels.

00:03:17.702 --> 00:03:20.407
If the red LED at the far left lights up,

00:03:20.407 --> 00:03:23.298
no further gain reduction is available.

00:03:23.298 --> 00:03:25.747
Next, you have the DSer.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:27.129
This starts with frequency,

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.463
and this control sets
the high-pass frequency

00:03:29.463 --> 00:03:31.411
of the filter used in the DSer

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:34.513
to help remove the (hissing)
sound when talking.

00:03:34.513 --> 00:03:36.710
Four to eight kilohertz is best for

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.100
when you're doing vocal processing.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.062
Then you have threshold.

00:03:41.062 --> 00:03:44.313
The threshold sets the
sensitivity of the DSer

00:03:44.313 --> 00:03:48.072
as a percentage of the
average input level.

00:03:48.072 --> 00:03:53.072
LEDs light up for one DB
and six DB when active.

00:03:53.447 --> 00:03:56.879
Now onto the final
section with the enhancer.

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.919
The First Enhancer Knob is for
LF detail or low-frequency.

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.424
This Enhancer Control applies
a boost to 80 and 250 Hertz

00:04:06.424 --> 00:04:09.884
without making the bass
sound too muddy or boomy.

00:04:09.884 --> 00:04:12.763
The High-frequency Detail
Enhancer works to add definition

00:04:12.763 --> 00:04:16.594
and crispness to vocals,
guitars, and other instruments.

00:04:16.594 --> 00:04:18.928
It's basically a little bit of magic for

00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:21.389
making things sound better at the top end.

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.268
Then you have the Expander
and Gate Controls.

00:04:24.268 --> 00:04:26.985
First up is the Threshold
Control which determines

00:04:26.985 --> 00:04:30.155
when the Expander and
Gate will fully open up

00:04:30.155 --> 00:04:33.649
and allow the input signal
to pass through the output.

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:36.899
Turning it fully counterclockwise
turns it off completely.

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:38.700
I have mine at about 30 DB,

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.868
so anything below 30 isn't
passed through to the output

00:04:42.868 --> 00:04:45.666
and works as a bit of a noise gate.

00:04:45.666 --> 00:04:48.417
The LED lights show up
when it is on and off.

00:04:48.417 --> 00:04:51.761
So as I'm talking here, you
can see that it turns green.

00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:54.338
When I'm not talking, it turns red,

00:04:54.338 --> 00:04:57.601
and no signal is pushed
through the device.

00:04:57.601 --> 00:05:01.142
The Expansion Ratio Control
controls the expansion

00:05:01.142 --> 00:05:03.893
and attenuation applied
to the input signal

00:05:03.893 --> 00:05:06.064
once it's below the threshold we set.

00:05:06.064 --> 00:05:08.885
So if it's below 30 DBs,

00:05:08.885 --> 00:05:12.728
what's the ratio it's going
to apply to that signal?

00:05:12.728 --> 00:05:15.561
Lower thresholds, like
one to one or two to one,

00:05:15.561 --> 00:05:18.696
are better for slower
material like vocals.

00:05:18.696 --> 00:05:20.980
Higher thresholds up to 10 to one

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.668
are for very fast inputs, like percussion.

00:05:24.668 --> 00:05:26.537
So you've made it
through the whole Device,

00:05:26.537 --> 00:05:29.417
and I could have just told
you where I set all my levels,

00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:32.505
but unless you're using
the exact same equipment

00:05:32.505 --> 00:05:34.630
in the similar environment as me,

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.673
your settings are going
to be a little different,

00:05:36.673 --> 00:05:39.096
so I wanted to teach you
what each of these knobs

00:05:39.096 --> 00:05:41.009
and buttons do.

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:44.211
Now you can tweak the Device a
little bit to your own needs.

00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:46.559
To wrap up, I'm happy with the
results I'm getting from this

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:48.521
to boost the gain on my microphone

00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:52.155
plus add a simple
compressor gate and DSer.

00:05:52.155 --> 00:05:54.024
It would be great if you
could run multiple mics

00:05:54.024 --> 00:05:56.242
in and out using the same settings

00:05:56.242 --> 00:05:57.867
without having to buy an additional one

00:05:57.867 --> 00:06:00.317
for each microphone or
input you wanna use.

00:06:00.317 --> 00:06:02.357
But I understand the limitations

00:06:02.357 --> 00:06:04.833
technically and hardware-wise of that.

00:06:04.833 --> 00:06:06.621
And unless you're going to rack-mount this

00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:10.208
with other audio gear, it's
quite large to put on a desk

00:06:10.208 --> 00:06:12.704
or hide in a cabinet or drawer.

00:06:12.704 --> 00:06:14.632
If you have questions about this setup

00:06:14.632 --> 00:06:18.092

as well as setup tutorials
like the ones I made

00:06:24.268 --> 00:06:28.308
for the Focusrite Solo 2i2 and 18i8.

00:06:28.308 --> 00:06:30.224
And until next time, remember:
if you're gonna do it,

00:06:30.224 --> 00:06:32.724
might as well do it on video.
