Hi, I am Natalja from the Red Brick Cafi.
On behalf of Expert Village, we are going

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.153
to learn how to properly make popular gourmet
coffee house drinks. So now we are going to

00:00:11.153 --> 00:00:15.710
learn how to make hot chocolate. A lot of
places with actually make their hot chocolate

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:22.090
with water but I like using milk because it
just tastes way better. We are going to start

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:30.150
with putting some chocolate syrup in the cup.
Depending on what kind of chocolate your are

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.750
using, you need to figure out the ratio of
chocolate verses milk. I am using organic

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.260
cocoa Camino chocolate, so I am going to use
three pumps of chocolate for a small cut;

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:54.220
four pumps are for large. Then I am going
to pour some milk in my pitcher and steam

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.360
it by itself. The reason I am steaming it
without the chocolate so if I am making another

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.719
drink at the same time, that requires milk,
I can actually use that milk for that drink

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.409
too. Start steaming it. And I am going to
steam it like I am steaming it for a latte.

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:38.740
So you don't want a lot of foam. You want
it just to be hot liquid milk. When it starts

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.009
feeling hot on your hand when you are holding
under the pitcher, that is when you should

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:56.880
stop steaming. Next step is to pour the milk
into the glass. I like to just kind of pour

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:07.919
3/4 through and then really stir it well.
And depending on whether your customer wants

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:14.160
whipped cream or not, you want to put more
milk or less so you can actually fit the whipped

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:33.560
cream. Okay. Just pour a little more milk.
Then to top it off, put some whipped cream

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:43.340
on it. There you go, that's the hot chocolate.
