00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.799
Hello, I’m Ashley Howard from Scissorhands
and welcome to our “Fix it” videos.

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:14.349
They’re very simple, they’re very short,
but they will show you how you can fix everyday

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.030
problems that you come across in the salon.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.860
We’re going to show you the tools and the
techniques.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.460
Something else that hairdressers often ask
us about at Scissorhands is “How can we

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.780
take the weight away from the hair, or thin
the hair out without creating any marks at

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.910
all and without having to point cut.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.240
Let me show you on this lady’s hair how
we can do that.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:45.660
With the 30 tooth scissor there, we can simply
look at the area that you want to remove the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.390
weight from, cut into the hair and as I take
the scissor away you can see the hair has

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.670
been removed, we lightened the hair, but at
the same time, this is very important, as

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.620
you look at the haircut, there’s absolutely
no mark whatsoever in the haircut.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.512
This means that if you need to fix the issue
with too much weight in the hair, whether

00:01:06.512 --> 00:01:14.040
it’s at the back, the sides or the fringe,
you’ve now got the tool to do that job.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.219
Here’s another common issue that we come
across in salons: how can we create a beautiful

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.499
crisp fringe or sharp line in a haircut?

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:30.130
Well, we recommend use a longer blade and
a convex edge.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.719
This is going to give you a beautiful crisp
line much easier than using a shorter blade.

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.390
We’re going to show you how.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.909
So, David is now going to show you how to
cut that fringe.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.670
He’s going to take this normal section,
nothing difficult and nothing technical, but

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.939
the secret is he’s going to be using this
longer blade.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.609
In this case this is a 6 and a half inch.

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.819
Anything from a 6 inch length blade is fine.

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:05.380
He then takes the section and he’s able
to cut that very quickly and very easily into

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.450
a crisp line.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:16.090
So, you can see the finished result now, by
using a longer blade, 6 inches or longer even,

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.610
how David has managed to cut this beautiful
crisp neat line into Kim’s haircut.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:31.060
