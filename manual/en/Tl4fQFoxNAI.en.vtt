00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.600
NARRATOR: This video covers some basic tips

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.033
for using and installing a combination car seat

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:13.400
in the forward-facing position, with a harness,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.666
using a seat belt and tether.

00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.433
Before you begin,

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:20.366
read your instruction manual for your car seat.

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.700
Also, read your vehicle owner's manual

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.166
on child restraint systems

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.433
and how to lock your vehicle seat belt.

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:29.300
Because every car seat and vehicle is different,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.466
it's important to follow all instructions carefully.

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:35.233
Place the car seat in the back seat of your vehicle

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:38.833
in the forward-facing position.

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:42.066
Carefully thread the seat belt through the correct belt path.

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.966
Be careful not to have any twists.

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.633
Buckle the seat belt.

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:48.366
Lock the seat belt,

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.133
press down firmly on the car seat,

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.233
and tighten.

00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:55.033
The car seat should not move side to side or front to back

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:56.800
more than one inch.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.666
Connect the top tether strap found on top of the car seat

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.766
to the tether anchor and tighten.

00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.633
This step is very important,

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:07.500
as it limits forward movement in a crash.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.100
Properly position the harness on your child.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.533
Harness straps should lie flat, not twisted,

00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.866
and be placed through the slot

00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.766
that is at or above your child's shoulders.

00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:21.133
Buckle the harness

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.433
and the chest clip,

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:26.433
and tighten.

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:28.566
The harness is snug enough when you cannot pinch

00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.833
any extra material at the shoulder.

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:34.366
Place the chest clip at armpit level.

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:37.900
Your child is now secure and ready to go.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.766
Continue to use your combination car seat with a harness

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.700
for as long as possible.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.400
Once your child reaches the top height or weight limits

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.166
allowed by your car seat manufacturer,

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:50.533
it's time to travel in a booster.
