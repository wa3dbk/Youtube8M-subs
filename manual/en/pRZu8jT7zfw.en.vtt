Hey Undertoads, Amanda here.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.040
I'm just hanging out at the underwater base
and was playing this game that really made

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.130
me feel like I was playing an old school system
for a second.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:52.710
From 8 bit graphics to a matching soundtrack,
the indie game Volchaos on the Xbox like marketplace

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.969
is a great game that will have you throwing
your controller across the room just for missing

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.440
one gem.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.629
And when I say gems, yep I mean gems.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.670
The goal to this game truly is simple, don't
get hit by stuff, avoid lava by getting to

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.610
the finish quickly enough, and collect all
the gems you can while doing both the first

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.430
two goals.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.450
Well as easy as it sounds I would find myself
dying when the little perfectionist inside

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.710
of me screamed to get all the gems.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.420
This game is a very challenging old school
plat former and your little indiana jones

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.170
like man you play as is a precious sort of
comical character.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.689
He does not talk but you can get his humor
by the little images that are between loading

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.909
screens.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.800
Each level gets a little tougher and has more
interesting ways for you to get to the finish

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.700
line flag.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.689
The flag you use to finish kind of reminds
me of the old school Mario days of jumping

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.360
down one.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.130
This guy has just made bad investments where
he has all this debt and needs to get rich

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.060
or I guess, die trying?

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.950
The only thing they add in to make this game
more difficult are these little fire blobs

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.090
that come out and attack you.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.200
There are ones that just wiggle on the group
and move forward but there are also ones that

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.930
will jump towards you and those are trickier
to get past cause you have to time your jumps

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:36.810
correctly.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.010
The only downside to this old school game
was that if you moved your character too fast

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.040
while jumping to a ledge 9/10 times youâ€™ll
fall off the edge ultimately meeting your

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.230
demise.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.280
So I'd catch myself constantly hitting the
opposite direction I was initially jumped

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:00.840
in once I landed.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.850
All in all Volchaos was a pretty good game,
I enjoy playing some of the indie games on

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.610
my Xbox from time to time since usually I
play indie games on Steam.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:20.160
It's a nice way to switch it up every now
and then.
