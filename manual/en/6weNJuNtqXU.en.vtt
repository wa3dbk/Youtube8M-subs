hi everyone so we're looking at a samsung
galaxy note 2 it is sixty-four gigabyte

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.770
marble white version and i want to give
you glimpse of what to

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.299
expect when owning a

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.869
64GB samsung galaxy note 2

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.679
definitely you don't get the
entire sixty four gigabytes and

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.849
it looks like they do take a
little bit more for the system as

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:26.740
well

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.300
it looks like

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.960
the total space

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.230
reported here is

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.940
52.75 GB

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.180
total space is available to you

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.430
and doing

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.620
calculations

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.360
it look like the result about 4.48GB

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.050
for the system

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.010
so does 4.48GB
plus

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.230
52.75GB

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.660
equal 64GB

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.530
in any sense

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.290
i think it comes up a little short but
still

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.590
fifty gigabytes is a lot

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.820
a lot to work with and if you have
one of these

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.250
it's a 64GB micro

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.890
SDXC card

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.320
so this gives you an additional fifteen
nine point some gigabytes

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.470
so

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.310
in the end you end up with over 110GB
storage space

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.200
so that's definitely a lot to work
with what can you do with all that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.270
memories it's up to you but what i like
doing is I like

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.540
downloading videos on the internet

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.570
and then i watch them on
the go I'm here in Korea

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.980
and i ride the subway a lot and
it is a great place to catch up

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.010
on all the TV shows that you missed out

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.929
and with

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.960
110GB space

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.580
you could put all the
episodes you want to watch and maybe you

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.370
could

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.450
include an entire seasons of

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.340
your favorite shows like i have a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.299
entire nine seasons of seinfeld with me
and

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:17.489
all the episodes of the
office and all of the twilight zone

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.799
I like to just have those around and i
watch one of them

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.289
and it's kinda like chicken soup for the soul

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:27.019
kinda feels good just

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.459
know that you could watch any of those
episodes when you

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.629
have them with you

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.589
or if you just like carrying a large
amount of files it's a great way to do

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:37.359
it

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.889
so

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:46.189
anyway I put the 64GB
storage card and now it reports

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:51.219
additional 59.46GB storage space

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:52.389
and it is

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.229
mostly full

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:59.689
so that's what it feels
like a

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.179
owning a smartphone that has

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:03.939
almost 128

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.139
gigabytes

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:06.849
of storage space

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.159
that's all i want to show you
