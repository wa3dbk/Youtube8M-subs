00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.220
This has been the most complicated
project I've ever done.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.880
To get the whole installation on the building,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.040
there is a team of about 20 people working overnight.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.120
We've had a lot of things
thrown up in our paths,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.940
but it's all stations go now.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.740
I think I'm influenced
by absolutely everything.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.480
Like childhood fables, though they're not funny,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.900
there was always some sort of dark humor.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.540
I try and put that in my work.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.380
J.Crew came to me asked me to do something totally crazy

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.160
on the front of their new building on
Regent Street.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.440
I met with Jenna and she

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.510
pretty much wanted me to have a free
rein and present the most creative,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.500
imaginative ideas I could, and the taxi one
was her favorite.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.080
I just thought it would great to sort of lift the traffic up and turn the volume up and just make

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.920
Regent Street more Regent Street than it
actually is.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.080
We did look into using real taxis.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.620
They're too heavy it's too
dangerous, so in the end we took a cast

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.820
of one of the more vintage style ones
which is called the Fairway.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.880
I think the fairway taxis symbolize the '60s when London was very exciting.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.480
They're quite regal, they almost look like a
Rolls-Royce.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.140
I just chose truly ridiculous elements—

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.800
funny sort of English icons in there. There's a unicorn

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.560
and a lion, there's The Crown Jewels.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.560
I thought each taxi needs to have its own story.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.320
A different color, a different
theme, a different vibe.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.620
The bows and bones one

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.540
I think of a sort of a
burlesque woman.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.060
It's purple, which I don't like, but somehow I loved that one.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.560
To get the taxis actually up onto the building,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.530
which are— uh, very very high, it's
very dangerous and very difficult and we

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.912
have to do it in the middle of the night.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.540
When all the taxis are up, I hope it will look seamless and beautiful.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.340
We finished.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.760
The taxis went up the last
two nights, I have no idea what day is and it's raining.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.400
No I'm really happy.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.140
Looks like my old taxi, that does.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.860
Where's the drivers? There's no drivers in 'em.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.060
I would love people to look up and keep looking up till they walk past,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.080
and have a conversation with their friend and say

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.540
" Oh, I like that one,"  "No I like that one."

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.160
I hope that nobody'll see the blood sweat and tears that have gone on.
