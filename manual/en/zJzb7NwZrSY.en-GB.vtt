00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:12.559
BlackBerry Z30.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.780
Expected Q4 2013.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.849
The recently-released BlackBerry Z10 and Q10
devices have impressed reviewers and BlackBerry

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.890
fans but don't appear to have halted BlackBerry's
slide into irrelevance. So, the new BlackBerry

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.430
Z30 aims to make the new generation of devices
rather more competitive with class-leading

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.730
smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy S4.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.870
The Z30 is almost identical in every way to
the Z10 except that the display is bigger

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.120
and it has a faster processor and much larger
battery, but rather bizarrely the display

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.040
is a lower resolution than the Z10 and it
has a different aspect ratio.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:03.830
The 5" Super AMOLED panel has a resolution
of 720 x 1280 pixels and a 16:9 aspect ratio,

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:11.840
rather than the 4.2" 768 x 1280 pixel 15:9
pixel panel in the Z10. In fact, the screen

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.149
on the Z30 is a bit more standard and the
width is more consistent with the 720 x 720

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.030
pixel panel on the Q10.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.600
On the back is an 8 megapixel camera with
a two megapixel one on the front. Inside is

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.540
a dual-core 1.7GHz processor with 2GB of RAM
and 16GB of onboard flash memory. The Z30

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.369
is an LTE-capable device with NFC support
with all the usual smartphone features thrown

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:49.840
in such as WiFi and GPS. Inside is a pleasingly
big 2880 mAh battery.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.759
Because this is a BlackBerry device, then
it runs the BlackBerry OS - in this case the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.159
latest version 10.2. Although BlackBerry 10
is a good operating system which strikes an

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.740
interesting balance between traditional design
and modernity, it is unlikely to drag people

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.619
away from other platforms.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.940
For a flagship device, the Z30 is rather modest.
If you compare it with the Galaxy S4 then

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.450
the Z30 is completely outclassed when it comes
to every hardware feature, although BlackBerry

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.420
10.2 comes with many useful messaging and
collaboration features as standard that rivals

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.970
do not. But the other key weakness with BlackBerry
is a lack of applications compared with iOS

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.670
and Android smartphones.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.830
BlackBerry say that the Z30 should start shipping
in certain markets later this month with a

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:50.900
wider scale rollout happening throughout the
fourth quarter of 2013.
