00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.563
Nuki &lt; Okay, let me and Roku present you
today's "Daigo episode".

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.100
(This is a story about Vanilla arcade SF4)

00:00:14.828 --> 00:00:16.428
Roku &lt; Okay.

00:00:17.836 --> 00:00:24.716
Nuki &lt; So called "ep.01".
Title is... "How Daigo returned to SF4."

00:00:25.706 --> 00:00:33.128
After we won 3S (in SBO '05),
Daigo had been away from fighting games.

00:00:33.948 --> 00:00:39.018
He was trying to be a pro Mahjong player.

00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:47.317
When Vanilla SF4 was announced for arcade,
People at Arcadia mag asked us some preview matches.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:57.099
So I called Daigo and went together.
Like "We'll have some moneys anyways."

00:00:58.447 --> 00:01:09.464
We played SF4 for an hour or two.
And we both thought it "Hella Boring".

00:01:10.107 --> 00:01:18.292
He played Sim and bodied my Chun whole times.
Then we talked about our impressions.

00:01:19.327 --> 00:01:26.982
I thought myself ...
"If he's gonna play SF4, I may join the bandwagon."

00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:32.577
You know, it was first SF to have own card system.
Roku &lt; I can understand it.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.324
Nuki &lt; So I asked Daigo,
"Tell me honestly. Are you gonna play SF again?".

00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:51.858
He said,
"No go. It's not worth my Ryu.
But the card system is refleshing."

00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:59.606
"Nuki must be familiar with this kind of stuff,
since you have VirtuaFighter experiences.
But for me, this card thing is new and tempting"

00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:08.778
"I can secretly play Sim or Rog at local arcade,
then keep 95ish win ratio anonymously."
... What a stingy bs he was.

00:02:09.472 --> 00:02:16.537
So I decided myself not to play SF4,
and never bothered it any more.

00:02:16.953 --> 00:02:21.375
Several days after SF4 was released,
I was happen to see its rankings.
Dude was there on the leader board.

00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:26.930
Yo! Mr. Umehara.
He was #1 of national rankings from the beginning!
Roku &lt; He had to forget what he had said before.

00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:31.418
Nuki &lt; He clearly said "Not worth playing my Ryu."
But shamelessly, he was there.
I called him like "Wait, WTF is happening?".

00:02:31.993 --> 00:02:39.068
I met him somewhere later and asked,
"How come you're playing SF4. Is it that fun?"

00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:59.876
He said "No. But I'm giving up Mahjong...
It took me 5 hours of playing to measure pros.
It'll be painful for me to carry on."

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:09.047
He had a job but looked for something to play.
Then SF4 came out to his sight.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.020
So, He tried it just for fun.
But fell in love with its card system.

00:03:15.367 --> 00:03:22.001
He had been keen about rankings.
Becoming 'Master', then 'Grandmaster'.
Got psyched to see what's next....

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:26.147
But nada!
He was really disappointed at it, lol.

00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:33.671
It's only "Ep.01".
So, let me stop here for today.
Anyway, that's how he returned to the scene.

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:44.793
Roku &lt; Though he said "not worth my Ryu"
Nuki &lt; Yea, he told me...
"Onuki, this game is not worth my Ryu."

00:03:45.465 --> 00:03:53.863
"But the card system looks interesting,
I might use Sim or Rog and win 95%."
or such....

00:03:54.572 --> 00:04:01.223
But you know....
he was obviously positioned as #1.
I found him on the mobile SF4.net.....

00:04:02.924 --> 00:04:09.157
I bet, I'm the only person
who know this "behind the scene".

00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:14.482
What shall I talk next time?
Next time if possible....

00:04:15.112 --> 00:04:21.886
Well, "Ep.02"!
"How Nuki reunited with Daigo" ....

00:04:22.808 --> 00:04:28.155
The title is....
"At Marugeya arcade in Ikebukuro."!!!
(See descriptions.)

00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:31.122
Don't miss it!!!!

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:39.406
I'd appreciate to those 600 viewers
joining our streaming.
Thanks everyone!!!

00:04:41.112 --> 00:04:51.064
I dunno when the "next time" is.
But it's nice to have a talk-show with you.
Roku &lt; Agreed! I want more stories.

00:04:52.018 --> 00:05:01.628
Nuki &lt; At first, I was going to talk about, um,
We'd publish these stories as a indie book.
... If demands are there.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:13.444
I'll even sing "Can't beat Daigo Umehara",
and pack it as a bonus CD.
(See description.)

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.915
It's gonna be an annoying book.
Roku &lt; Ahaha. I'd listen to your singing.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.585
Nuki &lt; I believe I'm the most suitable man to sing
"Can't beat Daigo Umehara".

00:05:25.002 --> 00:05:32.056
In fact, I couldn't beat him to death.
...That bastard was really really strong.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:39.171
Once again, next episode!
"At Marugeya arcade in Ikebukuro"!
See you next time!!!
