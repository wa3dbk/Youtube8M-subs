right okay elitism meteorologist for an
a_b_c_ affiliate in louisiana and

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.469
recently as she noticed that on their
face book page out one commenter made as

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.119
statement about her hair

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:17.470
now she is black and uh... she felt the
need to respond to that commenter

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.050
so first we read you on what the man
wrote to her here out

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.330
uh... black lady that does the news is a
very nice lady the only thing is she

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.550
needs to wear a waiver grow some more
hair i'm not sure if she is a cancer

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.350
patient but still it's not something
myself that i think looks good on t_v_

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.070
okay well thank you for informed opinion

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.490
so you like your hair the little of the
will

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.800
lestat suppose

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.100
well anne why do you even care about her
any forget that make part of it

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.640
ghetto life man

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.040
the war

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.070
so why why why what what do you try to
get and events for it's frustrating it s

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.590
and one everyone who is on television or
does it show gets it there always like

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.170
that

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.520
interest of the comments about your
parents and things of that will you know

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.679
that we should be focusing on something
else

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:09.780
but not wanna decided to politely
respond to that

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.850
uh... and she got fired for it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.580
mathematics but

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.829
i want to read you guys response because
i thought that it was thoughtful

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.990
it was nice and very patient it was much
more patient then

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.549
uh... what i would've written in
response to him

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:25.920
socio admit

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.619
and the black lady to which you are
referring

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.289
i'm sorry i don't like my ethnic air and
now i don't have cancer and a

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.179
non-smoking five point three one hundred
twenty one-pound out twenty five-mile a

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.340
week running thirty seven point five
year old women and i mean perfectly

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.450
healthy physical condition i'm very
proud of my african american ancestry

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.719
which includes my hair

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.080
for your edification traditionally our
here doesn't grow downward

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.100
it goes upward

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.990
many black women use strong
straightening agents in order to achieve

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.220
a more european great of hair that

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.840
is their choice

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.119
however in my case i don't find it
necessary how here if you happen to her

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.110
son

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.250
i find this outrageous i hope they got
rid of this

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.380
well woman obviously cause a transfer
trouble with proverbial rational

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.900
explanations

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.989
for it

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.779
but there's no right and then the guy
said again and then you really get a

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:17.259
sense of where he's coming via

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.309
he writes at this world has certain
standard

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:25.510
if you've come from a world of being
poor are you going to dress in rats

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.989
star center for white what for hair
prepare possible quite now he's trying

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.719
to say if you are on television that not
only a do you have to look as european

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:35.730
as possible

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.070
i'll be also have to be extremely
attractive look if you're not attractive

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.340
another television or i don't consider
you attractive enough for television you

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.780
don't deserve that job

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.310
right any goals for men and women but of
course it's much harsher when it comes

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.220
to females

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.870
uh... on television on shows so i have a
sperm is analyzing every single you know

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.100
strand of hair

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.129
on these interested separate
meteorologist

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.239
why

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.579
as if that isn't maddening enough
because this is some random dude

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.749
who is obviously very ignorant right

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:12.549
but what makes this story worth is the
fact that the a_b_c_ affiliate decided

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:13.430
to fire her

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.760
and the reason why they fired her is
because they allegedly had some sort of

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.359
work now they did they had a policy

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:20.809
that basically told them

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:22.710
how to react to these kinds of comments

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.170
and in the past she responded to comment
on the face book page and they told ur

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.660
don't do that ok uh... and they sent out
a company-wide email saying if you see

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.560
comments please refer to the special
person that we've selected

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.719
to respond to those comments for you

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.549
and she wanted to know that she wanted
to respond herself

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.290
now look she's famously services any
minute and i'd never got that memo

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.160
and it did have another stage of the sky
guy instead

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.610
well you do this miles per hour and was
a great program helped himself

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.219
but while the kids black

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.729
of contract it came out that you get the
sense that it's not that he's just

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:02.899
within it with us is attractive are not
he's upset the racial issue insurance

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:06.249
practices the program is open to
everyone i hope you don't look recently

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:07.220
that they were

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.489
happen to be blacks in that particular
simon right

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.199
that's a part of that

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:16.349
accommoda it's because a body she
violated a face book thing provisioning

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:20.860
the clinton all of our hey listen though
cause trouble right here day

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.770
they don't like how black you are to
suck it up

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.009
that that's what they're doing yeah and
i think that you know maybe she isn't

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.229
the most agreeable our employees that
they have and i'm not saying it's a bad

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.069
thing and say

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.330
you know maybe she's not an employee
that just like missus everything you say

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.150
she'll bring up

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.090
arguments may be on ways to make the
show that it maybe there's a second you

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.509
know one and they're just trying to find
reasons to get rid of her

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.379
because of this is the reason that you
get for getting rid of her there's

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:49.510
something else going on in that newsroom
that's incredibly weak sauce

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.099
you right maybe they don't like her for
a other reasons in there

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:57.270
using this is an excuse and it has
nothing to with racist fully possible

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.360
but if they did this pretty stupid
because it looks like you to have to do

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.410
with the race right or

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.479
it's an a minus a lab we don't want to
in eight hours after understand if he

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.580
runs a few moments of the races

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.110
we don't know why be so you can give you
all options there

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.320
one of the ways they might be

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.489
acting that way is to use his all are

00:05:18.489 --> 00:05:21.240
on the insist not react well to that

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.410
we have to cater to our audience

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.849
so if they make those comments

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:26.620
play yes i've been a
