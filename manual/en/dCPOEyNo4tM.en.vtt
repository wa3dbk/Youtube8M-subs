00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.320
Hello YouTube. This is my first vloggish kind of video.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.260
So, I'm a little nervous.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.020
Plus my whole family is downstairs and if they knew I was doing this they'd probably be laughing at me.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.800
Anyway, seeing as I'm totally bad at remembering things

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.700
I wrote everything down  like the organized good child that I am.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.760
Anyway, I shall read to you now.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.920
I don't know how many times people have come up to me and told me to go eat a sandwich.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.780
Seems nowadays that

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.060
women with my body type are bashed by the
media and really by everyone around them.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.790
The reason I making this video is because
I saw a picture on google images that said,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.480
Real women have curves.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.340
I didn't know what to think about this.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.540
Am I not a real woman?

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.440
When I was younger my friends used to chase me around the schoolyard chanting

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.520
'You're so skinny it's disgusting! You're so skinny it's disgusting!

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.440
I used to go home crying everyday.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.060
Sometimes people even told me that I had chicken legs.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.600
I was always so self conscious of my body when I was little

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.540
I was lanky and I was taller than most of the other kids.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.480
So these comments really did not help my self esteem

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.200
I've actually had people come up to me and ask me if I had an eating disorder.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.020
And it's like, I wouldn't go up to them and ask them

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.100
'Hey you're kind of fat of fat, do you eat too much?'

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.260
It's rude and inconsiderate to the persons feelings and

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.560
just really nobodies business anyway.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.320
Just to get the facts straight I don't have an eating disorder.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.920
I look like this because of genetics.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.940
Anyway, next point! Yes. What I was going

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.840
Yes.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.820
What I to say but I worded it wrong.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.580
Anyway-

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.080
I look like this because of genetics.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.840
My Nana looked like this when she was my age.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.560
My Mom looked like this when she was my age.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.120
It's all in DNA.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.260
Some people just aren't supposed to look
like this way

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.280
and really there's no reason that you should look this way.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.120
There's like- why?

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.380
Why is this the only way that's considered beautiful?

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.520
Like- This is beautiful but it's not the only kind of beautiful.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.040
Skinny I mean.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.830
People come in all shapes and sizes. Magazines and T.V. ads

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.160
may be overrun by a certain body type.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.020
Which is usually tall skinny and big
breasted.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.600
Yes, some girls may have eating disorders to look like that.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.380
But we should also remember that some people look like this not because of eating disorders

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.140
but because of their metabolism.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.300
People forget that this is a body type too

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.500
and it hurts when people
accuse us of being anorexic or bulimic.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.000
Even if we don't show it.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.180
What I think people need to realize is that

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.600
we shouldn't be hating on people who have the body type that we want.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.980
We should recognize that there's more than one body type

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.820
and more than one way to be beautiful.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.300
And we should love and be proud of the body that we have.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.340
Because beauty is more than skin deep

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.180
and there is more to a person

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.100
than their waist line, their cup size
or their hair.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.440
But at the same time we should not be glorifying a body type that isn't healthy for us.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.860
Being overweight hurts us just as much as being underweight does.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.520
We shouldn't be criticizing people because they are too fat or too skinny.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.260
We should be empowering people to have the body type that is healthy for them.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.820
And that's it! Yay, I'm done. Finally!
