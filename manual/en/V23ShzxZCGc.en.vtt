she believes that her dog is not dead
she still looking for it

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.339
but in fact the coyote dont this period

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.270
okay uh... look it probably about
anything they were wasted

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.179
first i missed the neighborhood dog did
this

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.149
i did notice that the name is daisy
right but it's a multi prove mammal

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.920
people i had not heard i'm not a dog as
a maltese poodle mix

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.760
that's a terrible name for the arts team
of people

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.080
he says anyone ever put any poppy hand
that name may nine i wouldn't want to

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.040
buy a dog you know multiple on my comp

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.040
is not a single clues that enough

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.280
uh... haley as i understand it so that
uh... all right now she devastated

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.620
look out on the back

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.300
okay because i found the story for

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.610
uh... because she would talk for a dog
who had a night of the darling feed your

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.479
dog stake in all the state

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.180
no dark

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.000
and you know if she if the dog reacted
poorly to someone she would not have

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.569
back in the house right

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:17.609
kilometers mental about that all by
delay the start was given to jessica

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:21.310
simpson by her ex-husband the cliche and
two thousand four unit

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.189
no was hurled it was like relaxed

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:25.900
you know

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.530
piece of me cliche

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.910
and plus of course as everyone else
doctor right keepin it real hit parade

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.450
uh... this was the one thing she can
latch onto and these days is with me

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.680
that's because the season

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.280
in your fee state

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.010
she'd gone anywhere hingham ma people
all over that house that they were right

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.400
there or day

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.210
so

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.790
uh... you know if she's not a human
being

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.319
so chat with him as all this into the
dollar she's there's so much about it

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.670
and then it cut but he comes out

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.939
look and we have had the same time the
baghdad had to be a funny moment meant

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.130
if that was on paid leave is no way we
stop laugh

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.670
date

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.569
i want to get all my go back on you and
i feel bad of course and i had a friend

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.580
who lost the dog was devastated by right

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.700
so i get in nine military have a friend
who is not a red white dog so all the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.099
time

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.349
well i got a call at priority it is
outside the sat so the only in the wrong

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.069
tree

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.619
but i think the reason i laugh at other
than the fact that that visuals kinda

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:28.339
funny

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:30.099
is

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.559
look the your you're being silly and i
i'd look at the an overseer time of

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:35.320
hurting

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.509
and mourning

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:42.819
it's like we can't have normal human
relations

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.780
and so we displaced

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.299
what's going on in our life

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.409
into these animals when and give it for
too much importance as it

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.749
and and the reason you do it jessica

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:55.619
and i know you're watching

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:56.939
is because

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.869
you think

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:02.979
he's here she is not gonna criticize

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:05.210
but is that the on became speed

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.620
you don't even know you know i'm sure it
likes you because you're you know great

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.409
to her right

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.249
but there's something dysfunctional
about that i don't think so i think i

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:16.599
think it taking a little too polite

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.219
identify look

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.560
i'm perfectly healthy person emotionally
ok have a boyfriend who loves me

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.849
i have family loves me i have zero you
know moshe leashes

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.359
uh... and that i have a until and really
don't uh... and i'm not to demand one

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.559
and pretty quick find umber

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.709
no and i get love from all over the
place

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.250
comes out they are right i don't know i
i i got him a lovable person sharply

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.419
lower debt i got voight

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:42.519
by

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.569
uh... access america

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.180
and i'm not certain my dog because she
provides this little like this level of

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.599
comfort and affection that you just
don't get anywhere else a dog is a man's

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.519
best friend they don't say that for no
reason like it it's civic the door can

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:58.969
say anything so we can

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:59.949
cross-examine

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.699
do you have a really dodi dot you know
to be vigorously freezing or who were

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:05.439
murdered yet like

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.879
affection is not always shown in words

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.159
okay now

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.409
now actions speak louder than words
adalah because they don't even know

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.699
looking anyway alright are you dont
scientists are some down-and-out and i

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:20.969
know they know their their owners and
and they do show affection identity and

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:25.089
i'm not being a hero and i know that you
and also let me uh... let me also say

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:29.099
this raising a dog and you and i think
this is so ridiculous but it's true

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.620
raising the dog from a puppy to you know
full down dot

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.250
is like a raising a child

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.869
you know it's it's not they're not
children denied human being

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:39.430
i guess that's what i'm trying to get

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.080
in may

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.310
i'm not trying to minimize what they are
but i know you guys are overstating what

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.520
they are

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.230
and so

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.410
and then the other part of it that
bothered me number one on long

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.219
the state

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:52.590
is that she's so devastated by

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.259
yeah

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.400
net no no no no no

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.100
in the old days here kids would you die
you know that means still today people

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.239
wanted to die you did say

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:04.999
you know what was their real tragedies
in the world man

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:07.509
there's a lot of tragedies in the world

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:08.720
you cannot

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.500
shutdown approaches like according to
our friends and she's shutting down

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.020
rather nuclear shut down at this point
right

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.930
because your dog i he just

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:17.690
it's now

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.509
but they are not vote for jessica sense
and in this particular case it's not

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.460
just the fact that her dog died you have
to keep in mind anisha airborne her

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.860
