00:00:07.513 --> 00:00:11.320
Today we’re going to talk about raspberry
varieties of the ever-bearing type, also known

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.240
as primo cane-fruiting raspberries. These
raspberries will bear a crop on the two-year

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.289
canes at a normal time in the summer, but
they’ll also bear a small crop in the fall

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.140
on the primo canes, or those first-year canes
with the green bark. One of the things you

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.720
need to look for with primo cane-fruiting
or ever-bearing raspberries is maturity date,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.421
because most of the ever-bearing varieties
won’t mature in time. They won’t ripen

00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:39.490
that fall crop in time for you to pick a good
crop, so you need to look for early-maturing

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.520
ever-bearing-type raspberries.
That really limits our selection. I’ve got

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.680
some of them here – not all the ones I would
recommend for this area, but some of the newer

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.930
ones you should be taking a look at that mature
nice and early.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.620
First on the list is Polana, a variety from
Poland that’s actually been with us for

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.870
quite a while. Polana is bred from good stock
in that one of its parents is Heritage. Heritage

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.689
is one of the better ever-bearing varieties
we have, but unfortunately it’s too late

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.350
for most of Maine. Unless you’re in the
southernmost part of Maine, such as Portland

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.060
and south, I wouldn’t recommend Heritage.
But Polana is considerably earlier than Heritage,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.970
by about two weeks. That means it’s going
to start ripening about the third or fourth

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.370
week of August depending on the year.
As you can see, the fruit size is a little

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.260
bit small. This is actually the summer crop,
so I’m not seeing as much potential as I

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.350
could. It has good color, but the flavor I
would rate as only fair. But at that time

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.010
of year it’s probably the only raspberry
in town, so you’re not going to get many

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.530
arguments about it. It still has pretty good
raspberry flavor. So that is Polana.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.420
This is a new one from the same program in
Poland, called Polka. This is a few days later

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.330
than Polana, but from what I’m seeing of
this, I like the fruit quality a little bit

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.280
better. It’s larger, firmer and has better
flavor. So this is for trial, but if you’re

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.010
interested in something a little bit later
 – say starting about the last week of August,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.440
first week of September – you may be interested
in trying Polka.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.450
A new variety from Great Britain is Joan J,
and this one looks very promising. You can

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.440
see already we’ve got good yields. This
is from the two-year canes, but the first-year

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.920
canes are also showing us very good yields,
very pretty fruit, good eating quality and

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.530
very early maturing. So I have a lot of hopes
for Joan J. I need a few more years with it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.250
to say it’s a great variety, but the early
innings say it’s looking awfully good. It

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.650
might be one to try if your nursery has it
available.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.160
Now one of the standards here in Maine is
Autumn Britten. This is actually a British

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.760
variety from Scotland. It matures fairly early,
about the first week of September, and has

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.630
large fruit, kind of a round shape with excellent
flavor. This is not a vigorous plant – it

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.590
will take a while for this plant to get established,
so you may want to plant it a little closer

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.209
than we see in typical recommendations. But
it will mature a nice, early crop of excellent-flavored

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.459
fruit and also does very well in high tunnel
situations.

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.760
Finally one that’s a little unusual, a yellow-fruited
variety called Anne. There’s another one

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.790
called Fall Gold, which is a little bit earlier.
Anne is a little bit late for Northern Maine

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.580
but should do well in the Mid-State and Southern
areas. Nice size, very pale yellow color,

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.720
attractive fruit, excellent flavor – this
is one of the best eating varieties you’re

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.870
going to have. The problem with yellow varieties
is if you’re trying to sell them, you have

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.970
a tough row to hoe because nobody really wants
yellow varieties. They think they’re ill,

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.580
they think they’re sick and they don’t
make a very attractive jam.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.660
However, if you’re growing these mostly
for yourself or you can do some good marketing

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.170
with pick-your-own, the flavor will sell people
on these. So it’s something to try. This

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.819
is a tall plant, not likely very winter hardy
if you’re trying to get two crops off of

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.700
it, but for just the primo cane crop this
one will serve very well.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.989
So remember, with your primo cane-fruiting
varieties, you’re looking for a little bit

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.200
of hardiness but mostly you’re looking for
early maturity. This is an exciting field

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.159
because right now there are a lot of new varieties
starting to show up with early maturing from

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.810
your ever-bearing or primo cane types. So
keep an eye on your nursery catalogues, and

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.780
of course, keep an eye on our recommendations
on the Cooperative Extension website.
