00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.920
Some believe that the complexity of life and
the universe can be explained by the possibility

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.360
that an alien race created it.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.660
But do you really believe that aliens have
the power to create the Earth,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.941
or how about something the size of the sun?

00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:23.609
Over 1 million Earths could fit inside the sun.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.780
The sun is also very hot.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.340
So, how would aliens go about putting the
sun together and constructing it?

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.460
How would they get close enough 
to the sun when building it,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.830
or move away from it quickly enough 
without dying after starting it up?

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.630
The conditions outside Earth in outer space
are, according to the evidence,

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.380
too hostile for life to exist.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.640
For example, prolonged exposure to the cosmic
rays in outer space can be fatal.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.780
Just the temperature extremes in outer space
would make almost any form

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.080
of life either too incredibly hot or too cold.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.960
There are also poisonous gases, deadly radiation,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.879
gigantic explosions, extreme gravitational
forces, and the lack of proper atmospheres

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.820
and chemical elements for life to exist.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.760
Yet, a large number of astronomers believe
that life evolved on Earth, and therefore

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.440
(according to them) it must have also evolved
on other planets in space.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.980
However, if this were true, many alien races on other planets, much older than our own, should exist.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.580
Some of them would be far more technologically
advanced than we are.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.100
As a result, they would have sent a radio
signal through space that we could pick up

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.200
or they would have reached us 
with their aircraft or robots.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.540
But we have never found any alien robots, any aliens, 
any alien aircraft, or any pieces of their aircraft.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.600
Here are some of the reported 
flying characteristics of UFOs.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.940
While in flight, UFOs will frequently change
size, color or shape.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.730
Multiple UFOs will merge into one UFO,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.980
and one UFO will instantly change 
into many UFOs.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.260
Many UFO witnesses have described these instant
changes to the size and shape of UFOs

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.380
by saying that the UFOs seemed as if they were alive.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.940
UFOs sometimes show up on photographs, 
but other times they do not.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.580
Most witnesses of UFOs do not report 
seeing an object or craft,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.980
but an unusual light moving 
around in the sky.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.240
Sometimes UFOs instantly appear and disappear
right in front of people

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.400
and will also pass right through the ground
or physical objects.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.340
This type of behavior means that UFOs could
not be from the material world,

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.730
but would have to be some kind of 
spiritual phenomenon.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.470
Based on the observed activity of UFOs, many of 
the world’s top UFO researchers no longer believe

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.500
that UFOs can be from the material world.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.520
Also, most of the so-called UFO abductees
can only “remember” their “experiences”

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.820
after being put under hypnosis,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.360
proving that their so called experiences 
with aliens were not real.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.940
These issues are covered 
in much more detail in my book

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.200
UFOs: Demonic Activity and Elaborate Hoaxes
Meant to Deceive Mankind.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.080
If ETs really existed, it wouldn’t take
them very long to discover what they needed

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.081
to know about Earthlings.

00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:20.901
As a consequence, they would have already
taken us over, destroyed us,

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:23.841
or revealed themselves clearly to humanity.

00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:29.461
The organization SETI (Search For Extraterrestrial
Intelligence) has been scanning the skies

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:32.429
for decades looking for intelligent life.

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:35.029
But they have never picked up even one signal

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:39.129
from outer space that would 
indicate an alien race exists.

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:44.340
Those searching for ETs have said that if
they did pick up even one complex signal,

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.320
it would prove that an intelligence 
must have produced it.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.799
But why don’t they apply the same standard
and employ the same thought process to DNA?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.960
If they did, they would realize that 
the complex information in DNA

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.600
proves that an intelligence put it there.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.020
Because whenever you find complex information,
it is always traced back to a mind.
