00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.870
To clean the rocks in your aquarium, mainly
the substrate of your aquarium is going to

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.120
be typically rocks, gravel, and you're going
to want to clean that on a regular basis.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.789
Every three or four weeks when you do your
good water change you want to siphon the rocks

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:20.789
in the aquarium.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.350
So, a siphon is basically something you'd
buy at a fish store.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.070
It has a gravel tube roughly two inches in
diameter, maybe eighteen to twenty-four inches

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.970
long, and that's connected to like a six to
eight foot length of half inch or three-quarter

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.680
inch flexible tubing.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.199
The tubing's going to go in a bucket, the
gravel tube goes in the aquarium, and you're

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:39.319
going to get a siphon going.

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:44.789
Once the siphon starts water is now siphoning
out of the tube into the hose into the bucket.

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.280
Be very mindful that the bucket doesn't overflow.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.079
I don't recommend siphoning directly into
a sink.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.269
You'll find some 50 foot pythons and stuff.

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.109
Those are good if you're very careful, but
if you suck up any gravel or sand it's going

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:00.620
to go right into your drain.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.159
And it's going to clog your drain and it's
going to result in an expensive plumbing bill.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.260
I like to see what I'm siphoning out of the
aquarium go right into a bucket so I have

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.810
good control.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.550
That being said when you're siphoning the
aquarium remove some of the decorations, and

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.960
just go nice and slowly through the sand bed.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.039
Do it in a zigzag pattern so that you can
see where you started and where you finished.

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.290
You don't want to just go haphazardly through
the gravel bed or you're not going to clean

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.290
efficiently.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.290
Kind of like vacuuming.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.290
You just don't go all over the floor.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.290
You start in one corner.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.509
You work your way to the other so you do the
entire perimeter.

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.820
You also don't want to go too fast because
you don't want all the waste to just get blown

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.820
into the water column.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.850
You want to trap all the waste into the siphon
tube so it all goes into your bucket.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.170
That's the goal, to remove a lot of the waste
that's in that gravel bed.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.100
And then after you've changed 15 to 20 percent
of the water you're going to replace that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.119
water with good, conditioned, filtered fresh
water of the same pH and same temperature

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.700
so you don't shock the system.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.460
The same rules apply to salt water.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.869
You just want to match the salinity and the
pH before you put that salt water back in

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:03.869
the aquarium.

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.280
With fine sands this video doesn't really
apply because we're talking about gravel,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.690
but it's the same principle.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.330
You'd want to siphon the sand like you would
the gravel, but you want to use a lot less

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.870
water volume, a lot less flow through the
siphon.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.220
Otherwise you'll suck all the sand out.
