Hey guys, we're Roxy and Victor from the band,
5senti2, and we're here with the renowned chefs,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.200
Jaime and Ramiro, from "La Casita Mexicana".

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.720
Today we're going to prepare some dishes from their new restaurant, Mexicano,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.500
that are absolutely delicious. Follow us! 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.680
Oh my dear Roxy! How are you? 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.400
Do you know what I'm going to have you make today? Let's see... 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.860
I'm going to have you make a 'guacamole al tequila'
- Mexicano and Jaime and Ramiro style. How does that sound?

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:42.420
I love it, I love it. I only know my grandma and mom's recipe, but
let's see what you're going to be showing us.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.680
We're going to be using first-class avocados,
which are very interesting.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.400
We have onions, pickled jalapeños, the carrots also,  

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.220
a little bit
of olive oil (which will help balance out

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.700
the flavors - because it's going to be spicy),
a pinch of oregano (that Tamaulipeco that

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.840
comes from the north of Mexico and is super
interesting), and what do you think this is?

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.200
Um, let me see... A little bit of jalapeño,
I knew that you would love it. I love chili peppers!

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.360
And of course a little bit of tequila - look that's tequila
blanco. Are you going to help me? Of course!

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.600
Well, you can start by giving me the ingredients.
First we have our avocados, remember that

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.700
these are Mexican avocados. We have to take
out the 'bone', and like I like to say, it's

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.080
supposed to make a noise as it drops. There
used to be people that said, 'No, I cut it

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.400
this way and that way, and I use a spoon to
scoop the squares neatly out.'

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.780
But do you know what's the best way to open an avocado and
know that it's ripe? Like this. 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.720
That's what I do! See?! You do know, of course! Do you
like it spicy or mild? I like it really spicy!

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.480
Can you start putting the carrots? Of course.
And the onion, just a little bit.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.920
This is where I like to add a little bit of the pickled
jalapeño juice - 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.540
 that's going to cut right in with the onions. Can you add a dash of
that olive oil? Of course!

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.200
See how easy it is to make this recipe? 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.420
Oregano is really
interesting - to get all of of the flavors of oregano

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.540
you always have to do this - see it's the magic of the kitchen. Like this.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.520
Look a little bit of sugar - but it's just a pinch. Oh,
some sugar, also? Yes. Oh, perfect. 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.100
You can be in charge of the salt, but since I'm superstitious, look, first I get the salt
and throw it.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.740
A little bit of salt here. Next we're
going to get a banana leaf, that is clean and washed.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.190
We can do it like this. It's because
presentation is everything, friends. It's everything!

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:01.340
And what we do with the same ingredients we used, you can arrange them on top.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.020
It ends up looking really cool.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.780
And you should always have fresh herbs in your kitchen.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.080
Like in this case, I like to decorate with a little bit of cilantro.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.860
Or there are some people that use a little bit of parsley.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.160
Ok, do you want us to try this?  How should we do this?

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.780
Yes! Yes! Yes!  Let's try a little bit please. Let's see.  

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.380
Let's try this delicious... Don't be afraid. O man, it's because this whole thing is coming on my spoon.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.860
Will you help me? I'll help you out. Okay, let's see. 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Mmmm...omg!

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.620
What do you think?

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.840
It's delicious, delicious.  

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.240
I invite you all to come and try this - 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.460
this is to die for. 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.220
And I'll help you - because I always have to have a taste. You always have to try your food. 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.900
That's right. Delicious. It is delicious, Jaime. 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.000
Thank you. You know that it's a pleasure having you here. 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.040
Aww thank you. I hope it happens again. It will. 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.040
Bye, friends!
