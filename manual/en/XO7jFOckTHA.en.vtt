00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.029
Well,

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.889
It's a beautiful spring day. Just one of 
those days when it's really great to be

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:12.650
outside.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.910
Birds are chirping in the trees, lawn mowers are going in the background in neighbor's gardens

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.580
 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.689
And that's the sort of day when it's
just a joy to be able to be outside

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.439
and do little things in the garden. And,
I'm going to show you how to prune

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.199
and train climbing roses today. And for
that, you'll need a pair of pruners,

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.770
A good pair of gloves.... because they're
thorny, and some twine to tie them in with.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.879
Now the trick or technique that I'm
going to show you

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.059
is really nothing new, it's been around
for hundreds of years

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.450
but I'm kinda surprised really how few
people know about it.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.660
And I think after I teach it to you,
you'll be very pleased to try it out in

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.699
your garden, because it's going to give
you

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.940
a lot more flowers, it's going to bring
the flowers down closer where you're

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.920
going to see it,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.920
and is going to make, I think, a very nice
feature in your garden.

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.509
This variety that I am using here

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.799
is one of David Austin roses. I like the
strong vigorous growing ones that will

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.619
get to about five or six foot,

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.490
because you can train them as mini 
climbers

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.579
There are climbing roses that'll grow
12 to 15 foot, maybe even thirty foot

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.500
tall... some other really big, strong ones.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.729
But in today's gardens we're looking for
smaller growing varieties

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.979
and these are ideal because they will
make a climbing rose

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.789
that's about five or six foot tall and
that is

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.679
much more in scale with today's garden.
Now, what I'm doing

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.289
is in training these plants.... and you can
see from this shoot

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.299
that I have trained in from last year.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.890
that what we're doing, is we're redirecting the growth

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.939
horizontally, so that then we have apical dominance

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.099
in all of these shoots, and these were
the shoots that carried the flowers for

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:03.930
last year.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.730
So we're channeling

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.180
the growth..... instead have been up
high on the plant, down horizontally

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.190
so that we get many more shoots, and many more flowers

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.370
By tying them down horizontally

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.340
you're taking the natural process which
is called apical dominance

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.390
and turning it in to growing

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.930
all these little shoots that when they
grow up

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.430
each produce flowers on their tips.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.330
The end result is that you get a beautiful
trained specimen like this one

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.580
that's loaded with lots of big

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.590
fragrant flowers that really

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.050
is a joy to have in the garden. Now when
you look at the individual shoots

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.410
on the plant, you'll see there' two sorts. 
There's these

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.550
older shoots here, which have a brown more grey color.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.050
And then there are young, juicy shoots
like these ones

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.490
and these are the healthy, strong growing
ones

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.790
that are going to produce all the
flowers next year.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.380
So, what we're going to do in pruning and
training this plant,

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.220
is cut out the old wood and then leave
the young shoots

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.510
so that we can train those back in.          
So with the pruners, we're going to start

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.020
by

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.860
cutting out the old shoots from last
year, they've already finished

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.470
flowering, the wood is not so growthy, so

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.330
that's the stuff that we want to get rid
off. So, we cut them

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.390
right back

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.420
just removing the old string from last
year, that we had them tied in

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.700
And then...., just getting rid of those

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.080
And leaving the young shoots. So now I've
removed

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.430
all of the old growth from last year,
and we're left with these young fresh,

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.170
flexible shoots, and it's time to tie
those in.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.739
Decide which ones are going to go best....,
Along

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.130
at whatever levels, and looking at this
one here.....

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.770
I have tied it in at the side, and now it's
time to take it

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.970
and train it horizontally, bending it
down....

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.989
as low as you can without breaking it.

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.680
And this would be a good level here for
this one. So holding it in place,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.800
then just with a piece of twine, tie it

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.290
to the trellis or the frame

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:34.290
like so. And then you can put another tie
in the middle, just to neaten it up and

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.640
keep it in place.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.400
And then when you've got that one in place,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.590
then take a look at the other stems and
see where they're going to work. So I see

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.700
this one here,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.150
is going to be pretty low on the bush so
I'm gonna try to get it is low as I can,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.200
and then all come back to you in a
minute when I get the job done.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.570
So as you see, I have no I built a series
of horizontal layers,

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.960
each one of these will now produce shoots with apical dominance

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.650
that I as they grow up, each of these
then we'll carry flower stems.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.020
And so this will become a wall of flowers,

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.290
and this technique will work on a trellis,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.490
on a fence, on a wall, on an arbor

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.600
Anywhere where you're going to be able
to enjoy, beautiful

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.820
gorgeous roses flowering in the summertime

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.240
from the ground up to the top over the
device that you're tying it to.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.550
This is David Wilson, enjoy your
gardening

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:46.550
it's good for us and it's very good for
our environment too.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.599
school is world

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:52.870
remember me well
