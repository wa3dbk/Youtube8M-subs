00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.930
after the discussion of uses of concave mirror
in this section weâ€™ll study some of the

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.540
common uses of convex mirrors.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:17.260
a very common use of convex mirror, is the
use, as reflector in street lights, because

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.660
in street lights, we need diverging behavior
of the light due to which light diverges.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.900
so in such situations of street light where
more divergence is required.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.130
convex mirrors are used.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.760
another common application for convex mirror
is, it is used as a rear view mirror.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.730
in automobiles, so that.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.480
the rear view will be of wide range or it
can be used as wide view mirror because of,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.200
diverging nature.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.840
or it captures, wide view from the surrounding
and concentrate these light rays after reflection

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.850
to the observers eye. and another common use
of, convex mirror.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.850
as it is used at the sharp corner roads to
see the wide range of other side.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.440
you might have seen in various hotels and
huge buildings at the corner such convex mirrors

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.670
are installed.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.400
so that the automobile coming from one side,
the driver will be able to see, whatever,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.720
the road is clear on the, other side of the,
turn or not, so such.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.850
mirrors are used to prevent, accidents at
such sharp turns.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.000
in huge buildings.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.090
and major applications of convex mirrors are
basically due to its wide range, of the field

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.070
of view through which light rays can be captured
to, a small region so you can write also that

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.000
major uses. of convex mirror.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.520
are because of.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.840
its wide.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.230
field of view. this field of view is the region
from which, the light rays incident, on the

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.530
mirror and reflected, to a point, which is
at the observers eye or. the light rays which

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.230
are incident on the mirror, are distributed
after reflection the wide field of view so

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.780
you must understand.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.099
that it captures a very wide range.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.110
for incident or reflected rays onto the mirror.
