Welcome back, it's Seafood IT guy again

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.940
Today I'd like to test the 3 action cameras again

00:00:16.195 --> 00:00:18.195
Here we go....

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:29.320
Today, I've bring these action cameras to theme park, and see how this action camera perform

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.360
The first footage is from GoPro

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.280
This time change to shooting at 720p, 60fps

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.000
As we see, even the resolution is lower

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.960
the image still keep in good quality

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.260
which is clearly represented

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.720
In slow motion, we can still clearly see the detail like water drop,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.780
the river, background 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.735
and leaves are all looks good

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.680
This is expected

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.900
since last time it also perform well in night shooting

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.880
So, how about low performer last time - SupTig Cam

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.560
the video is somehow too red

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.500
the color is a bit over saturated

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.060
But this time even in slow motion

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.640
details are clearly represented, like leaves, water drops

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.180
is in good detail

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.980
Which is quite a different result to night shooting last time

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.480
which was blurred, and a lot of "ghost effect"

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.420
Next is Sony, image is crystal clear

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.860
no "ghost image"

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.840
image stabilization also good, as no shaking at all which shooting on a boat

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.460
Sony and GoPro support high speed shooting

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.640
This is a 240fps video from GoPro

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.780
As you can see, the video keep smooth during slow motion

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.020
instead of "frame by frame" feeling

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.240
SupTig, on the other hand, doesn't support this feature

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.740
SupTig can only shoot up to 60fps

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.700
Sony and GoPro is up to 240fps

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.240
Let's see other videos, we can see some attribute on those cameras

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.160
SupTig is saturated and lower brightness

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.940
Sony is soft and brighter

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.700
GoPro is sharper

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.820
Overall, in day shooting

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.000
the difference between is much lower

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.580
compare to night shooting.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.740
See you in next episode.
