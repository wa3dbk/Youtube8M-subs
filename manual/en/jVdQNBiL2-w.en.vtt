00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.200
Speaker 1: Broadway?

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.150
Broadway: Oh, man.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.099
Speaker 1: I hear it all the time, man.

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.670
Kids ask me, they say, "Hey, man.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.420
I want to play just like Michael Jordan."

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.500
So I had an answer for them.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.500
Broadway: What's the answer?

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.640
Speaker 1: I told them, "You know what?

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.590
Just go out there and stick your tongue out
like this.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.590
Alright?"

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.630
"Then you'll be like Michael."

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.630
Right?

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.660
Broadway: No, man.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.660
Michael's the G.O.A.T.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.660
Speaker 1: He is, man.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.660
He is the -

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.660
Broadway: Greatest Of All Time.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.660
Speaker 1: Greatest Of All Time.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.660
I like it.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.660
Yes, sir.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.890
Broadway: But, let's just say we can teach
the people how Michael Jordan plays.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.890
Speaker 1: Right.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.810
Broadway: Teach them some of his moves and
maybe they can pattern their game after him.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.810
There's only one Michael.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.810
Speaker 1: There sure is.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.810
Broadway: There's only one greatest.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.190
Speaker 1: Lots of work in the gym.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.579
Broadway: So, you know, I don't want to be
confused with saying, "I'm as good as Michael."

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:49.579
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.110
Broadway: But, we're going to teach them the
way Michael plays.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.110
Speaker 1: OK.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.110
Sounds good.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.149
Broadway: So we'll take two of Michael's signature
moves -

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.149
Speaker 1: OK.

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:56.149
Broadway: Break them down.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:57.149
Speaker 1: Alright.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.149
Broadway: And show the kids how to practice
-

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:59.149
Speaker 1: OK.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.149
I'll be Craig Ehlo.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.149
Broadway: Being like Mike.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.149
Speaker 1: And you'll be Michael Jordan.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.149
Broadway: Oh!

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.149
You know what?

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:05.149
That's good.

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:06.149
Speaker 1: Now, Broadway, you told me that
tongue is not the only thing I need to do.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.580
I need to get in the gym, I need to work hard
and I got to perfect my game if I even want

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.970
to come close to playing like the greatest
of all time.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.970
Broadway: Yep.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.970
Speaker 1: Correct?

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.500
Now, one of Michael Jordan's favorite moves
was the fadeaway.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.500
Right?

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.500
Broadway: Signature.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.400
Speaker 1: Now, Broadway right here, he's
going to show us how that fadeaway works.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.400
Very, very effective move . . .

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.400
Broadway: First, Mike-

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.350
Speaker 1: Helping you to get away from a
defender.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.909
Broadway: First, Mike's in the post.

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.710
Got a feel for the defense and Mike used to
do it like this right here.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.710
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.710
Do it like that.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.710
Right?

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.710
Right?

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.710
Broadway: You see that?

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.710
Where's the defense at?

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.710
Then, Mike goes into a fake . . .

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.710
Speaker 1: Right.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.710
Broadway: .And then he goes into a shot.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.710
Speaker 1: OK.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.710
Broadway: So here's the fake -

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.710
Speaker 1: Oh, whoa.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.710
Broadway: Turn and then the shot.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.710
Speaker 1: Oh.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.710
Like that.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.710
Broadway: Mike gets such great elevation.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.710
Speaker 1: Right.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.710
Broadway: Hard to defend the shot.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.710
Speaker 1: Yes.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.710
Broadway: But, this is what it looks like.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.710
Speaker 1: Nice.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.710
Nice.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.619
Good fadeaway right there.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:05.230
And no great Michael Jordan's without a great
Michael Jordan celebration.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.860
You got a good celebration for Michael?

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.899
[laughs] That's what I'm talking about.

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.099
That is how you play like the greatest of
all time, Michael Jordan.

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.120
Broadway: What about the tongue?
