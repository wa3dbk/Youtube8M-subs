00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.191
When you're first starting out learning how
to slide boxes; it's really important that

00:00:04.191 --> 00:00:10.080
you choose a box that's set up for beginners.
Most mountains have a smaller beginner part.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.990
As you can see right here, this box is not
very high off the ground. There's not that

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.690
much of a gap from where you take off to where
you actually land on the box. You don't want

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.020
to pick one where the take off is way down
here, and the front of the box is way up here.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.450
When you're first starting out; you're not
going to really want to have to worry about

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.220
making it up on top of the box; as opposed
to getting your weight balanced, and being

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.480
able to slide the box comfortably. As you
can see here, with coming off; there's no

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.540
drop off or anything. It goes right back into
the snow. A small box like this is going to

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.710
allow you to focus on the basic fundamentals
of sliding the box; keeping your body positioned

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.930
properly, coming off properly, and getting
on properly. It's going to make it a lot easier

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.280
if you do fall and slip out. It's not going
to hurt as bad, because it's not that high

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.579
off the ground, and if for some reason; you
do catch a front edge, and you fall off the

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:11.859
front; you're already right there on the ground
with it, so it's not as bad as some of the

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:17.789
larger features on the hill. First and foremost;
you need to pick your terrain features properly

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:23.170
to go along with your skill level. Now we're
actually going to be sliding the box. I'll

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.139
walk you through what you're supposed to do
as I'm actually on the box and sliding. Just

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:31.490
make sure you keep your weight balanced throughout,
so you don't slip out, or catch your front

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:44.200
edge. You're going to hop sideways and then
hop regular again. As you noticed, I hopped

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.380
sideways; I crouched down low, so I was in
a proper stance on the box, and then I came

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.840
back forward like that. When you're sliding
sideways, it helps if your body is still a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.610
little bit forward; just because it will make
it so you can bring your body forward again,

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:07.029
so you can go back down the hill. Sometimes
it gets difficult to bring your body forward

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:10.599
if you get completely sideways, and you'll
end up coming all backwards; which is good,

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.260
if you mean to, but if you're not meaning
to, then it can just lead to your falling

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.890
or being out of control. You want to be able
to pop back forward, and come out regular

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.650
again, and go and ski the rest of the run.
