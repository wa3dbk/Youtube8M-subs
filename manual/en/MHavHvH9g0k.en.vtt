00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:08.790
JORGE BENLLOCH: Now, we are going to just
to add more detail. The posture of the arms

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:19.710
really important. They definitely need one.
We have to make--it's important now to define

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:28.339
the hip position of her because--that's the
hip, then, it's going to be the leg in there.

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:34.890
And that's the other hip, then, it's going
to be the leg in here. Then we have to mark

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:47.120
too, you know, this thing. That's good. Then
this guy have, more or less, the legs in position.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:01:16.729
Now, let's dance. Let's see if--she grab him
from the neck maybe. Maybe it's a good one.

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:47.109
Have to just try to redefine the bodies and
put some kind of little detail later. The

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:58.200
arms, they are getting too big and too fat
when we push the clay out around and we have

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:13.200
to re-trim in order to make them look good.
This guy have a big one but this is the jacket.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:03:13.480
That's good. There. I like to try to dress
him up with a tuxedo. And now, she have too

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:27.220
much material here. It's just time to put
a little more detail in a-in a good shape

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.930
though we have to reshape it. Every time that
we move the figurine and we press or push

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.400
the clay in one direction, you have to reshape
it because it's going to change the shape

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.250
on the other one and you have to be ready
for that and that's what I am doing here.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.250
Now, we have to do this--no feminine shoulders,
too thick. We have to reshape that. And later,

00:03:43.250 --> 00:04:14.700
we are going to make the kind of dress that
she's wearing. Maybe she have--all the back,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:32.400
covered by the dress. Later, we have to think
which kind of hair we want to put there and

00:04:32.400 --> 00:05:01.960
him, too. Now, the chest maybe is too big,
never too big. How I marking here the hips

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:14.770
better around the hip and the dress that it's
come after the hip.
