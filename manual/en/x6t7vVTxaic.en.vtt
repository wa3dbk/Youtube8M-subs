00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.580
He's got supporters.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.500
Detroit.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.900
New York.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.680
Los Angeles.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.520
Inciting large scale arrests and...

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.800
Sympathy marches.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.560
I'm very aware of that, Mr. Hoover.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.420
What I do know is he's non-violent.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.420
What I need to know right now...

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.360
What's Martin Luther King about to do next?

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.640
Mr. President?

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.640
Dr. King is here.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.320
Mr. President...

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.220
In the South, there have been thousands of racially motivated murders.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.300
We need your help!

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.540
Dr. King, this thing is just going to have to wait.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.720
It cannot wait.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.920
You got one big issue.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.940
I got a hundred and one.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.700
Selma it is.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.940
Here is the next great battle.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.280
Selma's the place.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.320
And they ready.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.040
Dr. King!

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.760
I'll tell you that white boy can hit.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.280
We will not tolerate agitators' attempting to orchestrate a disturbance in this state.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.080
It is unacceptable that they use their power to keep us voiceless.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.640
Those that have gone before us say, "No more!"

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.180
No more!

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.440
People actually say they're gonna kill our children.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.760
There are trying to get inside of your head.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.400
What happens when a man stands up and says enough is enough?

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.240
We build the path as we can.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.500
Rock by rock.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.440
This cell is probably bugged.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.560
It probably is.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.720
We must march.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.320
We must stand up.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.340
You march those people into rural Alabama, it's gonna be open season.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.320
May I have a word?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.900
There's no word to be had.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.900
There are seventy million people watching.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.520
These pictures are going around the world.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.560
We must make a massive demonstration

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.920
White, black and otherwise come to Selma.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.120
I heard about the attack of innocent people.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.380
I couldn't just stand by.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.200
Looks like an army out there.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.520
Mine eyes have seen the glory.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.660
Glory!

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.560
Glory!

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.680
Hallelujah!

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.040
What happens when a man stands up and says enough is enough?
