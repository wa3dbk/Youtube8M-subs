Hello in this tutorial I show you how to 
 make this box to put a little gift

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.930
Material

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:23.878
cardstock, acetate, glue stick, scissors, pencil and eraser

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:37.859
crease-tool, table and cutter, ruler

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.399
to decorate you can use deco paper and other things like ribbons and perforators

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.542
In the cardstock trace a square of 30 x 30 cm 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.672
cut it

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.600
and make marks every 6 cm on all 4 
 sides, 6, 12, 18 and 24 cm

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.064
join each pair of marks with a straight line

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.200
you´ll have a grid with squares of 6 x 6 cm

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.306
in these squares we´ll do tabs

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.338
make marks of 1 cm here and here

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.417
and join them with a straight line skipping 1 square

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.500
you´ll have this, these will be the tabs of the box

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.770
make diagonals to mark the figure of the tabs

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.480
in these 2 squares make a diagonal line from right to left in descending

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.700
and in these squares another diagonal but from left to right

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.590
cut the excess

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:32.780
when you finish, in the second top square make marks at 1.5 
 cm and then at 1 cm on the other sides

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.190
join the marks with a straight line

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.930
this square will be the window

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:04.730
to make it easier to cut use the table and cutter

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.550
cut a rectangle of acetate, it must cover the space you just cut

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.700
glue it with glue stick

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.520
with the rule and the crease-tool pass for all the lines

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.300
then make the folds

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.300
fold the triangles of the top to both sides

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.460
the others you can do it just inside

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.460
the others you can do it just inside

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.460
the others you can do it just inside

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.460

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.460
the others you can do it just inside

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.460
the others you can do it just inside

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.730
put glue in the tabs and close the box

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.570
press to adhere

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.220
and do the same on the other side

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.340
ready

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.960
now start decorating, for that you can use deco paper

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.180
and cut squares 1 cm less than the squares of the box

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.470
in this case of 5 cm

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.250
you can also use ribbon and figures of the perforator

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.520
fill the box with whatever you want to give

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.440
to close the box, put these two tabs like this

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.650
take this and pass it under 1 tab

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.460
and the other tab pass it through the middle

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.710
ready you finished

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.900

 in other sizes or even without window
