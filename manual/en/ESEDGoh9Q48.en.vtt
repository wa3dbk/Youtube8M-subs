00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
To make the cheese known as Queijo do Serro it’s necessary a good region.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.250
Depends on the climate.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:27.727
For us the climate is always cold in a way that contributes a lot.

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:32.372
If anyone tries to make a cheese like ours

00:00:32.372 --> 00:00:36.653
in a warm region similar to Governador Valadares

00:00:36.653 --> 00:00:39.603
 certainly won’t be able to make it.

00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:46.574
One of the main aspects that contributes to the quality of our cheese is the wheater.

00:00:46.574 --> 00:00:56.536
It’s an activity with 300 years and goes on along the generations.

00:00:56.536 --> 00:01:07.192
I don’t know who started but my entire family works with cheese.

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:11.747
To start making the cheese the first concern is the cleanliness.

00:01:11.747 --> 00:01:15.817
An important thing is the water quality.

00:01:15.817 --> 00:01:20.357
Then it comes the process starting with the milk.

00:01:20.357 --> 00:01:26.317
The area must be clean.

00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:30.271
In my case it is a manual process.

00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:34.477
The cattle tender gets the cow with its year-old calf

00:01:34.477 --> 00:01:37.391
and lash it with a rope.

00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:45.103
Then he comes with a humid cloth dipped on a special solution

00:01:45.103 --> 00:01:47.827
to clean the cow’s teat.

00:01:47.827 --> 00:01:51.483
After that he gets a bucket and start to extract the milk.

00:01:51.483 --> 00:02:04.996
Next he takes the milk to a deposit where it seats for about 2 hours.

00:02:04.996 --> 00:02:12.290
When the process is done to the milk is added the curdle.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.558
We also mix the curdle with a ferment we call pingo,

00:02:18.558 --> 00:02:22.508
which is also made during the cheese production.

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:29.220
Then the cheese maker initiates the removal of the serum

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.984
and after that he gets the dough putting it on the shapes.

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:51.987
Subsequently the salt is added

00:02:51.987 --> 00:02:55.752
and he wait until the next day.

00:02:55.752 --> 00:03:00.490
The following day the cheese is turned again.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.170
On the third day the curing process starts.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.964
Firstly the cheese is shred and then smoothed giving it a better appearance. 

00:03:11.964 --> 00:03:15.497
Finally it’s ready to be consumed. 

00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:24.199
The Serro’s cheese gets harder as it gets older but is never totally hard.

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.538
It’s always a soft cheese.

00:03:29.598 --> 00:03:37.284
Some cookers say that they don’t like to eat their own food.

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:40.769
Not in my case, I really like my cheese and I eat a lot!
