00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
[Music]

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.720
Hello there.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.880
With vegetables growing so rapidly there's one thing that's pretty much inevitable -

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.860
pests!

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.900
Just look at these blackfly on my beans for example.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.660
It's frustrating but it's also important not to get too
downhearted about it.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.310
Take a pragmatic approach and accept that
pests will always raise their unwanted heads.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.130
It's just another challenge that's thrown at us.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.600
In this video, we'll offer some tips for protecting your
plants and controlling unwanted pests,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.990
bur first we're also asking for your help.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.440
It came as no surprise when in a recent
survey you told us

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.940
pests are your biggest nuisance in the
garden.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.740
Well, we've listened and we want to help you,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.160
but to do that we need your help.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.760
We're launching a major new project called
The Big Bug Hunt.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.079
The Big Bug Hunt invites your to report the
pests you find in your garden.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.270
Why? Because by understanding what is spotted,

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.190
where, and when it's spotted,

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.780
we can start to build up a picture of the conditions common pests need to spread.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.040
Imagine receiving a notification when a
pest is likely to appear in your garden.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.420
This is exactly what we hope The Big
Bug Hunt will help us to achieve.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.540
It's a massive project but by putting
together the many thousands of reports you give us,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.580
we can begin to identify which
conditions trigger an outbreak of a particular pest.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.000
But we can only do this if everyone gets
involved by reporting.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.360
Reporting a bug couldn't be easier.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.900
Just head to The Big Bug Hunt website at www.bigbughunt.com

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.440
then click on the Report a Pest button.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.180
Enter the details of which pest you saw,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.740
and which plant it was on or near.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.600
Enter your location and then click to
send your report.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.040
You can also learn more about the
project on the homepage.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.760
With input from the gardeners like you
in our growing online community,

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.660
the data we collect from The Big Bug
Hunt has the potential to make a lasting impact.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.600
For example, we could use that data to alert you when unwanted pests have been spotted in your area

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.760
and provide you with recommended actions
to safeguard your plants.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.100
An intelligent warning system like that could save a lot of wasted effort, and a lot of money.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.250
With enough reports, The Big Bug
Hunt

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.640
could even go on to help farmers in
developing regions of the world,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.800
providing the information necessary to
help them avoid catastrophic crop failure.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.100
The power that your combined bug reports
could provide is immense,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.220
so stay vigilant this
growing season and report your pests.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.280
Visit www.BigBugHunt.com

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.900
to send us those reports and help us to
help you.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.820
Gardening magazines and television
programmes

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.990
can sometimes portray gardening as
trouble-free.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.880
Pests are barely mentioned, and when they are it's only in passing.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.640
True, most vegetables will 
reach harvest time without any problem,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.200
but it's unrealistic to expect a pest-free
ride every time.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.220
How many times have your leafy salads succumbed to slugs,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.500
or your cabbages been decimated by
caterpillars?

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.060
Whether it's a crafty caterpillar, worrisome whitefly, or root-ravaging carrot fly,

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.880
common pests turn up time and again.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.520
But while there's
little you can do to stop them appearing,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.520
you can at least raise the defences and, if necessary, launch an offensive.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.820
No matter where in the world you garden,

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.800
there are a few pests you are almost
certain to encounter at some point.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.160
Here are three of them.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.260
Slugs and snails are the bane of many gardeners.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.700
Just look at the way they're
demolishing my lovely kale, the cheek of it!

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.240
Don't get mad,  get even.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.340
You can prevent them from getting near your plants
by putting up barriers.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.840
For example, copper rings around plants or 
containers

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.220
will deter the malevolent mollusks by
giving them a small electric shock.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.460
Some gardeners also like to try barriers of hair or eggshells - though you'll need to eat a lot of eggs first!

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.460
Or get proactive - set up beer traps.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.700
Slug love the yeasty 
liquid and will drown attempting to get at it.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.140
Install a pond.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.500
Ponds are great for wildlife, and any
frogs or toads taking up residence

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.990
will make short work of the local slug
population.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.720
If you keep chickens, allow them to roam section-off areas of bare ground.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.140
Here they'll snap up lurking slug eggs while depositing fertilizer for the next crop.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.760
Know your enemy. If you can't see any slugs,
look for telltale damage such as this.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.980
Some slugs will even burrow into the roots of vegetables like carrots,

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.580
and if you come across the pearl-like slug eggs, be brave and destroy them .

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.800
Some caterpillars, such as those of the cabbage white (also known as the 'imported cabbageworm')

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.680
carry an insatiable appetite for members of
the cabbage family.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.380
Serious infestations will quickly
strip leaves bare.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.000
The tiny eggs are pale yellow, and
the found on the undersides of the leaves.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.200
The caterpillars are easier to spot.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.580
Stop butterflies from laying eggs
by erecting butterfly netting over your plants.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.720
Netting can be draped over a
simple wooden frame.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.620
Make sure it is properly secured at the
bottom.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.820
Another clever tactic is to plant decoy or sacrificial plants at the ends of rows.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.780
Plants like nasturtiums lure the butterflies away from the crop

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.980
bearing the brunt of any damage and saving your vegetables.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.200
Aphids come in many guises,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.180
including the black bean aphid or blackfly, green aphids and whitefly.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.880
Spraying colonies with a
mixture of soapy water

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.260
offers some control, but they'll
eventually return.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.720
Thankfully there are a number of beneficial
bugs lining up to feast on them.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.520
Insects such as the hoverfly and
ladybug (ladybird) actively seek out aphids.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.700
One ladybug alone can eat up to 5,000
aphids a year!

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.420
Get them onside and aphids need never
reach epidemic proportions.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.960
Attracting beneficial bugs into your garden
couldn't be easier.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.180
Plants such as calendula and poppies are
a real magnet,

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.580
with nettles especially sought after by
ladybugs.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.279
Provide places for these bugs to
overwinter

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:14.579
and you'll keep them in your garden from
one year to the next.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.240
I'm hugely excited by The Big Bug Hunt.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.040
There's no denying this is a massive
undertaking,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.160
but I think you'll agree the potential outcomes are worth it.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.500
So grab your smartphone, tablet or
computer, and please send us those reports

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.369
so we can warn you about impending pests.

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:38.849
It's time to launch the fight back against the bugs that would eat our crops before we can.

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:45.940
