00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.530
Hi, there!

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.530
I am Katy for RustiKate.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.990
This time I am going to be showing you a time
laps of a painting I did for a friend.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.990
As with all artwork,

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.639
there is a bit of a story attached to this
one.

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.830
And I wanted to share it with you really quickly.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.830
A few years back,

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.839
when I was in Alaska doing missionary work.

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.470
I also did a bit of jail ministry.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.880
And the fellow that I did it with,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.520
turned out, when I got to know him better,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.090
that he was a great artist.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.020
And so this last winter,

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.070
when his health was deteriorating,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.310
and so was mine.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.080
We decided to cheer each other up,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.570
and to inspire each other,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.550
that we would each make a painting.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.760
And that we would mail it to each other.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.980
And so this is what I made for him.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.510
And I hope, that once you watch this video.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.210
You will be inspired to dig out your paints,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.960
or whatever creative medium you use,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.309
and be a little more bold,

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:47.309
a little more colorful.

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.999
Maybe stretch your creative wings a little
bit.

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:51.190
And whatever you make,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:03:37.000
I hope that you will share it with others.
