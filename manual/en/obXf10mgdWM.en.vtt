00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What's up guys?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.550
You're watching Lavendaire.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:11.210
In this video I'm going to share some tips
on organizing your closet the KonMari way.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.910
The KonMari way is a method of decluttering
and organizing by Marie Kondo.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.550
She wrote this book called The Life-Changing
Magic of Tidying Up.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.320
You can check out this video where I go into
detail on her method of how to tidy,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.980
but in this video I'm going to share just
the tips on the clothes specifically:

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.130
how to organize your clothes the way Marie
Kondo teaches it.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.020
The first tip is a very significant part of
the KonMari method

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.850
and it's to fold your clothes vertically and
store them vertically in your drawers so that

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.380
you can see everything at once glance.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.210
You should fold whatever clothes can be folded

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.410
because folded clothes take up less space
and it gives you more room.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.070
If you guys are interested you can check out
my videos on how I fold my clothes the KonMari

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.250
way.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.320
The second tip is to hang up clothes that
look happier when hung up.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.170
So these are probably your very airy pieces
that look better when it's on a hanger,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.980
as well as your structured or heavy pieces
like your coats and jackets.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.939
Alright the next tip is the one that I found
most interesting, and it's to organize your

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:19.939
closet

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.820
so that it rises to the right.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.140
It will make you happier when you look at
it

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.100
because it's going in a positive direction.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.030
So whether or not you believe that's true,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.479
I just thought it was a very fun thing to
try out.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.350
What you do is put your long and heavy items

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.320
to the left and your lightweight and shorter
items to the right.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.450
So it would be:

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:50.680
jackets, coats, dresses, pants, blouses, skirts,
and whatever, crop tops or something.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.570
Similarly you should organize your drawer
so that the darker shades

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.470
are in the back and the lighter shades are
in the front.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.840
The next tip is to make sure that you've removed
all your labels, tags, hanging thingies,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.090
from your clothes, because you want to make
sure your clothes look comfortable

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.340
and broken into your closet.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.569
When you keep the clothes in the packaging
from when you bought it,

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.930
you kind of leave them in this state as if
they were still in the store

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.540
and they don't quite belong to you yet.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.690
Do you notice that once you cut off the tag

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.830
or take off the sticker, the piece of clothing
feels like it's yours?

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.900
Marie Kondo tells you to do this to all of
your clothing and not to leave any tags or

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.900
things around

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.390
because those are distracting and they just
don't make your closet feel like you.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.959
The next tip is to utilize old shoeboxes.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.820
Use shoeboxes and put them in your drawer

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.480
to further organize and separate your little
things.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.519
This is especially useful

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.849
for socks or underwear and little accessories
and things like that.

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.530
Marie Kondo also recommends to save the shoebox
lids to use as trays

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.420
in the kitchen to hold like salt and pepper
and stuff in the cabinets.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.940
The next tip is to store your bags in your
bags.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.130
So instead of stuffing tissue or old t-shirts

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.830
to keep a bag's shape, you can put a smaller
bag into a big bag and fit bags into bags

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.190
as long as you don't overflow it.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.510
It's a great way to save space and also keep
your bags in shape.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.050
And lastly, remember to keep it super simple.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.879
It's so much better to keep everything in
one place.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.500
Instead of scattered in different rooms and
spots throughout the house,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.970
just so you can keep track of your stuff at
all times.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:33.970
Alright that's it!

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.330
I hope these tips helped you a little bit
on your journey to organizing your closet.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.040
If you haven't watched my original "How to
Tidy" video, you should watch it right now

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.379
so that you can learn how to properly tidy
the KonMari way,

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.470
and how to go in the right order of the different
categories.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.470
I will be coming out

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.980

I organize my closet the KonMari way.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.299
This is a big journey and it takes a long
time to sort through all your stuff,

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:12.290
but once you can discard your unwanted things
and keep only that which you love,

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.430
and organize it beautifully in your closet
space, you're going to feel so good and so

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.430
fresh.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.680
I promise you.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.600
Happy tidying, keep going, good luck.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.210
And I'll see you guys in the next one.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.210
