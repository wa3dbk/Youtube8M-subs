00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.649
Hello, I am Dr. Michael DiTolla, the Director
of Clinical Education at Glidewell Labs.

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.809
In any given month we receive over 100,000
crown and bridge impressions and

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.579
many have issues, specifically, tissue issues.

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:19.250
Most of the compromised impressions we see
are 99% adequate, but the inadequate

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.860
1% is right at the margin.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.920
Why is this area so difficult to capture?

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.660
It’s not the tooth;
it’s the tissue.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.270
Unhealthy tissue will bleed at the slightest
touch and making a great

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.300
impression becomes virtually impossible.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.260
Twelve years ago I started filming all of
my cases, and there was simply too much

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.260
bleeding.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.629
I emailed my mentor, Dr. Gordon Christensen,
and asked him why the

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.690
tissue on his videos didn’t look like a
crime scene He said his staff put all crown

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.780
and
bridge patients on a rinse called Tooth and

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.030
Gums Tonic two weeks prior to the
preparation date.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.479
They continued to rinse with the tonic for
the two weeks that the

00:00:54.479 --> 00:01:00.760
temps were on, and then continued to rinse
for two more weeks after cementation.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.249
I didn’t think my patients would follow
through.

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.570
That had been my experience with
Peridex when I watched one of my well-meaning

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.021
hygienists sell a lot of it to patients,
only to have them return it, or tell me they

00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:13.450
threw it away.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.880
Gordon also mentioned that CRA had just finished
a fresh breath study comparing

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.149
14 products to mask breath odors, and that
Tooth and Gums Tonic had won.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.560
I was
sold.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.180
After a successful restorative case, we talk
a lot about what crown material we used,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.820
what we cemented it with, but it’s clear
that one of the unsung heroes in these cases

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.509
is Tooth and Gums Tonic.

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.399
In fact let’s take a look at a recent clinical
case of mine

00:01:38.399 --> 00:02:24.900
that will be the ultimate test 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:03:45.989
for 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:55.769
the tonic!
