00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.080
The highlands of Papua New Guinea are north of Australia.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.840
The Eneca have gathered to make mono, an old recipe that everyone pitches in to prepare

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.800
There’s no need to borrow a lighter in order to build a good fire here. 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.080
That’s right. They do things the old fashioned way, and they follow the traditional rituals.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.800
Their cooker is a fire pit dug in the ground where they heat up stones. Then they’ll use it as an oven. 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.600
Monos are small sweet plantains that they grate into a soft mass with a stick of bamboo.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.920
 The plantain mash is kind of thick and looks like a béchamel sauce.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.000
 Then they’ll add yams, pumpkin, maize and potatoes.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.760
They fill the fire pit with herbs and banana leaves. 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.000
Then they’ll add several layers of hot rocks, separating them from the food with more banana leaves. 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.280
The goal is for the food to cook without burning the banana leaves. 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.560
This requires a lot of patience as the banana leaves have to be kept wet the whole time

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.720
The primitive but efficient pressure cooker will begin to work now. 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.680
It’s slow, but it will never explode. And two hours later the food will be ready. 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.400
Now we can remove the leaves and enjoy the delicious aroma.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.920
It’s important to be careful with the stones, because they’re still hot. Finally the food is served.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.640
This bamboo dish is helpful for keeping up table manners. 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.840
No-one should get more than his share; that would cause a conflict. 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.400
This mono is cooked just the way I like it. It’s hard, though, to please everyone.
