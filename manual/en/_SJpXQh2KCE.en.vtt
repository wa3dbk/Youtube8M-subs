00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:16.800
This problem deals with lift, drag, and how
we can calculate power knowing both of those

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.800
quantities.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.380
So we have a light air craft.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.680
It has a wing area.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:41.829
So our area equals 250 ft^2 and a lift coefficient
of 0.40, a drag coefficient of 0.05 and giving

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.070
a velocity of 150 ft/s.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:57.450
What we want to find is the lift and the drag,
and the power required to maintain level flight.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.990
The first thing we need to do is define our
lift.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:10.640
The lift is Cl times 1/2 times rho, u^2, over
area.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.810
So the only thing that we are missing there
is rho, and it is the density.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.880
Remember we have to use our English units.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:28.939
So that is 2.38 times 10 to the minus 3*slugs/ft^2.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.219
So now lets put them all together.

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:43.670
This is 0.4 times 0.5 times 2.38 times 10
to the minus 3rd Slugs/ft^2.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:02:05.489
Multiplied by (150 ft/s)^2 and when we calculate
all out what we end up ith is 2677.5 now lets

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:10.929
look at our units slugs*ft/s^2.

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.200
We want to change that to lbf, and the conversion
is this.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.200
So if you notice.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.090
It is the exact same number, but we are butting
it in lbf.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:31.140
So this lift is also going to equal the weight
of the aircraft.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.840
Now lets figure out the drag.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:43.820
So the drag is going to equal Cd times 1/2
times rho, times u^2, times A. So the only

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.810
thing that changes in this is our Cd.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:03:01.470
So our drag is going to equal 0.05 times 0.5
times 2.38 times 10 to the minus 3rd.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.870
I am not putting the units in here because
there are exactly the same as before, and

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:20.570
when we figure out the drag, but what we come
out with is 335 lbf, and we expect the drag

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.070
less then the lift.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.800
So how do we get the power from that.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:35.890
So the power is going to equal our 335 lbf
times our velocity, which is 150 ft/s.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:49.350
This equals 50200 lbf*m/s, and if we want
to put this in a more recognizable form.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.730
All we have to do is convert it to watts.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:04:08.250
We do this by taking 50200 lb*m/s, and multiply
it by 1.356 and we end up with 68100 W.
