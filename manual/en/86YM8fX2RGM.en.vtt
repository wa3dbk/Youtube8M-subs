00:00:10.763 --> 00:00:19.156
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin. So far ahead, these bums is laggin'. See me 
 in that new thing, bums is gaggin'. I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon.

00:00:19.156 --> 00:00:27.917
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon. I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon. Look at my show 
 footage, how these girls be spazzin'. So f*ck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?

00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:32.368
Yeah, I said it: has-been. Hang it up: flat screen.

00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:36.479
Plasma. Hey Nicki, hey Nicki! Asthma;

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:41.192
I got the pumps. It ain't got medicine. I got bars; sentencing.

00:00:41.192 --> 00:00:44.791
I'm a bad b*tch. I'm a c*nt. And I'll kick that hoe; punt.

00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:49.021
Forced trauma; blunt. You play the back. B*tch, I'm in the front.

00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:53.383
You need a job. This ain't cuttin' it. Nicki 
 Minaj is who you ain't f*cking with.

00:00:53.383 --> 00:01:01.695
You lil' Fraggle Rock, I beat you with a pad-a-lock. I am a movie, 
 camera block. You outta work, I know it's tough. But enough is enough.

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:10.194
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon. Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon. Rah, rah, 
 rah, like a dungeon dragon. Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon.

00:01:10.594 --> 00:01:19.134
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon. Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon. Rah, rah, 
 rah, like a dungeon dragon. Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon.

00:01:19.134 --> 00:01:27.372
I ain't into S&amp;amp;M, but my whip's off the chain. A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame. 
 Twisted-*ss mind, got a pretzel for a brain, an eraser for a head, f*cking pencil for a frame.

00:01:27.372 --> 00:01:31.231
You don't like it then peel off, b*tch. Every last woman on 
 Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't f*ck you, slut.

00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:35.567
So wipe the smile on your grill off. I swear to God I'll piss 
 a Happy Meal off. Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off.

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:44.490
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod. Quit hollering "Why, God?" He ain't got sh*t to do with it. 
 Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowing my wad. I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra.

00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:53.160
Hope it'll fit tough t*tty, bitch, life's hard. I swear to God, life is a dumb blond white broad. With fake 
 t*ts and a bad dye job. Who just spit in my f*cking face and called me a f*cking tightwad.

00:01:53.155 --> 00:02:01.700
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod and caught her stealing my music, so I tied her arms 
 and legs to the bed, set up the camera and pissed twice on her. Look, two pees and a tripod!

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:09.670
The moral to the story is, life's treating you like dry sod? Kick it back in its face, my God. It's 
 Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd. But don't ask why, b*tch (Ask why not)

00:02:09.673 --> 00:02:18.360
The world-world is my punching bag and if I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots. Make that face, go 
 on, scrunch it up at me. Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it

00:02:18.363 --> 00:02:26.610
Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon. .You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon. You musta went off the back, 
 I'm 'bout to go off the deep end. I told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic.

00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:35.190
Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on? Is it my fault that all of you 
 bitches gone? Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho. Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow.

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:43.420
"Nicki, she's just mad cause you took the spot." Word, that bitch mad cause I took the spot? Well, bitch, 
 if you ain't shitting, then get off the pot. Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top.

00:02:43.422 --> 00:02:52.520
I hear the mumbling, I hear the cackling. I got 'em scared, 
 shook, panicking. Overseas, church, Vatican. You at a standstill, mannequin.

00:02:52.524 --> 00:03:00.880
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight? I'm the motherf*cking boss, overwrite. And when 
 I pull up, vroom, motorbike. Now all my n*ggas get buck, overbite.

00:03:00.883 --> 00:03:14.070
I see them dusty *ss Filas, Levi's. Raggedy *ss holes in your knee-highs. I call the play, now do 
 you see why? These b*tches calling me Manning, Eli. Manning, Eli, these b*tches calling me Manning, Eli!

00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:19.970
All you lil' f*ggots can suck it, no homo. But 
 I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:28.490
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend. Yeah, look who's back again, b*tch, keep acting as if you 
 had the same passion that I have. Yeah, right, still hungry, my *ss. You *ssd*cks had gastric bypass

00:03:28.487 --> 00:03:32.800
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass and 
 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (eyelash!)

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:41.360
Go take a flying leap of faith off a f*cking balcony 'fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly *ss. You 
 know what time it is, so why ask? When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash, it's (high class) meets (white trash)

00:03:41.362 --> 00:03:49.850
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon. Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon. Rah, rah, 
 rah, like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon.

00:03:50.052 --> 00:03:58.310
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon. Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon. Rah, rah, 
 rah, like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon.

00:03:58.306 --> 00:04:15.200
Roman, Roman! Stop it, stop it! You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad! You and this boy Slim 
 Shady! What's going on? They'll lock you away! They'll put you in a jail cell! I promise!

00:04:15.201 --> 00:04:27.120
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please! Back to bed! Run along! Let's 
 go! Come on! Wash your mouth out with soap, boys!
