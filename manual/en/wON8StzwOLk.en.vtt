ANKUR KOTWAL: Welcome to part
three of the "DevByte" series

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.520
"Making Apps Beautiful."
I'm Ankur Kotwal.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.740
Thus far, we've been focused on
making our list reader app

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.100
beautiful on phones, but we
haven't really looked at the

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.590
tablet side of things.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.290
So let's see if we just take
that app that we've been using

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.260
so far and put it on a tablet.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.830
Let's see what it looks like.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.210
So we have a Nexus 10 here
with the app running.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.770
And you'll see it's
not particularly

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.880
attractive at all.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.680
There's all this wasted white
space on the right-hand side.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.590
And then when I go into the
Detail view, the text is going

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.670
edge to edge.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.250
Sure, the fonts are nice, and
we've modernized it with an

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.960
Action bar.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.170
But this isn't a great
tablet experience.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.520
So let's switch back
to the slides.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's talk about
what we can do.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.750
And really, the obvious thing to
do in this situation is to

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.580
implement a two-pane UI.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.780
So we're going to go from
something like what you see

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.910
here to something like this,
where we have both the list

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.600
items on the left-hand side and
the detailed items on the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.209
right-hand side.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.720
The way we're going to do that
is we're going to try and

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.620
basically keep or reuse as much
of the code as possible.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.980
We don't want to write a phone
version and a tablet version

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.400
of the apps.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.530
That's not how you build
Android apps.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.230
So we're going to use a little
trick called XML references.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.730
So let's look at the code
on my machine here.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.330
We have our two activities,
the list activity and the

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.600
detail activity.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.040
But you'll notice we've also
got a layout here for a

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.300
two-pane activity.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.920
Now, one way to load this is
that when we load the initial

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.850
activity, the list activity, we
could just, at that point,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.390
work out whether we're a tablet
or not and load the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.280
two-pane layout.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.190
We're not going to do that.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.570
We're going to use this XML
references trick that I

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.140
particularly like.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.350
So we're still going
to load Activity

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.590
Article List as our layout.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.870
But we're going to specify this
refs.xml file, and that

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.840
name isn't special.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.240
We're just calling it that.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.360
But what is special is we're
going to check in on a

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.980
directory called values,
smallest width, 600dp-land.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.550
The smallest width 600 dp
basically tells us that this

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.530
is a tablet.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.290
That's a metric that we use.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.950
The Land tells us we're
in Landscape Mode.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.610
So in Landscape Mode on a
tablet, we're going to load

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.260
this refs.xml.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.940
And this file has the activity
article list.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.830
And what we're saying is if you
refer to a layout called

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.120
Activity Article List, instead
of returning what's already

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.440
there in your resource folder,
return a different layout.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.940
So load this layout here,
activity_article_twopane.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.500
So again, we've done it all in
XML without actually having to

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.700
change any Java.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.860
And we'll get the
right layout.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.350
We'll get the two-pane layout,
which is great.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.420
But we're not done yet, because
we actually need to

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.310
make one more change, which is
when the user selects an item

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.300
from that list view, we
shouldn't launch another

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.200
activity into their
detailed view.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.850
What we should be doing is
selecting or replacing that

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.740
right-hand fragment.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.010
So what we're going to do is
actually in our article list

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.020
activity, we're going to work
out if we're in two-pane mode.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.960
There's multiple ways you can do
this, so we're not going to

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.200
go into it in a great
amount of detail.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.200
But once you know if you're
working in two-pane mode, all

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.670
you're doing is basically when
the list item is selected,

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.900
you're going to get your
Fragment Manager and replace

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.860
that detail fragment with
the relevant one.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.470
If you're in single-pane mode,
you're just going to go and

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.610
call the start activities.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.410
So on phones, we'll start
a new activity.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.950
On tablets, we'll just replace
that fragment on the

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.170
right-hand side.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.760
Simple as that, we have
our two-pane UI.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.650
Of course, this is all based on
the assumption that you are

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.420
already using fragments.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.780
If you're not using fragments
in your app already, I think

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.220
you're making a mistake.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.510
It's really important
that you do so.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.250
It allows you to make these apps
really flexible depending

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.089
on the form factor.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.950
And you'll see we did it
with minimal effort.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.110
So let's switch back
to our slide.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.510
And what we're seeing
now, we've got our

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.740
nice two-pane UI--

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.390
great.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.850
But one thing that's still
lacking here is spacing.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.200
Those margins that we specified
on either side for

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.400
the detail view, they
don't seem as

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.100
applicable for a tablet.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.170
And in fact, even our List
view seems a little bit

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.650
squashed, or more so
than it should be.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.220
So what we're going to do is
actually, we're going to go

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.730
and override some of those
values for tablets.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.040
So switching back to the code,
you'll recall that we had a

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.600
dimensions XML file that we'd
specified for our List views.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.760
We'd had some top and
bottom margins.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.470
And for our detailed
view, we had some

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.880
margins on either side.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.310
What we're going to do is
specify another dimensions

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.090
file for tablets, 600 dp.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.670
And we don't care whether it's
portrait or landscape.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.360
We're going to use
these dimensions.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.190
And instead of 8 and 16, we're
going to go 16 dps vertically,

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.130
for margin, for the List view,
and 80 dps on either side.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.550
So now let's switch back to
slides and see what that will

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.590
actually end up achieving.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.060
This is what we have now.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.560
When we put those new margins
in, we've got much better

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.060
spacing vertically between our
list items on the left and on

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.710
either side in the detailed
view as well.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.010
So with that being said, we've
now come to the end of this

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.600
checkpoint, which is this is
where we started with our

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.500
tablet app--

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.030
not very attractive at all.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.270
And this is where
we've come to.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.530
So the next part, we're
going to focus

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.780
on performance tuning.
