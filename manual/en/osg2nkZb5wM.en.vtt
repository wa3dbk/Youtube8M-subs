Most people who have periods probably don't
love buying and using pads, tampons and menstrual

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.480
cups even though to be fair, making menstrual
cups talk is pretty fun. That's right. But

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.590
it's also important as I've recently learned
to not take all of this stuff for granted.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.740
Access to tampons and other menstrual products
is more of a luxury than you might realize

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.070
because for a lot of girls, women and trans
men around the world and in the United States,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.320
they can't just go to their local drugstore
and pick up new pack whenever their period

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.890
rolls around. For women living in homeless
shelters, domestic violence shelters and areas

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.140
affected by natural disasters menstrual products
might not be readily available in addition

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.890
to private bathrooms where they can clean
up. And in the case of living in shelters,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.440
if and when pads and tampons are donated there's
no guarantee that they're in a variety of

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.260
shapes, styles and sizes which is yet another
luxury we often overlook. This is very much

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.989
a trans issues as well not only because trans
people have periods but also because in the

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.250
United States one in five people has experienced
homelessness either because they've been kicked

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.190
out of their house by their parents, they've
experienced housing discrimination or discrimination

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.330
in trying to find a job. And did you know
that for people on welfare, food stamps don't

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.670
cover menstrual products which is kind of
a basic necessity? Or how about the more than

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.460
350,000 American women behind bars in the
United States who yet again don't have ready

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.740
access to menstrual products. A lot of times
the closest thing that you're going to get

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.820
to a pad or a tampon is a wad of toilet paper.
Moving outside of the United States to developing

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.119
countries where in a lot of places menstruation
is still highly taboo, getting your period

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.950
often means missing school, missing work,
and also getting recurrent vaginal infections

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.650
from using dirty menstrual products if you
have access to any to begin with. Human Rights

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.270
Watch and similar organizations have highlighted
menstrual hygiene as a basic human right in

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.530
addition to things like access to clean water
and sanitation. A right that shocking number

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.770
of people around the world aren't granted.
So if and when you have a period think twice

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.959
before you take that tampon, or menstrual
cup or pad or panty-liner for granted.
