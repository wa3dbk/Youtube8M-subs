Hi, this is Alia, and welcome back to my kitchen.

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:19.128
Today, is the last recipe of my Grandmother's comfort food Series.

00:00:19.128 --> 00:00:23.455
So far, we made the Hash brown potato,the Rice Pudding, the pasta.

00:00:23.455 --> 00:00:28.999
and today, I'm going to show you how to made 
 a very very nice recipe of my Grandmother.

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.299
Perfect! She used to do it like Nobody else.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.426
It's called "Taknetta".

00:00:34.426 --> 00:00:36.794
Can you call it right?? 
"Taknetta"

00:00:36.794 --> 00:00:41.109
and "Taknetta" is basically Cookie Butter Moroccan Style.

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.695
It's Moroccan recipe from the eastern region of Morocco.

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:48.363
as my grandmother is from "Koshda" which is the east of Morocco. 

00:00:48.363 --> 00:00:54.764
I think it is also popular in Algeria. they share a 
 lot of recipes from the eastern of Morocco and Algeria

00:00:54.764 --> 00:00:56.868
and in general, in all of Africa.

00:00:56.868 --> 00:00:59.858
but this recipe is very specific in her region.

00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:05.265
So basically, Have you had butter cookie before?? or cookie butter?

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:17.316
"Cookie Butter" is basically like Talat but brown in butter, but 
 taste like cookies crushed in Pena butter and so texture.

00:01:17.316 --> 00:01:19.923
It's AMAZING!!

00:01:19.923 --> 00:01:23.041
However it's very very fattening as you will see the recipe.

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:28.528
so my grandma only made it twice a year in Eid in Morocco.

00:01:28.528 --> 00:01:35.929
and we use it as adept for dates or as spread for bread.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.300
Don't attract to the recipe because it is a lot of oil. It's delicious.

00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:46.330
you have to try it. Don't to be late to do it. Like me.

00:01:46.326 --> 00:01:50.040
It's lovely!! 
It's called "Taknetta"

00:01:50.045 --> 00:01:52.050
So let's discover it together.

00:01:52.052 --> 00:01:54.270
Pour the oil in a saucepan

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.520
OK, I know, that’s a lot of oil, 
 but remember this is occasional comfort food

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:04.810
and believe me that’s how much oil there is in 
 regular cookie butter you buy from the store.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.100
Add the flour and mix it well with the oil. 

00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:08.690
Cook on low heat.

00:02:08.688 --> 00:02:14.440
this is important, it has to be low heat 
 or it will burn… and very quickly.

00:02:14.443 --> 00:02:18.320
Now, all you have to do is wait and stir frequently.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.300
check your mail or do something while sitting next to the stove! 

00:02:21.304 --> 00:02:26.000
Really, do not leave anywhere, this thing burns quickly.

00:02:25.995 --> 00:02:32.090
As the flour cooks, you will see that the colors 
 of the mixture become darker and the texture thicker.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.460
After 30 minutes, add the sugar, and continue stirring and cooking 
 on low heat for another 15 minutes or so. 

00:02:39.462 --> 00:02:42.680
You will see that the mixture will become like a paste. 

00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:46.060
Once it starts drying, remove from the heat 

00:02:46.058 --> 00:02:50.820
and add the roasted sesame seeds and roasted chopped almonds. 

00:02:50.815 --> 00:02:53.410
Place Taknetta immediately in a plate, 

00:02:53.411 --> 00:02:58.400
Otherwise, if it says in the pot it 
 will continue cooking and of course burning

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.680
 that’s the big danger of this recipe.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.900
Also do not taste it now, you will definitely 
 hurt your tong… it’s really hot! 

00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:14.080
As taknetta cools down, you will see that a layer 
 of oil forms and comes on top. 

00:03:14.076 --> 00:03:18.460
Do not get rid of this oil it’s necessary to conserve taknetta. 

00:03:18.462 --> 00:03:26.050
You can put the mixture in a closed jar and leave it in 
 your kitchen, not your fridge, for up to 1 month! 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.810
Before using it, make sure you stir it to mix up the oil.

00:03:29.812 --> 00:03:36.190
Place in a plate and serve it the Moroccan 
 way with toasted bread or dates! 

00:03:36.187 --> 00:03:41.960
Bon appetite!
