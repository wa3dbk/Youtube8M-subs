00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:08.509
Hi! Marshall back with Expert Village and
my amazing dog Possum. Possum, don't be bashful.

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:13.759
Sometimes she gets a little shy. In this case,
we're going to teach you fetching, or we're

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:32.050
going to teach you how to teach dogs fetching.
Possum, fetch. Come here, sit, out, good girl.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.320
One of the biggest things is a dog is going
to pay complete attention to you as long as

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.870
you have this in your hand. The second you
lose this, the dog quits paying attention

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.600
to you. They're totally into the toy. The
trick is many times what you'll do is you'll

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.440
throw this and they'll go fetch it. A lot
of times, they'll either keep it, run away

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:01.000
with it, or they might even come back with
it. Possum, come. See, she doesn't want to

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.560
because she's not listening to me. Possum,
fetch, come, come on. Good girl. Everybody's

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:20.700
watching. Come here, come here, that's my
baby, sit down, out, good girl, good girl.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.570
She knows about submission. She knows about
the Alfa dog. When she's given an order she

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:33.280
wants to turn up her stomach that she's in
complete compliance so don't abuse that. Show

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.510
her that you love her whenever she turns up
her belly. She gets a little bit nervous around

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.461
cameras. Possum is now going to show you how
she's not going to just immediately run out

00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:58.140
of the toy. Possum, come, come here, sit down,
yes, excuse you, whoa, whoa. Possum, go fetch.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:06.210
Good girl, come. Possum, come. Possum, come.
She's a little older, so she doesnâ€™t bound

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:16.310
around like she used to. Possum, fetch, come,
good girl. Sit down, please. Sit down. Alright,

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.920
now another trick you can do as well as just
fetching and not actually going after. The

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.401
trick is whenever you tell a dog to do anything,
you want to make certain that you tell them

00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:34.131
once and you make them do it. If they don't
do it after you tell them. Like let's say

00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:44.370
it's sit and you want them to sit, you say
Possum, come. Possum come. Come, sit. Now,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.319
let's say they didn't sit. You would say it
one more time. Possum, lay down, and then

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.650
make them do it. Never let a dog get away
with it because dogs aren't nearly as stupid

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.299
as you might think they are. Dogs are actually
quite clever and they will figure out exactly

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.829
what they can get away with it. I don't even
let Possum chase my cats, but when I'm out

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.780
of the room, I'm pretty certain that she does.
They know what they can get away with when

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:18.519
and where. They get no treats when they chase
the cats. Here's another trick. This is a

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:27.290
trick in 30 minutes on a rainy day. This is
the slowly fetch because whoa. I taught her

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.310
the word whoa. Whoa means slow down. It doesn't
mean stop and it doesn't mean no, but whoa

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.840
is very close to no. When you say Possum,
no, she's knows that's she's been a bad girl,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.859
but if you say whoa, then she's slow down.
You can teach her that on a bicycle. Teach

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:51.299
her whoa. Whenever you slow down and you say
whoa, you yank her cord. That will teach her

00:03:51.299 --> 00:04:04.799
to slow down of whoa. So watch this. Possum,
whoa. Slow. Okay, get it. She will slowly

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:11.480
fetch because she knows the words no and whoa,
and slow is just another English word. It's

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.859
kind of a neat trick. I don't know what I'm
going to do with it, but it's fun.
