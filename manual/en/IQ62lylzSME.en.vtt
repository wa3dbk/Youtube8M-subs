00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:15.000
I will never forget our promise from the summer of 2055. I, too, will be space traveler.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.940
"Only Human"

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.260
Summer, 2048.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.900
I have always dreamed of travelling to space.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.860
Yuta! Do you know about the Mars Project?

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.100
That's so cool! I want to go there someday.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.780
Yoko, we should try out for the Project.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.460
Do you mean the one looking to explore beyond Mars?

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.940
Yeah! we are going to go where no human has gone before.&nbsp;Just imagine, it’s a new frontier!

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.640
I'll be up there with Yōko!

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.780
But, I still haven't figured out how to achieve that dream.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.780
2054

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.160
That's so unfair!

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.160
I want to get out of here, too!

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.920
He is a good kid. 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.020
But, he just doesn't have the aptitude like you.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.540
Will you be waiting for me when I come back?, I love you.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.560
I have no regrets. Everything I have done was not without meaning, even following my dreams.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.580
But after we broke up, I feel so lost.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.600
Will... Will you come back again?

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.040
Yūta, I believe in you. you can make your dreams come true.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.900
This world that you long after, it will not bring happiness for humanity!

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.240
I'm going to do things my way. I know things will work out in the end.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.040
Here, take this with you to him.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.320
Yōko!

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.360
Yūta! You can do it!

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.060
What will you be doing once I make it up there?

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:58.860
If you do make it up there, then we'll probably see each other again.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.740
Only Human
