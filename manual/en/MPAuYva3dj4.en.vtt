00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.500
Hello, my name is Laura Bliss.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.360
I've been a nail technician for the past 12
years now.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.769
I'm curently teaching at the London College
of Beauty Therapy.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.909
I'm going to show you how to do acrylic over
tips.

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:21.050
I've already prepared the nails.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.859
First of all, I'm going to put primer on to
dehydrate the nail.

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.390
I just might show that the acrylic bonds to
the nail right.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:41.649
It only goes over the natural nail, not over
the tip because it can crack it.

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.820
This is exactly the same procedure, if you
are putting acrylic just over a natural nail.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:56.429
First of all, dip your brush into acrylic
liquid, sweep it along in the powder, and

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:00.710
pick up a nice sized bead of it.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:08.080
Place it onto the free edge, lightly brush,
and then just pat it across the free edge

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:23.860
of the tip.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.530
Make sure it is totally flat before you go
onto the next bead.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.640
The second bead, causes the stress point,
is just where the tip meets the natural nail

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.260
because that is where it's most likely to
break.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:48.550
First of all, just pat it over to the sides
and then just brush it over the tip.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:59.130
Then your final bead, slightly smaller, just
place it just above the last one and with

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.160
the tip of your brush, gently sculpt it around
the cuticle area.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.320
Just make sure it is totally flat.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:16.040
You are pushing it into the nail, not into
the cuticle, leaving a nice margin all the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.420
way around your acrylic, and then we're going
to file it.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:35.360
First of all, just make sure that the length
is ok, not too wide, just taper in at the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.800
sides, and then just buff over the whole nail.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.840
Make sure that you're continuously moving
the file so that you don't get a burning sensation

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.620
with your client.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:01.550
Make sure that you always file into the center
so you maintain a nice 'c' curve to the nail.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.180
Look down the barrel of the nail just to make
sure that it is nice and tapered at the free

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.820
edge and it's not too thick.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:23.170
Look at it from the side and make sure there's
no lumps or bumps.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:35.860
Scar it with your white buff to remove any
scratches and then finish up with a free white

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.560
buffer.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:52.920
Start with the hardest part first and then
just go down the grades.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:05.880
Then just before you use the last one, put
some cuticle oil on, to rehydrate the cuticle.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:16.849
Then just finish up with softest side of your
buffer, and that is acrylic over tip.
