Hello there unboxers!

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.650
This is Sakis Karpas from GameOver.gr in another episode of Unboxholics!

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.100
In today's episode, we will take a look at Wedge Mobile Keyboard by Microsoft

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.250
A brand new keyboard that is mainly intended for tablet use.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:54.000
Wedge Mobile Keyboard provides convenient access to commonly used Windows 8 functions with shortcut keys

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.500
Wedge Mobile Keyboard uses Bluetooth technology, allowing you to wirelessly connect to your PC or Mac

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.800
as well as iPad and Android tablets.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.300
First up is the keyboard itself but we let's see what else is inside!

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.300
2 AAA alkaline batteries and a multi-purpose cover can also be found inside the package

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.400
The cover has a velvety texture which makes it vulnerable to dust...

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.800
it is quite robust and its weight is ideal for supporting any tablet

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.800
It can also be used as a protective cover when traveling

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.100
Manuals are included in numerous languages (Greek is one of them)

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.900
The two alkaline batteries are placed into a small bar at the back side of the keyboard

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.900
which is also used as a keyboard leg.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.700
The keyboard length is 25.6mm

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.900
and the width of it is 10.1mm, which means it is easy to carry around

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.300
Its design is minimal with curved angles

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.000
while the metallic diamond cut frame/casing steals the show.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.900
Aside from the bar on the back

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.600
which two AAA alkaline batteries can be placed on the one side

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.000
while the on/off Bluetooth button is placed on the other side

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.200
a piece of rubber prevents the keyboard from slipping on slippery surfaces

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.200
The keyboard keys are light when typing in order to offer a more pleasant typing experience.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.900
Moreover, Wedge has media keys so that you can control your music, with next track, previous track, play, pause, and volume control keys.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.850
*Greek language is fully supported*

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.900
The connection between the keyboard and a tablet is established via Bluetooth

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.400
To do that, you have to turn on the Bluetooth function via the settings menu of your tablet

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.600
and then pair the two devices

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.000
The procedure is simple and fast!

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Microsoft Wedge Mobile Keyboard is expected to hit the greek stores soon and it will be priced at â‚¬79.90

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Wedge Mobile Keyboard is a hiqh-quality keyboard and is a great recommendation for those who would like to turn their tablet into a laptop

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.800
Soon, we will upload several presentations for peripherals that can be combined with Wedge Mobile Keyboard
