00:00:01.234 --> 00:00:02.535
  - It's not gonna feel good.

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:05.271
- That is in there good.

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:06.573
(yells)

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:08.742
(grunts)

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.044
 Ouch.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:16.016
  (fast tribal music)

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.521
  We're on private
  property right now,

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.590
 a rancher who wanted
 to remain off camera.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.225 line:0%
 He gave us permission
 to be on his property

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.894 align:start position:0% line:0%
  and he said, "I see the Gila
  monster every single day.

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:29.396 line:0%
   "This is the time,
   you gotta show up,

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.331
 "hang out at the bottom of the
 hill, it's gonna come out."

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:34.167
  And sure enough, at
  8:15 in the morning,

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.702
   there he comes up
   out of his burrow.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.303
   I see him.

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:39.239 size:88% position:44%
   He's out.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.341
And he's underneath the
prickly pear cactus.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.176
This is the culprit right here.

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:44.711
  That's prickly pear cactus.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.246
In approaching the Gila monster,

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.714
  I was very excited,
  so I didn't think

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.549
  about the fact that
  I was crawling up

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.951 align:start size:88% position:13%
into a prickly pear
cactus, and I have these

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:55.422
  little, fine needles
  all in my shoulder,

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:58.992 align:start position:0%
  they're all in my hands,
  and I was kneeling in these,

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:01.227 align:start size:88% position:13%
  and this is the
  biological landmines

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.029
 we have to deal with out here.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:07.100
  Now I'm dehydrated and full
  of prickly pear needles.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.401 line:0%
 - Well, one thing you
 might not have known,

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.336 line:0%
 at least I didn't know
 about a Gila monster

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:15.241 align:start position:0% line:0%
   before the scene was they
   have slime green poop.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:18.545 align:start position:0%
It literally looks like Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtle ooze.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:19.913 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - One of my favorites,
 but I wanna know

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.748
what your favorite lizards are.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.216
(groans)

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:24.184
(laughs)

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:25.118
 (gags)

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:26.719
He just pooped all over my hand.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.154 line:0%
(laughs)

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:30.557 align:start position:0% line:0%
- Yeah, it was great, when
Coyote gets pooped on, that's...

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:31.724
 - Aw.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:32.926
(grunts)

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.761
  It stinks, hold on,
  let me put him down.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:39.732 align:start size:88% position:13%
Aw jeez, I got Gila
monster slimed big time.

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:42.168
 I think he's had about
 enough of this scene.

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.403
   - I had to rinse
   it off, of course,

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.004
  but still, it was worth it.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.072 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - [Voiceover] So
  you were on cleanup.

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:47.407
  - I was on cleanup.

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:49.576 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Coyote] That is
belly sweat right there.

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:50.610
  Mel.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.311
 - No.

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:52.812
- Belly dancer.

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:56.483
   It is so hot, I am
   drenched in sweat.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.151 size:88% position:44%
   - I also had to
   blot Coyote quite

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:00.320
  a bit 'cause he gets sweaty.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.321
   - Blot me.

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.822
(laughs)

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:04.791
 - [Voiceover] All right, let's
 just keep rollin' the scene.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:08.828
  - Life on Breaking Trail,
  bounce boards and blotting,

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:12.232 line:0%
 when it gets real hot
 during these scenes.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.370 align:start position:0% line:0%
 Sit right on that cactus,
 all right, here we go, ready?

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.405 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 - Just walkin' around,
 all the prickly

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:20.874 line:0%
things you gotta watch out for.

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.942
  There are many times
  you're just tryin'

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:25.278
 to get a good shot and
 adjusting your stance

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:27.514
  and then like, "Oh,
  I sat on a cactus."

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.015 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I think we're gonna
 keep adventuring

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:30.517
 through the desert so I think
 we're gonna rest for a bit.

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:33.052 align:start size:88% position:13%
Hopefully these monsoons
behind us don't hit

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.888
 and we can head back out there

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:36.489
 and see what else we can find.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.057 align:start position:0%
   I know tonight we're
   hopin' to do some herping

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:40.393 align:start position:0%
  and maybe we'll come
  across a cool snake or two.

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:41.728 size:88% position:44%
   - Yeah, that'll be sweet.

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:45.098 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Okay, so guys, we're
  going to continue

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:46.766
 on the adventure and hopefully

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.768
   find you some more
   cool creatures.

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:50.036
Good see with the Gila monster.

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.271
  - Oh yeah, big time.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.505
   - All right, we'll
   see you guys soon.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.374 align:start size:88% position:13%
