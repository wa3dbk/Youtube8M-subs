Closet Organizing Hangers DIY: New Year, New You

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.570
Hi, Guys and Welcome to Studio Knit. I’m
Kristen.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.570
Today, we are going to be making these artsy Closet Organizing Hangers that anyone can make.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.449
We will craft our CLOSET ORGANIZERS with three different techniques. 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.350
Fabric Wrapped, Yarn Bombed, and Knitted.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.979
This project helps us get more organized,
which reduces stress. We will learn a new

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:39.979
crafty skill, recycle our old clothes, and
save money by making it ourselves!

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:46.260
I’m thrilled to be part of Kin Community’s
‘New Year, New You’ Collaboration. Along

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.179
with my favorite DIY YouTube channels, we are all sharing our own New Year challenges

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:57.670
and tips with you! Oh, and if you think this
would be a great project to stay organized,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.389
please hit like to let me know you would like to see more crafty DIY projects like this.

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:07.670
These hangers are perfect for straightening
up multiple fashion accessories like scarves,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.670
tights, belts and neckties. And they just
take up the space of one hanger in your closet.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.200
I used materials that I already had on hand, so this project was essentially free to make.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.000
A old clothes hanger
Rings – I used some old plastic bracelets.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.609
Inexpensive bracelets can also be found at
your local thrift or dollar store. To fabric

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:35.950
Wrap, use fabric from old clothes or linens
A glue gun and Scissors

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.100
To Yarn Bomb or Knit you will need
Yarn, Size 8 Knitting Needles, Scissors, and a Tapestry Needle

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.140
To make a fabric wrapped hanger, simply wrap material around your hanger. After cleaning

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.280
out my linen closet, I chose an old curtain
to repurpose for this project. And about every

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.280
three inches, I am dabbing a bit of glue from our glue gun to keep it in place.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.720
To yarn bomb our hanger, I like to simply
wrap then knot the yarn together and cut 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:37.099
the ends. I am only dabbing glue at the very tip of the hook, to keep it in place.

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.280
And knitted hangers look really impressive!
I’ve included links to all the knitting

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.280
techniques in the description below. For our hanger, I cast on five stitches and then just

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.730
knit a really long piece in Stockinette Stitch. Seam it together with your tapestry needle

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.610
and yarn around your hanger. For our rings, you could do the same, or create an I-Cord

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:23.269
and slip your ring through it. For my I-Cord,
I also cast on five stitches.

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:43.159
Decide how you would like to arrange your
rings. Then just either attach them together

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:49.569
with yarn or fabric in whatever formation
you chose.

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.519
I love how our unique choice of materials,
colors, and fabrics give our project some

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.769
really cool, original designs.

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.540
It looks so polished, clean, and ready to
help you stay organized.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.780
 I hope you give this fun DIY project a try.
