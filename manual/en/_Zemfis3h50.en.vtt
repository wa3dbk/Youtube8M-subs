00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
Rub 'n Restore® is a professional
waterborne system that allows you to

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.910
recolor leather and vinyl with a sponge.
We will be changing this loveseat from

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.859
dark green to a beautiful tan. Let's
begin by wiping the surface with a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.119
cleaner like 409® or Greenworks® to remove any loose dirt, grease or oil.

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.890
Exhaustive cleaning is not necessary

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.260
That's what Rub 'n Restore® Color is for. We will be using a cellulose sponge to

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.790
apply the dye. Dampen the sponge with
water so that it doesn't drip when

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.129
squeezed. Keep a spray bottle of water
handy to periodically moisten the sponge.

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.160
Thoroughly stir your Rub 'n Restore® Color until evenly dispersed. This can take up

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.460
to two full minutes. Pour a small amount
of Rub 'n Restore® Color directly onto

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.690
your sponge or the working surface. Spread it evenly across the area,

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.940
massaging into cracks and wrinkles.
Notice how little dye we pour onto our

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.940
sponge, maybe a tablespoon at a time.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.850
Don't worry if Rub 'n Restore® Color looks streaky and transparent. The first layer

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.630
is always the most work because it
primes the surface for the following

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.790
coats of dye. Remember that many thin
layers are better than a few thick

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.740
layers. If any coat of Rub 'n Restore® Color is applied too heavily you may

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.070
notice small cracks form as the dye dries and cures. Thoroughly dry each coat

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.270
with a hair dryer before applying
another layer, but avoid getting the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.780
surface too hot. The color will darken as
it dries. It will take several coats to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.430
do a dramatic color change like this one.
Second and third layers will get better

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.470
coverage but may still look streaky or
uneven. Any additional coats should

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.430
remedy this and leave you with a
professional result. You be the judge.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.210
Just let the entire process be fast and
easy.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.670
Don't spend too much time or use too
much Rub 'n Restore® Color on any one area.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.099
It took five coats of dye to color
change this sofa which is demonstrated

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.110
on this cushion.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.670
Surfaces with lots of wrinkles and folds,
like this one, will use more volume of

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.260
Rub 'n Restore® Color. We did the tops and sides of the loveseat with just under

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.520
8 ounces, but we did not dye the
undersides of the cushions or the back

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.700
of the loveseat which are not visible. We
usually recommend 16 ounces to perform a

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.250
dramatic color change such as this.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.320
However, using a color similar to your
surface will achieve the same great

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.690
results with far less volume of Rub 'n Restore® Color. For more luster and to

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.940
deepen the color you can apply our Clear Glosser. It also provides an extra layer

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.500
of protection from the elements. Apply it
the same way, with a damp sponge,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.530
ideally the following day. Your surface
is ready for use as soon as

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.470
Rub 'n Restore® Color is dry. It will not rub off on clothing. Allow 48 hours for the dye

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.020
to cure to its full strength. During this
time avoid getting it wet as water or

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.090
other liquids will reactivate the dye.
