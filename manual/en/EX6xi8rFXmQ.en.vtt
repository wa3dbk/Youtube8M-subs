00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.580
I'm going to give you some tips on how to
look tan with makeup.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.400
So, one of the main things about trying to
look tan is not going overboard.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.000
You don't want to look too orange.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.060
We really want to make it like a nice believable
tan that you just got sun-kissed or you were

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.350
in Bermuda.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.980
So one of the first things that I did was
actually use the Makeup Forever Primer #4,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.050
which actually, if you can see has a really
nice kind of dark color.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.410
This is beautiful to mix in with - you can
either apply it first or mix it in with your

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.400
foundation just to give your skin a little
bit of glow.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.100
So I actually did that and previously mixed
it in with the foundation.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.300
So I'm going to continue applying it to Bobby,
here.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.320
It's just going to give her a little bit more
of that tan look without going too overboard

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.130
and I'm just applying it within her foundation.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.570
While also making her look a little more tan,
it's also priming her skin making her makeup

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:09.369
last longer, minimizing fine lines and pores,
just giving her a nice, finished look.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.800
Okay, so now that we have her foundation on
and a little bit of primer that's giving her

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.219
some color, I'm also going to add a little
bit of bronzer.

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.140
Everyone loves bronzer but there's a trick
to making it look right.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.490
So what I'm going to do is - this isn't really
a technique for contouring.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.609
It's more just giving a sun-kissed, kind of
fresh look.

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:33.890
So I'm going to start by bronzing on the top
of her forehead.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.649
This one, especially for how to look tan for
makeup, I'm not using a matte bronzer.

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.909
I'm using something that has a little bit
of glow because it's going to highlight her

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.000
skin as well.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.210
So I'm applying that at the top of the forehead
because when the sun comes down and hits the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.039
face, a lot of the sun will hit right here.

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:59.429
It'll also hit the top of her nose and the
top of her cheekbones here.

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:05.729
I'm going to apply it to the other side, and
don't go overboard.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.920
Make sure you're using it in moderation.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.690
I'm actually going to take a little bit down
to the jawbone just because, especially when

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.980
you're bronzing, you don't want it to look
too dark on the face and not on the neck.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.870
Another fun thing to give yourself a nice
bronze glow is actually to apply a little

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.970
bit on the chest.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.430
I love that this has a little bit of shimmer,
so I'm literally just putting it right on

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.920
her collarbone here.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.620
It just kind of picks up the light a little
bit and makes her look nice and glowing.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.799
Beautiful.

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.380
One last thing that I'm going to use is actually
a bronze setting powder.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.380
It's beautiful.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.989
It really doesn't give you too much color,
but it will give you that final finish of

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.330
a nice, bronze glow.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.430
So I'm just going to use a nice kabuki brush,
sweep it over the entire face.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.019
This is actually the Tart Bronze Setting Powder.

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:10.980
All of these tips will give you a nice bronze
look without going too dark.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.690
All right, and that's how to look tan with
makeup.
