Jane Houston Jones: What's Up for February. Planetary pairs, just in time for Valentine's Day.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Hello and welcome. I'm Jane Houston Jones from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If you wake up early mid-month, you'll see the moon glide by Saturn

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in the South-Southeast an hour before dawn.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Keep looking over the next two mornings and you'll see the crescent moon bookend Mercury

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
very close to the horizon.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And those are not the only meetups between solar system bodies this month.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Venus, traditional goddess of love, attracts Mars

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
though their closest encounter happens a week after Valentine's Day, on the 21st.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
On the 21st, the two planets are just half a degree apart; that's the width of the moon.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Sound: Whoosh.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Jones: Even through modest modern telescopes, today's astronomers have a view

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that would have stunned Galileo.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
In 1609 Galileo learned of the invention of the telescope and began to make his own.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Over the next months and years, he observed the moon, Venus, Mars, Saturn, several star clusters,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
sunspots on the sun, and Jupiter.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This is the very best month to observe Jupiter!

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It reaches opposition on February 6 and is visible all month long.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Jupiter's moons perform their ballet just as they did when Galileo observed them in 1610.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Using modern telescopes, you'll be able to see the moons pass in front of and behind one another

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
as they march across the planet, casting tiny shadows.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It's also a great month the view the Main Belt asteroid Juno through telescopes.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You'll find it near the pretty collection of stars known as the Beehive Cluster.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You can learn more about the history of the solar system and discoveries at solarsystem dot nasa dot gov.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And you can learn about all of NASA's missions at w w w dot nasa dot gov.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
That's all for this month. I'm Jane Houston Jones.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Music.
