00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.080
Hey you it's a brand new day,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.000
Everybody's here to laugh and play

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.620
Everybody sing Humf

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.080
Everybody sing Humf

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.840
Wallace and Loon

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.760
Uncle Hairy too

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.180
My mum and my dad are all there with me and you!

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.540
Everybody sing Humf!

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.540
Humf and all the Stars

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.280
One evening, Humf was driving his favourite
truck around the window.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.040
It was getting dark in the sky and the streetlights
were coming on.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.180
And then the light came on in Humf's bedroom
too

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.130
Dad!

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.440
Hello Humf, I thought I might like to see
what you were doing

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.010
Supper time!

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.720
Ah it sounds like it's time to wash our hands.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.960
Humf wasn't tall enough to reach the sink
by himself and that's why he had a special

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.260
step to stand on.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.300
Uh-oh!

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.520
What happened to the light?

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.130
I think the bulb has blown.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.729
Oh

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.950
Not to worry, I just need to change the bulb

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.380
Humf's dad was very clever and Humf liked
to help him when he was doing clever things

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:56.170
Humf's dad looked for a light bulb in the
cupboard and Humf helped

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.159
A-ha! A-ha!

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.220
Can I carry the lightbulb?

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.229
Ok Humf

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.780
Humf's dad was very clever

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.750
Ok I need the lightbulb now Humf

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.230
And Humf liked to help him when he was doing
clever things

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.360
Umm...

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.400
Actually Humf, can you hold the torch for
me?

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.770
Humf liked shining the torch about, it was
very bright.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.750
Um, Humf, you need to shine it up at the ceiling
so I can see what I'm doing.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.380
Oh!

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.960
So Humf shone the torch up at the ceiling
but it wasn't easy

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.900
Left a bit, I mean on the ceiling not on the
wall.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.550
That's it! Oh dear, I can't reach

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.440
Humf's dad wasn't tall enough to reach the
lightbulb by himself

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.280
Humf, wait, I thought you were helping me!

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.550
So Humf gave him his special step to stand
on

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.180
You can be tall, like me!

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.050
Thank you Humf, that was very clever

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:34.180
And then, Dad was tall enough to take out
the old lightbulb and put in the new one.

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.099
Humf helped me change the lightbulb

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.219
Well, he is a very clever furry thing.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.760
Must take after his dad

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.760
Uh-oh you blew out another lightbulb Dad

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.209
I didn't blow out the lightbulb Humf, all
the lights have gone out

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.909
It must be a powercut

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:11.290
Humf didn't know what a powercut was, but
he hoped his mum and dad knew how to fix it

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.170
Hm.. All the lights in the street are out

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.909
We'll have to wait for the power to come back
on.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.699
The car lights are still on

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.560
Look at all the little lights in the sky

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.460
Those are the stars Humf

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.360
The starlights are still on Dad

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.570
But the lights in the house were not working

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.440
So Humf's mum lit some candles and put them
on the table

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.740
Humf's mum was very clever too

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.060
This is nice

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.100
After dinner the lights didn't come back on
and Humf wondered if his mum and dad didn't

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.560
know how to fix a powercut

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.479
Mum? Why do candles wiggle about?

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.889
I don't know Humf

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.810
I think they just like dancing

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:30.800
Humf's clever mum put the candle in the bathroom
when he had his bath and Humf's clever dad

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.300
used the torch to read him a story

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.880
And Humf helped.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.380
And then the little green bus went back to
the bus garage and went to sleep.

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.919
And still the lights didn't come back on.

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.159
Goodnight Humf

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:59.400
It was very dark in the house with no lights
on but Humf didn't mind.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.770
He could see the starlights in the window

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.080
Can I have the curtains open? I like the starlights

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.020
Ok Humf, Goodnight

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.710
The powercut is over, all the lights are working
again. Good night again Humf.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.430
Goodnight again dad.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.940
Humf's clever mum and dad had fixed the powercut
after all.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.520
Goodnight little star lights, goodnight.
