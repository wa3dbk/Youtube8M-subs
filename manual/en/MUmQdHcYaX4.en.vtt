In the second row, the engine room, I\'92ve

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.630
gone for Sitaleki Timani and James Horwll.
Timani\'92s quite new on the scene but a very

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.929
big unit, very powerful, quite aggressive,
likes tackling people. So I see him as a good

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:23.799
option for the team and James Horwill, who
was out for much of last year with an injury,

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.320
is looking forward to coming back into the
team. He was captain when he got injured so

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.069
there\'92s good leadership there and a very
popular member of the team and a very capable

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.460
player, so he\'92ll be well rested having
not played for so long and I think that the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.819
whole of Australia is looking forward to having
him back. So with those two we\'92ve got two

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:40.819
very mobile forwards; good in the line-out
and good in the loose and in the tight for

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:41.819
that matter as well, so, good solid outfit
for the second row.\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri380\sl360\slmult1

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:45.819
\f1 \cf0 Yeah the back row in Australia is
a key area against the Lions, particularly

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.799
once we get into Australia the ground tends
to be a little bit firmer, therefore teams

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.170
tend to move the ball around and the roll
of the number 7 is very prevalent and I\'92ve

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.929
gone for David Pocock there who, we all know,
is a wonderful player. He was injured a little

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.600
bit last year and his replacement was Michael
Hooper who is a look-a-like for David Pocock,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.929
and it\'92s very difficult to leave Michael
out because he played so well and there is

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.360
a call\cf2 \cf0 to play both of them at 6
and 7, which would make it a very very fast

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.870
and competitive back row. The only problem
there is we\'92re missing a line-out jumper

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.530
and that\'92s probably where I\'92d go for
Scott Higginbotham on the blindside flank

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.220
at number 6, because he\'92s a big fellow,
good in the line-out, aggressive, tough, and

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.530
you need to have that sort of element. I think
the balance with him and Pocock at 6 and 7

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.530
is quite good with maybe Michael Hooper coming
on later. I\'92ve gone also at number 8 for

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.240
Palu, Wycliff Palu,\cf2 \cf0 who\'92s a big
ball carrying number 8. I\'92d like to see

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.769
him a little bit, pick up his work rate a
little bit more, because sometimes he can

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:51.209
go a little bit missing but he is a very good
ball player and a big man and I see the Australian

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.459
back row with what I\'92ve gone for, quite
balanced, but with some people coming off

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.650
the bench to certainly add to it at a later
stage during the match.\

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.340
\f1 \cf0 9 and 10 very key area. Will Genia
who, once again, was injured for most of last

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.140
year. We missed him a lot. He sort of, he\'92s
a great link between the backs and forwards.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.500
He lets the forwards know what he wants to
do and also his passing and service out to

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.420
the backs is very strong, but he\'92s also
a very dangerous runner. Oppositions have

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.129
got to keep an eye on him otherwise he\'92ll
go, and he scored a lot of trys from just

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:33.209
around the ruck just poaching around there,
so he\'92s a very key player and one that

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.370
once again we welcome back with open arms
from injury.\

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.989
\
At 10 it\'92s quite a difficult position,

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.670
I\'92ve opted for Quade Cooper who\'92s had
his troubles over the last 18 months or so,

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.439
both on and off the field. He got injured
at the World Cup in the play-off between third

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:52.370
and fourth and I just feel that he adds something
extra. If he can get back to full fitness

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.699
and playing like we know he can, I think at
10 he\'92s a match winner.\

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:01.699
\f1\b0 \cf0 Yeah the defence is something
of a bit of a question along that three-quarter

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.069
line. Berrick Barnes, I don\'92t think there\'92s
much of a question about him, an ex-rugby

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.719
league player, he tackles very well, he\'92s
got a very good technique. When I see Barnes

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:14.050
and Cooper swapping quite a bit between 10
and 12 I think it will be a fairly fluid arrangement

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.750
there. So, then at outside centre at 13 I\'92d
probably have Adam Ashley-Cooper, I think

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.680
that\'92s his best position. That\'92s the
position he likes playing. He\'92s very well

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.520
respected amongst the rugby community with
his defence and also for his powerful fend

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.930
and running with the ball. So those three
I think would be a threat in attack to the

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.270
opposition. I think the Lions would take notice
of them and need to really defend quite strongly

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.090
against them but also, the big thing that
they\'92ve got to do, particularly with big

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.039
centres running at them and big sort of flankers
and forwards running at, particularly Cooper\'92s

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.760
channel, they need to really have their defence
well organised.\

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.760

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.730
\f1 \cf0 Back Three\uc0\u8232
\b0 Yeah I think that Australia\'92s back

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:03.000
3 is potentially a weapon for us. I\'92ve
gone for Digby Ioane on one wing, James O\'92Connor

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.710
on the other and Kurtley Beale at full-back.
I think all 3 of them are very good ball carriers,

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.620
very dangerous when they\'92ve got they ball
in their own right and the 3 of them together

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.440
will form a very good unit. You look at The
Lions and they see those 3 at full-back, they

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.520
better make their kicking spot-on, because
any loose kicks or bad chase those 3 are going

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.500
to make you pay. I just think they\'92re a
very dangerous outfit. They\'92re also pretty

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.660
good defensively. Ioane plays a lot above
his weight in terms of ball carrying. He comes

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.280
in and helps around the rucks and mauls and
carrying the ball through there. James O\'92Connor\'92s

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.230
dangerous wherever he comes up and Kurtley
Beale\'92s a brilliant runner, so to have

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:50.500
people of that ability I just hope we have
them all available because last year, because

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.340
of injury at some stages throughout the year,
they weren\'92t available and it hurt us a

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.780
lot because the difference between some of
these guys and the next lot, with no disrespect

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.789
to the next people down, is a big mark of
difference.\
