00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.080
Hey guys.

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.590
I'm Grace and this is The Breakdown.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.560
So in the last couple of weeks we've seen
Irrational Games shutting down and Sony Santa

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.509
Monica's seeing massive lay offs.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:14.530
In the last few years we've seen Square Enix
not meeting their sales expectations, Nintendo

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.140
generally having a bit of a bad time and THQ's
bankruptcy.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.920
So that got us asking.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.260
Is the gaming industry asking too much of
us and what can they do to improve it?

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.630
As always, leave your opinions in the comments.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.439
First off let's delve into Take Two and Ken
Levine's recent announcement that Irrational

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.860
Games, the developers behind the popular Bioshock
series, was shutting down.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.860
What happened?

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.390
Well, Levine threw out a luxurious number
by anyone's standards that 200 million copies

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.470
of Bioshock Infinite would be sold.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.510
Levine wanted to reassure Take Two that it
would be a mega-seller.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.360
It wasn't, and only because it didn't sell
to the extent that Levine promised.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.350
I mean he even said homeless people would
ask for a copy of the game over change, which

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.780
is ridiculous and makes no sense.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.800
They'd ask for a console to play it on, and
a TV, and a home with electricity, you get

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.570
the idea and don't even get me started on
what he said about Ghandi.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.540
He asked too much of the world and the world's
response would be one of the reasons Irrational

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.280
Games has been deflated and packed away like
a bouncy castle at a party that had a lot

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.800
of hope until some kid dropped a brown number
in the middle of it.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.230
BUT that's not to say Take-Two is an example
of a company in crisis, and neither is its

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.620
parent company publisher 2K Games.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.850
Triple-A game development costs a lot but
when it comes to big budgets games, the money

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.040
being used goes towards better development,
technology, specs, narrative, innovation and

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.040
much more.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.170
Don't forget these guys own Grand Theft Auto.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.760
What we should have a look at is the death
of AA games, those games without the Hollywood

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.550
budget and without the indie soul.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.740
But before we get to that let me us my great
segway on you first.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.640
Levine was born in Santa Monica and the next
thing I'm going to discuss are the layoffs

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.620
by God of War developers Sony Santa Monica.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.760
Nailed it.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.130
Job cuts have been confirmed by a Sony representative
due to a cycle of resource re-alignment against

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.500
priority growth areas.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.430
I don't know what this means but it sounds
serious.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.180
Anyway, the last game these guys released
was God of War: Ascension which was rumoured

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.090
to cost as much as Modern Warfare 2 to make,
and sold just 360,000 copies in the first

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.060
month compared to the 1.1 million monthly
sales of God of War 3.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.650
Then you've got the news from developers IO
Interactive recently saying from now on they'll

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.080
only work on Hitman 6 and are no longer developing
any more additions to the Kane &amp; Lynch, Mini

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.920
Ninjas or Freedom Fighters series.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.630
The news followed financial difficulties from
parent company Square Enix who saw substantially

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.990
lower than predicted sales of Hitman: Absolution,
Sleeping Dogs and Tomb Raider and now they've

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.600
been carrying out major restructuring.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.090
Even though all three Square Enix games sold
over a million with Tomb Raider and Hitman

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.690
selling over 3 million they still came in
under the projected sales forecast accumulating

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.960
a $105 million loss for the year.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.489
The company expected 14.9 million in total
for all their games and the three biggest

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.910
titles of the year alone only sold 8.75 cumulatively
at the time.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.270
So how come even the big AAA titles aren't
meeting what they're predicted?

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.520
Is it because they're forecast too high because
they expect too much too soon from the world?

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.330
Square Enix are doing well but it's only their
forecasts that bring them in at an accumulative

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.330
loss.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.420
Its saving grace.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.280
Final Fantasy 14.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.770
Following around a Â£83m loss in the last
financial year, sales of the re-release of

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.290
Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn are reportedly
strong.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.110
But let's not forget the success stories.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.209
We've got Swedish studio Starbreeze has turned
round a 15 year loss in just six months.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.540
Previously recording a loss of $14.4 million,
the company in the last six months has managed

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.020
to generate a profit of approximately $16
million with games like Payday 2 and Brothers:

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.050
A Tale of Two Sons, both of which have done
well on Steam.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.300
So earlier I mentioned the death of AA games.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.950
Now to explain that game type briefly, its
not got a Hollywood budget but it's not indie,

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.060
its the THQ's Red Factions, Saints Rows 1
&amp; 2 of the world.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.139
But for some reason the gaming industry feels
like it needs to put a lot of money into the

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.180
game but do they really?

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.430
I'd be happier with a lower quality game that's
shorter, if the price mirrored the experience.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.720
Finallyyou've got Nintendo's Wii U sales issues
and THQ's bankruptcy which saw the company

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.120
split into parts and sold to the highest bidder.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.620
It's all going on and it seems that the gaming
industry is pumping too much money into development

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.169
and not making it back in sales.

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:48.589
Put it this way, just over 59 million Xbox
360s and 57 million ps3s have sold around

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:55.059
the world, if Ken Levine wanted to sell 200
million copies of BioShock Infinite every

00:04:55.059 --> 00:05:01.749
xbox 360 and ps3 owner would have to buy it
along with 84 million PC/Mac users.

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:07.389
It's like they've forgotten that not everyone
buys all the games, we can't afford all the

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:08.389
games!

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.139
In comparison the nearest media is a Blu-Ray
and games are double the cost and so realistically

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.809
you're only going to buy one a month and even
then you'll end up with a pile of shame of

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:19.169
all those games we haven't got enough time
to play.

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.389
So the games industry needs to stop pumping
a buttload of money into the game and expecting

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.230
everybody to buy every single one.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.710
What do you think the gaming industry can
do to improve this?

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.029
Let me know in the comments.

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.029
This has been The Breakdown.

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:34.250
