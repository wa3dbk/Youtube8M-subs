00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This week's Torah portion tells the story

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
of when the Jews receive

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the Ten Commandments.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You know the Ten Commandments, right?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Adonai is the only god.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Don't worship idols.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Don't take God's name in vain.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Do keep Shabbat.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Do honor your parents.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Don't murder.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Don't commit adultery.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Don't steal. Don't lie. Don't covet.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Yeah, *those* Ten Commandments

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that the Jews went to Mt. Sinai to receive.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Isn't is strange that the parsha isn't named

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The Ten or Commandments or Sinai

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and instead is named after

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Moses'  father-in-law Yitro,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Moses' non-Jewish father-in-law?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This week begins with Yitro,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
coming to see Moses

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and bringing along his whole family.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What he finds

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is Moses working himself to exhaustion,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
trying to answer all of the questions the people have

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and give all of the judgments to the Israelites.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
From morning to night,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Moses judges the people.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Who should get this lamb?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Who is responsible for this slave's injury?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
How shall we split this portion of wheat?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Morning, noon, and night,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Moses is providing judgments.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
His father-in-law, Yitro, like all grandfathers,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
would like to see Moses

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
spending a bit more time with his family.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Now, he has two ways to try and fix this.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The first, which is the easiest,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
is to lecture Moses on all the reasons

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
he should be spending more time

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
with his family and less time at work.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Moses probably would have felt guilty,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
promised to change his ways

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and then nothing would have changed.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Instead of lecturing Moses,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Yitro looks at it from Moses's point of view.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Moses knows that the people

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
need to have someone

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
helping them make these decisions,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but can only see himself acting as the judge.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Yitro offers another solution.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
A solution that meets the needs of Moses,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Moses's family and the Israelites.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Yitro suggests to Moses

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that he set up a system of judges and courts.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
He tells him that

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
men can be trained to make the decisions 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and help settle arguments.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Moses sees that his father-in-law

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
is making a wise suggestion

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and appoints judges

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
to make the decisions about splitting

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
a portion of wheat,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
taking responsibility for an injury,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and ownership of lamb.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Then Moses was able to go back to his family

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and share the responsibility of judging

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
with more of the community.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
This portion reminds us not only

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to pay attention

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
to the big commandments,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
but to look for solutions

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
before complaining to a friend

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
about their behavior. Yitro didn't just

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
complain to Moses, he offered a solution.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Think about times when you wished

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
someone would do something

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
in a different way.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Did you complain about what they were doing?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Or did you offer them a way to do it differently?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
This portion tells us

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
that we have the responsibility

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
to help others with suggestions

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
rather than just complaints

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
How can you be a little bit more like Yitro?
