00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:24.875
  Hello?

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.760
I was influenced by my older brother.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.260
 My older brother was part of the underworld.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.720
I was just a low-ranking moneylender.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.820
   I used to...just be a money collector.

00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:42.705
My name is Minkyu Lee and I have two jobs. I'm a chef at a pizzeria and I'm a dog breeder.

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:45.845
I breed dogs and I sell dogs.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.960
It took a year and a half to start professionally. Before that, I did it little by little...just as a hobby.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.580
It was a side job that became a full-time job.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.480
This opportunity came when I first got to know about the large dog breed, the Great Dane.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:09.880
At first, after I raised small dogs, I wanted to try raising big dogs. Great Danes are the biggest dogs.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.760
I'm going to try to raise a big dog, so it should be the biggest dog.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.100
So, I got to know a few people from a dog club that I'm a part of, and they said,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.000
 "We know you like dogs. So instead of spending money on dogs, how about earning money from dogs?"

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.720
First, do you know that I really hate working? Uh...I really hate sweating.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:41.420
But because I like breeding dogs, it's not hard work. Also, I don't get stressed from customers.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.200
In this job, I can say, "Buy if you want to. Don't buy if you don't want to." To be honest, I have the final say.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.720
Presently, business is still very good because there aren't many big dogs available.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.120
Frankly speaking,

00:01:53.434 --> 00:01:55.534
 it's fine. It's fun.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.540
Later, after becoming closer with my customers, they ask me what I originally did.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.700
They never think that I was always a dog breeder.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.500
So I just say, "I've always done this job."

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.340
