Hi I'm Ashleigh.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.160
Hi I'm David.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.650
We are the school captains of Forest Lake State High School.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.920
Welcome to our school, let's show you around.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:27.570
[singing]

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.060
So we're here with Miss Sleeman who is the head of the department for the arts at Forest Lake High School and she's going to tell us a little bit about it.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:42.450
Basically the purpose of music extention is to let those kids experience what it would be like to be a performer, or composer, or musicologist so they can take that further.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.840
They can go to university or TAFE or some of them might just choose to continue playing and loving music after school, which is really what we are here for.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.000
Year 8s can choose arts, dance, drama Music.  They get a term each - a bit of a taster.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.050
Right through to Year 12 where you know we offer things like music extention, we've got fashion design, design, media studies, music studies - there's basically every subject that you would want to do.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:16.000
We've just bought some MacBook Pros and the kids get the opportunity to create movies, they can film in the blue screen, in After Effects and there's so many opportunities for kids.  Its really fantastic, some of the work they are producing

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.850
[drumline plays]

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.050
So the drumline is one of the ensembles that we have here at Forest Lake, one of the four groups that we have. 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.050
The kids really seem to enjoy it - really love it.  It's really popular. Everywhere we go everyone wants the drumline to play.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.870
So start on the bottom and drag up.  We're just trying to make it as smooth as we can.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:44.630
As you can see behind us here, this is the Year 11 construction class. Each student is completing a Certificate 1 in construction.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.980
They are achieving this by working in conjunction with an organisation known as CSQ, Which stands for Construction Skills Queensland.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:01.250
My role's is one of mentoring first and foremost. We interview the students in Year 10 to become part of our Doorways to Construction Program.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.490
And a big part of the Program is putting them out on work placement. And the idea behind that is we give them a taste of the trade they want to be.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.500
I am hoping to try and get a school-based apprenticeship in my work placement.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.740
Love your work. Thanks guys.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:34.260
Students can do and be whatever they want at our school. For students who are more academically capable, the Lighthouse Program provides a greater challenge. It offers the same curriculum but goes into greater breadth and depth.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:43.650
Welcome to the Student Enrichment Centre. It is probably the most important part of our school. It is what makes our school so wonderfully diverse.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:53.900
[Teachers helping students]

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:03.120
We've got a very very strong special education program at this school. Students with a disability add a very special dimension to our school.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.270
[Whistle Blows]

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.920
Mr Webb Could you please tell us a little bit about the sports program here at Forest Lake.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:32.000
Yes I'd love to tell you about the sports program. Here at Forest Lake we offer a variety of different sports to cater for all the different children that attend our school. So we try to make sure that everyone at our school's catered for for all the different sports that are offered from the Greater Brisbane area.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:49.090
The school was built specifically as two schools within a big school. The community were very very concerned about their students getting lost in a large school, so we've got a designated junior secondary school.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.360
In our school the teachers come to the students, so the students tend to be in a home classroom when they are in Year 8.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.970
So Mr Culverhouse, key question - What is the PRIDE Program?

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:12.780
The PRIDE Program's put in place for behaviour and recognition in our school. It's about rewarding kids for the good things they do. And correcting them when they do things wrong.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:25.930
We provide students with daily rewards with a sticker process where they get a sticker for doing the right thing in the classroom or in the playgroud and that way they can build up a bank of those stickers and trade them in for positive rewards and items.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.800
[Off camera] The staff really care about our students. 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.980
I think the relationship staff form with the students is incredibly special.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:45.230
The students really do appreciate what we do for them because you'll see the past students come back to say hello. They want to keep the bonds going and keep the friendships and connnections.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.020
[Off camera] When they see you when you're out in the shops...

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.740
YES!! They'll run right across the shopping centre to say hello!

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:01.250
The subjects I'm taking currently at Forest Lake State High School help me decide on what I want to be when I'm older, as well as choose my university subjects and degree.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:10.570
What I think make Forest Lake State High School special is that no matter who you are or where you come from there's just this general sense of equality and positive engery within our learning envirnoment.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.590
We are proud of our school

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.050
Thank you for sharing a day in the life at Forest Lake State High School

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:24.460
Welcome to the Student Ehancement Centre. It is probably the one of the [mumbles]

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.830
Take Three

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.660
