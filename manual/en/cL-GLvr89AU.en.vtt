00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:05.982
What am I doing with my life?
I just want to connect.

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:08.484
Why can't I connect with people?

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.653
Oh, right.
It's because I'm dead.

00:00:12.238 --> 00:00:14.782
I wish I could introduce myself,
but I don't remember my name.

00:00:15.687 --> 00:00:17.410
I think it's started with an "r".

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.288
But that's all I have left.
It's kind of a bummer.

00:00:20.538 --> 00:00:22.999
I shouldn't be so hard on myself.
I mean, we are all dead.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:26.336
This is my best friends. We even have
almost conversations sometimes.

00:00:31.382 --> 00:00:33.009
They call these guys, "bonies".

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:35.011
They'll eat anything
with a heartbeat.

00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:36.638
I mean, I will too, but...

00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:40.099
At least, I'm conflicted about it.

00:00:44.524 --> 00:00:45.897
Nice watch.

00:01:03.383 --> 00:01:04.290
Be

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.541
dead.

00:01:10.785 --> 00:01:12.131
It's too much.

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:17.929
- Don't be creepy, don't be creepy.
- What are you?

00:01:19.472 --> 00:01:22.600
This is a corpse
infected with the plague.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.978
It is uncaring, unfeeling,

00:01:25.978 --> 00:01:27.605
incapable of remorse.

00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:29.482
I don't understand,
but he's changing,

00:01:29.732 --> 00:01:31.150
and he feels,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.027
and he's learning
to be human again.

00:01:33.277 --> 00:01:34.904
- Oh my God, is that him?
- Yeah.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.949
'sup?

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.326
You started something here.

00:01:40.576 --> 00:01:42.287
Whatever it is what you too have,

00:01:42.537 --> 00:01:44.414
it's infecting the others.

00:01:44.664 --> 00:01:48.001
- They're somehow curing themselves.
- They are not curing themselves.

00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:51.963
Come with me.

00:02:00.324 --> 00:02:02.056
Shoot on sight.
We have a breach.

00:02:05.226 --> 00:02:07.769
- You're changing everything.
- Corpses are fighting skeletons.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.620
- Who do we shoot?
- Shoot this!

00:02:12.275 --> 00:02:12.901
Hi!

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.781
How did you die?
How old are you?

00:02:19.674 --> 00:02:21.067
You could be twenty something.

00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:24.078
But you could also be a teenager.
You have one of those faces...

00:02:24.328 --> 00:02:27.912
