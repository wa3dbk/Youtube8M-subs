00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.870
Today we are going to be taking a look at
the GoPro Jaws Flex mount for all models of

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:14.139
the GoPro action sports cameras and also the
new Hero Three Plus part number ACMPM-001.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.980
The GoPro Flex Clamp can be mounted to pretty
much anything from a quarter of an inch all

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.980
the way up to 2 inches.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.090
It is in a simple quick release style clamp.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.740
It has this ratcheting strap on the inside
of it, pull it tight around the object here

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.200
and you just pull this ratcheting strap tight
and it would press up against these two pads

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.440
here creating a really nice and snug hold.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.080
Now the teeth right here of the clamp do pivot
to give you a nice solid grip, so instead

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.060
of it being rigid by a inaudible 00:00:46
or some other clamps, it will clamp flushly

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.270
against different things that you are going
to be securing it to.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.870
The flex arm itself can quickly be released
and removed by pinching these two tabs together

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.150
and simply just pulling this off.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:02:25.560
With this removed, this will allow you for
more 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:03:06.930
of 
the low profile angle.
