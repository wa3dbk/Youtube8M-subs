00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.820
I only have a little experience in coaching, excepted with my players in Lyon,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.300
I've never managed team.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.400
At this moment, everything is right, it's easy, it's just the warm-up.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.989
I can count on some experienced players I have, to manage this kind of situation.

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.300
There are some captains, coach/player in the team too.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.559
I think when the game will start, I will leave the pressure to my players,

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.720
and me, I'm here to evaluate them.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.360
We are firstly here to evaluate players.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.780
It's complicated to propose a special play philosophy, because we don't know well the team

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.740
we will play, it will change.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.590
So I think we will play in the same way that we started the game.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.190
We will keep the same system, that it was performant

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.550
at the end of the first half.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.400
It was in accordance with that I saw in the past. There were two girls that I didn't know.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.470
I was pleasantly surprised by the fact they join the group.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.000
The girls will almost all play the game against Italy.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.320
From tomorrow morning and the next training course in Nantes

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.880
we will work on phase of play.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.869
We will clearly base our training on the group performance.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.080
We talked a lot about values in French team,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.079
so if I can bring help to this group, it will be precious, it's the objective.

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.650
When we take part in a selection like this,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.410
I think it's to finish the job and with the willpower to win.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.560
Knowing each other and knowing players from different clubs

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.609
will also cement the gaelic football in France.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.240
It's wonderful to see how people answered the call, played the game,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.800
involved in the project.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.070
It's also important to see how players

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.669
gave one's all during this week-end.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.480
The objective is to perpetuate the project. We didn't decide yet the future but the aim

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.840
is to capitalize the experience of this course and the 20 september's one.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.840
And of course, the game on november 15th, to renew the project, the experience,

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.480
and continue this selection.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.760
Congratulations to everyone. The play level, the involvement,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.280
the fair-play, the behavior were exemplary.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.880
Personally, I spent a great week-end.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.920
Congratulations to everyone.
