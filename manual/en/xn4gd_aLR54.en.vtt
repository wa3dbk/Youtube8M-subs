00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.800
Hi, today we're going to talk about the use
of what are called rocker- soled shoes in

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.680
treating pain under the ball of the foot,
pain in the big toe joint, and pain at the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.059
heel and problems such as plantar fasciitis.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.910
Now, when we normally look at using a shoe,
this is a pretty normal athletic shoe, pretty

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.029
firm heel and pretty stable, and like most
good shoes, it'll bend naturally where the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.029
toes bend.

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.259
Now, for most people, that's fine.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.989
We can take a decent orthotic, either a full-size
orthotic for athletic shoes, or a much smaller

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.100
device for dress shoes and if the people are
having pain in the big toe joint or under

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.600
the ball of the foot, those will do a great
job of taking stress off those tissues and

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.180
making them feel better.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.262
But for some people, they continue to have
pain even with the orthotics and a lot of

00:00:46.262 --> 00:00:50.410
that is because as they walk forward, they're
putting a lot of pressure on the ball of the

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.410
foot.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.770
For example, this type of shoe allows you
to go like that, and as you go like that,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.269
you're putting really tremendous pressure
on the ball of the foot, and the big toe joint

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.040
is asked to bend a lot, which is normal, but
if you, for example, have arthritis in the

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.090
joint, it may not be able to do that without
pain.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.200
So one option is to get a shoe that has what's
called a rocker sole.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.140
Now a shoe with a rocker sole is completely
rigid on the front.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.630
I can't bend it.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.439
This is an excellent running and walking shoe,
a brand called Hoka, H-O-K-A, that has a great

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.439
rocker.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.050
And because it has a rocker, as you walk through
the step, you're not being asked to bend the

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.789
big toe joint.

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.250
And rockers have been used for over a century
now as a way to transfer pressure off the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.630
ball of the foot and get it to a part of the
foot that is less painful.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.330
They also do a great job of taking pressure
off the heel and putting that pressure forward.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.580
So this is a great rocker for an athletic
shoe but you need rockers on dress shoes also.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.479
Here's a dress boot from a company called
Earthy that has a great rocker on it.

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.939
So that really does decrease pressure on the
ball of the foot and compression in the big

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.039
toe joint.

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.579
You can do that with a really good custom
orthotic like this, such as made for a dress

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:08.579
shoe.

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.640
There are also some pre-fabricated orthotics
you can find on our website.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.380
Here's even a much higher heel stiletto that
has a platform and a rocker.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.690
So if you go to our website, do a search for
"rocker-soled shoes."

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.160
You'll find a page there that lists not only
some information on rockers, but lists all

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.840
of our favorites, whether they're for dress
shoes or for walking shoes.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.350
And in addition, you'll find information on
the best over-the-counter and custom orthotics

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.480
that can help this problem.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.370
Again, go to the website, do a search for
"rocker soles."

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.650
Also, please, if you find this information
helpful, please subscribe to our videos and

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:56.409
we'll let you know as soon as a new one comes
out.
