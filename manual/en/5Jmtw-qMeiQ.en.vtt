00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.160
Hey, I'm Rachel

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.979
and this is "Dressed To The Nines."

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:09.150
Summer party season is bringing

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.269
out some fierce stems!

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.709
Here we go with our red carpet round up!

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.340
Blake Lively looked incredible at

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.590
the premiere of Turbo in New York.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.880
She showed up to support hubby

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.320
Ryan Reynolds in Burberry Prorsum resort 2014.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.320
The look was simple

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.660
and chic with the shell tank

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.120
and embellished pencil skirt.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.580
Her nude "so Kate" Louboutin pumps

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.570
made her legs look even longer.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.570
HOT, Blake!

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.809
Diane Kruger was summer fresh in

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.260
Jonathan Saunders at the premiere of FX's
The Bridge.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.181
Her gorgeous chiffon dress was a

00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:43.000
big win on a warm summer night

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.030
and the choice of white Givenchy sandals

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.719
was the perfect way to round out the look.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.410
Looking great, Diane AND JOSH!

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.969
What a gorgeous couple

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.670
their summer fashion is on point.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.421
Emma Roberts went for the gold

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:56.660
at an event in New York.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.530
The starlet wore a white Editions

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.800
by Georges Chakra spring 2013 scoop neck playsuit.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.680
She added a white jacket with gold embellishments

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.230
a gold clutch and Schutz "Imalia"

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.500
strappy peep toe sandals.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.780
I love this look because she's appropriate

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.780
for an evening event

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.820
but still looks young and fashion forward

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.090
Nine West has some awesome

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.680
strappy gold sandals called Annie

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.610
and I'm DYING to get them!

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.400
They're a favorite summer party shoe

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.410
with their 4 inch stacked heel.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.630
These sexy sandals would help any girl

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.730
get her summer Amazon girl on!

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.310

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.040
Get ready for Guess Whose Shoe!

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.580
Which hot actress and musician lovin' mama

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.970
was sexy in studded pumps?

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.000
Here's a clue...she's a romantic comedy favorite

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.120
and the daughter of Hollywood Royalty

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.520
It's Kate Hudson!!

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.530
Goldie Hawn's daughter stunned in London

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.750
wearing an embellished Ellie Saab spring 2013
dress.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.860
The back of the frock had a beautiful train

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.450
that blew in the breeze to expose her

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.510
Christian Louboutin "Geo" studded pumps.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.200
I cant believe Kate has two sons!

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.640
I swear, she doesn't age!

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.680
You look amazing, Kate!

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.250
We saw the Louboutin "Geo" pumps

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.020
on Gweneth Paltrow earlier this year

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.540
at an Iron Man 3 event only she opted

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.140
to accent a black and white look

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.330
with the sexy studded toe stems!

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.450
They're so hot, they spice up both looks.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.820
It's royal baby week

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.750
and our shoe queen has us saying -- OH BABY!

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.900
All hail QUEEN!

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.200
This week our shoe queen is...

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200
Olivia Munn!

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.340
Olivia looked as sexy as ever in

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.570
Hollywood this week at the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.730
season 2 Premiere of the Newsroom.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.870
She rocked head to toe black

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.650
with a killer summer tan!

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.770
Her Thakoon Resort fourteen dress

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.390
featured simple but feminine lace

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.320
and hugged her amazing figure.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.130
At first glance form the front

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.020
her Guiseppe Zanotti sandals look simple

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.060
but have a gorgeous side structure

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.080
that highlights the shape of her feet.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.320
Congrats, Olivia!

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.170
You look smashing!

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.010
I hope you're sitting down for this one

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.680
it's time for shoe shock!

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.210
We were in shoe shock over Rosamund Pike's
look

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.000
at the premiere of The World's End in London.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.540
She opted for a sexy white dress

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.660
from Victoria Beckham's Spring 2013 collection.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.510
While the dress alone is beautiful

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.490
I'm not sure of her choice of the

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.060
exposed hot pink bra

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.561
and matching Ellie Saab heels.

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.000
The shoes are cool, but paired with the bra

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.340
it makes this ensemble less posh!

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.210
On the runway, the look was shown

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.260
in a demure and sophisticated black

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.540
and I like it much better than

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.459
the bright way it's worn here.

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.440
Try a nude bra next time, Rosamund!

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.090
Well, that's it for now.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.520
Check back next week for an

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.880
all new SUMMER episode of

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.150
