00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
The Fallaway Whisk this figure

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.429
commences backing line of dance &amp;123 and

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.670
finishes facing diagonal center try that

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.420
again this figure begins packing line of

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.850
dance or 123 and finishes facing

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.140
diagonal center and now for the man's

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.990
timing and alignments this figure begins

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.329
backing line of dance 123 and finishes

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.840
facing diagonal center and now for the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.570
man's foot positions left foot back

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.360
right foot to the side and slightly back

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.090
left foot crosses loosely behind right

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.690
foot in fall away position and now from

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.260
a different alignment left foot back

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.289
right foot to the side slightly back

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.230
left foot croc crosses loosely behind

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.309
right foot in fallaway position and now

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.150
for the footwork toe heel toe heel toe

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.680
heel and now for the ladies timing in

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.500
alignment we commenced his figure facing

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.830
line of dance 123 and we finish facing

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.900
diagonal center against the line of

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.049
dance and now for the foot positions

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.130
right foot forward left foot to the side

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.829
right for crosses loosely behind left

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.420
foot in follower position and now from a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.700
different angle right foot forward left

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.340
foot to the side right foot crosses

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.680
loosely behind left foot in follower

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.390
position and now for the ladies footwork

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:06.700
heel toe toe heel toe here and now for

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.140
the technique in this figure

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.280
general we're going to start off

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.010
standing on your right foot now this way

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.990
that you have from the prior figure I'd

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.480
like you to maintain as you lower and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.010
use your range of motion through your

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.680
right leg and hip instead of dissolving

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.290
this way i want you to maintain thats

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.870
way for the next two steps 12 now as I

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.550
lower and rotate through my range of

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.620
motion I want to think of creating a

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.010
curved line through those next two steps

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.560
knowing that the ladies on the outside

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.019
of the turn so we're going to be aware

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.930
not to turn our upper body's too quickly

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.600
I'm going to keep my right side forward

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.540
diagonally forward to her as long as

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.150
possible it's very important I turned

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.030
towards the camera not to be overactive

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.330
in the torso turn relative to the base

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.000
so if I face the camera and I rotate

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.519
through my range of motion through those

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.100
next two steps i'm keeping my right side

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.070
forward so that when i go into my fallaway

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.600
position I can then make the

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.760
transition of my upper body so i'll

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.950
demonstrate that with heather i think

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.780
we'll back the camera for this you have

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.989
a better view so i rotate to the inside

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.780
of turn curving allowing her to come

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.880
around me and then I'm still maintaining

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.900
my shape

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.329
ok now from this position we're going

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.579
into a fall away position so I want you

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.769
to think again of these three points

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.700
feet the low Center slightly turned to

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.410
the right of the feet and then the high

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.450
center turned even further to the right

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.610
than the low center and that is the

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.920
position we're going to achieve as we

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.049
cross behind we're going to have a

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.180
strong sense of pulling across through

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.900
our thighs are hips our ribcage even

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.940
though we're stepping toe heel toe heel

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.730
there's a strong diagonal shape there

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.459
now the reason we need that is because

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.200
if we maintain that sway to the right

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.000
too long there's a strong possibility

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.430
that will continue moving backwards and

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.040
of course once we finish this fall away

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.380
whisk we want to of course come

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.480
word in our promenade position okay so

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.610
I'll back the camera for this we have

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.020
one two three

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.940
now I'll just finish off by saying that

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.600
as I dance from my right side being

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.000
forward and I create those diagonal

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.040
shapes that we've talked about i want to

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.090
feel that my upper body then can my

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.820
elbows and arms may dance across my body

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.460
to allow this portion if I just stand

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.830
towards the camera here just simply let

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.370
my ribcage to my hands and arms move

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.980
across me now not too far across because

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.810
we do not want the lady too far behind

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.640
are hip but definitely we're going to

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.940
pass the lady across to that right side

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.600
that i'm standing up okay and now for

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.890
the ladies

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.780
so for this figure ladies what I'm

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.450
trying to think about is I'm very very

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.540
aware of my right side traveling forward

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.630
even when my second step is a sidestep

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.030
what I think tends to happen for the

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.850
ladies here is the minute the foot

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.180
position is aside the body thinks side so

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.490
I have a little rule that I feel within

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.490
my body that my body is always traveling

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.500
forward at all times even when it

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.420
appears and looks like it's traveling

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.300
backwards my elbows and my back belonged

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.180
to my partner I never ever ever think of

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.240
taking my upper body backwards ever at

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.510
any time so sometimes ladies when

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.790
there's a foot position that side

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.290
don't ever think that your body is

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.720
traveling side even when the foot

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.690
position is side still feel that you're

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.580
traveling forward through your partner

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.430
now when i use the word forward don't

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.830
think forward as as far as a pressure

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.690
point through the body just think

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.910
forward pick up the spine if you're

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.880
always aware ladies of your abdominal in

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.150
central area to directional actions that

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.250
won't ever be a specific pressure point

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.840
that comes out through your body will be

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.900
a neutral feeling of energy but not of

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.810
pressure so what I feel in this figure

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.330
ladies is I'll just I'll just try this

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.750
Viktor again is I'm going forward and as

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.520
I take this next figure I'm

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.830
thinking basically only of my waist

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.860
turning and as they turn my waist for

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.560
the actual whisking action my back and

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.110
my body still feel poised very very

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.569
forward towards the man so try not to

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:40.150
allow the shoulder blades or the back

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.729
to collapse down and that's something I

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:46.030
have to be very very aware of because i

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.889
have quite big shoulder blades and if

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:50.169
they're not picked up this area can look

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:52.509
heavy so the center is always picked up

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:54.940
I'm always aware of my waist area

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.139
turning so my back can appear light and

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:05.400
forward at all times
