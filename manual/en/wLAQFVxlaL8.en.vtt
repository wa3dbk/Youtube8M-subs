00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.620
- [Voiceover] Whether
you call it "poo-tinn",

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:03.890
or "poo-teen",

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.160
I just call it good.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.860
First thing we need for making our gravy

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.360
is we need a roux.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.730
And I'm gonna start with
a quarter-cup of oil.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:13.800
And to that, we're gonna add

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.640
a quarter-cup of all-purpose flour.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.840
And we're gonna mix it in
and start heatin' it up.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.400
After a few minutes of cooking,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.810
our flour's gonna pick up a little color.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.310
Whenever it does that, we're gonna start

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.380
adding our stock.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.450
I'm using two cups beef broth,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.520
and two cups of chicken broth.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.450
But you can use any
kind of ratio you want.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.360
You can just use one if you want.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.360
Chicken stock is good, beef stock's good,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.540
turkey stock.... oh, awesome!

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.130
After we get our stock good and hot,

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.660
it's gonna thicken up.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.170
And at that time we're gonna season it.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.360
I'm just gonna go light on some

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.470
black pepper,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.140
I think the store-bought broth

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.510
already has enough salt.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.840
But you can adjust that to your liking.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.180
And then, we're just gonna simmer this

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.510
for a while.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.450
We're gonna peel a couple of potatoes.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.800
I'm using the Idaho russet potatoes.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.680
To prevent my potatoes from turning brown

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.150
after I've peeled 'em,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.870
I keep 'em in a bowl of water.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.660
And we're just gonna push 'em through

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.460
the potato slicer.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.450
I'm using a three-eighths
inch blade today.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.900
After I slice the potatoes,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.730
I like to leave 'em in a bowl of water

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.200
for two, three hours,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.300
that gets some of the excess starch

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.570
off of 'em.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.090
But before I fry 'em, I need 'em dry.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.510
So I'm gonna put 'em on this wire rack,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.890
let 'em drip a little bit.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.910
And then just before frying 'em,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.620
I'm gonna use a clean kitchen towel

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.430
to make sure they're dry.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.620
(oil crackles)

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.750
Let's test our oil.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.020
Eh, that's just about
what I'm looking for.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.330
'Cause the first fry,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.160
we're gonna do at a low temperature.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.960
If you have a thermometer

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.480
you're looking at about 330F.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.430
When they just get some color on 'em

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.690
we're gonna take 'em out,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.870
let 'em cool down,

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.500
and we're just gonna keep

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.500
working in batches

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.320
until we get 'em all fried up.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.210
For the second fry,

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.180
we've heated the oil up to 375 degrees F.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.210
We want these things really cooked now.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.220
And all we're really doing
is crisping the outside

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.220
a little bit,

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.630
puttin' more color on 'em.

00:02:14.454 --> 00:02:17.350
After a few minutes
they've got a nice color.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.860
We're gonna take 'em out,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.400
put 'em on some paper towels

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.710
and hit 'em with some salt.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.230
You wanna salt 'em

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.740
right after you take 'em out.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.100
To our bowl we're gonna
add some cheese curds.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.010
Yeah, you have to use cheese curds.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.580
Wellll, everybody says you have to, but

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.940
you know, if you only got cheese,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.310
use cheese.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.050
But yeah, these are real cheese curds.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.080
And we're gonna put
some gravy in our bowl.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.850
Yeah, put gravy in dere.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.900
Yeah, that's what I like.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.380
And then we're gonna add our fries

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.260
to the bowl.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.910
Or, pommes frites.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.160
Then we're gonna plate this up.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.120
But I think it needs a little more gravy.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.720
Actually, it needs a lot more gravy.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.340
So, how is it?

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.300
Gotta have some cheese curd,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.300
fries, gravy.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.440
Yeah, mmm.
