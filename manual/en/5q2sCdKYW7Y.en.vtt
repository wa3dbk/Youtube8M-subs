00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.440
Carrier Aggregation, which is part LTE advanced and the 3GPP Release 10 standard

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.540
is an important technology being introduced to help meet target data rates for data hungry mobile device applications and services.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.180
We need more wireless bandwidth to keep up with demand of mobile subscribers.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.240
That is what wireless carriers keep saying.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.640
The problem, is that meeting the 150mbps down-link target set for LTE Advanced,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:45.160
requires at least 20Mhz of bandwidth and very few network operators deploying LTE have sufficient contiguous spectrum,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.760
meaning all 20Mhz is next to each other.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.180
Carrier aggregation addresses this problem by combining discrete radio channels within and across bands to increase user data rates,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.760
reduce latency, and increase the capacity for wireless subscribers.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.180
Its like taking several two lane highways.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.860
One from over here and one from over there and combining them together.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.840
Separately they can both each handle a certain amount of traffic.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.760
Combine the two together and you can handle twice the traffic

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.040
but, the real benefit of combining them comes from more efficient use of the available capacity.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.780
On a single two lane highway, you might get stuck behind a slow driver and not be able to pass.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.700
Whereas on a four lane highway, if highway aggregation was possible, you would have more options for passing the slow driver

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.980
and getting to your destination faster.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.280
The same thing holds for using wireless spectrum.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:44.320
Aggregating multiple carriers together, enables improved efficiency so more people can be served, average data rates increased, and the latency or delay of services will be reduced.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.920
Because this technology is so important to meeting the needs of wireless subscribers and carriers,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.900
there's a lot of work happening right now to make it available in commercial devices and networks.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.760
Somebody needs to make sure that the technology really works and that is where Spirent comes in.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.920
Our portfolio test solutions address wireless networks, devices, and services.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.720
To ensure that LTE Advanced Carrier Aggregation functionality meets performance expectations, we offer three types of solutions.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.740
First, for testing mobile devices, we offer the CS8 Mobile Device Tester.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.340
The CS8 is the industry's simplest and fastest tool for verifying the design of mobile devices

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.680
and it now includes the capability to test carrier aggregation.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.560
You can follow the link on the screen for more information.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.080
Second, VR5 Channel Emulator, helps test the RF receivers in wireless infrastructure and mobile devices by supporting

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.560
up to eight simultaneous RF channels with different MIMO configurations.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:50.980
With support for bandwidths up to 100Mhz, the VR5 can be used for carrier aggregation testing of both LTE chip-sets and network infrastructure.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.280
Please follow this link for more information.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.640
Finally, for testing the end-to-end performance of wireless services either in the field or in the lab,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.040
Spirent's Service Experience Solutions measure the overall mobile experience.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.640
These tools measure voice quality, call performance, data throughput, battery life, and video quality.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.000
All of which need to be verified when carrier aggregation is enabled.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.640
Here's a link for more information.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.020
Now we'd like to quickly show you the CS8 Mobile Device Tester and how it is used to test carrier aggregation.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.760
First, you need to know that the CS8 is a network emulator.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.960
It tests mobile devices by emulating the entire wireless network.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:42.680
It gives you control over RF, protocol, and core network settings through either interactive GUI, a programmable API, or a simple automation environment.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.700
For a quick demo, I will be using our CS8 Mobile Device Tester connected to a test mobile that supports carrier aggregation.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:58.340
Here is the CS8 test explorer we can select a carrier aggregation test and we can configure parameters easily using drop down menus.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.300
For example, here we are selecting the frequency bands for our primary and secondary cell.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.780
In the message composer we can verify all protocol messages and we can view message contents that are shared over the air.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:20.020
And finally, on the test mobile, we can run a physical layer throughput test to see that we are getting the benefits of carrier aggregation.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:30.620
In this case, we are getting approximately 70mbps for each channel which allows for the combined 140mbps throughput we expect.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.020
To learn more about carrier aggregation and Spirent Solutions, here are a few more comprehensive resources.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:47.080
First, you can download our carrier aggregation white paper, which details the design challenges of mobile devices at the physical, RRC, and MAC layers.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.720
You can also view our on-demand webinar that focuses on the mobile device test challenges of carrier aggregation

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.280
Thank you very much.
