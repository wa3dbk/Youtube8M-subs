00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:01.958
Campus life is not what you see in the movies

00:00:01.958 --> 00:00:03.000
[Campus Life in America]

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.917
I remember I was very shocked by campus life at the beginning.

00:00:06.917 --> 00:00:09.792
I was placed in a six person room with five other girls.

00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:10.917
I’m in a sorority. [Sorority]

00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:14.583
I like the experience cause I automatically have so many friends.
[Friends]

00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:17.042
When I first came here I was nervous, [Nervous]

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:21.250
but as time goes by you will learn about the city, you learn about 
the culture,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.167
and it’s much easier than before.

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:25.875
I think that makes you grow up so much and so fast. 

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:27.125
[Makes You Grow Up So Much So Fast]

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:28.167
and you have to know how to do certain things

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:29.500
like doing laundry and and washing dishes.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.375
I have my own kitchen, so I can cook with my roommates.

00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:35.500
So we have like our Tuesday night dinner date. [Tuesday Night
Dinner]

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.542
We’ll cook for each other.

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:38.083
The cafeteria? [Cafeteria?]

00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:42.292
Put it this way, it’s never going to be as good as your 
Mom’s cooking.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:43.917
Like, who doesn’t like a good burger I guess, 

00:00:43.917 --> 00:00:46.042
and that’s something you can always find here, rely on.

00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:47.708
A burger or a pizza [Burger Pizza]

00:00:47.708 --> 00:00:49.625
Well the most fun thing I do is traveling. [Travel]

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:53.708
I would encourage any international student to travel in the 
United States. 

00:00:53.708 --> 00:00:57.125
Take a road trip, like the Americans would do. [Road Trip]

00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:00.750
The country is so big that I get the opportunity to just look at a 
map and say,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.833
I want to see the Grand Canyon and then I can go and see it

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:07.250
Something that I did not know about American culture 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.708
is how friendly people can actually be. [Friendly]

00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:11.042
and how open minded they are.

00:01:11.042 --> 00:01:12.667
People smile at you on the street. [Smile]

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:15.125
I think that’s one of the things that surprised me the most.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:19.708
The way people use regular words to give it a meaning.

00:01:19.708 --> 00:01:22.667
Like I know somebody who says Awesomesauce! [Awesomesauce]

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:24.708
Or later alligator.  [Later Alligator]

00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:27.625
You don’t necessarily learn about that in the English classroom

00:01:27.625 --> 00:01:30.125
Sweet, like this is like slang. [Sweet]

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:33.625
There is this one: What’s up shorty? [What’s Up Shorty?]

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:35.667
It’s such a diverse place.  

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:41.042
You get to meet all kind of different people from different
countries with different backgrounds.

00:01:41.042 --> 00:01:47.500
And they are all very open minded to who you are 
and the way you do things.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.792
I had always thought of Peru as my only home, of course.

00:01:49.792 --> 00:01:53.375
So when I got here one of the things I learned is that you can 
actually have two homes.
