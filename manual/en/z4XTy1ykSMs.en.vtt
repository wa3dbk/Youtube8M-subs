00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.710
How to Drive a Semi.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.610
It takes talent and training to drive a semitrailer.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.290
See if you have what it takes to operate one
of these rigs on the open road.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.060
You will need A commercial driver license
manual or driving school A commercial driver's

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.100
license and good health.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.240
Step 1.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.349
In order to drive a semi, you must get a commercial
driver's license and pass a medical exam.

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.460
Age requirements vary from state to state
and can depend on whether you plan to drive

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.930
intrastate or interstate.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.250
People with epilepsy, diabetes that requires
insulin shots, or certain heart conditions

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.470
are not eligible to drive a big rig, though
individuals can apply for a medical waiver

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.070
from the ban.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.180
Step 2.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.120
Get your license by passing a general knowledge
written test and a road test.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.700
If you want to transport hazardous material,
drive a tanker, pull double or triple trailers,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.510
or engage in any other kind of specialty driving,
you'll have to pass tests for those specific

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.800
skills as well.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.960
Step 3.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.290
Do a pretrip inspection each time you hit
the road, and a posttrip inspection at the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.420
end of each day.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.000
Check out the tires and wheels, brakes, steering,
suspension, and the lights.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.939
Check the mirrors and double-check emergency
equipment like spare tires and tire chains.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.820
Make sure the truck is not overloaded and
the cargo is both balanced and secured.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.890
Step 4.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.799
Learn to accelerate correctly.

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.619
If you're driving a manual transmission, master
the fine art of double-clutching when shifting

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.940
gears so that you gain speed gradually without
jerking.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.390
Rough acceleration can cause mechanical damage.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.390
Step 5.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.860
Always have both hands on the steering wheel.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.320
If you don't, and you hit a curb or a pothole,
you could lose control of the rig.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.439
Step 6.

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.610
If you must back up, walk around the vehicle
beforehand.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.630
Look for objects behind and above your truck
that you may not clear when reversing.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.929
Then, put on your emergency flashers and back
up slowly, using the lowest reverse gear and

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.649
watching your side mirrors.

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.719
Don't ride the clutch.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.560
Whenever possible, back up and turn toward
the driver's side, where you have greater

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.890
visibility.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.890
Step 7.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.649
If traffic ahead is slowing down, tap your
brake pedal a few times to warn drivers behind

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.770
you, whose view you're blocking.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.770
Step 8.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.670
Signal well before you turn.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.190
If you can't make a right turn without moving
into another lane, turn wide and keep the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.610
rear of your rig close to the curb.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.120
For a left turn, make sure you have reached
the center of the intersection before you

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.550
start your turn.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.650
Step 9.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.550
Don't forget the most important rule of the
road: Never drive when you're sleepy.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.780
Eight-hour sleep breaks are not just suggested;
they're mandatory.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.580
Did you know Did you know?

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.150
Nearly 5 percent of America's 3.5 million
truck drivers are women, according to the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.470
2008 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
