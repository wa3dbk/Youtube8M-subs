00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.699
Mining Cable Splice Kit 3100 for flexible
conduit and jacket repairs and for splicing

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.750
mine and portable cable.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.110

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.339
Cutting and Cable Preparation

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.150
Square cut the cable ends that are to be spliced.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.610
Split the cable approximately 12” between
phases.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.320
Taper the jacket approximately 1”.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.170
Taper or bevel the ends of the insulation
to the conductor.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.860
If using cable types G or G-GC, pull the grounds
and ground check conductors out and tape them

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.579
to the cable jacket behind the split.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.790
If using two-conductor cable, cut one lead
approximately 6” from the end of the cable,

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.880
leaving the other conductor approximately
12”.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.720
Cut the corresponding conductors to match.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.180
If using three-conductor cable, stagger the
leads approximately 6”, 9”, and 12”

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.720
from the end of the split.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.250
Cut the corresponding conductors to match.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.960
Remove the jacket and phase insulation for
one-half the butt connector length or two

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.409
parallel connector lengths from each phase
end.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.780
Scuff and clean 4” of the cable jacket beyond
each taper or split end.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.080
Cut the ground and ground check conductor
to lie in between the connections of phases.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.280
Installing Connectors

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.780
Join the conductors one at a time using the
proper connectors (either butt, parallel or

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.700
modified crow’s foot) and appropriate crimping
tool.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.030
Be sure to insulate each conductor in sequence
before connecting the next conductor, ground,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.140
or ground check.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.739

that Scotch brand Glass Cloth Tape 27 or Scotch

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.920

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.819
Build up half-lapped layers of the tape, gradually
going out on existing insulation ½” past

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.489
the tops of the tapers.

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.310
The tape should be wrapped to a thickness
equal to or greater than the original insulation.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.170
Start ½” past the end of the Scotch brand
Linerless Rubber Splicing Tape 130C and apply

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.020
one half-lapped layer of 3M brand Temflex
Vinyl Electrical Tape 1700P over the 130C

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.650
tape, extending ½” past the other end of
the tape.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.210
If the cable includes a ground check, the
ground check connector should be wrapped with

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:32.230
one half-lapped layer of 3M brand Temflex
Electrical Vinyl Tape 1700P, extending ¼”

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.590
onto the existing insulation. Follow with
one half-lapped layer of Scotch brand Linerless

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:45.650
Rubber Splicing Tape 130C, extending ¼”
past the 1700P tape. Then using the same ¼”

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.360
overlap, add a final layer of half-lapped
1700P tape.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.620
Connect the remaining ground wires.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.680

31 across the splice and continue 2” past

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.240
the end of the tape.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.270
Always wrap the 31 tape toward the machine
end of the cable.
