00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:05.170
Today on our 2014 Chevrolet Sonic, were going
to be test fitting the Rhino Rack Vortex Aero

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.810
Roof Rack System.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.100
Were using part numbers RRVA118S-2 for our
crossbars.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.270
We use that part number for the silver.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.690
Theyre also available in the black as part
number RRVA118B-2.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.020
Weve got the RRLKVA foot packs.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:28.919
This is a 2500 series foot pack and were using
Fit Kit number DK327.

00:00:28.919 --> 00:01:09.360
Now when applying, I want to show you how
to assemble the final 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:22.790
foot 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:04:55.880
kit here.
