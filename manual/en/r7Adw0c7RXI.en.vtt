At the Blender's Simple Tasks Complications Office, they're hiding a secret for making a bake with multiple textures.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, I'm searching for a way in Blender 2.61.
First of all, I create (not mandatory) a group of 4 vertices.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:46.600
Now, with the 4 vertices enlightened (enabled), I can open a (UV) image to import.

00:00:54.133 --> 00:01:03.933
From my investigations, I discovered that I must use one and only one UV Map (to map) for all of the textures.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:35.533
When I select 4 vertices in the model view (where we are watching the box with the logos) the UV/Image frame is being changed automatically,

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:42.000
 by showing 4 "similiar" vertices, but instead they are coordinates.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:50.100
You can notice that I'm selecting all the "coordinates" but the vertices were not affected.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Here comes the secret: if I try to bake, the baking itself overrides my brand new UV Map.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:34.100
So I've done a new UV Map, but the active one is always the first ("UVMap images"). I kept its camera icon enlighted.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:46.200
Here, I'm setting my logos (2 textures under one common material) and pointing the map to the "UVMAP images".

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:03.600
Here, I'm overwhelmed by my thoughts, I did not think to make something for youtube but only for me!

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I'd already noticed some differences in results, between the game engine and the renderer.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:06.000
The textures must be "unchecked", because they're already UV mapped.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:17.100
In Blender it's like a strong box safe: if you wrong the combination, it locks up and the robbery is failed.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Here I forgot, for the Nth time, to enable the "Face Textures" feature, into the material tab.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.000
After a moment of admiration, for how a Leonardian mind could perform a so fascinating mechanism,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:25.100
I just remembered that I want to take a more control for my final result: I want a correctly "open" texture for my cube.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So I'm going to select an edges structure that must be cutted and not separated from each of them.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Now I selected a brand new UV image (named "imgbaked") created a while ago.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:30.100
 I have "UVMap BAKED" selected but with the transparent camera (disabled). It's enabled the "UVMap images" instead.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:40.500
With any slightly different steps, I always lose the old UVMap and the UV job itself.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I tried to make a bake for obtaining a clean result (only the "Textures") and also for have the shadows into the textures ("Full Rendering").

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:05.100
Although it's only a movie targetted for my memories, thanks for have been watched it and my apologies for the slanglish! See ya

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.100
You can watching it again without subtitles! Try it out... it's FREE!
