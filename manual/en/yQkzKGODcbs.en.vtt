00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Don't tell me maybe, maybe it's over

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Just leave me here and trust that we'll be fine

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
When I am quiet it's not that I'm agreeing

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
In a story like this, I know no word could change your mind

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's not scream, let's not cry, let's not fight

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Just say goodbye

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And now we go on our separate horses

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Don't look behind and live in defense

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Oh maybe one day we could have some tea again

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
But for now we'll drink some water to kill the bitterness

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Let's not scream, let's not cry, let's not fight

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Just say goodbye

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Let's not scream, let's not cry,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Let's not scream, let's not cry, let's not fight

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Just say goodbye

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Say goodbye

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Say goodbye
