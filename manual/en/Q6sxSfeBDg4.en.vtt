00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.510
We're at a special Teen Vogue screening of
the Maze Runner

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.740
but before we find out if these stars can survive the labyrinth

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.750
let's see if they can navigate this red carpet

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.190
This cast actually represents a lot of really
popular television shows

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.500
what do you think Game of Thrones fans
would like about The Maze Runner

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.520
Ooh!

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.580
- Um....there's death in it! - Oh good!

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.590
- That's a must for Game of Thrones fans! - I think all Game of Thrones fans must be obsessed with death by now.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.020
What do you think Teen Wolf fans are
going to like about the Maze Runner?

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.510
Um, I mean I think that - you know I
think they'll get a kick out of it

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.620
cause, uh, I think they'll like that world

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.430
if they love the Teen Wolf world, basically
like it's obviously it's not the same

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.140
thing and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.960
it's a completely different situation but
it's really imaginative in that way

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.970
It's not just another Young Adult adaptation.  It IS for everyone.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.480
- Well what makes it for everyone? What elevates this? - I think what elevates it for me personally

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.920
there's no love triangle
there's no time for that and this is a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.649
race to the finish from start to finish

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.920
and the you know the second the character opens his eyes you open your eyes

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.180
you're on the journey with him, and i like that, it's not easy

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.250
you have to really commit to it. - In Hollywood it used to be they would buy the rights to a

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.869
book and they would say

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.520
"bye-bye" to the author. But now, particularly with young adult genre

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.990
authors are sticking around.  how's it been? how's the journey been?

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.570
Man, this has been the highlight of my
career

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.770
from the very beginning the producers
talk to me they had me read the script

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:24.829
the director and I

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.600
got to know each other I was on set, I
mean

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.799
I just feel like Fox wanted me to be a part of it and contribute and it's just

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.950
as a huge film lovers it's been the highlight of my career

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.360
It is a big cast but you're the lead. How is it to transition
from a fan favorite but the best friend

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.259
on Teen Wolf

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.819
to the lead character?

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.009
It was a lot more days on set!

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.380
I I don't know it's it's good you know
i'd

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.049
I didn't even, I don't know I was there
everyday but

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.209
I didn't feel like I...

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:04.590
like the out and out lead, I felt like it was such an ensemble

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.590
I had so much support

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.140
like I do with Teen Wolf, was similar in that sense and I

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.590
never really felt like a everything
hindered on when I was doing

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.819
I play the role of frypan who's the cook of the glad and he's one of the keepers

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.319
so you know he's he's always around
Newt and Gally and Minho and when Thomas

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.840
comes he's

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.900
very much involved very much trying to
see what he has to say

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.970
night here two runs the maze and saw me
as one of

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.340
I yes it's not about the money man

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.389
what are you cooking to me what do you
put a lot of steel

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.870
okay okay you know how I wanted it to
don't yeah

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.130
ask what happens his to everybody has a
newborn rowing on some more

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.150
he wrote another some have a little more
homeless population went to the hospital

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.019
I was very very lucky to be given
material that I was giving

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.889
all you know has revisited think it's
very powerful emotional intensity

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.989
say this for nothing but a bowl or two
before our eyes by tell

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.150
write a book was it will inspire or
excellent

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.069
what is it about a bunch of boys left on
their own that so intriguing but also

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.709
dangerous

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.150
yeah I it's fascinating to me since I
read more the flies back in high school

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.359
and his this something about humanity

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.830
and and trying to

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.129
you know discover the way we would react
in this kinda situation so

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.200
was def inspired by Laura flies and I
can to get

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.340
my own route his cock my work lies

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.170
james's here

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.270
this is what would happen if you quit
boys together like they would band

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.050
together with you

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.050
and they would like to ride together and
he wouldn't be like

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.790
you know wooden turned vicious and in
turn violent in there and of course be

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.959
disagreements but like it would be
handled very

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.190
like I you know like it is like a scene
in the book and the movie

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.080
you know stories like like they playing
people I created this community for

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.750
themselves

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.290
in like the first thing that they come
up with the first rule is never harm

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.580
another

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.880
later like that's like really just such
such a difference

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.980
through my lord applies in just terms
and black james's

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.790
theory with people like you just nosey
because you believe so

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.459
so wholeheartedly like humans are
innately good and that this is how

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.160
you know that workout is beautiful I
think this has been a very secretive ad

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.380
campaign not a lot has been really

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.530
what do you say to her audiences see on
screen

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.800
when they got an amazing see the whole
thing as it is

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.290
disposal at little segment we're now at
like classical music promised to watch

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.120
as a film honestly genuinely

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.850
excited to see for them to see this cast
together I feel like none other people

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.410
haven't really seen one agree for looks
like and I think we've done a good job

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.590
keeping that under wraps

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.340
so when they see the movie I hope the
groomers pay our nom excited for the

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.400
adventure that takes

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.000
my back to West Palm did such a great
job treating this world

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.390
this adventures world I'll 0

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.840
dreamers amazes me characters

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.950
times and then just sit back relax and
enjoy the ride really involved

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.690
not the I think I think this is
something different that we're bringing

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.100
this means and i think im gonna

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.360
sheep
