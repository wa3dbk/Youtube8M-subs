00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.259
I’m Lee. I have a degree in architecture
and about ten years construction experience,

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:11.470
and we’re installing a new dishwasher. The
water inlet, which is, everything’s located

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:19.560
on the bottom. You just want to take some
Teflon tape and stretch it around the threads

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.699
before you even set the dishwasher up. &lt;P&gt;
Once you have wrapped the Teflon tape around

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:35.100
the threads, just take the compression fitting
nut, slide the compression fitting over. You

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.030
can reuse the old pipe, but it’s not recommended,
and then just insert the pipe into the valve,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.100
and just tighten this up until it won’t
turn anymore, and tighten it about three-quarters

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:58.050
of a turn past that. And then you’re going
to have to feed the water pipe and electricity

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:07.360
and the drain line through the cabinet wall
to be connected on the other end, to the switch,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.080
draining into the sink and pulling water from
the sink also. &lt;P&gt; Once you get everything

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.020
fed into the cabinet area, we’re just going
to take this piece of copper pipe, and you

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.140
want to bend a large arc. You don’t want
to just grab it and bend it- it’s going

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:33.670
to break, you’ll have a water leak- it won’t
flow right. And you just take off this nut,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.660
which is a compression fitting, and you can
use the new one, or we already have one on

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:52.570
there. And you just slowly, over a wide amount
of area, bend this copper pipe and slide it

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.670
into the valve, and then tighten down the
nut on that. &lt;P&gt; And once you have your supply

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:10.370
line and your electricity hooked up to the
switch, there might be an old drain here-

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:18.720
this one is in fact draining a leak from above
because we have not found the right hose yet.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:28.090
We want to slide this over- you need to take
this clamp off the old one- and you can take

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.770
it off and then throw away the old pipe, and
as long as you keep the clamp because it might

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:40.370
not come with new ones. Open it up to where
it’s big enough for the new drain line.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:49.810
Now, the hose on the top part of the drain
right here is always going to have a lot of

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.790
play in it. And that’s just because they
usually make them fairly large. But with this

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.180
cinched type clamp, you have no problem, and
no worry, and it does drain down into the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.940
pipe itself. And you just clamp it until it’s
tight, and that is how you would install a

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.719
new dishwasher in your kitchen remodel.
