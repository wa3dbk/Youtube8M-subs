00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.820
I am wearing the Mountain Hardwear women's
Super Light Plasmic jacket.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.860
As its name suggests it is ultra light weight,
it is packable and it is going to keep you

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.440
dry without taking up a lot of space or weight
in your pack.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.099
This jacket has got a 15D face fabric which
means that it is really light weight.

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.070
On the inside you have Mountain Hardwear's
Dry Q Evap.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.359
Which just means that it is going to wick
really well should you begin to sweat on the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.849
inside of the jacket.

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.530
But it is fully seam taped as well.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.559
This jacket is extremely breathable so Mountain
Hardwear has taken out pit zips, because of

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.989
the breathability of the jacket and because
of that Dry Q Evap fabric on the inside.

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.190
The features of this jacket are pretty simple.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.129
You have a full length water resistant zipper,
one adjustment point on the hem, simple Velcro

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:06.260
cuffs on both sides and a two way, fully adjustable
hood that is big enough to wear a helmet underneath.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.000
This makes it really great when it starts
raining really hard and you really need to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.650
batten everything down.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.370
Along with the light weight theme of this
jacket you have two simple hand pockets.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.080
They are set up a little bit higher so if
you are wearing a backpack or you are wearing

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.570
a climbing harness you can still access these
pockets.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.030
I'll note that there is no stow pocket or
stash pocket for this jacket, but you can

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.880
certainly turn one of these pockets inside
out and stuff the jacket in there.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.570
My first impression of this jacket was that
it was really airy.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.290
So when I put it on, it is really light weight,
but it also feels like it is going to protect

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.910
me from the rain.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.570
The fit is really good.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.030
I am wearing a small and I wear smalls in
other rain jackets of other brands and this

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.390
seems to fit really well.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.980
It is more of a relaxed fit so you can fit
some layers underneath of it.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.100
I am wearing a, you know, synthetic mid layer
and it fits really well with that.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.500
But I can see you getting some heavier layers
underneath of it as well.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.560
With the light weight, small pack size and
breathability of this jacket, you are going

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.850
to be sure to stay dry in the back country.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.060
It is the women's Mountain Hardware Super
Light Plasmic jacket.
