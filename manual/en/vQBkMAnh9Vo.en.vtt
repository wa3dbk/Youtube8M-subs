Hi, this is Gary with MacMost.com.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:11.190
On today's episode let's look at creating
Slideshows in the new Photos app.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.710
In Photos there are a variety of ways to start
a slideshow.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.560
Now there seem to be two main types of slideshows.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.619
One is kind of a quick slideshow and the other
is the one with all of the details and customizations.

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.540
A quick slideshow can be started by going
into your Photos Library and digging down

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.540
into Moments.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.180
You will notice that as I rollover the different
moments here I get this little control on

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.420
the right with a play button.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.079
Anytime you see a play button it means a slideshow.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.020
If I tap it I can see that I've got just some
quick options.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.480
I can select a theme and I can select music.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.370
I can choose from iTunes or certain theme
songs that are included.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.350
So once I have chosen one of these I can hit
Play Slideshow and it will just simple play

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.180
the slideshow.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:05.040
That's really the only options I've got.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.600
I can hit the Escape key to exit from that.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.590
Now I can also access similar functionality
if I go to an Album.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.330
So I'm going to go to the test album here
that I've got setup and notice that here I've

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.479
got that same play button.

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.850
Now it is on the toolbar here at the top.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.869
I have the same options to create a very quick
slideshow and just view it on my screen.

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.600
Now the more detailed type of slideshow is
actually a project.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.829
You have many different types of projects
like books and such in Photos.

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.150
You can create a slideshow by selecting an
Album or selecting individual photos, or going

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.439
to the Photos Library and selecting a bunch
there.

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.380
I'm going to just select this Album here and
then I'm going to go to File and Create Slideshow.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.290
It will allow me to name the slideshow.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.130
I'm going to use the same name as the album.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.490
I'm going to hit okay.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.200
Notice that it puts it in a Project section
here on the left sidebar.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.840
By the way if you don't see this left sidebar
go to View and then you can Hide/Show sidebar

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.040
right there.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.770
So you've got the test album here as an album
up here and as a slideshow here.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.869
Now I've got more options available to me
in this format.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.680
First thing is that I've got a list of all
the photos I've included and I can use the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.420
plus button to add more.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.450
I can also drag and drop the photos to reorder
them.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.160
I've also got this little bit of title text
here I can select.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.950
Once I have that selected I can actually edit
it here.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.660
So there is a lot of different things that
you can do.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.280
On the right I've also got the ability to
select a theme.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.280
I can select the music.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.670
So it is as before.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.840
I can choose from my library or wherever.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.930
I can also do some customizations like Fit
to Music, customize timing between them.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.290
I can change the Transitions and Speed.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.870
All sorts of things here on the right with
this button.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.500
So you have a lot more that you can do when
you create a slideshow project as opposed

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.510
to just a quick slideshow.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.700
You can also play it from here.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.620
You can do a Preview and you can also set
whether or not it loops.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.330
Another big feature of a slideshow project
is the Export button here at the upper right.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.659
Here I can select from three different video
formats and it will export it as just plain

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:25.819
video which means that once I have it exported
I can upload it to YouTube or some other sharing

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.250
service or to Facebook.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.150
So this is the ability to kind of share a
slideshow as a video.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.180
You can also have it automatically sent to
your iTunes collection there as well so then

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.560
you can see it appear on your other devices.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:46.530
It will say sync across on your home movies
using your iPad or iPhone.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.989
So you've got a lot of options there that
you don't get with your standard slideshow.

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.019
You have to create a slideshow project in
order to do this.

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.560
One great customization feature that you've
got is that not only do have this this text

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.959
here, which is part of the theme I chose,
but I can put text somewhere else.

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.370
So let me got and select this photo.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.050
I hit the plus button and I can add a photo
which is what you would expect the plus button

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.050
to do.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.520
But I can also add text and it will add text
to the currently selected photo.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.930
Now I can create a little bit of additional
information here for this particular photo

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:17.930
in the slide.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.260
So you have a little more ability to customize.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.350
Of course if you really want to create a great
slideshow with your photos it is probably

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.600
still best to go to iMovie where you can do
all sorts of things and have ultimate control.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.610
But for creating a very fast slideshow and
exporting it as a video you can use the Photos

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.020
app and the slideshow Projects.
