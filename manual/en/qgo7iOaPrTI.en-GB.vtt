00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.729
Our team in Malawi had plans to work with 136,000 people 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:17.859
across the rural area. 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.039
We chose Bokola and Kaniche as a representative community who 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.159
were willing to open up their hearts and their lives and tell the UK public 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:31.449
what it was like to live without clean water and safe sanitation.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.210
The issues that affected 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.700
the people of Bokola and Kaniche, 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.760
these included 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.760
inaccess to safe water, they were getting water from running rivers 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.900
but in the dry season they'd be 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.200
digging scoop holes in the river beds.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.510
So many of the people that we met on that visit 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.580
had incredible stories to tell, 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.830
but two people struck me the most. 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.940
Howard, a 17 year old boy, living in Bokola 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.590
was one of the only children I could find who actually went to school. 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.380
And even so he very rarely got to go. 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.140
In Kaniche I met Mary, a 22 year old mother of 2 young girls. 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.390
A mother who is HIV positive and her youngest daughter is 2. 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.390
Mary needs clean water more than anyone else to keep herself fit and healthy.

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:11.159
The Big Dig launched on 18 June 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:18.159
with the help of 31 commercial radio stations across the UK. 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.180
With this project we wanted to give our supporters the chance to really get to know 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.000
the people whose lives we were going to change. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.409
And to see for themselves the real impact of their support. 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.409
We did this by equipping our two partner staff, Michael and Nathan with simple mobile phones. 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.749
And they used Instagram to capture simple photos 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:48.219
and stories of work that was happening, day-in day-out in Bokola and Kaniche. 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:52.039
In the normal project, we just go to the community, 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:54.000
talk to them about hygiene 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.079
without taking some photos. 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.889
But with this it was like 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.299
part of motivating them, 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.029
when they saw you taking a photo and tell them that

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:08.369
"Oh this photo, we'll send it to the UK". 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:13.000
So they know that next time today I don't have a latrine, 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.289
I need to have a latrine so that when they take a photo of me and send it to the UK. 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:24.849
So it was also, it also contributes to the participation of the communities. 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.929
We created a simple blog, thebigdig.org, to 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:44.989
which we uploaded the photos and the stories that Michael and Nathan were capturing, 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.839
every single day of their visits to the villages. 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:53.989
The Big Dig also gave WaterAid the chance to use social platforms in a way we never had done before.

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.859
Thanks to Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:01.139
the amazing content being created in the villages was shared worldwide, 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:07.159
bringing with it a whole legion of WaterAid supporters. 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.079
The UK government pledged to match all donations to The Big Dig campaign, 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.349
over a 12 week period, from 18 June to 18 September. 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.639
We set out to raise £1.2 million and 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.410
on week 5 we already reached it. 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.440
Through The Big Dig, 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.050
we saw a real contrast between progress and pain. 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.719
Because while the community members were making huge steps, building latrines and 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:34.469
creating handwashing facilities, 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:37.419
we also saw the worsening water crisis. 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.710
Meaning that people were still getting sick, 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.229
women were still spending hours and hours collecting small amounts of water 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.229
to feed their children. 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.599
Three months on and the change is remarkable. 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:05.599
Toilets have been constructed, hygiene messages can be seen all around this village. 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:08.220
About 40m beneath this peg, 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.710
there is something precious, something that can transform lives forever - 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.580
safe, clean water. 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.669
When those trucks began to drive into Bokola and Kaniche, 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.069
not only were the community as excited about the water that was about to come, 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:31.069
but the supporters who had made that happen were all on the edge of their seats too. 

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:47.279
We've hit water 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.209
and it's time to celebrate!

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:52.870
This is what you've achieved 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.019
in just one summer. 

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:18.019
Hitting water 

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:22.400
in Bokola and Kaniche was the climax of The Big Dig.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.650
Being part of something that created so much celebration and which signifed 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.009
the start of a transformation for two communities, is something

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:36.129
every single person involved in this campaign can be truly proud of. 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.000
There'll be no stopping here. 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.280
Over the next 3 years, thousands of people across Malawi are going to experience the same joy, celebration and gratitude. 

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:03.749
So we aimed for £1.2 million and in fact we doubled it. 

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:07.029
We funded the whole of the rural programme in Malawi and 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:09.809
we've also funded some of our urban work too. 

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:17.359
Meaning close to 200,000 people across Malawi are going to benefit as a result of The Big Dig.
