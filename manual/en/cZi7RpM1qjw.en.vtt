00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.650
Those poor sight seeing aliens.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.019
They're out and about in the universe enjoying
themselves when they're hit upon by a meteor

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.019
storm.

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.430
It's time for damage control.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.850
Help guide the aliens to their rescue ships
with the use of paddles that deflect, bounce,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.300
drip, and contain all manner of other strange
properties as you navigate around the meteor

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.359
fields.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.039
One of the most amusing things about Puzzle
Rocket is also one of the most horrifying

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.689
if you stop to think about it.

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.610
The goal of each stage is to get the aliens
from their derelict spacecraft to the rescue

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.610
rockets.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.370
Now common sense says you should set up your
paddles before opening the release valve and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.609
jettisoning the aliens into the murky vacuum
of space, but how are you meant to adjust

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.960
the paddles to the right trajectory if you
have no way to test them out?

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.840
The first order of business each level then
is to flip that lever, allow the limitless

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.109
supply of extra terrestrials to expire until
you work out how to fill the limited capacity

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.039
of each rocket, possibly collect the stars
scattered around each level, and then move

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:59.690
on to the next stranded ship.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.290
You need to be making a lot of little adjustments
as finding solutions to each level is a game

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.379
of finesse.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.060
The amount of paddles you have to work with
are in the bottom left corner, with colors

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.610
indicating the property of each paddle, and
a series of circles indicating how many you

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.670
have at your disposal.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.110
Paddles when dragged have a radius around
them that can be used to move and rotate them,

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.740
but for rotating, your best bet is using the
clockwise and counter-clockwise rotate buttons,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.530
as this grants greater control as you watch
how the angle affects the passage of all those

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.290
little aliens.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.210
It's this exactness of paddle placement that
makes the game kind of troublesome however.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.600
There's just too much fine-tuning, and once
the help signs stop suggesting areas for paddle

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.350
placement and you're left to your own ingenuity,
there's just more frustration than fun.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.100
Now there will be the type of puzzle gamer
who will jump at all the experimentation possible

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.200
in saving these creatures, and it's not to
say that the presentation, level design, and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.759
sheer number of different paddles aren't extremely
well done, it's just we don't see this game

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.630
having a broad appeal as it is, and that's
unfortunate as it seems that's what it's aiming

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.960
for.
