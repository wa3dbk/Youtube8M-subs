00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:28.960
Spot the difference, guys. By looking at...pictures.
Not terribly exciting, I realize that. Nonetheless,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.960
it�s still fun. And I�ll tell you why.
First off, even if you go into these things

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.890
expecting suck, you still end up playing like
a godd*mn detective. You can�t help it.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.690
It�s human nature to, uh, you know...organize
information. And then tap touch-sensitive

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.360
screens. It�s iSpot Japan for the Nintendo
DSi.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.300
It�s elementary, my Emma Watson.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.540
So this thing comes from the DSi spammers
over at EnjoyUp Games. I mean that in a good

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.940
way. These guys have been pumping games onto
Nintendo�s handhelds for years now, and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.810
although this is far from their best, it�s
a perfectly fine casual game for those who

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.200
use their DS for things like...puzzles. And
crosswords.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.140
And who...take naps, in the afternoon.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.450
Old people, is what I�m saying.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.450
Freaking...AARP.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:36.060
Now, iSpot Japan�which sounds like...Apple
made some huge magnifying glass to hang over

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.810
Tokyo�was released to DSiWare back in 2012.
Of course, it�s available on the 3DS eShop,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.080
as well. And again, it�s a pretty simple
concept. You get two pictures, very similar

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.340
in appearance but with very subtle differences.
Find the differences to progress, use hints

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.150
if you must, I have a freaking headache.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:08.280
So there are three difficulty levels, each
one with more or less differences to find.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.450
The game strings the photos together like
levels, and you only have a few hints to work

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.620
with. So it�s actually kind of arcade-like,
in that...you kind of just keep going until

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.620
you lose.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.480
Of course, the overall theme of iSpot Japan...is
Japan. Each photograph shows some kind of

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.900
Japanese landmark or cultural staple. And
after completing each picture, you�re shown

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.519
a little map of Japan with the history and
location of the photographed place. If you�re

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.889
interested in Japanese culture, that�s definitely
a nice little touch.

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:43.319
There�s also local one-on-one multiplayer,
where two players race to find all the differences

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.379
first. And that�s really when the game is
at its best.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.680
Anyway, there�s...really not much to say
here. The game plays fine, the taps are very

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.579
responsive...it�s a well-made game, if a
little thin. Like most of EnjoyUp�s DSi

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:03.250
and 3DS offerings, it�s a small, inexpensive
game meant for short bursts of gameplay. And

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.939
with that criteria, iSpot Japan is a solid
little game.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.049
With pictures of sushi.
