00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:04.480
Hi guys its Larry from the Oregon Coast

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.119
and uh... this is part two my beginners
hydro project

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:13.009
this little project experience last
summer

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.330
its a early jalapeno plant

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.730
usually get about 2 feet tall

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.900
he's about 18 "

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.050
he was the runt of the family of seedlings

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.089
of uh...

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.490
feeling very stern

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.220
this last spring

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.680
I brought him indoors

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.480
about a month ago

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.470
but not going up

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.640
so far its doing  really really good indoors

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.410
all i'm using is a 13 watt cfl

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.540
our contract worth more pressure even to
those

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.370
if you want to do this project

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.240
or useful tool that over perhaps because

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.890
copy in proportion to talk to him

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.010
never to let newman

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.930
this in n_p_r_ per second

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.010
i think that's the hope that you are
compact fluorescent

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.440
use to those

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.299
3 watt aquarium air pump

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.440
aquarium air-popped employers don't
matter

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.220
and that's the trick

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.330
guesswork earlier but um...

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.700
two thirteen watt cfl

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.100
run lights for 16 hours

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.720
on the timer

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.300
that seems to be a

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.970
working really good

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.370
originally i just had the grow lights at 10 hours

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.920
uh... boosted up then

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.330
distress you seeping doable harvest
office got

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.820
basically michael grizzly was district
you can live to love

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.800
wellspring

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.380
but so far

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.440
really pressed will cost

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.130
and for the nutrient i'm using fox farms grow big

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.970
if they act

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.850
3-2-6 NPK hydroonic nutrient

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.680
as per capita lamp one hundred wired up
on that

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.740
check out those roots

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.740
well rocky is doing pretty good

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.850
real good

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.269
a couple of jalapeno peppers ready to pick

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.239
gonna see if they're harder not sound
might campbell took taste tester

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.559
its  about a three weeks cycle have
gone wrong with that but i want to

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:16.889
water change every 2 weeks

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:20.499
as pre water about julian since there
from the bottom

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.779
this that barely enough for the bottom roots to touch
attached

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.909
and you see i got a lot

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.719
low friendster

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.739
i found red wiggler worms

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.979
in my mini aquaponics bed &amp; escaped

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:40.180
they've been living indoors for a couple of months

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.519
every once in awhile the crawl up into the roots

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:45.249
there

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.519
that's pretty cool

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.169
now just a couple bob

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:54.629
I take a 3 5/8 " hole saw 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.249
drill a hole in the lid

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:01.899
and i just use a standard 3" net cup 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:03.959
Local hydroponics store

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.809
hydroton

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.430
bring indoors

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.499
is pre and or is he is a smaller
container

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:13.839
and sometimes you want him to it

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:17.739
who intend to to to gallon bucket or
five-gallon bucket and uh...

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.699
it's really easy to move

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.149
cut a little notch for the air line

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:25.839
they're going to go through that cindy
was pretty good

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:31.259
and issues merger the screw it up water
coupler kept for murder

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:33.809
hydroponic nutient

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:36.069
what air

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.329
grandpa that's not really set

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.829
lets see how hot this pepper is

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:49.239
people play

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.629
is that's incorrect

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.239
it who yeah

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.349
so far so good

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:56.470
uh...

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.989
i have been some the flowers off uh...

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.719
bob months ago they preserve just uh...

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:05.799
really infested half of them are slow
down the um... uncertain of fired and

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:06.669
speaker

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.469
flustered

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:10.809
and bam

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:15.519
this is a seekers uses simple project
and

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.959
basic issues water about every two weeks
three weeks that the forget sometimes

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.669
and

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.539
it's a little bit other nutrient

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.419
anti-big news

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.199
all right sir do dual costs uh...

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.580
estimator um...

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.919
ameerpet about

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.250
fifteen bucks compound

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.939
anti-competitive that level for about
four o'clock sipes so

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:41.529
talk and free naked with a dollar
contract what

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:43.970
usually about twenty bucks

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.000
credit any i guess about being back at
it and so

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.050
concluded with your program

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.300
ten bucks

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.360
for the scumbag

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.409
sophia seven-year commissar suggestions
that

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.209
to stop lying down low enough

00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:00.039
so he wanted
