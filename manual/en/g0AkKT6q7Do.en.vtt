00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Would you like to see what I work?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.000
It's called "A story from the Desert"

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And there are thousand of needle points

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What is your method, do you go from left to right?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
With the Gobelin, you can start anywhere

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.000
and you can start with any colour

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.000
but it's better to begin with the dark colours

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
as it's easier to see the lighter colours later

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.000
as I realised this on my own

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.000
and sometimes, the white borrows from the neighbouring colours, you know

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.000
it depends on how the thread was dyed

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.500
and that's why I use this approach

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
How do you combine, or choose the colours?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It's the eye of the painter... the Gobelin is a painting by needle stitch

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You can buy the canvas together with the coloured threads

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.000
Do you ever change them, or use them as supplied?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Some vendors sell the patterns together with the threads, others without

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.000
and then you need to buy the threads and combine them as you wish

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.000
and you can change the colours, if you don't like some...

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The most difficult to stitch are: the eyes, the hands, the portraits

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.500
those are very difficult, if you mess up one needle point

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the entire facial expression will be compromised

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I saw some Gobelins, the faces are skewed, 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
the gaze is cross-eyed. But yours are very good

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And they look you in the eye, from wherever you look at them...

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
For instance, in this one that you work, the eyes are the central feature

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.500
yes, but I haven't finished yet, still to go

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.500
It is going to be very difficult to stitch those eyes

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I have a little bit more to do, here

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
What is your favourite subject matter in the Gobelins?

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.000
I loved flowers a lot in  the beginning, and I still like them

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I also like the religious subjects, I like them all

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.000
I cherish the moment I start on a new one

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.000
and I rejoice when I finish it

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
but I always have the next one by me, in waiting 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And I study it, over and over, then I start work on it, 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and I'm happy when it came out right

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.000
What do you feel like, when it's finished,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.000
And you have to say good bye to that Gobelin, and start on a new one?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
While I work on them, I am immersed in every detail, so that it comes out right

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and I am happy with every flower, every leaf, every colour that comes out right...

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
This is a religious subject, 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
do you see how beautiful is the expression of the Madonna? And her hands...

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I like a lot to work on children, although it's a difficult subject

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Here the work is extraordinarily difficult, the hair, the clothes of the flute player...

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Let me show you the back, as often one can hardly distinguish the face from the back

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I remember you once told me that the mastery can be seen on the back

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Can you explain why?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Because you are not allowed to make knots, on the back

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
as they can be seen, even under glass

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000
You have to thread, as gently as possible, 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So let's have a look at the back of this one

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Really, from a distance it's hard to see any difference

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
This one is superb! Very beautiful...

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.000
It is one of the most beautiful orthodox icons

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.000
The colours are extraordinary

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The demeanour, the gaze, and all the details, the clothes... 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and check out the back

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Here it's all about perspective

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I think it's very difficult to render the perspective

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Very difficult, as in painting, it is one of the most difficult things, 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.000
to render depth by using colour

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
This one is so painstakingly difficult, as each needle point is a different colour  

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.500
every single point

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
it looks like Pissaro, the exponent of the pointillist style 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And I suppose the more points there are, in different colours, the harder it gets

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
yes.. this is about one year's work... normally

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.500
How long does it take to finish the Birch trees?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It took me four months, working sometimes 12 hours / day

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Do you work that long? "Yes"

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
All the large pieces take about 3-4 months of intense work, not just an hour or two 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
In an hour, you would go through about one centimetre, at most...

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.000
One cm per hour?!

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.000
Yes, if you are very skilled and experienced

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But this applies only to backgrounds, which are simpler, not to the fine details

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.000
This for instance, takes longer

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And here, one flower, you cannot finish in one day... definitely not

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Although flowers seem easy... at least for me, now, it got easier

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I think the human face is the most difficult

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
yes.. the most difficult is...

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.000
because the eyes... and the gaze

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and the hands... like in painting... the same thing

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
In painting, the hands... only the greatest artists managed to paint beautiful hands

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Is this one of your favourites? 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Yes, because I had the desire to see them for real, at the museum in Egypt... and I did not get there

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.000
Shall I show you the back?

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.000
From a distance one cannot see the difference 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And its pair, Tutankhamun

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.000
The colours are extraordinary

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I love the gold with the tones of blue and turkuoise

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.000
A connoisseur will realise how much work there is here

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Do you have any favourite painter, one that you prefer to work from?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Yes, I love van Gogh, and I shall never own a genuine van Gogh

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.000
You never know...

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And like me, any one of you, you know... you can own this version

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Also this one

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
The famous irises .. lake with irises

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
DÃ¼rer, I like this... 

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and this one should sit on everybody's desk, so they say... this "Prayer"

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Shall I show you some landscapes?
