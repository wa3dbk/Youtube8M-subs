Hello everyone.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.250
Michael here with the daily note 2 and 3 Youtube
channel.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.100
And as you can see I'm about ready to head
outside and its becoming increasingly and

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.230
extremely cold in Korea where I'm at but what
i really like doing at all hours of the day

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.830
is to take notes or to take reminders for
myself and I kinda like to do this hands-free

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.359
because it's pretty freezing outside so I
want to show you three ways to take no note

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:38.290
while it is still in your pocket you certainly
say hi galaxy into the mic of the earphones

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.840
that came with your galaxy note 3 but no need
to do that because the earphones come with

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.840
this button.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.649
this clicker here and all you need to do is
click and hold and it launches s voice much

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.809
more reliably and is much better than saying
hi galaxy when you're outside and there's

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.579
a lot of stuff going on

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.480
and what's nice about watching s voice with
the clicker is that when you do a click and

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.100
hold you can launch S voice from just about
anywhere you can even do it inside of an app

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.970
or at your home screen which you cannot do
by saying hi galaxy

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.500
s to take notes hands free with the galaxy
note 3, here are the 3 methods that I found

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.250
whether you want to take a written memo of
voice memo or a combination of both so to

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:28.470
take a written memo you can launch S voice
memo by a bookshelf 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.299
and you could see that it has saved to memo
which means it has saved two an S note to

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:41.210
get to your S note just open up your S note
app and when you open it that's pretty much

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:52.000
all you get for a voice memo you to do this
record voice so it launches the voice recorder

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.160
and from here it starts recording automatically
now it's going to appear that there are no

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.130
ways to stop this
you could click on this can't stop it but

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.899
here's a little trick that I found out.

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.509
you could launch the launch S voice again
and you'll get this error message however

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.290
it saves the memo that you are recording so
it's kind of a way to stop it and here's a

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.430
third way incorporating the tips and tricks
video that I did on episode 31 open Google

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:33.400
voice search 
note to self buy a bookshelf okay and you

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.930
could see that it works a little differently
its using Google now so let's take a look

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.519
at what you get with that so it just emails
you to your Gmail account you just email yourself

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.470
you could see that it has typed out the words
that were recognized in your voice note also

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.950
you get this sound file and you could play
what you recorded and since wrong the topic

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.690
of using the clicker button for hands-free
functionality you could download an app called

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.200
headset button controller I believe it's a
paid app but you can program it to do this

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.310
I programmed it so that when you do a quaduple
double-click it turns off the screen

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.459
i did do a video for the galaxy note 2 series
on the headset button controller app but I'll

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.720
try to do another video for the galaxy note
3 series with an updated information so that's

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.390
