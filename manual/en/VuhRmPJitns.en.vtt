00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.589
YouTube beauty expert NurberXO in her recent

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.660
May 2012 Favorites video asked about dermaplaning

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.400
and its effect on hair so today I want to
take a deep dive

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.449
into the technique!

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.079
And as a quick aside, I love getting skin
care questions in video form

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:21.599
like NurberXO’s.

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.580
So if you have a question, please post them

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.859
as video responses to DermTV episodes and
I’ll answer

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.050
as many of them as I can!

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.050
Hello

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.429
I'm Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:32.429
[pause]

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:37.400
And welcome to DermTV.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.100
To understand dermaplaning, let’s first
start with its history.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.120
Superficial exfoliation as a cosmetic technique
for facial rejuvenation

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.190
became very popular in the early 1990’s
with the development of

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.940
therapeutic strengths of glycolic acid for
in office,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.470
physician performed, superficial peels.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.010
And while chemical exfoliation is superior
to physical exfoliation

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.710
for many reasons I’ve discussed in prior
DermTV episodes,

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.840
there are many forms of physical exfoliation,
including shaving,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.330
that work.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.229
As a matter of fact, because most guys

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.640
have been shaving and thereby exfoliating
2/3 of their face

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.880
for many years, that’s the reasons by the
30’s and 40’s

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.040
that men’s skin often looks better than
women’s skin.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.229
So, once the benefits of regular glycolic
exfoliation caught on

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.590
in the dermatologic community, plastic surgeons
wanted

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.710
to be able to also offer their patients the
benefits of exfoliation.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.920
But since they weren’t trained in the use
of chemical peeling agents,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.869
but they certainly are skillful with their
scalpels,

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.880
they invented Dermaplaning, which is merely
a fancy name

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.229
for the procedure in which they used a scalpel
blade

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.420
to do exactly what a razor blade does when
you shave…

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.369
It takes off superficial layers of dead cells

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.630
at the same time it removes hair.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.990
In the case of dermaplaning, the surgeon,
or esthetician

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.470
uses a scalpel blade…

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.980
…mounted on a regular scalpel handle…

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.450
…and with the blade at a medium angle to
the skin,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.210
they scrape off the upper layer of skin like
this...

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:33.570
And by the way, if you shave your legs, every
time you shave them...

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.370
you’re dermaplaning the skin of yours legs.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.700
After you shave your legs... don’t you just
love

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.830
how soft and smooth they feel?

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.390
It’s not just from removing

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.250
the hair that they feel that way; it’s also
because the razor

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.810
has exfoliated your skin, making the skin
surface smoother.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.470
So if you'd like to try a very inexpensive
form of dermaplaning

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.190
on your face at home, why not consider gently
shaving

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.870
the skin on your face.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.370
You can use the same razor and cream

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.140
you use for your legs in the shower,

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.100
and in fact shaving in the shower is even
more gentle.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.870
And if you have any facial hair, not to worry…

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.060
shaving doesn’t make the hair thicker, coarser

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.370
or grow any faster, and if you need some reassurance

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.230
there are a bunch of DermTV episodes demonstrating

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:32.610
that as well.
