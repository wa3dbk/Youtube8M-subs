00:00:00.356 --> 00:00:01.603
Klingons! Pew!

00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:02.786
Gorn! Pew!

00:00:02.816 --> 00:00:04.720
Space dogs! Pew!

00:00:14.193 --> 00:00:17.504
I know - I know! The gunk they scrape off
the side of the ship every time we dock

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:19.485
are more threatening than this thing.

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:23.842
But, the entire security force on board is
undergoing "advanced space combat training".

00:00:23.978 --> 00:00:26.879
I don't understand what's so
"advanced" about a training phaser.

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.056
Pew! Pew! Pew!

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:31.835
But, Captain Kirk is
always saying to us,

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.423
"You've got to learn how to aim...

00:00:33.453 --> 00:00:35.432
before you can learn how to fire."

00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:39.515
What the heck? Power outage? For real?

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.890
This is the starship Enterprise!

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:45.540
- Crewman Nadia?
- Nadia here.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.120
Ensign Williams. Are you in engineering?

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.300
I am, ensign.

00:00:49.697 --> 00:00:52.893
What the heck is going on with the power and
please tell me it's not just my quarters

00:00:52.923 --> 00:00:55.684
- there have been way too many thin...
- Captain...

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:58.124
I do believe I have been patient,

00:00:58.277 --> 00:01:00.293
but where is me breakfast?

00:01:01.178 --> 00:01:02.553
Oh! What the heck?

00:01:02.756 --> 00:01:05.860
Oh, I'm on my communicator
and I just passed the room

00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:08.690
the Captain has our visitors in,
some guy named...

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.308
Mudd who brought a...

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:12.222
a bunch of...

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.163
- Crewman? Crewman?
- women with him...

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.669
- and they're all...
- Nadia! Nadia!

00:01:17.748 --> 00:01:18.748
really...

00:01:19.607 --> 00:01:21.520
The... the...

00:01:22.172 --> 00:01:24.920
the lith... the lithium crystals.

00:01:25.093 --> 00:01:26.393
What about them?

00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:29.146
Lithium crystals suck!

00:01:29.473 --> 00:01:32.147
Five of them are out.
We're running on batteries.

00:01:32.343 --> 00:01:34.743
- Thank-you, crewman.
- Acknowledged.

00:01:36.726 --> 00:01:39.288
Can you believe the Enterprise
runs on six lithium crystals?

00:01:39.318 --> 00:01:41.471
No wonder we're having power problems.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.959
- Williams to engineering.
- I recruit wives for settlers.

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:53.070
A difficult, but rewarding task.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.835
- End communication.
- Now hold on right there!

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:58.909
That sounds like a pretty lassie
speaking to me from beyond.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.268
- I was paging Crewman Nadia.
- Well, I'm not called Nadia...

00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:05.542
but for you I might make an exception.
What's your name, darling?

00:02:05.572 --> 00:02:07.832
- End communication.
- No! No! Hold on!

00:02:07.862 --> 00:02:10.102
I could make you so happy!

00:02:10.316 --> 00:02:13.506
What if I could bring
the lights back on?

00:02:14.992 --> 00:02:18.259
- Wow! How did you do that?
- Never mind that, pretty lass.

00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:21.414
What's say you be me fourth wife?

00:02:21.547 --> 00:02:24.311
- No, thank-you.
- No, Harry Mudd could make you...

00:02:25.268 --> 00:02:26.682
Computer, delete log.

00:02:27.883 --> 00:02:29.502
Come on!

00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:42.053
Insufficient power.

00:02:42.144 --> 00:02:44.864
- Delete log.
- Insufficient power.

00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:46.390
Delete. Log.

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:51.388
Hate this computer.
