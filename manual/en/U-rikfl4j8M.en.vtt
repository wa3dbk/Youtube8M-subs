OF CREATING A FAKE PERSONA

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:05.238 size:78% position:39%
WHEN YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE
ON YOUR LAPTOP ALL NIGHT?

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:06.839
WAIT.

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:08.174
DOES THE CEDRIC HAVE Wi-Fi?

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:09.309 size:56% position:28%
YEAH, THAT'S ABOUT
ALL IT HAS.

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:10.876
COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJOR,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.479
HOURS ON HER LAPTOP?

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:13.646 align:start size:50% position:50%
SHE'S A HACKER,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.281 size:75% position:63%
WHICH IS WHY SHE WAS
STAYING AT THE CEDRIC.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:16.916 align:start size:66% position:34%
SHE COULD PAY IN CASH
AND REMAIN ANONYMOUS

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.651 size:59% position:70%
WHILE SHE WAS USING
THE I.P. ADDRESS.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:19.819 align:start position:0%
EXACTLY, AND WHATEVER
SHE WAS HACKING INTO

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:21.388 size:66% position:33%
WAS EITHER SO ILLEGAL
OR SO DANGEROUS,

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.789
SHE HAD TO MAKE SURE THEY
COULDN'T TRACE IT BACK TO HER.

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:24.523 align:start position:0%
AND EVEN IF THEY DID
TRACE IT BACK TO HER,

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.626
THEY'D STILL HAVE TO FIND HER
AMONGST HUNDREDS OF RESIDENTS.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.728 size:75% position:63%
SO SHE CREATED
A WHOLE FALSE PERSONA.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.229 size:88% position:56%
AND WHO'S GONNA LOOK TWICE
AT A RUNAWAY HOOKER?

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:31.998 size:84% position:58%
I MEAN, SHE'S LIKE THE GIRL
WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.299 align:start position:0%
ONLY THEY DID FIND HER,

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:34.867 size:81% position:41%
WHICH IS WHY WE CAN'T FIND
HER LAPTOP.

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:36.336 size:84% position:42%
WHOEVER SHE WENT UP AGAINST

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.037 align:start position:0%
KILLED HER AND TOOK IT.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.806
UH, PROBLEM. WE DON'T KNOW
WHO SHE WENT UP AGAINST,

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.775
AND NONE OF HER FRIENDS
SEEM TO KNOW EITHER.

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:43.576 size:81% position:41%
OKAY, CONTACT THE CEDRIC'S
INTERNET PROVIDER

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.311 size:78% position:39%
AND GET A LIST
OF ALL THE I.P. ADDRESSES

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:47.647 size:75% position:38%
ACCESSED BY RESIDENTS
OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.316 size:81% position:41%
THERE'S<i> GOTTA</i> BE AN ANSWER
SOMEWHERE IN THERE.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.385
WHERE DO WE FIND HER?

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:54.287 size:72% position:36%
UM, MOUNT HOPE CEMETERY
IN WESTCHESTER.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.155 size:81% position:41%
SHE WAS KILLED LAST SUMMER
IN A CAR CRASH.

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:57.891
WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES?

00:00:57.924 --> 00:00:59.025
WELL, THERE WERE NO WITNESSES,

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:00.326 align:start position:0%
BUT ACCORDING TO
THE POLICE REPORT,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.794
SHE WAS DRIVING HOME
FROM THE FIRM'S SUMMER PARTY.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:04.196 size:75% position:38%
SHE LOST CONTROL
AND CRASHED INTO A TREE.

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.132
AUTOPSY INDICATES THAT SHE WAS
INTOXICATED AT THE TIME.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:08.901 size:75% position:38%
BUT ERIKA NEVER BELIEVED
THE OFFICIAL ACCOUNT.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.403
ANY REASON WHY?

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:11.871 size:84% position:42%
WELL, SHE BELIEVED THAT PAM
WOULD NEVER DRIVE DRUNK.

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:14.006 size:84% position:42%
AND WHEN THEY FOUND PAM,
SHE WAS WEARING HIGH HEELS,

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.942 size:78% position:39%
AND ERIKA SAID
SHE NEVER DROVE IN HEELS.

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:17.710 size:50% position:75%
THREE DEATHS,
ALL LEADING BACK

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.380 size:59% position:70%
TO THE LAW FIRM
OF BANKS AND BAUER.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:21.681 size:84% position:58%
IS IT JUST ME, OR IS THIS

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:24.017 align:end position:100%
STARTING TO SMELL LIKE
A JOHN GRISHAM NOVEL?

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.085 size:66% position:67%
A SINGLE-CAR ACCIDENT
WITH NO WITNESSES?

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:28.354
GUYS, THIS IS
A CLASSIC CONSPIRACY COVER-UP.

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:30.423
THOUGH ONLY A LOWLY INTERN,

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.959 size:84% position:58%
PAM STUMBLES ONTO SOMETHING
THE FIRM IS DOING,

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:35.995 size:78% position:39%
SOMETHING BIG, NEFARIOUS.

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.198 align:start position:0%
SHE HAS TO BE SILENCED,
ONLY AFTER THE ACCIDENT,

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.565
BLAYLOCK CAN'T TAKE THE GUILT

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:42.001 align:start position:0%
OR ADMIT THE TRUTH.

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:44.637 size:59% position:30%
SO HIS ONLY BASTION
IS TO ESCAPE

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.739 size:72% position:36%
INTO THE SWEET OBLIVION
OF DRUGS.

00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:48.374 size:66% position:67%
AND THEN WHEN ERIKA
STARTS COMING AROUND,

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:49.675 size:78% position:61%
THEY REALIZE THAT THEY'RE
GONNA HAVE TO ACT

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:50.944 size:84% position:58%
BY ELIMINATING THEM BOTH.

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:53.813 size:66% position:67%
BUT WHAT
ARE THEY COVERING UP?

00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:55.314
WHATEVER IT IS,

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:57.049
THE ONLY POSSIBLE EVIDENCE
IS ON ERIKA'S LAPTOP,

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:58.351
WHICH OUR KILLER TOOK.

00:01:58.384 --> 00:01:59.619 align:start position:0%
YEAH.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:01.653 size:72% position:36%
WAIT,
ARE WE SURE ABOUT THAT?

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:04.490 size:81% position:41%
ERIKA WAS MEETING BLAYLOCK
ON THE ROOF, RIGHT?

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:05.925 size:75% position:38%
A GUY WHO,
ACCORDING TO THE E-MAIL,

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.226 size:81% position:41%
SHE DIDN'T KNOW VERY WELL.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.895 size:72% position:36%
IF I'M ERIKA,
I'M HIDING THAT LAPTOP.

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:10.530
WELL, WE SEARCHED HER ROOM.
IT WASN'T THERE.

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:13.633
WAIT. DO YOU GUYS REMEMBER
THE FOOTAGE FROM THE ELEVATOR?

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:14.801 align:start position:0%
YES.

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.769 size:81% position:41%
SHE WENT DOWN
TO THE LAUNDRY ROOM FIRST.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.071
AND LANIE SAID THAT SHE FOUND

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:19.372 size:66% position:67%
TRACES OF CREOSOTE
UNDER HER FINGERNAILS

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:20.773 size:69% position:66%
FROM THE BOILER ROOM
NEXT DOOR.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:23.576
(Castle and Beckett)
THE LAPTOP'S IN THE BASEMENT.
