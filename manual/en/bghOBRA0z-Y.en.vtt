"Hi, my name is Marcus Milius.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.400
I play harmonica.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.950
I got a degree at the University of Southern
California, a Bachelor's of Music, in Jazz

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.120
Studies - Chromatic Harmonica.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:23.090
I play and teach harmonica here in New York
City, and I'm happy to show you what I do.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.180
One thing that is very confusing about harmonica
is that there are so many different kinds.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.050
Often times this is just the difference in
names, in models, or brands.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.940
For instance, the blues harp the marine pan,
the special twenty, the golden melody which

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.210
are all diatonic harmonicas by the Horner
company and they are really all very similar.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.809
But the main differences in harmonica will
be primarily the diatonic and chromatic harmonica.

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:06.740
There are many others as well as base harmonica,
chord harmonica, echo harmonica, or tremolo

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.070
harmonica.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:18.090
And they all have different sounds, but primarily
it divides into diatonic and chromatic harmonica.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.990
Chromatic harmonica looks like this.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:47.990
It plays in all keys, and sounds a bit like
the artists Stevie Wonder or twist talemen.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.770
Diatonic harmonicas will be set up in one
key and you'll need twelve of them to play

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:09.700
in every key and they tend to have a bluesier
folkier sound, or a bluesy sound.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:18.510
And you'll notice that they bend very nicely,
and they have really nice double stops or

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.260
chords.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:44.799
The other harmonicas that are out there would
be the base harmonica, chord harmonicas which

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:54.079
are really big, there are also diatonic harmonicas
that are tuned to minor, or other scales.

00:02:54.079 --> 00:03:02.839
There are diatonic harmonicas that have a
very organ like sound and they're called echo

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:05.699
harps or tremolo harps.

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:11.949
So, that takes a lot of investigating to know
the difference.

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:16.760
But usually most people are going to be playing
the majority of recordings that you hear will

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.609
be chromatic harmonica and diatonic harmonica
and they're pretty easy to hear the difference

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:21.789
between.
