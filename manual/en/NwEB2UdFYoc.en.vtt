00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:11.059
hi it's AlaskaGranny do you have some of these food
items in your pantry I stockpile them for

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.789
emergencies because they're fast and
they're very simple I thought I would

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.460
share with you a way that I store food long term food storage
because the box is taking up so much

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.340
room so the first thing I do when I
bring boxes of food pasta rice  home from the store

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.310
is a stick them in the freezer for three
or four days because then if there's any

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.500
of those  little weevil pantry wheat bugs
that are in the grains things it

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.370
kills them

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.059
then I don't want to store the big box in my
cupboard or pantry  this is what I do I empty the box of noodles or rice and the sauce packet

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.480
I take it all out of  the pack and I put it in a ziploc
bag so you can see for the Pasta Roni  Noodle Roni Macaroni and Cheese Rice a Roni

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.860
I take all of the noodles
out and the seasoning pouch envelope and I put it

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.399
in a ziploc sandwich bag and then I can roll it
over and this box of noodles fits in a small bag and takes up far less space in my cupboard or pantry

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:08.250
I empty the entire box then I took this air tight container like tupperware or rubbermaid or a food storage bucket 
that I had and I opened it and I store

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.909
them all in here and I have 14 or 15
boxes of noodles or rice fit  in this little container then

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.050
I put the label  of what it is  I put all the same
flavor or variety

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.550
in here and then on the  back I put the
back of the box with the directions so

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.230
that I can take one of these add one and
three quarters

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.100
cup of water a splash of olive oil and I
can actually prepare a meal for my family for dinner or emergency food storage meals

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.370
add a can of vegetables
add a can of chicken or meat

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.800
and I can prepare meals for my family in an
emergency situation for dinner or take these meal packets camping

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.170
these are like meals in a jar or dehydrated meals or emergency food storage meals for long term food storage

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.170
do the same with  macaroni and cheese packages empty the box of noodles and the sauce packet

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.170
into a ziploc bag press out the air

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.590
put all the bags of homemade MRE s into the  box  label  and include the directions

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.490
these DIY prepackaged meals for emergencies will store for a long time in my

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.100
cupboard

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.260
it also just requires  water and a
little olive oil as well red beans and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.920
rice I put the same flavor all-in-one food storage container
the directions are on the back and

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.060
8 prepared meals in a jar or dehydrated meal  when I want to
prepare one meal I can take one

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.459
homemade meal packet out and prepare it I don't have to
have a great big huge box so I have

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:54.070
several dozen boxes of these things
right here and instead of having a

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.590
couple dozen of these giant boxes which
are full of air they would share with

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:07.590
you how I store things like prepared
pasta Roni macaroni and cheese and

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.440
rice-a-roni so that they don't take up
so much space in my little kitchen or

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.160
pantry and then they're going to last
longer

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.210
and I'm ready for an emergency I
have many many meals right here in these

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.880
three plastic containers and there's no
one right way to do long term  food storage

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.240
some foods will
last longer than others so do what works
