00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.960
One day back in high school, my buddy said,
“Hey, let’s go check out what’s on this

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.160
mountain.” And after a really long exhausting
day, we turned around this corner and came

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.980
across this beautiful lake. I told my parents
about this lake and they go “Oh, you should

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.730
go up and take some pictures.” And they
got me this tiny, little point and shoot.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.730
That was pretty much what got me hooked, like
man, what else is out there? And I just started exploring.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.350
My name is Jon Dickson, and I am a postgraduate
Geographic Information Systems student from

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.170
Western Canada. I’ve just graduated university,
and since then I’ve been travelling around

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.229
Australia.

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:05.720
I started playing with SLRs about 3 years
ago. And so, I try and take pictures to show

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.070
people the beauty we’ve got left. I feel
like not enough people get out there and appreciate nature.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:20.000
I’m lucky enough to be fit enough
and have the time to get out there.

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.710
I'm more than willing to perch on the edge of
a cliff for a couple hours to get that shot I want.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.800
The pictures work out and the other
people like the pictures, so it’s a trade off.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.420
I really like doing long exposures of the
ocean. Getting the water to blur.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.350
And so when you contrast that with the roundness of the rocks and maybe throw in a jagged branch or

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.300
two, I find that works really well for composition.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.549
Night photography is also something I’ve
grown really fond of. Capturing the structure

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.159
in the Milky Way and the stars with the D7100, because it’s an excellent low-light performer,

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.100
really makes for some awesome pictures.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.360
Because of my studies, travels, and backpacking, I get to see things that a lot of people don't get to see.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.270
And so raising awareness through
visual and other means is really important to me.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.470
There’s still a lot of beautiful
environments that need to be protected and

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.140
preserved and saved for the next generation.
Take rocks for example; they always make for

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.760
a great story. Understanding how things are
formed, and where they’re moving, what they’re

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.610
going to look like in the future. Not quite
being a fortune-teller but it’s pretty close.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.970
It’s almost like looking into the future
and the past at the same time.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.500
I’ve come a long way from that first fateful
day in the mountains. My parents told me to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.220
go take some pictures, and I haven’t stopped since.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.220
This is who I am. My name is Jon Dickson and
I am a D7100 photographer.
