00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340
The video you're about to watch is 8 months old, sorry

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.280
This is some footage I shot with my friend Dan in December last year,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.440
Thought I lost the footage, found the footage last night, edited it together, I hope you enjoy it

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.800
Wasn't gonna upload it. But I asked you guys on Twitter and it was a resounding "Obviously yes, you dumb hoe"

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.880
So without further ado here is the long awaited, what I thought was long lost, Ask Demma 2

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.260
Enjoy.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.040
D: Nothing, I'd have hotdogs for lunch.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.160
D: Take that back, we're getting a telegram in

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.520
D: The Nazis, are progressing, across the Northern border

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.440
D: Stop

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.340
(Both laugh)

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.680
(Intro music)

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.120
D: I don't know

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.480
E: I don't know what any of that means

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.980
D: Good

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.480
E: But yes

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.840
D: You don't know what the word Emma means?

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.540
E: I will be, whatever that is

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.260
D: I don't know what Emma means!

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.600
E: I wanna be number four!

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.480
E: We're not going to do very well on heists if it's me

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.980
D: Yeah

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.460
D: That's a gun Emma, that's not a middle fin- That's a gun again Emma

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.400
D: That's not a middle finger

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.260
D: Come on, you can do it, I believe in you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.800
D: That's a gun Emma

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.800
D: You didn't kill him, you didn't kill him

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.540
D: Good god Emma

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.180
D: You can hold the coats for the rest of the guys

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.480
E: I'll be the car person! There must be a car person

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.700
D: You can be the car

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.820
E: Yeah!

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.860
D: Somebody else will drive, you can be the car

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.880
E: I'm in, beep beep

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.320
Both: Motherfucker

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.480
Both: Ayyy

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.740
E: Oh wait, we're getting a telegram

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.840
D: Yep

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.020
E: They won't be able to pick this up, I just think it's amazing

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.020
D: I quite like the current present

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.480
D: Which is the year 2014, 2015, whenever the fuck you put this video on

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.480
E: Oh, 14, it'll be this Friday

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.980
D: Oh, okay

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.980
E: Hang on, wait, wait

E: Motherfucker

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.180
D: And here we have the wild Emma Blackery talking to the wild hamster

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.320
D: Note how on the sofa, she's placed the hamster

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.880
E: Little ham

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.200
E: You can meet little ham

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.220
E: She likes you

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.320
E: Oh, she's all confused and doesn't know where to go

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.120
E: Don't pee on me

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.960
D: My channel, my channel

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.920
E: She's so cute

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.940
D: Is she a political leader, is she?

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.200
E: Yeah

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.560
D: Aw, what's her policies?

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.360
E: Erm, she's basically Kim Jong Un

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.340
D: Okay

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.100
E: But, fluffier

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.220
D: Did you stop Sony releasing the movies? Yes you did, yes you did

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.220
E: Did you hack Sony? Yes you did

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.340
D: Did you think I look better in the wig?

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.020
D: Oh, that's a definite no

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.460
D: She's vomiting

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.520
E: She's washing

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.960
D: I would delete this channel

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.380
E: Well you can fuck off

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.380
D: This question can be easily reworded into TALK ABOUT MASTURBATION

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:53.560
D: (screaming)

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.820
E: Fuck you, alright

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.760
E: Hamster, why are you still scratching that thing?

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.360
D: My first impression, of Mrs Emma Blackery, was, eh

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.340
E: I was just like, why am I getting subscribers? Who the fuck is this nerd thing?

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.320
E: Oh, it's a gamer, oh, it's a gamer

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.220
E: It's another Youtube fucking gamer, let me guess, Minecraft

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.300
E: Ironic, 'cause you do the thing

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.240
E: The Minecraft thing

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.460
D: What Minecraft thing?

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.060
E: You did the Minecraft thing

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.200
D: Yes, and you do the gaming thing as well

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.260
E: But not Minecraft

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.940
E: 'Cause I'm not a peasant

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.960
E: Getting rid of the noise that the hamster's making

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.180
D: All you need is like eight pounds to build a tiny hamster cannonball

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.600
D: (imitating a hamster flying out of a cannonball)

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.020
E: No, leave her alone

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.500
D: Wait, it hasn't landed yet

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.900
D: There we go

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.700
E: What would you do with a million pound?

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.140
D: I would just keep it, I don't really-

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.120
D: I live on like the tiniest amount of money possible

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.300
E: You'd just keep it in your bank

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.300
D: I'm one of those people who is like, I've got twenty pounds, woo

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.840
D: That'll be dinner forever

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.360
D: No, I don't ever- really spend money I don't think

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.140
E: I don't know what I'd do

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.640
D: As you can tell by the clothes that I wear

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.760
E: I would treat my family, and Luke, and I would, I would

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.780
E: I was trying to think of something nice for you but a present for you would

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.780
E: probably be make Nintendo half-decent

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.480
D: No, just come around my house again

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.280
E: Aw

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.980
D: (laughing)

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.420
D: Poo

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.020
E: Are we butt to butt again?

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.220
D: No, 'cause you're too tall now

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.720
E: Try it

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.100
E: Oh, my butt fits in your back crevace

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.980
E: Your butt fits in my under-butt

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.700
D: It's like you're sitting on my butt

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.400
D: Oh, don't you wiggle

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.420
E: (laughing)

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.300
D: Pervert

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.520
E: My anaconda does

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.760
E: This one's a stupid one

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.500
D: Oh, this one's a stupid one? Oh good, all the others have been sensible

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.740
D: You

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.060
D: Clearly

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.960
E: Clearly me, I would overpower him

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.780
E: I'm taller, I'm stronger, I'm faster

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.900
E: I'm smarter

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.000
D: Got hair I could choke on

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.880
E: That's true

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.940
E: Actually no, I'd just make you wear the wig and then I'd just choke you with it

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.760
E: Oh what the fuck

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.460
D: Oo, piratey

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.740
D: Yes, it's a form of Japanese dance

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.040
D: It's where they wear- yeah, it's that sort of thing isn't it

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.320
E: Look it up, just google bukkake

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.180
D: Don't!

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.480
E: And then you'll see the dance

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.400
D: Don't, don't

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.120
E: Really good

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.400
D: All the Japanese websites hate us

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.400
E:: Last question, last question, last question, last question

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.380
D: Metapod

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.500
E: So you could just stand and do nothing?

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.000
D: Harden!

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.440
D: I could just sleep for the rest of the day

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.000
E: That would make a change

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.060
E: (laughing)

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.220
E: Yes! Yes!

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.340
D: We're leaving

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.160
E: Worth it

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.640
E: No!

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.720
E: That was good payback for all the height jokes you make

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.820
E: I don't know what I would be, what Pokemon would I be?

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.420
E: Not that you know any Pokemon

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.820
D: Er, I know all of them

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.400
E: Do you?

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.900
D: Yeah

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.540
E: How many are there?

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.220
D: 152

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.280
E: I was playing the new Pokemon, the new Y or whatever it is

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.540
D: I played through Y and every time I got a Pokemon it was like well that's a massive piece of shit

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.580
D: It's some keys!

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.180
D: Who came up with keys as a Pokemon?

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.800
D: It's keys!

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.200
E: It is pretty stupid, it's keys

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.700
D: When it faints, it snaps in half and all the keys fall off

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.320
D: and I'm like, so what are these then? Are these necessary to the Pokemon?

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.660
E: They're just its limbs

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.340
E: So it's like if we died, our arms and our legs would fall off

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.920
D: But instead of dying they faint, tell me they faint, tell me that's not some-

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.420
E: (whispers) They die

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.420
D: In Pokemon fainting is the equivalent of oh yeah your dog was sent to the happy farm

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.840
E: Well like if the Klefki fainted, like, to revive it

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.940
E: Wouldn't Nurse Joy have to sort of like put the keys back on

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.240
E: Just do up the thing, and then it's just awake again

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.640
D: How many of them do you reckon are killed every time someone's drunk and they're trying to get their keys in the door?

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.640
D: Oh no I broke it's neck!

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.760
E: No it's literally just drop it on the floor by accident, Klefki no!

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.580
E: (back to the question) I don't know, probably a Gyrados 'cause I'm a big evil fucking dragon when I'm pissed off

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.660
D: (whispers) Magikarp

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.880
E: I'm not a Magikarp

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.840
E: I don't just flap around

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.800
D: See this channel!

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.800
E: I hate you

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.500
D: No you don't

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.380
D: (laughing)

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.220
D: (whispers) BFFs

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.560
E: (whispers) BFFs for life

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.040
E: That's what it means

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.980
E: We're probably gonna get stabbed for doing this sign, I don't know what it means

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.580
E: I swear like people on Facebook who are in prison do this

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.060
D: Yeah, it's 'cause their hands are tied together

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.580
D: And they've had to trade two of their fingers for cigarettes

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.300
E: Four of their fingers, actually, they got desperate

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.140
D: No, they're in a mirror

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:30.800
*fart noise*
