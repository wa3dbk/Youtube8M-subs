00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.050
Joe: Hey, it's Joe Crump.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.179
I've got another question here.

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.100
This one is from Kim from Los Angeles.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.150
Kim says, 'There's two scenarios that I've
come across when talking to sellers.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.401
Number 1: What happens if someone is behind
in their mortgage payments?

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:19.210
Is there a way to help them by selling the
home rent to buy with the tenant?"

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.369
Joe: She's talking about the for rent method
where we use the lease option memo and we

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.210
tie up the property to buy it with a rent
to buy that's assignable that we then assign

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.829
to a new buyer and we take the lease option
fee, the first month rent goes to the seller,

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.690
and we're in and out of the deal, and we make
a chunk of money, then we're done.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.300
So that's what she's talking about here.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.190
But, she's talking about somebody who's behind
on their payments, and if they're behind on

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.469
their payments, you don't want to do this
with a buyer if that person is behind on their

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:48.469
payments.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.340
So, they either need to get current on their
payments -- there's a possibility that you

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.300
could come up with their late payments out
of your lease option fee but that'll dramatically

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.519
reduce the amount of money that you can get
to do that deal.

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.989
I don't usually do deals like that, but you
can look at that and decide for yourself.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.330
You can also have the seller talk to their
mortgage company and see if they can get a

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.590
loan modification, which is becoming more
and more difficult these days for them to

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.190
do, but it might be possible for them to bring
it current and then make the payments over

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.190
time.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.200
That way, you'll protect your buyer in the
transaction and the seller will be back on

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.640
track and get their credit straightened out
over time.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.600
So it's a real benefit if they can pull that
off.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.070
But, if they can't, I wouldn't spend a lot
of time with a deal like that unless you can

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.510
get it substantially under market value.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.420
Joe: Remember, there's only two ways that
you can make money in real estate as in investor:

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.410
one is that you buy properties substantially
under market value for cash, and two is that

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.440
you buy properties that are closer to market
value on terms or even above market value

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.590
in some cases.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.730
So, if you can buy it on terms then that means
you can sell it on terms.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.330
If you buy it for cash, you can even do an
assignment for cash if you can get it low

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.610
enough in price.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.550
But remember, the person you sell it to has
to come up with cash, and that makes it more

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.700
difficult for them.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.950
That means you have fewer people that'll buy
that property.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.950
So you want to focus on properties that you
can sell on terms most of the time because

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.060
it'll make it easier for you to sell.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.900
We know this about a property on a lease option
that's properly priced, not just the purchase

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.420
price but the actual monthly payment, which
is much more important than the purchase price.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.081
Joe: The purchase price can be high, but the
monthly payment has to be in line with the

00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:26.480
market rent for that property.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.870
If you're over that, it's not going to sell.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.310
But if you're in line with that, and you use
the techniques that I teach to sell, using

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.530
Craig's List and using the signs in the yard
and those types of things, to get it sold,

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.600
that property will sell in 30 days or less,
and usually in just a couple of weeks.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.550
If the monthly payment is high, it will not
sell at all and you'll have to get your seller

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.850
to get their monthly payment down because
they'll be competing with other properties.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.550
Joe: I hope that helps.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.550
Oops.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.550
I've got question number two.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.550
Let me finish that.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.181
Question two is: "If someone is upside down
with their property value by $150,000 -- Let's

00:02:58.181 --> 00:03:02.260
say the seller wants $500,000 but the current
market value is $350,000.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.580
In one of your CD's you say that you can give
the seller the sale price of the property

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.360
they want of $150,000 more than market value
today, if they agree to a longer term on the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.380
lease option like 5 years.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.510
My question is, how do you know how much above
the market you can go with the sale price,

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.650
and how much longer do you need to extend
the term by?

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.400
Is this something that one becomes more comfortable
structuring the longer you're doing deals?

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.890
Right now it seems so arbitrary.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.319
Or does the market naturally dictate what
you can and cannot do with regard to structuring

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.950
the deal (meaning if it's too priced high,
no tenant buyers will respond to my marketing

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.950
of the property)?"

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.780
Joe: So, you can sell the property for more
than it's worth.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.910
We do it in California.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.020
We do it in Las Vegas.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.160
We've done it in lots of areas where the property
values dropped much more than they did in

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.830
the Midwestern states where they dropped 30-70%
in value.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.830
And we have exactly these scenarios where
the property has a mortgage of $500,000 but

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.790
the current value is only $350,000.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.370
But we have been able to sell them for $500,000
-- because the lease option buyer is looking

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.180
for a way to own that property.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.079
They will only pay market rent.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.820
So if you've got a $500,000 property and let's
say it's got a $4,200 a month mortgage on

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.370
it but market rent on that is $2,800.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.520
So you've got $1,400 a month negative cash
flow if they only get $2,800 a month income

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.810
on that property.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.240
But the seller, having $1,400 negative is
much better than them having a $4,200 a month

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.259
negative.

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.129
That's why this works -- because it makes
sense for people who want to keep their credit

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:46.129
clean.

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.689
Now it may make sense for people to just let
the property to go back to the bank and take

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:51.710
that hit on their credit.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.559
But there's an awful lot of people, like government
workers, politicians and people that are in

00:04:56.559 --> 00:05:01.349
high corporate jobs, who need to keep their
credit clean because their companies check

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:02.349
it.

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:08.080
If you've got some kind of security clearances,
you've got to keep your credit clean because

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.870
you become a higher risk if you've got bad
credit.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.380
So there are a lot of people out there that
have to keep their credit clean that have

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.699
properties like this that have this kind of
income that you can help.

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:24.569
And you can solve their problem and take their
$4,200 a month pain and drop it down to $1,400

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.749
a month pain, which is much better for them.

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:28.789
Joe: It's like the heart surgeon.

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.479
He comes to you and he says, 'You need to
have heart surgery.

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.569
I'm going to have to cut your chest open.

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:36.339
I'm going to spread it with these rib spreaders.

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:38.754
I'm going to go in there and I'm going to
cut around.

00:05:38.754 --> 00:05:42.150
You're going to be in lots of pain and it's
going to be horrible.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.819
And I'm going to charge you a huge amount
of money to do all of this.

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.110
But the good news is that you're going to
live.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.669
The bad news is that if you don't do it, you
die.'

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.120
So which choice do you make?

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.309
And that's the same situation that these folks
are in.

00:05:56.309 --> 00:06:00.849
it's not a good situation but it's a situation
that makes sense to an awful lot of people.

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:03.289
So don't let these prices intimidate you.

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:08.440
And when lease option buyers buy, the likelihood
is that they are not going to exercise the

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.440
option.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.610
They want ownership without the responsibility
of ownership.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.960
Less than 30% of lease option buyers will
actually exercise the option.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.469
And we want them to know up front that the
likelihood is that they're not going to exercise

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:25.650
the option -- while they are there -- while
that buyer is still there.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.050
They're going to treat it like their own house.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.330
You know, you don't wash the rental car.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.430
But if you perceive it as your own, you're
going to take care of it on a much higher

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.430
level.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.300
Joe: People want to have the American dream.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.349
And whether you buy it with a lease option
or you buy it with a mortgage, it's still

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:41.830
your house.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.400
If you're a tenant, you're a tenant -- you're
renting from somebody else.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.960
But as a lease option buyer, you are a buyer
in that transaction.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.789
And that's what people want -- they want to
be able to tell other people, 'Come back to

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:52.789
MY house.'

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:53.789
They want to have control of that house.

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:55.419
They want to be able to paint the walls if
they want to.

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:58.899
They want to be able to take care of it the
way they take care of it.

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:03.349
And that's what we provide -- we provide the
American dream for people who can't qualify

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:08.190
for mortgages, which is a big portion of the
country right now.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.919
And it's been working for us for many years.

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:14.529
So there's always people who have this situation
and there's no reason why you can't make this

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:15.699
work for yourself.

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:17.300
Good luck, Kim.
