00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.280
Hey guys welcome to MinnieMollyReviews so today

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.670
i'm reviewing 'Gold by Kim Kardashian' so just to start off i wanna

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.309
tell you guys that on my other channel the
Molly i'm doing vlogmas

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.549
this year, so if you wanna check that out, click over

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.619
here and you can go and watch my latest vlogmas and

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.810
you can go and look back at all the others! So, I originally

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.289
bought the mini set of 4

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.269
Kim Kardashian fragrances and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.210
so these are only really really tiny 7.5ml

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.910
and they're not sprays either. So this is...oh, where is it? So this is what 'Gold'

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.170
looks like as the mini version and then this

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.559
is the one I have now and it's 100ml

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.350
so it got this from Argos and so

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.949
this one obviously has the gold middle but this one doesn't it just has the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.440
gold like neck and writing on it and so

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.660
it's just a pretty...it's the same sort of

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.440
bottle as the mini ones, obviously just a larger version of it

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.330
so it's a pretty designer design really

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.250
and then this the box so it's quite
simple like the 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.439
bottle, just gold on the front you know
cause it's called 'gold'

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.310
and black around and then gold on the back so the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.009
fragrance, the top notes are: pink pepper, grapefruit and
bergamot

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.979
so from the initial spray you get
like this scent

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.159
of pink pepper mixed with sweet citrus
fruit

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.729
the top is elegant and almost has a gourmand

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.540
edge to it that smells quite creamy. So the middle notes are: Jasmine, 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.950
rose and violet, so these florals are quite
creamy 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.740
also, so the notes are more of an overall like sweet
yet elegant floral scent

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.439
rather than one note standing out which makes it
not overpowering

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.490
the base notes are: patchouli, sandalwood

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.509
amber and bezoin. BenZOIN? BenzoIN? i'm not sure how to say that to be honest

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.610
but the base gives this scent of warmth

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.490
that can be smelt throughout the whole of the fragrance so it's like this sweet amber and benzoin 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.789
what has given the scent like
the cream

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.350
warm edged kind of to the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.780
scent and so overall this scent

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.570
starts with a sweet like citrus burst

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.630
with pink pepper and a creamy floral middle and a
warm yet gourmand

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.640
base to it. So this scent has been described as a 'love or hate it'

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.120
sort of fragrance and I think it's because it's
quite different to your

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.650
average celebrity fragrance it's more subtle for 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.900
older maturer wearers rather than for  like the
young people who are used to

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.100
like sweet vanilla fruity floral fragrance but

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.590
I do think it it's quite a nice fragrance

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.000
especially for night time as well like you could go
to eat dinner

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.350
or go out dancing or whatever you do and this is the type

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.350
of fragrance you would wear so it lasts
about four to six

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.560
hours and like I said you would wear it when you're

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.810
going out for a meal or something like you know when you're dressed up

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.240
I think it's that kinda fragrance so on the back

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.640
it says 'throughout the centuries gold has held
fascination that comes not only from it's

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.780
undeniable beauty but it's immense value, luxurious

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.990
sensual and rare, Kim Kardashian Gold is iconic

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.020
a true precious luxury captured in fragrance
transcend ordinary

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.660
with Kim Kardashian Gold' it's like a little mini advertisement on the back of the box.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.740
this fragrance came out in 2011

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.960
and like I said it is the second fragrance
from Kim Kardashian's collection

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.250
a lot of you guys actually requested this
review but it is quite an expensive

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.880
fragrance, the Kim Kardashian line is quite
expensive so

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.150
I decided to do it cause i could get it for Â£20 from Argos

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.210
and so it's just it's quite hard because I know you guys want me to review them but

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.490
they're quite expensive fragrances so

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.710
on My Board of Many Fragrances, here

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.140
is Kim Kardashian Gold, so I gave the box a

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.950
7 cause like i said, it's pretty simple, there's  not really much
to the box

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.640
the bottle; an 8 because I think it's really nice, it's sort of designer

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.910
and then the scent; a 7.5. Because i'm quite in the

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.350
middle with this scent, i do like it, I wouldn't wear it
everyday

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.870
I would probably only wear it when I'm going out, I have been wearing it this week

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.400
but I do think it suits more going-out dressed-up

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.930
sort of theme to it. So overall

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.139
this scent starts with a sweet citrus

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.849
burst with pink pepper and a creamy floral middle and a warm 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.009
yet gourmand base. So thanks for watching watching guys
