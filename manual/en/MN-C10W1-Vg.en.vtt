00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.390
What's going on YouTube, my name is David and I'm here to give you some tips for your best body in

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.799
2013

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.280
whether your goals are weight loss or muscle gain

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.999
You'll find something in this video useful

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:14.500
t's very cliche to have a fitness related New Year's Resolution

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.779
but a number of people who actually
succeed those resolutions is quite

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:18.939
I believe

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.840
I'm here to improve those numbers

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.240
I love exercise and fitness culture

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.219
I used to be staff at my college's weight room

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:30.339
 These tips will surely help you as much as they have helped me and others.

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.200
As I continue with my exercise tips series, my tips will get more and more specific, 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.220
but these three starting tips are very general and widely applicable.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.140
Tip 1-
Make REALISTIC but challenging goals

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.220
and tell others about your goals.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.010
If you spent the entire last year struggling to even lose 15 pounds

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.570
there's no way you're going to lose 15 pounds in January

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.780
You'll be continually disappointed for failing to meet these goals

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.820
and you won't rewarded for your work

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.760
Burnouts and frustration are common

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.500
and people can often give up

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.460
be honest with yourself in terms of
where you are with fitness

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.600
 and base your goals off of previous experiences

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.530
I'm going to tell you about my goals. I can do 5 free standing vertical pushups right now

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.200
I want to be able to do 10 by the end of March

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.640
Based on the difficulty level of the exercise

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.910
this time period in which I have to train

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.909
and my previous training experience

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.240
i think this is a realistic goal,Go through these calculations in your head for the goals you want to set,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.770
then write down where you are with your fitness and where you want to be in the time period that you want to be.  

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.450
Telling others about your goals improves your motivation

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.920
They can also provide social support and advice

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.030
Those who know your goals will also give positive reinforcement with compliments about your progress,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.920
which gets you through inevitable difficult periods in your training. 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.660
Tip 2.
Think twice before paying for a workout plan, diet, or supplewhich gets you through inevitable difficult periods in your training. 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.499
A lot of these supplements make lofty promises about what they do, 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:58.610
without any significant scientific backing

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.970
A lot of times as evidence of effectiveness, they cite their COMPANY FUNDED study

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.229
Some supplements, such as Whey protein or Creatine Monohydrate

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.689
do have a lot literature supporting their efficaciousness

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.879
When thinking about buying a supplement, do your own research

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.999
Look through google scholar for peer reviewed studies about the ingredients.As for diet plans or workout plans

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.530
most of them are just using fancy marketing

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.900
for information you can find for free by browsing the bodybuilding.com forums, talking with others

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.419
members in your gym

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:32.559
or doing literature searches, steering clear of studies that have clearly been funded by a supplement company. 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:35.579
One of the best investments you can make in making progress 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.369
is hiring a personal trainer to get you started

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:40.409
even professional bodybuilders

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.319
However, don't think that just because you are paying for their time

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.450
means that they will do all the work for you.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.040
can't start slacking. There is no substitute

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.380
Even with a personal trainer, if you aren't focused and committed, you won't make any progress. 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.669
The last and possibly best tip that i can give you is

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.980
 At the end of the day, you are doing everything for YOU and YOU ONLY

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:06.839
Don't think you have to improve yourself for society's expectations. 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:09.269
Society's expectations aren't going to change in our lifetime

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.559
but you can change how you feel about those expectations. Simply don't 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.709
care what others might think about you. 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.799
Even if you told others about your goals, you aren't doing this to impress them. 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.660
You want to be fit because you want to live a healthy lifestyle, 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.360
have more energy in your day to day and always challenge yourself to be the best that you can be

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.730
You will definitely inspire others to be healthy, as well. 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.859
Self-motivation is the best kind

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.079
and just being satisfied with whatever progress you make

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.650
and knowing it's all about you

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.590
not the expectation of others

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.069
 will help you immensely

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.039
That's the mindset you must have if you intend to live a healthy lifestyle. 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:50.579
I hope these tips help you out a lot.
