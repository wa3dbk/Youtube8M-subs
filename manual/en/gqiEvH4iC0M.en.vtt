00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Hi, I'm Lawrence Schick. I'm the Lead 
Loremaster on Elder Scrolls Online,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.300
and I'm here to do an unboxing video of the magnificent 
Collector's Edition-the Imperial Edition-of The Elder Scrolls Online.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.500
Let's take a look at what's in here.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.700
Here we go; it opens up like this ...

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.100
and the tab A from slot B ...

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.500
inside: stuff!

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.500
Before we get to the physical stuff (which is totally excellent), 
let me tell you about the digital features that come with this.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:52.500
This elegant little box contains the discs that have The Elder Scrolls 
Online plus the added bonus features of this Collector's Edition.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500
First of all, this is the Imperial Edition.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.300
Only with this edition do you get to play Imperial characters, 
so you can play Imperial characters in any of the three alliances.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.000
You also get the opportunity to cosmetically change 
your armor and your appearance to look like an Imperial,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
regardless of what you're wearing, and you get a 
magnificent white Imperial charger-an exclusive mount.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.500
As if that isn't enough, you get the ability to go 
and get the blessings of Mara, the goddess of love,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.600
to bless your union with a partner of your choice.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.500
And you and your partner will get magnificent Rings of Mara,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.000
which, when your character's wearing them and you're playing 
with your partner, you will get significant experience buffs.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And to make you feel even more like a budding little family,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.900
you will get an exclusive vanity pet, a little 
scuttling mudcrab, to follow you around.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.500
That's the digital aspects of the Collector's Edition.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.000
Very cool on its own, but now let's get to the physical 
stuff, because that's what I'm excited about.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You get a map of Tamriel for your wall, and then you're gonna get ...

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.000
see who that is?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
That's a statue of the Daedric Prince Molag Bal himself.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.500
His statue is bound in here, just as 
he wants to bind the mortals of Tamriel.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.000
Here he is, Mr. Molag Bal himself.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.300
The Mace of Molag Bal, his mighty artifact.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.800
He's got a victim here.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.000
Look at the tiny torment on that miniature 
victim's face. I gotta tell ya, this is ...

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
this is deathless art.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.900
Here is ...

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.000
this is, we've got the Mace of Molag Bal, 
and this is the base of Molag Bal.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.100
OK, so this is what he's gonna stand on, and 
we've got his vicious, triune, scorpion-like tail.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.900
There, look at that.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So that's the statue of Molag Bal.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.500
It's magnificent and wonderful, and it's the kind of 
thing that you don't wanna put on your nightstand,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.500
because you don't wanna wake up suddenly 
in the night and see that there.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.400
As if that wasn't enough, here's my favorite 
aspect of this entire Collector's Edition.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.500
This is the Collector's Edition art book combined with lore book-

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.500
and not just a lore book, but a lore book 
that has a story; it follows through.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.500
So, this book is The Revised Edition 
of the Emperor's Guide to Tamriel.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.900
An Imperial scholar, Flaccus Terentius, has been 
hired by the Chancellor of the Elder Council,

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.500
Abnur Tharn, to travel around Tamriel 
and revise the Emperor's guide.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:38.500
This lore book not only includes his story, but also 
many, many details about the cultures of Tamriel.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.000
There are ten chapters, one on each 
of the major cultures that he visits,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and it goes in detail into their background 
and the creatures that you encounter there.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.500
So that's the Collector's Edition.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
We've got-just to sum up-all those cool digital aspects 
that we talked about, all the Imperial features,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.600
the map, the very cool statue of Molag Bal himself,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.000
the Collector's Edition art book and 
lore book, and this very cool box.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
This Collector's Edition is going to be available 
for a limited time at selected retailers.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.500
They made me say that; that's marketing speak.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.500
What this means to you is that you 
need to nab this sucker while you can,

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.500
because we're only gonna make a limited number 
of them and then we're done, it's over.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:35.000
Let me point out again that Elder Scrolls Online 
is launching on PC and Mac on April 4th, 2014,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.500
and on PS4 and Xbox One in June.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.300
ItÃ­s racing toward us like a colossal 
juggernaut of doom from Coldharbour.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.000
Be ready! It's coming for you.
