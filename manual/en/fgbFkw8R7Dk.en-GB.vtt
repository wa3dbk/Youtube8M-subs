00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.230
Welcome to my Quest for BUTTERFLY KNIFE. Granted,
it's not got the same ring to it, but the

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.070
idea behind it is the same as my Quest for
Karambit video. It cost me $1,500 virtual

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.989
dollars to get one of those, but I might have
just been unlucky. Let's see how long it takes

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:17.120
for me to unbox a butterfly knife!
Okay, so this could take a while. I'll speed

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:24.120
it up a bit until something interesting happens.
My first purple and it only cost me $15 to

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.770
get it! Looks like it has an average value
of 64 cents. I'm... surprised it's that much,

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.280
to be honest with you. Still, onto the bigger
and better weapons!

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.050
GASPPPP gah. Just my luck. Remember that in
theory there's double the chance of a rare

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.409
item landing either side of the one you get,
so you shouldn't be too surprised when this

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.379
happens once in a while.
And now for some uber 48x speed footage, since

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.399
I seem to go through a rather dry load of
cases. Thanks, Gabe.

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.780
YAY! A water elemental glock, worth an average
of just over 8 dollars. This has been a rather

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.739
poor start to the Quest for Butterfly Knife,
but hey, it would be unfair to redo it. But

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.650
surely if I gamble away enough money, I'll
make a profit? That's how it works, right?!

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.930
See, it's all onwards and upwards from here.
There's not much information on this weapon,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.360
but it averages out in the market at just
under $5. Not too shabby, though it hardly

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.120
makes up for all of the crates I've opened
so far. A butterfly knife will solve all that.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.410
Boom. Take that, probability, you don't apply
to me anymore! I'm raking it in now. Valve

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.450
had better watch out. Next stop: Covert weapons.
They're so close I can smell their sweet gassy

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.320
aroma.
Gah! Another point to the side items. Don't

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.320
worry, it's the middle's turn next! Just need
to up the speed a bit...

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.180
Okay, not a Covert, but there's nothing wrong
with a Classified Stat-trak, worth an average

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.180
of just under $25!
And how about that, just $75 later I get my

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.240
first Covert, worth an average of $56 on Steam
Wallet, a system that I can't legally take

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.730
money out of again.
Hmm, I've spent as much as I earned this week,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.940
but I was only going to waste it on something
else anyway. It's definitely been worth it

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.200
and I'm sure to make it back at some point!
What can I say, I don't mind giving Valve

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.530
this money because they've earned it. I get
so much fun out of the game and they don't

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.010
try to get money from you like EA does. This
is almost a donation and I even get something

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.690
back from it!
Like now! Oh. Almost. It's because I didn't

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.250
knock on the table 4 times before clicking
ROLL that time. I should have listened to

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.270
that Gypsy woman! I wonder why everybody who
shows themselves getting knives on Youtube

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.140
is so lucky. I bet they don't have to unbox
hundreds of crates to get them!

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.620
Yes! I know, I'm going to upload the unboxing
of this one crate onto youtube so it looks

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.760
as though I'm as lucky as everybody else!
This one's worth just under $16, so not as

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.069
good as the other one, but at least it looks
nice.

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.560
Anyway, some nice 64x speed here to get through
the stupidest, most unfair bad luck that I've

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.330
ever had. Just look at all that money. Not
to mention the cost of the crates in the first

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:56.330
place.
Right. A thousand dollars on skins for a game.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.849
And over 400 crates. What is it that I've
got from it?

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.990
Let's add it all up and see if I've recouped
my losses.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.120
Using the current valuation on Steam Marketstorething,
I constructed this table. Since I didn't bother

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.900
checking to see what exactly each of the 402
cases I unboxed were, I decided to use the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.530
average value of all the different weapons
of that category and from that, the weighted

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.790
average of all different conditions. This
means that the actual value COULD HAVE BEEN

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.860
HIGHER! But, as always, could also have been
lower. Not that you'd be in that section,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.470
since you'd definitely be lucky if you did
this challenge.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.989
Using these values, I calculated the value
of the 402 weapons to be $414! Not bad...

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.209
until I consider that I could have got the
same thing from the market-place and saved

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.680
myself almost $587. For that I could have
gone and got myself 3 butterfly knives as

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.819
well. BUT HEY, where's the fun in that?
$1,000 down, an unknown amount left to go.

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.470
My search for my Butterfly Knife continues.
And now to ask you- how much virtual money

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.060
will have to spend altogether before I get
the knife? $1,001? $9001? Closest suggestion

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.790
wins a cheap weapon from my inventory, cos
I'm a cheapskate like that.
