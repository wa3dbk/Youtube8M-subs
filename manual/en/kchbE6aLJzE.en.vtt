00:00:10.487 --> 00:00:14.661

Kokkam is a great choice for making Sherbet as it gives coolness and is delicious.

00:01:07.777 --> 00:01:12.984
(these have been soaked in hot water 30 minutes earlier to make Sherbet)

00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:16.188
Sugar - 1/2 cup

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.914

Firstly we have to grind Kokam to prepare the Sherbet.

00:01:33.764 --> 00:01:44.161
Put Kokkam in a mixer along with sugar.

00:02:06.506 --> 00:02:11.181
Kokkam is grinded so pass it through a strainer.

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:28.007
All of the pulp is collected after straining and now preparing Sherbet won't take long.

00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:30.236
All we have to do is dissolve it in water.

00:02:35.925 --> 00:02:46.600

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.725

Cool Kokkam Sherbet is ready which has been made using fridge water.

00:03:09.526 --> 00:03:15.796
