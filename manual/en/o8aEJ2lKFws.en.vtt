00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:27.239
When the Tiguan was released in 2007, I wasn't the biggest fan..

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:34.729
It was just a shrunk Touareg. But now they've updated it

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:37.184
And I have to say; It certainly looks a lot better!

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.658
They've tried to make this Tiguan like the newest Touareg

00:00:53.658 --> 00:00:56.861
The previous model was a bit of a "Barbie" car

00:00:56.861 --> 00:01:01.305
It was very round and not very sporty

00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:03.593
This one really is quite the opposite

00:01:03.593 --> 00:01:07.576
It has got the new VW nose

00:01:07.576 --> 00:01:12.273
But they forgot to redesign the mirrors, because they look exactly the same as the ones on the old version

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.599
Again we have the 2.0 TSI, with 210 bhp

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:43.091
I'm not going to tell anything about this engine. I'm certain you're all very familiar with it

00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:46.607
In this new model it is accomponied by a 7 speed DSG gearbox

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:50.507
Which is a bit more fierce than the 6 DSG

00:01:50.507 --> 00:01:57.807
It changes gear more frequently, but in the "D" mode it's a bit dead

00:01:57.807 --> 00:02:01.889
In "S" it really gets more aggressive, but it keeps the revs too high 

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:04.840
which can get uncomfortable..

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.144
I think VW is going to use this gearbox in the new gti

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:38.918
As usual, this press model is equipped with all options available

00:02:38.918 --> 00:02:45.935
The best one is the "R-Line" package, which takes the Tiguan to a whole different level

00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:57.847
You get a different nose, back, a diffuser, sideskirts, spoilers, 19" rims and sporty suspension

00:02:57.847 --> 00:03:04.452
I wouldn't get the suspension, because it gets quite uncomfortable with the 19" rims

00:03:04.452 --> 00:03:07.485
and you will never feel like doing some serious cornering with this car.. That's really not what it's made for

00:03:37.214 --> 00:03:39.613
I do have some complains..

00:03:39.613 --> 00:03:46.295
The interior looks, and feals, really cheap

00:03:46.295 --> 00:03:50.179
not what we're used to from VW

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:54.109
The seats are included in the R-Line package

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.564
they're covered in fabric..

00:03:56.564 --> 00:03:59.517
Which isn't what you'd expect in a car with this price tag(â‚¬60.000 NL)

00:03:59.517 --> 00:04:05.583
they're quite firm and not very comfortable.. I think this is a big mistake

00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:21.887
VW really improved the Tiguan

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:25.461
The old one was just boring.. 

00:04:25.461 --> 00:04:29.808
it was a very dull car, it didn't have anything special

00:04:29.808 --> 00:04:40.171
This new one, with the new front and back, just looks a lot better

00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:42.003
Would I recommend it to anyone...

00:04:42.003 --> 00:04:44.207
Yes I would!

00:04:44.207 --> 00:04:46.140
It really has become a great looking car..

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.860
especially with the R-Line package!

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.126
But you can leave the suspension "upgrade".. 

00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:55.023
It really is just useless..
