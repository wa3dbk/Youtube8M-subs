[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:05.730
Stanford University.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.270
All the way from a Jacquard
loom to the Babbage machines

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.090
to the very early
electronic computers,

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.230
the fundamentals have been about
manipulation of information.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.550
Computation and computers are
bound by the laws of physics,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.030
primarily because bits
are physical entities.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.110
That notion implies that
you can use computers

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.500
to actually manipulate matter.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.430
We don't want to
manipulate information,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.050
because this is something that
your electronic computer can

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.310
actually do.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.830
What we have implemented
is a platform

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.320
where we utilize exactly the
same techniques to manipulate

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.190
water droplets.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.030
Droplets are fascinating
as a material

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.790
because they're a little bag.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.770
You can put anything
you want in it.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.060
And in the field
of microfluidics,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.900
there are thousands
of applications

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.960
people have explored that
utilize these droplets

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.710
as little beakers.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.970
We're going to use
them to transport

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.840
physical materials inside them.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.760
Let them be chemical components,
biological components,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.132
that you can analyze, synthesize
very fast and very efficiently.

00:01:26.132 --> 00:01:29.420
We utilize a ferrofluid
droplet, which

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.250
is primarily just essentially
a floating liquid magnet.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.150
This system of coils generates
the magnetic fields that

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.680
act as a clock to the system.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.490
The water droplets may respond
to the magnetic fields that

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.280
are generated by the coils.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.680
On our microfluidic
sieves, we have

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.290
these tracks of metallic
bars that get magnetized.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.290
They look like
little T and I bars.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.150
The way you would organize them
on a two-dimensional surface

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.980
gives you arbitrary control
of a magnetic landscape.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.130
Just by changing the layout
of the metallic bars,

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.150
we can do any logic
operation that exists.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.479
We want to take
that exact system

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.380
and keep making it
smaller and smaller

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.510
and faster and
faster so that it can

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.820
do more operations per time, can
work with smaller sample sizes,

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.340
and can do more
complex reactions.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.350
It's not about manipulating
information faster,

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.480
but it's about
manipulating matter faster.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.140
And that is a capability that
we have not had until now.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.490
It allows us to
manipulate this material

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.250
in a fundamentally new way.
