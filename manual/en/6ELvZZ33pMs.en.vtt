00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:02.500
 Hello Youtube friends 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.600
 Welcome to this channel 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:06.900
 Today I'll show you how to patch 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.599
 a net or cast net 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.000
 as we see here 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 a tremendous gap 

00:00:24.028 --> 00:00:26.600
 and that we proceed to mend 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.400
 let's cut this 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.400
 because it no longer serves us 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.700
 and now we take our needle 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.700
 always with a matching thread 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.500
 now we join with the splice junction 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 I already showed you in a previous video 

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:51.899
 the splice junction 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.900
 we throw 

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:11.299
 now cut 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.299
 we know that this node does not run 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:22.500
 Now we take the diamond 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.500
 where do the knot, 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 to the eye in which 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.600
 we will make another knot 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.600
 the next round also 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 We adjust and now another knot again, 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:44.000
 but in the bottom 

00:01:45.578 --> 00:01:46.399
 such that the knot 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:48.299
 the original tissue left us in the middle 

00:01:49.358 --> 00:01:50.299
 now cut 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.299
 and we have there 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.700
 the diamond where we will make another knot 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.700
 this will cut friends 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.699
 and we do run 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.500
 to tie the knot 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.500
 in the bottom 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.500
 well ... then we cut it 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.700
 and now we will run 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:42.299
 so that we will knotless 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.799
 and we will make the next knot there 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.800
 Now here we unite our thread 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.900
 always with the splice junction 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.900
 We tie here 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:13.399
 now also we tied the other end 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.400
 with a blind knot 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.900
 and now let's throw to adjust 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:24.899
 well now 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.800
 proceed to cut 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.800
 so we left good 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.800
 and in the end we cut 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:35.799
 We grabbed the diamond 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.799
 We measure and do the knot 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.599
 the knot with which we weave normally 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.900
 the atarraya 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.200
 that is the knot we are doing 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.500
 Now the bottom 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.500
 which just run 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.900
 We take it with needle 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.900
 and the knot is the same as we weave 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:08.599
 the atarraya only this time 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.600
 It is conversely 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.599
 We take the two wires and now 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.600
 another in the middle of the two 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.500
 as you can see ... and now adjust 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.500
 all right 

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:31.500
 once you have 

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:35.500
 We give an adjusted 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:39.699
 and now we have only this diamond 

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:43.699
 We pass the needle 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.700
 We equate 

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:52.199
 in this way we will be equal 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.199
 now we give a pass 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.199
 and one in the middle of the two wires 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.200
 and we will adjust 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.699
 adjust well 

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:09.399
 now we only need to 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.399
 the last 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.800
 and make the knot 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:20.500
 I have shown you in a previous video 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.500
 that is the "knot to patch" 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:25.399
 we catch estimate 

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:29.799
 and we went through the two wires 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.500
 then adjust 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.599
 then make blind knot 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.600
 such that the knot 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.900
 original tissue left us in the middle 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.200
 all right? 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.400
 well now we adjust and 

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:56.599
 we proceed to cut 

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:59.899
 remember friends 

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:01.399
 to patch a network round 

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:03.399
 They mend provided with 

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:06.699
 same thread color 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.500
 your network may be green 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.500
 patch with green thread 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.199
 if it is white as in this case mine 

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:15.500
 I patch with white thread 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.500
 good friends 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.500
 if they liked the video share it 

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:22.699
 and subscribe 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:24.699
 with me 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.000
 until next time 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 chaooo
