00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.660
Hey guys, this is Austin and today I’m here
with a comparison between the

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.040
iPod touch 5th generation, iPhone 5 and iPod
touch 4G.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.179
To start with let’s take
a look at the design.

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.379
The iPod touch 5th generation steps away from
the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.869
others with the option of colors.

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.570
I’m a fan here as it definitely beats the
polished back from the last gen which you

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.260
could scratch just by looking at it.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.820
It’s not perfect however.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.620
The camera is slightly raised from the body
which

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.060
doesn’t look too great and the iPod touch
loop is...well kind of silly.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.070
You can
press a small button and it raises up to allow

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.970
you to attach a lanyard but in all
honesty I think it’s a bit unnecessary.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.260
The iPod touch 5th gen gets the same 4
inch Retina Display from the iPhone 5 which

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.460
is not only bigger but also higher
quality than the last gen.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.579
The weight is also ridiculous with the new
iPod

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.359
touch, it feels like Apple secretly filled
it with helium or something.

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.251
All three
have very different specs but I wanted to

00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:49.339
know how they stack up.

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.719
I ran
Geekbench which measures the general performance

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.870
of each device and as
you can see here it’s pretty one sided.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.030
The iPod touch 4G clocked in a score of
388 where the iPod touch 5G got 627 points

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.190
and the iPhone 5 brings in a very
respectable 1642.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.530
Numbers aren’t everything though as in real
use the iPod

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.440
touch 5th gen and iPhone 5 are very close
where the iPod touch 4G is starting

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.520
to show it’s age.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.780
iOS 6 runs on all three and in general is
identical.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.390
There are
some differences however.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.190
One big feature of iOS is Siri.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.380
So if we try it on the
iPhone 5.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.160
How are you doing today?

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.210
I feel good.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.330
I’m glad to hear it.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.810
And let’s
go ahead and try it on the iPod touch 5th

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.090
generation.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.270
Hey Siri, how’s your day
going?

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.270
I’m happy to be alive.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.020
All right, and let’s go ahead and try it
on the iPod

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:46.560
touch 4th generation.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.220
Yeah.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.850
Overall the iPod touch 5th generation has
a lot of

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.850
the right stuff.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.390
It’s basically the iPhone 5 without the
phone and for a lot of

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.450
people that makes a great compromise.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.010
The iPod touch 4th gen is still a solid
device but it’s quickly getting out of date

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.400
so it’s not a bad idea to spend the
extra money to get the latest and greatest.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.600
