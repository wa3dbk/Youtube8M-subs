00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.100
So it's Thanksgiving time and you are going
to be hosting the Thanksgiving dinner at your

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.269
home. Well my name is Lori Randall of Simply
Divine Events and I'm going to tell you how

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.990
to create your Thanksgiving dinner and how
to plan a menu for that. The first thing you

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.400
are going to want to do is make sure you plan
it ahead, come up with a list and write down

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.230
a menu of what you are going to be serving.
You want to keep in mind your meats, your

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.190
starches, your vegetables, how to do a nice
salad and also take into consideration the

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.770
guests that are coming and their dietary needs
so go ahead and find that out beforehand as

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.750
you are planning your menu. Also you want
to make sure you shop ahead and get there

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.230
before the Thanksgiving rush and then you
might also want to get your platters out.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.820
Go through your cabinets and get out all the
platters that you might have and make sure

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.329
that you have enough platters to accommodate
all the food and something you can even do

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.590
is get a little sticky note and stick it on
the platters ahead of time and say that this

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.690
is going on this and that is going on that
so that you can kind of make sure you are

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.751
all planned and organized. You are also going
to want to go through your linen closet and

00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:06.700
make sure that you have a nice linen that
might go with Thanksgiving, a nice champagne

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.020
color, yellow or orange maybe even a Fall
leaf pattern linen so kind of stick with your

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.180
theme. Also you want to go through your dishes
and make sure they are all clean. Get your

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.090
china out and make sure that is all clean
and set aside. You might even want to set

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.220
the table the night before the day of and
that way you are not scrambling setting everything

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.060
up. Also keep in mind that you are going to
probably have leftovers so make sure that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.619
you have the Tupperware so you can give some
guests to take things home or you might want

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.350
to invite everyone the next day to come back
and have maybe lunch and make turkey sandwiches.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.939
Make sure that you have your tin foil, your
saran wrap, all of that stuff as well when

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.200
you are planning your Thanksgiving dinner.
Best of luck. I'm sure you are going to do

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.320
great. Again my name is Lori Randall with
Simply Divine Events and I just told you how

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.020
to create your Thanksgiving dinner.
