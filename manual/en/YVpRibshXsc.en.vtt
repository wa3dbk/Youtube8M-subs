00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.509
Hello ladies and gentlemen!

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:13.630
Welcome to my League of Legends how to get
good video, where I teach you how to get good.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.160
Looks like we’re already off to a good start.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.150
So before we jump into anything too complicated,
I think it’s necessary that we cover the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.150
basics.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.320
So here I am playing as Singed, and being
the support that I am, naturally, I’m going

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.460
to be responsible for the middle lane.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.380
And I’d like you to pay close attention
to the summoner spells that I have chosen.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.300
Now this is not character or role specific;
there are two summoner spells that are better

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.300
than the rest.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.850
Those summoner spells are clairvoyance and
teleport.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.680
Soon, in the video, you’ll find out why
each one is so important.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.290
Personally, I like to play with the camera
zoomed in all the way on my character.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.280
This way, you’re in the action at all times.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.300
You’re awareness is much better.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.840
I also like to lock the camera onto my character
so that I don’t get lost trying to move

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.809
the camera with the mouse, and I can see what’s
coming at me from all angles at all times.

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.280
Okay, so now you might be thinking, “I’ve
got my camera zoomed in, my camera is locked

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.810
onto my character, what’s next?

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.860
When someone comes at me, what do I do?”

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.130
There’s just one thing you need to remember
when in combat: attack the champion.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.770
Don’t worry about the minions.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.049
This is League of Legends, if we wanted to
see league of minions, we’d go to the movie

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.049
theater.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.049
This is league of legends, worry about the
legends, the champions.

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.700
It’s in the title for Christ’s sake.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.979
Come on, what do I have to spell it out for
you?

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.619
Don’t you know this stuff?

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.479
Now here’s when teleport really comes in
handy.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.719
As the title suggests, it allows me to teleport
to any friendly turret.

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.789
This means I can get back to my base quickly
and efficiently, allowing me to heal up and

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.049
get back in the action.

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.572
I cannot stress just how crucial this really
is.

00:01:48.572 --> 00:01:50.139
Focus on the champion.

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:53.729
You want to get him as low as you can, so
that he has to use his teleport to get back

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.429
to his base and heal up, and there’s your
opportunity.

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.299
As you can see, I’m using my blinding gas.

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.450
I think it’s working out pretty well for
me, I don’t think he can see me.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.229
This is a great example of how having a zoomed
in camera can give you an in-depth, detailed

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.119
view of your surroundings.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.620
Here is when I’m in the most trouble; I’m
low health and I don’t have my teleport.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.569
This is bad news, I can’t get back to my
base.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.510
So I’ve got two choices, I can either run
back to base, or wait until my teleport comes

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.510
back.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.650
In most cases, you should probably…

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.230
Now that I’ve basically shared all the basic
secrets with you, I can move on to the next

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:37.689
important step: items, knick knacks, objects,
shoes, sneakers, gym bags, water bowls, lava

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:38.689
lamps.

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.860
When most people think of items in League
of Legends, they think wards.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.430
You have been lied to.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.769
If you are buying a ward, you are basically
deciding the fate of your entire team, and

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.349
that’s defeat.

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.970
Think of it this way, would you rather know
where you opponent is, so that when he starts

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.960
heading your way, you can back out before
he has a chance to kill you, or would you

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.690
rather be able to outrun them, no matter where
they are.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.170
This bring me to my next point, buy boots.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.049
Buy several pairs of boots.

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.700
The more the merrier.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.780
If you do not have 3 pairs of boots by the
five minute mark, then you need to go back

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.780
to Heroes of the Storm.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.090
Put on your boots and bam, you will smoke
the champions on the track.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.920
Once you have your boots, and you have enough
money saved up, use your teleport, go back

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.709
to your base, go to the shop, because we are
about to buy the most important item in League

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:33.930
of Leggings.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.930
Type this in.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.900
What I am typing right now is the only item
you should buy from this shop.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.810
If you are buying anything other than Doran’s
Blade, go back to Pajama Sam.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.760
I don’t care if you’re Jinx, I don’t
care if you’re Singed, I don’t care if

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.219
you’re Fizz, I don’t care if you’re
Lisa, Anne, Nancy, buy this item.

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.430
Doran’s blade, get as many as you can.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.159
You should have 6 in your inventory, if not
more, by the 10 minute mark.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:08.420
Look at the stats on this thing: health, attack,
life steal.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.849
This has been the holy trinity since Super
Mario Brothers on the Nintendo 64.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.579
Put one of the bitches in your trinket slot
if you can.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.680
Now look at this, pay attention to this.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.720
Now that I’ve got my Doran’s Blades, I’m
going to demonstrate just how crucial this

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.720
really is.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.610
We’re gonna hit the dragon one time.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.630
Watch the health bar, watch the dragon’s
health bar.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.480
This is how far we’ve come from doing 3
damage to Taric in our lane.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.850
Look at that, one hit!

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.850
That’s one hit baby!

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.850
Nobody can stop a Doran’s blade.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:44.430
I’m Dwayne The 
Rock Johnson.
