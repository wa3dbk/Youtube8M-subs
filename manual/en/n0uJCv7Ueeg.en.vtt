00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this video, we will look at a side-by-side view 
of Kelly Slater’s paddling technique next to an 
up and coming WQS surfer Taylor Clark and his 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
paddling technique.  

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
These are two surfers who are pretty much 25 
years apart in age.  

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
One who really needs no description of his 
talents and accomplishments, 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and another who has potential talent to take him 
very far on the professional surfing tour.  

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Taylor is a kid who I was watching at Seaside a 
lot and he was young 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and he was just blowing it up there, and he 
continues to be a fantastic surfer, 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.066
but I’m not one to analyze surfing technique.  

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:41.066
What I have noticed most was Taylor’s paddling 
technique in the contest and over the years at 
Seaside 

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:46.000
and I wanted to see if you could see the same 
things that I do.  

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The main two reasons I wanted to post this 
analysis are one, 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to help WQS surfers, especially younger WQS 
surfers with increasing their stroke efficiency 
early in their careers rather than later when 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.033
fatigue comes on faster.  And two, 

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:06.066
help more experienced surfers who have already 
hit that fatigue level, 

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:12.000
help them surf longer through increased 
efficiency in their stroke.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.033
So let’s take a quick look at first a side-by-side 
view of Kelly and Taylor.  

00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:20.066
Here is Kelly paddling back out, 

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:25.066
and just to remind you of what makes his stroke 
so efficient, from the other video I posted, 

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:33.066
we can see that he has his head still, looking 
forward, high elbows in his recovery and in his 
catch phase, 

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:38.000
and he puts a very slight roll into his stroke from 
rail to rail.  

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Click here if you need a refresher from that 
video.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.033
Here is Kelly again from behind. 

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:48.066
Now let’s take a look at Taylor’s paddling.  

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:54.033
First from behind.

00:01:54.033 --> 00:02:01.033
Then side by side with Kelly.

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:04.000
Did you see what I did?  

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.033
The biggest tell is this yawing motion you see 
here.  

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:14.000
Watch Taylor’s body go left and his feet go right 
and then vice versa, his feet go left and his body 
goes right.  

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.066
That is yawing, that side to side motion, a term I 
reference in the other video.  

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:29.066
Yawing slows you down, it’s inefficient and 
caused by the lack of roll in the stroke and the 
swaying of the head from side to side.  

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:35.033
The lack of roll and swaying of the head also 
affects the elbow recovery and catch.  

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:39.066
So really one problem causes another.  

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:43.066
When I saw Taylor out in the lineup at Seaside 
when he was younger doing this, 

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:47.066
I just thought it might be an age thing or 
generational.  

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:51.000
I thought he may grow out of it, and he may still 
grow out of it.  

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.066
But then I saw John John Florence who, grant it, 
they aren’t the same age, but fairly close. 

00:02:57.066 --> 00:03:00.033
Take a look at John John’s technique.  

00:03:00.033 --> 00:03:03.066
Looks similar to Kelly.  

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:08.033
And then take a look at two other world 
champions, Mick and Parko.  

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:12.000
Both with similar technique.  

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So these techniques can be fixed.  

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
It’s all about muscle memory.  

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Taylor’s muscle memory for surfing is absolutely 
incredible, he is a great surfer, 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000
but his paddling technique can certainly improve 
and help him catch waves more efficiently.  

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.066
Take a look at this clip.  

00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:38.033
From those heats, I noticed if Taylor was not in 
the absolute best position to catch a wave, he 
struggled a little bit.  

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:44.000
You can see here he bogged a little at takeoff 
and needs to work a bit to get into the wave.  

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.033
I didn’t see that with his other competitors in the 
same heat.  

00:03:48.033 --> 00:03:52.000
That may be due to the paddling stroke.  

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.033
When paddling into a wave, you increase your 
stroke rate, 

00:03:56.033 --> 00:03:57.033
it goes faster, 

00:03:57.033 --> 00:04:01.066
but you use the same techniques that you 
would for regular paddling.  

00:04:01.066 --> 00:04:09.033
So when you get it right during regular strokes, 
regular paddling, you’ll get it right when you 
increase your stroke rate to catch a wave.  

00:04:09.033 --> 00:04:12.066
Your muscles will remember.

00:04:12.066 --> 00:04:20.000
So next time you go surf, try and notice whether 
you are yawing from side to side, moving from 
side to side with your body.  

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000
In the other video, I outlined some drills you can 
do in the pool during a workout or in the water 
while you are surfing.  

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So take a look at that again if you would like to.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
In another video series, about the Bernoulli 
Principle, a seasoned swim coach breaks down 
another problem that both swimmers and surfers 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.066
run into - what is called slippage.  

00:04:40.066 --> 00:04:43.000
You can click here to go directly to that video if 
you’d like to.  

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.066

surfers blog to improve your paddling.
