00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.720
Corrado, do you work for which agricultural company?

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.360
BISAGNO agricultural company, Confienza

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.420
we are using..

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.620
then, pulled by this awsome Fendt 930, how many horsepowers?

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.947
300

00:00:33.947 --> 00:00:35.163
300

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.220
an equally beautiful Fontana leveler of 7 meters

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.020
What is special about this level?

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.860
level double pole, practically automatically corrects

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.620
the blade

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.040
under the bank, if by chance is high, it is self-leveling

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.080
whereas usually you have to do it manually

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.940
but, you told something about a problem with the wind in these days

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.420
the dust

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.160
why? What does the dust do?

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.300
when I am far from the tripod, the dust..

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.440
the laser control doesn't take more

00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:31.657
the signal disappears

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:33.302
and so, how do you do?

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.440
and then, if I know it's more or less straight, or I slow down

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.260
or, in any case, I go... because..

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.200
otherwise we never end up

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.040
in this case, I must slow down because it isn't a normal leveling..

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.868
why isn't it normal?

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.200
Here we are close to the banks of the river Sesia

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.740
that, this winter, overflows and has brought in a lot of sand

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.980
I also found the trunks, there in the middle

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
and so..

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.760
in some points I have 20 cm of terrain

00:02:18.902 --> 00:02:20.902
and in others nothing.. there are some holes

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.820
and so I have to pull a lot of terrain

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.980
trying to finsh before the night

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.000
well, but the leveler of 7 meter pulls a lot of terrain

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.420
yes, of course, it pulls a lot.. it's very good

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.440
this leveler weighs 50 quintals, right?

00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:37.851
yes, 50 /55 quintals

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.680
and so you need all 300 horsepowers to pull it

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.215
yes

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.000
let say that the sand doesn'help

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.660
because this land is sandy

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.120
and the blade doesn't flow well

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.080
whereas it is more nice to see it working in strong lands

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.860
because the terrain turns in well, and even the tractor makes less effort

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.660
but this land won't be used for rice, also if we are near Vercelli

00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:12.708
there will be maize, right?

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.440
maize for biogas

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.860
you should be more careful if it was planted with rice?

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.300
let say that the paddy flatter is better

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.760
how many "giornate" ( italian measure)?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.380
180 "pertiche" (another italian measure)

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.714
attention please

00:03:36.714 --> 00:03:38.253
so 30 giornate, right?

00:03:38.253 --> 00:03:39.497
and in hectares?

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.240
12 hectares.. more or less

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.660
I do the calculation and I write it below (11,78 ha)

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.660
