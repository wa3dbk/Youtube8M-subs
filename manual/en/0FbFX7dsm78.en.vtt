((**SOT**))

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:09.500
“You’ll look good in blue!”

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.160
((**SOT**))
“You’ll look good in blue!”

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.160
((**SOT**))
“You’ll look good in blue.”

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.480
((**SOT))
“You’ll look good in blue!”

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.940

“You’ll look good in blue!”

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.990
((**SOT**)) (Chelsea Melchor)
"I’m Chelsea.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.750
Literally as soon as I stepped on UK’s campus
I knew that was where I was going to attend

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.750
to school.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.750
I loved it.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.080
The people, the campus was gorgeous.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.960
I felt like it was the perfect school for
me.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.860
There’s always something going on campus.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.570
On SAB, Student Activities Board, I am the
Director of Pop Culture.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.370
Basically what that means is that I’m in
charge of a lot of homegrown events.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.219
I’m also in charge of bringing different
comedians and acts to campus and it’s so

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.840
rewarding to just be able to see your hard
work come together for an event that students

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.840
love.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.840
((**SOT**)) (Chelsea Melchor)
“I’ve found that in Lexington there’s

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.120
so much to do from Keeneland in the fall and
spring to a bunch of other different places

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.120
off campus.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.179
It definitely feels like a college town but
then it also feels like a city so there’s

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:02.179
a lot to do.”

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.620
((**SOT**)) (Chelsea Melchor)
“I love using the Johnson Center.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.160
I had a trainer there which was awesome.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.150
I went to the gym every day.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.150
I love the classes.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.300
I love doing spinning.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.300
I got to do Zumba.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.750
I’ve tried yoga this semester too which
has been really fun.”

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.570
((**SOT**)) (Jason Rexroat )
“My name is Jason Rexroat.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.050
This is the space systems lab at the University
of Kentucky.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.170
It’s here that we build orbital satellites,
sub-orbital satellites, altitude balloons

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.240
and International Space Station modules.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.500
Interfacing with NASA, I have a mailbox full
of NASA emails every day.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.910
It’s a really unique experience to be able
to build an actual working satellite and get

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.270
it through all of NASA’s testing requirements
and actually get it into space.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.690
((**SOT**)) (Jason Rexroat)
“It’s a chance to represent the University

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.570
and the state of Kentucky on a national level
and in space itself.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.150
It’s an opportunity to see the real world
and apply what I’ve learned in class to

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.450
actual problems which I think it’s very
much kind of helping me on that road to becoming

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.450
an astronaut.”

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.510
((**SOT**)) (Jason Rexroat)
“My favorite place on campus is the library.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.560
The William T. Young library is an absolute
massive library with a huge book collection.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.000
It has the highest book endowment of any public
university in the country and so there’s

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.950
just tons of study rooms and study spaces
you can rent out, all kinds of computing options.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.920
It’s really a great place to not only do
homework but just to hang out.”

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.170
((**SOT**)) (President Eli Capilouto)
“When we went to the Young Library, we were

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.439
almost speechless and said ‘This is a sanctuary
of learning.’

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.579
And that stands out.”

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:18.579
((**SOT**)) (Rebecca Dailey)
“Hi!

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:19.829
My name is Rebecca Daily.

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.340
My passion is to become a travelling nurse
and since being here at the University I’ve

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.880
been able to travel to two different universities
and study abroad.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.359
I’m volunteering at orphanage outreach,
teaching English to the children there and

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.610
just helping in any way possible.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.883
Things here in nursing that prepare us for
our career is everything in nursing are everything

00:02:35.883 --> 00:02:36.900
is a lot of hands-on.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.700
Things don’t go as the book said.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.030
Patients are always different so we have a
lot of hands on to prepare us for when we

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.659
get out we’re ready for all those different
things that do take place.”

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.239
((**SOT**)) (Rebecca Dailey)
“I’d watched sports from time to time

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.310
but I really wasn’t as into it as I am now.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.310
Now, it’s just like you have to watch.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.310
It’s just so much fun and excitement.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.310
Basketball season and football season, it’s
just you bleed blue.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.590
You see blue, you bleed blue, you love the
University of Kentucky.”

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.690
((**SOT**)) (Reginald Smith Jr.)

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.129
“My name is Reginald Smith Jr. and I’m
from Atlanta, Georgia.

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.349
The professors that I’ve worked with at
the University of Kentucky really have made

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.521
the entire experience worthwhile because they’re
so excited about what they do and they’re

00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:18.890
so excited about sharing their knowledge with
students.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.790
I have been awarded a wonderful music education
but also a great education on life.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.260
I’ve been allowed to travel with the University
of Kentucky choirs to places such as the Bahamas,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.629
Paris, France, to England.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.200
I’ve been to Windsor Castle and Ireland.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.609
I was able to sing for Barack Obama, Muhammad
Ali.”

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.409
((**SOT**)) (Reginald Smith Jr.)
“I was also moved by the opera department

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.829
and the faculty and how the faculty work together
to create such a wonderful program and they

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.829
work for each and every student.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.099
I’ve realized that that’s just not the
opera department but that’s in every department

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.019
that I’ve had to opportunity to take classes
in.

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:07.630
So it’s been a very life-changing experience
and wonderful performances because of the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.819
wonderful faculty members I’ve had the opportunity
to work with.”

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.000
((**SOT**)) (Hailey Simon)
“My name is Hailey Simon and I’m studying

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.189
sustainable agriculture.

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.060
It’s a program with three core pillars.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.770
It’s agriculture that is socially just,
environmental stewardship as well as being

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.120
economically profitable.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:38.570
It’s just really getting to know how things
grow with your hands.”

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:53.210
((**SOT**)) (Hailey Simon)
“UK really made it easy by having K Week

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.210
and at K Week they had lots of different clubs
and groups that really put themselves out

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.110
there for me to just join along.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.830
I wasn’t so sure if I would love living
with a bunch of girls and it was the best.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.860
It was right in central campus so it was close
to everything.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.419
The hall directors would do pizza nights and
movie nights.

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.169
It made it easy to make new friends.

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.560
I love the UK school spirit.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:28.289
Blue is like the soul of this city and I feel
like it’s kind of touched on mine too.”

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.780
((**SOT**))
“I have had so much fun.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.300
I have had so many stories.”

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.690
((**SOT**))
“I’ll be kind of ahead of the game.”

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.360
((**SOT**))
“We’re all like a big family.”

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.360
((**SOT**))
“There’s so much here.”

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.040
((**SOT**))
“Everything I’ve dreamed of and more.”

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.319
((**SOT**))
“Every day I wake up and feel more and more

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:44.370
excited about the fact that I’m part of
this whole See Blue.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.370
community.”

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.370
((**SOT**))
“I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.”

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.880
((**SOT**))
“I wouldn’t trade this experience for

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.880
anything.”

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.180
((**SOT**))
“Come and visit us and find out what See

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.180

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.180
really means.”

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.180
((**SOT**))
“Once you visit us here, you’ll know it’s

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.180
home.”

“See blue!”

((**SOT**))
“See blue.”

"See blue."
