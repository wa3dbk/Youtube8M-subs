00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.489
As a school administrator

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:07.930
a parent came to me one day and was
very upset with me. She said,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.820
"You know, you're holding my child
accountable for a principle that we don't

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.170
practice at home,"

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.650
and I said, "I'm sorry, please explain." She
said, "My child is being penalized for

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.140
being tardy every morning,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.500
and I don't think it's fair." And I said, "Well,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.490
ma'am, that's the rule. If you're late, you
get penalized.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.300
School starts at eight o'clock." She said,
"But I'm raising my child

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.730
in a natural environment. There are no
alarm clocks in my house.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.700
We all wake up when our body clocks
naturally

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.200
awaken us." I said, "Okay..."

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.320
She said, "And so the district is in
violation of MY policy by saying that my child is late.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.600
He should not be penalized
because we are being raised

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.180
to adjust to our own biological needs,"

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.300
and I said, "That's a good idea." Now, to be
honest,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.360
I had something to do. I was busy that
morning, and she was talking a very long time,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.819
and finally I said to her, "Okay, ma'am,
since your son's being raised naturally,

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:13.069
and that's good, I want you to raise him
naturally the way you should.

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:17.709
So tomorrow morning, when your child's
natural body clock awakens him,

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:21.039
send him to school." She said, "No matter
what time?"

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.109
I said, "No matter what time, when he wakes up,

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.139
send him to school." She said, "Will he be
marked tardy?"

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:32.619
I said, "Oh, no, we're going by natural
function."

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.399
And so she said, "Well, I don't want him in
Mr. Thomas's class because Mr.

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.130
Thomas doesn't like him anymore

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.249
because he's always tardy, and I feel he
should have a new teacher.

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:45.979
Whose class are you going to put him in?" I said, "Every teacher at this school is certified.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.340
Let him walk around and choose a room. [crowd laughter]

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.149
Wherever he finds an open chair or

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.590
a teacher that is physically appealing,
he may go in.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.779
We have blondes, brunettes, Asians,

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:03.609
Hispanic, whatever he chooses, just go in.

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:07.539
I'm sure before the end of the day he will have picked up some tidbit of knowledge."

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.709
So she was getting a little suspicious,
and so she said, "Well, okay,

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.120
what time will he go home if he gets to
come whenever he wants to?"  I said, "When

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.709
he begins to feel fatigued,

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.640
he should just pack it up, run along home,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.950
because I think you shouldn't stay as
long as your natural body function says

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.780
you're tired.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.530
He should just go home." She said, "Well, he can't just 'go home.'

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.060
He's a bus rider. What bus will he ride?" I
said, "They're all yellow.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.480
Choose one. [crowd laughter] Whenever he gets to a place

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.450
that is close to what looks familiar,
just ask the bus driver to let him off."

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.959
She said, "You're crazy! You've lost your mind! You can't

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.329
run a school like this!" I said, "That's
what I've been trying to tell you.

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.809
Get the boy here at eight o'clock. [crowd laughter, applause] You know?"
