00:00:00.394 --> 00:00:02.576
(piano playing)

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:05.421
Dr. Zucker: We're in the
Louve and we're looking

00:00:05.421 --> 00:00:09.092
at a large altar panel
by Giotto of St. Francis.

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:10.835
It's a really spectacular painting.

00:00:10.835 --> 00:00:13.307
Dr. Harris: It is, it
shows St. Francis receiving

00:00:13.307 --> 00:00:16.367
the Stigmata from Christ
who appeared to him

00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:17.768
in the form of a Seraphim.

00:00:17.768 --> 00:00:21.635
What's striking is that
this is not St. Francis

00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:24.694
in a very iconic frontal way.

00:00:24.694 --> 00:00:25.956
Dr. Zucker: As we might have expected in

00:00:25.956 --> 00:00:26.973
a more Medieval tradition.

00:00:26.973 --> 00:00:27.592
Dr. Harris: Exactly.

00:00:27.592 --> 00:00:31.931
Instead Francis is kneeling,
he's in a naturalistic

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.536
landscape or at the
beginnings, we could say,

00:00:34.536 --> 00:00:36.337
of a naturalistic landscape.

00:00:36.337 --> 00:00:40.655
As he receives the stigmata
he looks up in wonder

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:44.026
and awe and confusion,
and even some anxiety,

00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:44.707
I think.

00:00:44.707 --> 00:00:45.586
Dr. Zucker: A little fear there, right?

00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:46.063
Dr. Harris: Yeah.

00:00:46.063 --> 00:00:47.661
Dr. Zucker: But they
are very human emotions.

00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:49.664
It's really an expression
of, you're right,

00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:52.367
not an eternal iconic image,

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:55.525
but rather of a moment
of a man responding.

00:00:55.525 --> 00:00:57.073
Dr. Harris: And his body is rendered

00:00:57.073 --> 00:00:58.746
naturalistically, too.

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:01.201
We have modeling, so we see the folds

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:04.412
in the drapery, we see his left knee,

00:01:04.412 --> 00:01:06.540
his right knee folded under him,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.758
the modeling in his hands where we see

00:01:08.758 --> 00:01:10.663
the stigmata, modeling in his face.

00:01:10.663 --> 00:01:12.822
So he really seems like
this folky three dimensional

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:15.078
presence, really different from the flat,

00:01:15.078 --> 00:01:18.914
transcendent figures of
only a little bit earlier.

00:01:18.914 --> 00:01:20.176
Dr. Zucker: And actually
other artists that are

00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:20.890
still painting.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.113
I want to go back to that point you made

00:01:22.113 --> 00:01:24.209
a moment ago of the naturalistic landscape

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:25.780
because this is certainly not naturalism

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.060
as we would expect now
in the 21st Century,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.091
but it is, at the very beginning of the

00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:32.436
14th or at the very end
of the 13th Century,

00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:35.456
quite an extraordinary
innovation to place this

00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:38.338
really physical figure
as you had described him

00:01:38.338 --> 00:01:40.965
in an environment with
trees, with mountain.

00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:42.959
Dr. Harris: Clearly his
scale doesn't match the

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:45.934
building and the trees,
but there's an effort here

00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:47.881
by Giotto to place him on earth,

00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:50.423
not just in a heavenly space.

00:01:50.423 --> 00:01:52.404
Dr. Zucker: We see this
extraordinary gold filled

00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:54.463
background, the light of Heaven pours down

00:01:54.463 --> 00:01:56.840
and we see that literally
in the divine rays

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.631
that go from the Seraphim from Christ

00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:02.178
down to Francis, down to
his feet, to his hands

00:02:02.178 --> 00:02:03.827
and to the wound in his side;

00:02:03.827 --> 00:02:06.901
this gift from Heaven
for his faithfulness.

00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:08.782
It's important to remember that Francis

00:02:08.782 --> 00:02:11.443
was a mendicant, a
beggar, that he'd given up

00:02:11.443 --> 00:02:13.831
his worldly possessions
and like the Dominican's,

00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:15.924
the Franciscan's would renounce

00:02:15.924 --> 00:02:18.336
worldly possessions in honor of Christ.

00:02:18.336 --> 00:02:20.668
Initially there are some
reports that the church

00:02:20.668 --> 00:02:22.596
was not sure that it wanted to accept

00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:23.930
St. Francis' ideas.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.426
The predella below is
important because it shows

00:02:27.426 --> 00:02:29.636
very much the acceptance of Francis.

00:02:29.636 --> 00:02:32.261
Dr. Harris: So, we have
these three scenes below

00:02:32.261 --> 00:02:37.234
in the predella showing
Pope Innocent III vision

00:02:37.234 --> 00:02:39.017
of Francis supporting a church,

00:02:39.017 --> 00:02:42.808
the next of blessing that
order of the followers

00:02:42.808 --> 00:02:44.600
of St. Francis, the Franciscan's

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.749
and then St. Francis
preaching to the birds.

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:50.100
Dr. Zucker: Those are all
really interesting stories.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.209
This dream of the Pope, this great miracle

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.900
in which he dreamt that Francis was

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.121
not only supporting a
church, but was supporting

00:02:57.121 --> 00:02:58.735
a church that was falling down.

00:02:58.735 --> 00:03:00.905
It's crucial allegory,
of course, or metaphor.

00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:03.878
The acceptance of Francis,
this central scene,

00:03:03.878 --> 00:03:06.208
very, very important;
literally the embrace

00:03:06.208 --> 00:03:08.289
of the church to this mendicant order.

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:09.179
Dr. Harris: Legitimizing.

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:10.539
Dr. Zucker: That's right,
absolutely legitimizing

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:12.402
and if you think about it for a moment,

00:03:12.402 --> 00:03:14.480
the mendicant's did
represent a kind of threat.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.430
The church was a very wealthy institution,

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.878
it was a very powerful institution,

00:03:17.878 --> 00:03:19.532
and here were these followers of Christ

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:22.865
saying, Christ preached
poverty, I'm taking that on.

00:03:22.865 --> 00:03:25.445
For the church to embrace that was a very

00:03:25.445 --> 00:03:26.578
important step.

00:03:26.578 --> 00:03:29.243
Then, of course, on the
right this relationship

00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:31.694
between Francis and nature.

00:03:31.694 --> 00:03:35.256
Francis living in the desert
or living in the wilderness

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:38.022
having this direct
relationship with all of God's

00:03:38.022 --> 00:03:39.665
creation is placed here,

00:03:39.665 --> 00:03:41.763
One of the reasons that
Francis is often linked

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.661
to sort of ecological movements

00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:46.306
and often seen a patron of nature.

00:03:46.306 --> 00:03:48.032
Dr. Harris: I love the way he reaches out

00:03:48.032 --> 00:03:51.966
toward the animals, the
way that the figures are

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:54.365
it's very stark against
that gold background.

00:03:54.365 --> 00:03:56.440
So there's this Heavenly realm,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.509
but simultaneously in an earthly realm.

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:02.361
It seems to me that
Giotto has united both.

00:04:02.361 --> 00:04:04.433
Dr. Zucker: There's a
simplicity to Giotto's work

00:04:04.433 --> 00:04:06.968
that includes a kind
of emotional directness

00:04:06.968 --> 00:04:09.808
that I think has made
his work seem incredibly

00:04:09.808 --> 00:04:11.410
authentic for many, many years.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.145
Artists are constantly looking back to the

00:04:14.145 --> 00:04:16.897
so called Italian
Primitives for that sort of

00:04:16.897 --> 00:04:18.711
direct vision and here we have it

00:04:18.711 --> 00:04:20.301
at it's most beautiful.

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:23.282
