Hello, My name is Candace Draper and I'm a
fit expert here at Canyon Beachwear.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.740
Everyone that works here at Canyon Beachwear
is a fit expert.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.559
We know everything there is to know about
bikinis.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.809
It's kinda eat, breath, sleep bikinis.

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.470
So we're like the girlfriend you forgot to
bring into the store.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.330
You can also find us online or at www.canyonbeachwear.com.
you can find us on Facebook and twitter as

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:30.369
well under canyonbeachwear and today we're
gonna be talking about swimwear.

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.610
Rhea is wearing one of canyon beachwear's
most glamorous one-pieces we have.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.791
The black is classic, you can never go wrong
with the black suit.

00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:42.810
See this amazing square neckline with the
seam running through.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.190
That almost gives that retro look while still
being extremely feminine.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.610
And this is exactly how you want to wear one-piece.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.079
Rhea's got her shoulders back, she's rocking
heels and she is confidence.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.739
That's honestly the key to wearing a swimsuit.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.461
For one-pieces, it's all about the torso.

00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:05.320
You want to focus on this here; this weaving
actually makes it appear longer than what

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.970
she really is.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.770
The great bust-line is giving her minimal
but amazing cleavage as well as these great

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.770
straps.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.490
When you get shoulder straps, you get a lot
less headache from neck pain and holding up

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.640
and everything like that.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.250
The shoulder straps are going to give you
that athletic but still the **** look that

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.479
you're probably looking for while looking
for one-piece.

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.150
This is the suit that you can literally take
from the lap pool to the pool in ****. It's

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.160
a suit for all seasons, for all wear it's
great.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.360
The pattern is more of a hipster; the high
cuts are pretty much out.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.509
So the low cut hipster is the one which you
really want to go for.

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.670
It's going to give the most fabric from armpits
to hip and that's going to give you most length.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.509
On the back, she has this seamless cut, it's
a seamless high cut but still wide.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.531
She also has this ‚ÄòU' back with a little
bit in the mid.

00:01:57.531 --> 00:02:01.299
You don't necessarily want too low cause you're
not going to get the support you need.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.990
And if you get too high, it sometimes gets
a little too high and feels a little stuffy.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.829
So this is a great coverage as far as the
one-piece goes.

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.870
So if you're looking for any kind of one-piece,
you definitely, I would say stick with the

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.000
solid.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.340
The solids are going to give you the most
versatile and the leanest look.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.300
Any kind of print is going to be a little
bit too much, depending on what kind of shape

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.300
you are.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.820
So stick with the solid, a black one-piece
always looks amazing.
