The Caribou Lou Recipe

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Welcome back, this is your Maestro of MIxology

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Jöhnny Dîablø, and today we’re making the Caribou Lou.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
As far as I can tell,  this is a drink that was invented

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
on the University of Missouri campus

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
back in 1995.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Of course, the rapper Tech N9ne

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
made it famous.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, what you’re going to need for this is:

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Bacardi 151, Malibu,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and pineapple juice.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Alright, let’s get busy with it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We’re going to start with 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
1 ½ ounces of Bacardi 151.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.000
One ounce of Malibu coconut rum.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And then we’re going to use five ounces of pineapple juice.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now I’m going to shake this up and throw it in a glass.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Ba-boom.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Alright, let’s strain this out.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Now, people aren’t paying me to make this drink,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
at least not yet.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I just want to want to.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Alright, let’s try it and see how it tastes.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
That’s dope.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It tastes just like pineapple, but 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
there’s a — yeah, I can taste the coconut, too.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And I know the 151 is lurking in the background.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
But believe me, 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I’m not heaving from this yet.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
