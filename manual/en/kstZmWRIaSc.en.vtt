they about happily married gay couple
christopher bridgeman martin border

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.849
both corporate executives were
humiliated in texas at the george bush

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.849
international airport when they went to
collect their luggage from the

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.369
international flight there bag which was
secure before the flight had been

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.560
tampered with

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.430
its contents including adjudged hendrik
purple dildo were taped to the top of

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.410
the bag now the bag contained a logo of
the airline and only airline personnel

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.579
were allowed to handle the baggage so
people are leaning towards thinking this

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.019
is not a t s safing but in airline
baggage handlers thing the couple is now

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.750
suing the airline for invasion of
privacy intentional infliction of

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.070
emotional distress mental anguish as
well as negligence either seeking an

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.120
unknown amount for damages they work out
only going to be in texas very briefly

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.280
to catch a connecting flight as you know
luis

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.630
when you come in on international flight
you kind of have exited re-enter

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.600
security including with all that luggage
that's the point at which they noticed

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.370
this

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.780
and um... so when asked for a comment
daily mail is reporting that the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.470
airlines reasoning for removing the
dildo was quote because the airline

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.400
baggage handlers realized it was in a
baghdad a man's name on the luggage tag

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.110
apparently the airlines policy is that
employees have been judge of what isn't

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.980
isn't gender appropriate for the
customer's personal and private clients

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.030
uh... these baggage handlers in our
sociologist it's incredible

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.860
i wonder

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.490
with the requirements are to become
uh... but that is usually a hundred and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.080
he did

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.500
the degree that field you doctor
beginning to be about it and then you

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.760
constantly making assessments about the
gender appropriateness of different

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.800
items people carry

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.930
so what's gonna happen here

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.570
are now will see what happens with the
law suits a very strange story we

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.930
haven't really heard from united about
about what

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.280
the situation

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.090
