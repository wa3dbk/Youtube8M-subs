Hi, I'm Sarah with the Hobby Lobby Creative Studio!

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:43.400
Welcome to our Sew This Bedroom Series! Today I'm going to show you how to make this super easy, no-sew lampshade you can customize to fit any room in your house! 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.250
To complete this project we'll be using this self-adhesive lampshade you can find in the Home Decor section of the Fabric Department.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.040
For the rest of the supplies you need to make a lampshade like mine, check out the printable by clicking the link for a full supply list!

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.809
To get started, press your fabric, then lay it out flat, face down.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:10.620
Unpeel the lampshade pattern from the shade, and place it on your fabric, centering the design of the fabric if needed.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.980
Trace directly around the template using a disappearing ink pen.  

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:26.629
Instead of just cutting exactly around the template, I'm going to add a little extra fabric so I can wrap it around the top and bottom edges of the lampshade to give it a nice, finished, professional look.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.320
To do that, I'm just going to add 2" to the template on these three sides. 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.020
The template already allows for a bit of overlap at the seam, so we don't need to add any extra on this 4th side.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:50.640
An easy way to mark this is to set a seam gauge at 2" and make small tick marks with your disappearing ink pen all the way around those three sides of the template.  

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.100
Now you can carefully cut out your fabric following the tick marks on three sides, and the line for the fourth side.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.700
At this point, go ahead and press your fabric again if needed.  You want to make sure it's nice and flat before applying it to the shade.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.020
Lay your fabric out, print side down, like this.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:22.120
Now, position the shade so that the back seam lines up with the edge of the fabric closest to you.  Also, make sure that the top and bottom edges of the shade line up with the lines you drew.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.140
Once you have it lined up, gently place the shade down, leaving just the very edge of the fabric exposed.  

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:38.000
The shade is self-adhesive, but I still recommend applying a thin bead of hot glue along the edge of the fabric just to keep it nice and secure

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.051
Quickly press it into place along the seam of the shade.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.800
Now, rotate your fabric and shade so that the loose end of the fabric is closest to you.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:56.000
Using the lines drawn on the back side of the fabric to line up with the edges of the shade, slowly roll the shade towards you. 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.220
Make sure to hold the fabric taut the whole time you are applying the fabric to the shade. 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:11.100
As you go, run your hand along the inside of the shade to help smooth out small wrinkles or bubbles and to help really secure your fabric to the shade.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:20.440
Keep an eye on your fabric to be sure you aren't getting any wrinkles, if you notice one forming, stop and re-roll that section so it's nice and smooth.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.441
Once you've made it all the way around the shade, you're ready to finish up the back seam.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.180
Fold the fabric under to where it will slightly overlap the raw edge of fabric on the back seam

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.250
Press across the fold with your fingers, then carefully secure it with a line of hot glue applied right at the very edge.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:57.140
Now that the fabric is applied to the outside of the shade, you're ready to fold the extra fabric around to the inside, giving you that clean professional-looking edge.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.320
Position the shade so the top opening faces you.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:11.120
Starting at the front middle of the shade, fold the fabric over once so it almost meets the edge of the shade, and secure the fold with hot glue.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.160
Do this all the way around the shade moving little by little until you have it all folded and glued.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:26.949
Now, again starting at the front middle of the shade, wrap the fabric up into the inside of the shade, again applying some hot glue to secure it in place.

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:32.569
Continue working your way around the shade, doing a small section at a time. 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:50.260
When you get to an area that has a wire from the shade's frame, cut a little slit in the fabric to allow it to go around the wire (just be sure not to cut past the edge of the shade!) Glue it into place on both sides of the wire, and keep going.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:00.450
When you get the top done, flip the lampshade around, and finish out the bottom opening the same way you did the top.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.340
Here's what your lampshade should look like when you're done finishing that bottom edge.  

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.460
Now you're ready to add the tassel trim!

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:16.471
To measure out your trim, just wrap the tassel trim around the bottom and add about an extra inch.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:25.940
Starting again at the seam of the shade, and working in small sections, apply a generous line of hot glue along the bottom of the shade.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.870
Line up the bottom edge of the trim with the bottom edge of the shade, and press it in place.  

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.400
Continue working your way all the way around the shade.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:46.540
When you get back around to the back seam, cut the trim so the ends fit flush up against each other.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.540
Glue to secure it in place, and you're all done!

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.480
These lampshades are such a great, quick way to add a custom look to any room.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.510
Well, that's all for today guys!

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:00.200
