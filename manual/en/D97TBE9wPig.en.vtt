Heya playas, if you've ever wanted a glimpse
inside of my life, the entire month of August

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.560
is gonna be your chance.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.550
I'm gonna explain more right after the intro
but trust me, you're gonna wanna stick around

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.190
because I have an exciting announcement just
for you.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.920
This is The Josh Speaks.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.660
You're watching The Josh Speaks.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.650
So, while you're watching this video.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.609
I'm actually out taking a road trip all around
New York seeing things like the Finger Lakes

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:28.980
and Niagara Falls.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.270
If you follow me on Twitter or Periscope then
you know that I've been participating in SSSVEDA

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.530
which in my case is actually stream every
day in August.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.860
If you're on Periscope, follow me @TheJoshSpeaks
so you can see the things that I'm experiencing

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.460
and so you can interact with me live.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.489
SSSVEDA is a more structured and organized
30 day challenge set up by Amy Schmittauer

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.110
of SavvySexySocial.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.510
If you want to participate and start vlogging
or streaming for the entire month of August,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.510
it's not too late.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.379
I'm going to link her video right here so
you can get an idea of how to go about it

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.609
and where to start.

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.860
And at the end of the month, I'm going to
create a recap video of the different crazy

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.650
experiences I had and the best questions that
you guys asked me.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.210
Speaking of bonuses and I realized that no
one said bonuses but speaking of bonuses,

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.280
lets be real here.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.119
Back to School is coming up which means I
need to do a Google Hangout with you guys

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.930
to answer all of your Back to School questions.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.659
Now, I'm gonna be out exploring this entire
week so expect that hangout to be either next

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.159
week or the week after.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.380
Either way I really want to get you guys prepared
for Back To School so you feel confident,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.869
relaxed and ready to take on the world.

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.700

an immediate answer, leave them down below

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.090
