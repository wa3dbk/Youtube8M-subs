00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.760
Extremely small dimensions (Sony RX100 body size)

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.980
Collapsing lens. No release lever, only slight press is needed 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.960
Very fast autofocus

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.560
Wide angle 16:9 touch screen makes 4:3 photos very small 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.620
Manual focusing is controlled by buttons or display with 12-32mm lens (it does not have focus ring)

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.260
Two focus speeds for manual focus

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.380
Touch quick menu

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.800
It is quite easy to accidentaly press the touch screen and change the position of AF point to top right corner

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.760
Quick menu is fully configurable

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.040
Full HD 1080p50 video, stabilization is good, zoom is very smooth (12-32mm lens)

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.780
If the manual video mode is used, you can change aperture and exposure time

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.660
External flash has strange shape, in not very strong for its size. The GM5 sync time is 1/50 seconds only

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.880
Dynamic range is good, lens suffers from lens flare

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.280
Autofocus is mostly fast and precise in video mode. The wind was strong here and AF system was not capable to handle that properly

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.240
Changing the aperture from F5.6 to F22 and back

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.980
Night photos are quite good (long exposure times support, extremely sensitive AF system up to -4 EV). Do not forget to turn on the long exposure denoise system (GM5 really needs that)

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.780
Night movie is not very good, suffers from higher noise and insufficient exposure

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.680
