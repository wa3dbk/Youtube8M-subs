Hi, Alan Stratton from As Wood Turns dot com.
A couple of weeks ago, I got a line on some

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:22.749
walnut wood. I managed to buy a lot of this
walnut. It is 3" thick. It is offcuts from

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.970
gun stock blank cutting. I took the worst
piece of the whole lot and decided to make

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.960
a bowl out of it. This is the piece. This
is a nice big trunk. In the future, I'll

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.230
get probably 2 or 3 more bowls out of this.
Let's make a nice walnut bowl; fiddleback,

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:55.659
some sap wood, and some rich heart wood out
of this blank of walnut. Let's have some

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.210
fun.
The first task, of course, is to true up the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.210
blank. This one I managed to cut fairly round
and it is fairly easy to do it. Making sure

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.070
I'm using a bowl gouge and not a spindle
gouge. Always for this sort of work, use a

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.070
bowl gouge.
Just a little bit more to true it up. Then

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.200
start shaping the outside of the bowl. I wanted
to maximize what I got out of this piece of

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.900
wood. The wood is 3 inches thick. I could
not make it any thicker. So I wanted to preserve

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.900
every bit of that thickness that I could for
the bowl.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.280
I wanted to get a nice pleasing shape out
of it also. Get the outside just a little

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.420
bit more at this point. All this with the
bowl gouge. I changed the cuts a couple of

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.030
times. In the end, I'll do some shear scraping.
But with the changeup between the heart wood

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.360
and the sap wood on this walnut, it was very
hard to get a good smooth cut. I wound up

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.930
doing some shear scraping.
In order to maximize the depth, I decided

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.690
not to turn a tenon on the bowl itself. did
not want to waste any wood to a tenon. So

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.920
I glued on another waste block so I could
maximize the actual walnut piece. While I

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.480
was at it, I treated a check and bark inclusion
with CA glue to stabilize it.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.480
When that dried, which was overnight, I went
back and trimmed up the outside just a little

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.290
more to get the shape of the bowl that I was
after. And shear scraping. Time to flip it

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.290
over and go for the inside...Using my largest
bowl gouge.

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:14.459
This wood was actually very nice to turn.
Generally, I'm turning green wood and you

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.630
would see it coming off fairly easily. I expected
this to be much, much harder. Indeed it is

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.630
hard. But I made sure I had sharpened my tools.
I watched my cuts, my holding, I tried to

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.290
keep my weight balanced and everything to
maintain my stance. And I think it is starting

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.510
to pay off.
This went very nicely and very well. I did

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:56.280
stop quite often to check the wall thickness.
I didn't want it too thin; I did not want

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.280
it too thick. It is a smidgen over Â½" thick.
To me, it was a very good weight and heft.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.319
I know some people want to go for 1/8".
But this one is potentially a utility bowl

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:18.190
also. I did not want it too thin. And to me
this had about the right thickness, the right

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.680
feel to it.
At this point, I'm working on the last little

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.680
hump in the center of the bowl. To get that
out and down. Then with the difference in

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:36.100
the cut, I decided to go ahead and use the
heavy bowl scraper. It is cutting with just

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.970
a little bit of a burr out on the edge of
that scraper. And it is heavy enough to reach

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:48.970
a long way over the tool rest. It actually
cut very nicely on this walnut. And it did

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.930
make a nice smooth finish. Just needed a little
bit more sanding to finish it up.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.889
There's the last little bit. I started to
sand it here with 80 grit. You can see the

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.320
cloud of dust that it is raising. I said no;
I have to cut down on that dust. So I decided

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:17.320
to step back and use my mineral oil/wax mix:
75% mineral oil and 25" beeswax and that

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.460
cut down significantly the amount of dust
that it was generating. I really don't like

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.160
breathing walnut dust.
Then take off the waste block that I had put

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:38.160
on to mount it with; tool it off. Get as much
of that walnut showing. I didn't want to

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:46.229
give up any more of it than I had to. I do
want a little foot on the bottom, a little

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:56.080
recess so it will sit level on a table top.
Then blend it on in. Then finally cut away

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.960
the little nub that was left on it.
Here I'm using a vacuum chuck. So it is

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.960
using atmospheric pressure to hold it against
the head stock. But I wanted to keep the tail

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:18.370
stock on as long as possible. Then finish
it up just a little bit with the heavy bowl

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.449
scraper. Then back to sanding to blend it
in.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:28.830
Then finish the outside with the walnut oil
that I'm using for this size of bowl.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.180
And I think it is a beauty. Good fiddleback
figure, good heartwood, good sapwood. It's

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.150
a keeper. Has a little bark inclusion on the
side.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.800
I like it. It is actually a gift for my son
and daughter in law. I think they like it.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.160
If there is anything else you'd like me
to try, please let me know. If you have critique,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.820
let me know.
