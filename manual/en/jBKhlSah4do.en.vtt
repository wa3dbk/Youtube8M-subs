Hey folks it is Barry here welcome to my virgin
kitchen now have you ever wanted to make your

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.260
own edible lego?

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.870
Maybe your dog eats it, maybe your kids eat
it, maybe you eat it, well now you can.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.020
These are edible chocolate lego men, amazing
times.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.030
Pretty cool right so wether you are making
a Lego cake and want some little Lego men

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.140
to go alongside it or you want to kill off
that desire inside you to want to eat actual

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.900
Lego pieces you are looking at someone that
may have done that when they were younger.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.030
You need one thing ok this is a silicone lego
mould ok, very important there is a link down

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.379
below of where you can get one and also I
will give this away at the end of the video.

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.590
If you want to have a go hit pause on the
video now write down all the ingredients I

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.170
have there if you want to join me I added
some nuts too also some food colouring oil

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.430
very important for dying our chocolate.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.670
Anyhow it is easy, messy, but this is how
you do it.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.221
So the first thing you want to do if you are
not making them on their own I made a few

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:59.469
plain lego men as you will see is get some
stuffed marzipan and push it into the body

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.869
parts, like the arms or feet or body just
to create little portions so when we dye our

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:08.330
chocolate and add it in there it will melt
and firm up together consistently so get it

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.170
all nice and laid out, next up grab your melted
white chocolate and add in the food colouring

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.170
oil.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.200
So I started with the yellow first of all
got it nice and vibrant in there, then added

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.990
in to the little pockets I had formed with
the marzipan filling it right up, it does

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.470
get pretty messy as I say but just stick along
with it and shove in your freezer for ten

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.900
minutes just to firm up.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.630
With it firmed up it was a case of repeating
those steps, so dying the white chocolate

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.680
red and blue respectively scooping out my
marzipan bits moving it where I needed to

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.810
and just filling up the holes to seal it all
together putting it back in the freezer for

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.550
ten minute blasts as I went along and that
is pretty much it guys once all done you can

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.981
pop it out of it a nice cheeky black icing
pen smile on there looking amazing, maybe

00:01:50.981 --> 00:01:55.000
line them up and get some more lego pieces
alongside to get it confused, and it does

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.900
taste pretty darn good.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.280
Absolutely loving it the only thing I was
a bit gutted about was the fact a helmet from

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.250
real Lego would not fit on it and looked more
like a turban.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.229
If you would like to win this actual lego
mould the link is down below to get it all

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.870
I want you to do is take a photoshop of me
right now and turn me into lego.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.700
Tweet me @myvirginkitchen and my favourite
one I will message you and send this one out,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.900
just like all my other competitions guys I
will let you know privately because something

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.579
in the past some people got a bit angry about
that and started giving hate to one girl,

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.150
that won a mould, that was horrible, so I
notify you privately in case you are wondering.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.503
Anyhow tweet me a picture of me lego style
and give these a go.

00:02:32.503 --> 00:02:35.810
I will see you next time, check out my last
video, bye then!
