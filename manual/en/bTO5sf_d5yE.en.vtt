How to Make a Paper Glider.

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:13.730
If you’re looking for hang time, this tried-and-true
paper glider is just the ticket.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:21.470
You will need A sheet of 8 1/2&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot;
paper and a ruler.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.650
Step 1.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.730
Place the paper on a flat surface in front
of you, as if you’re about to write a letter.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.090
Step 2.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.840
Fold the paper in half lengthwise.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.809
Make a crease, then unfold the paper and smooth
it flat again.

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.230
Use the edge of a ruler instead of your finger
to make your creases really sharp.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.500
Step 3.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.670
Fold the top two corners down and toward the
crease to form two triangles, creating a point

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.570
at the top of the paper.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.970
Press the folds flat.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.579
Leave a little space between the inside edges
of each triangle and the crease.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.159
This will make folding easier as you go along.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.850
Just make sure your triangles are the exact
same size.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.280
Step 4.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.280
Fold the top of the paper down, making a crease
where the bottom edge of each triangle starts.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.220
The paper will now look like a large envelope
with a pointed flap.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.470
Step 5.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.540
Now fold your two new top corners in toward
the crease, again forming two triangles, but

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.830
before pressing down each fold, move the corners
slightly upward along the middle crease.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.500
This will give the glider a blunt nose instead
of a sharp point.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.500
Step 6.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.830
A small triangle will now be peeking out from
beneath the folded flaps.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.140
Fold the triangle up over the flaps.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.140
Step 7.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.780
Now fold the entire right half of the plane
under the left half (along the original middle

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.240
crease), so that the small triangle stays
on the outside of your plane.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.670
Step 8.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.960
Fold down one wing, starting the crease where
the blunt nose begins and angling it on a

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.490
slight diagonal.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.700
Step 9.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.519
Flip the paper over and repeat, folding the
other wing down to match the first wing, forming

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.230
a narrow triangle base that you'll hold to
launch the plane.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.060
To make the glider arc up as it flies, fold
the back corner of each wing so that there's

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.590
a small triangle sticking up—or fold one
triangle down and one up to make the plane

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.940
spiral.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.090
Step 10.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.779
Pick up your glider and hold it near the nose
with one hand.

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:32.569
Use your other to lift up the wings.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.420
Find some open space, and you’re ready to
soar.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.659
Did you know If a paper aircraft were thrown
in space, it wouldn’t fly—without the

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.239
pull of gravity, it would float away in a
straight line.
