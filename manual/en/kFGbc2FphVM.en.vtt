00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.909
Welcome to ItalianCakes. In this
video we offer you a recipe for

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:20.909
dough of Christmas cupcakes. It's a
spicy recipe, reminiscent of taste and

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.489
the scent of some typical sweets
Christmas.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:32.210
In a container we are going to pour 150ml
of milk,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.680
we add 70 grams of sugar,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.320
1 tablespoon of bitter cocoa we will go
sift with half a teaspoon of

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.790
bicarbonate

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.350
a third of a teaspoon of yeast

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.340
and then

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.410
we also add 120 grams

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.640
made with flour.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.950
We also sift the flour

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.880
 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.740
and we pour

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.820
all the ingredients in the container
with milk.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.850
 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.479
We briefly chill to blend the
ingredients, and in another container

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.230
let's prepare the spices:

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.900
a quarter of a teaspoon of nails
carnation,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.390
a quarter of a teaspoon of

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.040
nutmeg

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.850
a teaspoon of ginger

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.850
and two teaspoons of cinnamon.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.110
We mix the

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.780
ingredients and leave a few minutes

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.570
before pouring

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.170
in the container

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.190
with the ingredients previously
shakes.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.500
Add a tablespoon of jam

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.950
(in our case we used the
Cherry Jam)

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.969
and 30 grams of margarine

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.570
or melted butter.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.440
We have used margarine 
which gives a taste

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.070
a little more delicate.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:13.070
We're going to mix all of them well
ingredients together

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.829
and our dough is ready.

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.619
So we pour it

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:21.889
inside the cups for

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:28.889
cupcakes

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.709
and let's go to bake:

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.619
190 Â° C for about 15 minutes.

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:40.369
Once the cupcakes are cold
let's go drill in the center to be able to

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:41.349
to insert

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.689
the stuffing

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.659
and we keep a small disk of pasta

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.189
to cover the filling.

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:56.099
We used as stuffing of the
cherry jam, but we can

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.149
use also

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:05.089
a ganache or other types of creams.

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:09.299
After stuffing our cupcake
we put

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.689
the disk of pasta on jam. In
this way if we want to use the

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:19.839
sugar paste to decorate the
our cupcake, will not come into contact

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:21.989
with jam

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.519
and therefore we will not ruin ours
decoration. We thank you for
