00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.630
okay so we're going to look at chin-ups today
and the different variations, so I'm going to have

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.630
Danielle demonstrate.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.400
So the first and most easiest grip to do is
the parallel grip, so if you notice she keeps

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.080
her body very aligned, she pulls with the
lats first, pull, and goes up to the top, and

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.590
you see her deltoids touch the bars, well
bring it down, stretch, and pull it up, okay

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.870
and that's perfect sequencing, go down, so
she pulls with the large muscles first then

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.830
the elbow flexors, that's very good, thank
you.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.560
The next progression when you're doing chin-ups
is to do them supinated, that means palms up,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:04.059
and shoulder-width. So she'll face the bar,
this way, and then shoulder-width. She hangs

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.960
from the bar and pulls herself up, as you can
see the upper chest is touching the bar, that's

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:21.570
perfect technique, go down, do another one,
good, and go down, that's good, thank you.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:30.049
Okay so, when you go from a parallel grip
to supinated grip, you're about 15% weaker

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.049
okay, the reason is, why you're strongest
with the parallel grip is that the sum of

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.749
the four elbow flexors is at its optimal ratio,
so the brachioradialis has a very very effective

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:46.929
line of pull, the biceps brachii not so much,
the brachialis always works, but if you look

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.999
at the sum of the four elbow flexors it has
its optimal angle of pull when the hands are

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:53.119
neutral.

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.719
The next grip after supinated grip would be
narrow supinated grip and Danielle will demonstrate

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:06.859
so in that case the space between the two
hands is usually about four to ten centimeters

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:12.930
and she pulls up, okay and again she's way
above the bar, which is great, do another

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:21.280
one please, stretches and, up very good, and
bring down, good, stop.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:31.100
Okay so when you start with chin-ups you start
semi supinated grip and then you move to supinated

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.350
grip then your narrow supinated grip.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.450
The next step once you've done narrow supinated
you want to do narrow pronated okay, so you

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:48.220
want to leave about four to ten centimeters
between the two, very good, pull up, and again

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:57.260
she's way above the bar which is a great -- another
one, excellent okay, so those are excellent

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.670
pull-ups and then that's the next progression.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.290
So when you do your pull-ups what I suggest
you do, is you, if you want to do a cycle

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.320
to improve your pull-ups, is you do a more
challenging grip every sixth workout.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.760
So let's say Danielle has just finished a
grip where she's narrow pronated the next

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.730
phase would be wide pronated.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:30.020
So she will use a grip that is slightly wider
than the shoulders and pull up, okay, and

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.310
one more, pull, and good, all right, excellent
