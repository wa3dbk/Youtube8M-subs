00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:10.440
The gearboxes of modern Formula One cars are
highly automated. We shift gears by using

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.849
the pedals behind the steering wheel. And
they’re maybe a little bit comparable to

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:22.119
the sequential gearboxes from motor bikes,
except that our gear changes just happen so

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.710
much faster.
They are 7-speed boxes, seven ratios with

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.270
one reverse and the thing that’s really
developed in the last few years it what we

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.360
call seamless changes. And that means, we
change from one gear to the next without losing

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.890
any power from the engine. We don’t have
to tip the clutch, we don’t have to lose

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:47.510
drive. What we actually do, is engage both
gears at the same time. One starts to overtake

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.109
the other and just before it becomes a problem
the other one pulls out. So we get seamless

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:57.809
acceleration.
First of all, there’s the gear ratios which

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.480
you need to tune from one track to another.
And there’s also the way the shifts happen

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.930
because very often you are in the middle of
the corner and you have to shift, so you need

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.020
to make sure that the shift is very smooth
otherwise you could snap the rear away and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.200
you could spin and you could be off the track.
That requires a lot of detailed work.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.270
They’re also very tough little things,
they weigh around 35 kilos but they’ve got

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.099
to take 750 horse power and the huge amount
of torque from the engine, 350 Newton meters,

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:34.899
so they’re really nice pieces of engineering.
Almost like Swiss watch making when you look

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:44.959
inside them, but great piece of engineering.”
In a typical race I might shift about 3100

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.271
times, so you can imagine that all I’m doing
all the time is shifting. At the same time

00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:53.840
I need to change the brake balance, switch
on the KERS, the rear wing, the differential,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.489
so there’s a lot going on in the cockpit.
