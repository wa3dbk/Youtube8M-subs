00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.164
It's bout that time we should just say what's
on our mind and just let it all out right

00:00:55.164 --> 00:00:56.164
now.

00:00:56.164 --> 00:00:57.164

if all there is is drama

00:00:57.164 --> 00:00:58.164
why we fighting with each other baby.

00:00:58.164 --> 00:00:59.164
We won't get no stronger
if we don't care to hold on to what we had

00:00:59.164 --> 00:01:00.870
in the beginning.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:09.369
It's crazy cause everything that I say to
you, you start to catch and attitude then

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.191

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.049
You listen to your friends who
tell you what you should do

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:04.590
instead of listenin to ya baby.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.590
I feel like all your trust
jumped right out the window

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.920

me.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.370
It's crazy
cause when me and you are arguing

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.262
it's always over nonsense and it makes me
wanna leave you.

00:02:16.262 --> 00:02:17.262
But I can't
cause I don't wanna mess this up

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:21.230
