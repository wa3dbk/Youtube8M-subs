JOE WILES: Hi. This is Joe Wiles with the
Rock and Roll Conservatory on behalf of Expert

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.590
Village. In this segment, we're looking at
number 78. It is "Roulette" by System of a

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.850
Down. Our first step is that we've gotta take
our guitar from standard tuning, your standard

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:26.950
E, A, D, G, B and E. We've gotta drop it down
a whole step to D, G, C, F, A, D. I'm going

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:35.350
to play the pitches and you match your guitar
to these, okay? That's a D note. This is your

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:47.100
G note.
This is your C note.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:59.879
This is your F note.
This is your A note. And lastly, this is your

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.579
high D note. It's just like standard tuning
except it's a whole step down as if you had

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:15.250
two frets lower down here, okay? Now, to tackle
"Roulette," we're going to start with the

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:24.689
open C string. This is now the C string, 1st
fret of the high D string. Those are the two

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:32.590
we're going to tackle first. Next one, 3rd
fret of your C string, 5th fret on your high

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:43.639
D string. Okay? Then 3rd fret of your, now,
it's a G string, and the 5th fret of your

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:53.369
A string now. That's the 3rd chord. Slide
this up three, 1, 2, 3. So now on the 6th

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:02.319
and 8th fret of the same strings, we're going
to go slide this all the way down, same form,

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:09.540
but we're on the 1st fret and the 3rd fret
of the same strings, and you'll slide it up

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:37.610
two. Okay? Put together, that sounds like
this.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.260
That's a cooler riff. But the drop D tuning
could be a little tricky at first or the drop

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.790
D standard tuning could be a little tricky
at first so practice that a bit. Use my guitar

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.611
tuning as a reference if you need it, if you
don't have a tuner. And I'll see you on the

00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:51.680
next one. We're going to look at number 77.
