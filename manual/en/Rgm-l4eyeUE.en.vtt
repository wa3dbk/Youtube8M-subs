00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.300
So I had a chance to try out these new Zik
headphones from Parrot.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.180
And you know Parrot as a Bluetooth company
— they've made their name for themselves

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.860
making Bluetooth products, and these are,
indeed, a Bluetooth headphone.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.760
So they connect to your Smartphone or other
Bluetooth device, no wires needed.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.270
You can roam around and listen at will.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.330
It's very nice.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.590
And they're comfortable.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.970
They're well built, and they sound pretty
good out of the box.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.530
But to really take them to the next level,
I recommend downloading the free Parrot Audio

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.760
Suite app.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.289
It lets you change settings in the headphones
— for instance, turning on and off noise

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.800
cancelation, which the Zik does very well,
by the way.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.149
They have microphones on the bottom that analyze
the ambient sound and help cancel out the

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.269
noise, and do a great job of it.

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.659
But the most fun is, inside the app you have
all these audio settings you can change.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.879
You have a seven-band equalizer which you
can make your own preset or you can use one

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.460
of the presets that's in there.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.110
There's also this really cool concert hall
thing which lets you move these speakers around

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.420
in a virtual room, and it changes the sound.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.550
You can really hear it separating or getting
closer together.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.400
One of the primary features I liked on the
Zik headphones is that over your right ear

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.600
the ear cup is a touch panel, so you can do
certain basic functions just by tapping on

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.600
here.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:43.860
For instance, swipe up for volume up, down
for volume down, track over or track back.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.360
If you want to answer a call that comes in,
just tap.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.710
If you don't want to answer that call, just
press and hold for a couple seconds and it'll

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.600
refuse the call.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.700
When you take the headphones off, your music
will pause, or if you have a phone call going

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.390
taking the headphones off will automatically
shoot the call right over to your phone.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.200
So they're just so easy to use, and well thought
out.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.860
I really like that about the Zik.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.530
If you have any questions about the Zik headphones
or Bluetooth headphones in general just give

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.069
us a call.
