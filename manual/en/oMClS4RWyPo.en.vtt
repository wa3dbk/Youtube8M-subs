00:00:00.108 --> 00:00:02.378
I hope no one is claustrophobic - the Celts!

00:00:02.378 --> 00:00:03.378
On Emperor!

00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:04.378
With friends.

00:00:04.378 --> 00:00:05.888
It’s Cool.

00:00:05.888 --> 00:00:09.208
Mountain forest town - can’t complain, just
hit Found City

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:10.678
Oh hey!

00:00:10.678 --> 00:00:12.448
Yes, I saw ya there

00:00:12.448 --> 00:00:15.368
Sweden also said hi

00:00:15.368 --> 00:00:16.368
Whoa Rome!

00:00:16.368 --> 00:00:17.668
Hi… ahhh what’s your name?

00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:18.998
We live in faithful Edinburgh

00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:21.568
I like being King

00:00:21.568 --> 00:00:23.208
Teenage dream!

00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:25.078
The forests are full o’ birds

00:00:25.078 --> 00:00:26.508
Gotta buy that Silver!

00:00:26.508 --> 00:00:27.768
Got it.

00:00:27.768 --> 00:00:29.727
Grab land while it’s available

00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:30.988
Then violence

00:00:30.988 --> 00:00:33.157
Not everyone can settle

00:00:33.157 --> 00:00:36.538
Fifth place - totally due to holy forests

00:00:36.538 --> 00:00:37.617
Violence begins!

00:00:37.617 --> 00:00:38.617
Umm…

00:00:38.617 --> 00:00:40.597
Hiawatha has no soldiers nearby

00:00:40.597 --> 00:00:43.398
Guess you were forced to declare war earlier,
weren’tcha

00:00:43.398 --> 00:00:46.117
What you don’t see is Pocatello wanting
Silk for cheap

00:00:46.117 --> 00:00:48.778
He’s unhappy about our proximity

00:00:48.778 --> 00:00:50.827
Oh he’s mad

00:00:50.827 --> 00:00:53.187
Smash his stuff and don’t let anyone in

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:54.718
Our forests!

00:00:54.718 --> 00:00:56.597
Brave soldiers soldier on

00:00:56.597 --> 00:00:58.407
His soldiers suck

00:00:58.407 --> 00:01:00.807
The Celts know the secret to land expansion

00:01:00.807 --> 00:01:03.018
Need some Great Generals

00:01:03.018 --> 00:01:04.938
That means more violence!

00:01:04.938 --> 00:01:07.048
Gotta have a reason to fight

00:01:07.048 --> 00:01:08.668
Totally justifiable now!

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:11.238
Die everyone who thinks differently!

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:12.438
We are war monger

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:15.298
Hear us roaaar

00:01:15.298 --> 00:01:16.978
That’s enough for now

00:01:16.978 --> 00:01:18.938
It’s like training on the Holodeck

00:01:18.938 --> 00:01:24.638
Computer: run Great General production program
Riker 9-12 difficulty hard

00:01:24.638 --> 00:01:26.228
Program is ready!

00:01:26.228 --> 00:01:28.508
Yikes - a Great Wall

00:01:28.508 --> 00:01:30.518
Computer I didn’t mean that hard

00:01:30.518 --> 00:01:31.518
I’m sorry!

00:01:31.518 --> 00:01:32.518
Anyway… engage.

00:01:32.518 --> 00:01:33.518
Hahahahaha

00:01:33.518 --> 00:01:35.638
That’s how it feels to see all the land
around you just disappear

00:01:35.638 --> 00:01:38.088
Market tomorrow - fresh fruit?

00:01:38.088 --> 00:01:40.538
I hope the markets have security

00:01:40.538 --> 00:01:41.538
War from the North!

00:01:41.538 --> 00:01:43.128
Get a bunch of troops together

00:01:43.128 --> 00:01:45.688
Ahh this isn’t good

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:48.188
Rome, we grew up together!

00:01:48.188 --> 00:01:49.368
You DO remember!

00:01:49.368 --> 00:01:50.368
Ahhh!

00:01:50.368 --> 00:01:53.688
Uhhhh - but you aren’t even nearby

00:01:53.688 --> 00:01:55.508
Everybody was fighting in the trees!

00:01:55.508 --> 00:01:58.118
Where’s a Great General when ya need it

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.648
Stab anything that gets close

00:01:59.648 --> 00:02:04.208
Whadda ya want for Open Borders and a new
enemy, 500 bucks?

00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:05.208
Sure.

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:07.128
Why aren’t you rushing over to fight?

00:02:07.128 --> 00:02:08.128
Hurry up!

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.367
They’re just trees and hills.

00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:11.768
Well that was a good investment

00:02:11.768 --> 00:02:13.578
Calm down but shoot when necessary

00:02:13.578 --> 00:02:15.727
Hold your fire!

00:02:15.727 --> 00:02:17.748
Unhappy in 620 AD

00:02:17.748 --> 00:02:19.427
Wonder if that wonder will work

00:02:19.427 --> 00:02:21.947
1 turn left

00:02:21.947 --> 00:02:23.828
Missionaries find your position!

00:02:23.828 --> 00:02:25.337
Epically Heroic at home

00:02:25.337 --> 00:02:27.677
Take a moment for the lost Missionary

00:02:27.677 --> 00:02:29.647
Grand Temple is almost here

00:02:29.647 --> 00:02:31.927
As is war with all sorts of people

00:02:31.927 --> 00:02:34.087
Indonesia was angry for a bit

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:36.078
Free Acoustics at the speed of sound.

00:02:36.078 --> 00:02:38.248
And Rome sure is eating well

00:02:38.248 --> 00:02:41.268
Our 18 Citizens are content

00:02:41.268 --> 00:02:43.218
Carthage needs some Silk

00:02:43.218 --> 00:02:45.298
Egypt also requires it

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:46.388
Arabia as well

00:02:46.388 --> 00:02:48.117
Russia says please

00:02:48.117 --> 00:02:50.167
Silky-smooth like no other, eh

00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:52.748
No trade here, just demands

00:02:52.748 --> 00:02:53.748
You too

00:02:53.748 --> 00:02:55.567
Observe more science from the sky

00:02:55.567 --> 00:02:56.957
Hey Sweden!

00:02:56.957 --> 00:02:57.957
Be enlightened

00:02:57.957 --> 00:03:00.667
A way-too-late National Epic

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:02.688
Arabia is starting to take off…

00:03:02.688 --> 00:03:06.677
Over here is even more crowded - and the Byzantines
are late-bloomers

00:03:06.677 --> 00:03:07.767
Open Borders?

00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:09.707
Respect our trees.

00:03:09.707 --> 00:03:11.528
Science is the current focus

00:03:11.528 --> 00:03:13.138
Science and hammers

00:03:13.138 --> 00:03:16.078
Free land seems to be gone

00:03:16.078 --> 00:03:17.468
Gotta fit schools somewhere

00:03:17.468 --> 00:03:20.028
And crossbowmen wherever there’s room

00:03:20.028 --> 00:03:22.617
Come on man - bad karma

00:03:22.617 --> 00:03:25.657
Now I gotta tempt Russia with luxuries

00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:26.977
Mountains are the best defence

00:03:26.977 --> 00:03:31.568
What, you don’t like your embarked units
being sunk by arrows?

00:03:31.568 --> 00:03:32.568
Guns soon!

00:03:32.568 --> 00:03:34.417
Did ya hear that world?!

00:03:34.417 --> 00:03:35.798
Also going to expand the empire

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:38.197
That’s what Open Borders are for!

00:03:38.197 --> 00:03:39.197
Right, Poc?

00:03:39.197 --> 00:03:40.197
He’s invading calmly

00:03:40.197 --> 00:03:42.427
Don’t think about actually warring

00:03:42.427 --> 00:03:44.367
No one declare war!

00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:45.947
Gotta be Industrial

00:03:45.947 --> 00:03:47.557
Might get Broadway!

00:03:47.557 --> 00:03:48.647
Suddenly more slots!

00:03:48.647 --> 00:03:49.647
For Music

00:03:49.647 --> 00:03:50.647
NO!

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:51.647
I have Coal!

00:03:51.647 --> 00:03:54.007
And Archaeologists wait for a Cannon

00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:55.007
Got it!

00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:56.007
Now dig

00:03:56.007 --> 00:03:57.587
Still fifth place!

00:03:57.587 --> 00:04:00.097
Not eating as well as Russia or Rome though

00:04:00.097 --> 00:04:03.237
These guys dream of food, and sunlight

00:04:03.237 --> 00:04:04.707
Anger the Romans

00:04:04.707 --> 00:04:06.068
It was one time!

00:04:06.068 --> 00:04:07.068
So sorry.

00:04:07.068 --> 00:04:09.457
Been a while since any blood’s been spilt

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:11.347
Should’ve knocked on wood

00:04:11.347 --> 00:04:12.828
Or several blocks

00:04:12.828 --> 00:04:13.998
So…

00:04:13.998 --> 00:04:17.248
Ethiopia is too far away to really be a worry

00:04:17.248 --> 00:04:19.578
The other guys are kinda close

00:04:19.578 --> 00:04:21.018
This old chestnut again?

00:04:21.018 --> 00:04:24.558
Had no idea I agreed to denounce Arabia earlier

00:04:24.558 --> 00:04:27.088
Dude I didn’t even want to denounce him!

00:04:27.088 --> 00:04:29.568
Let’s be friends, Arabia!

00:04:29.568 --> 00:04:31.319
Plasticize, maybe Arabia won’t attack

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.468
Can’t handle war on all sides

00:04:34.468 --> 00:04:36.818
Kinda busy in the south

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:37.818
NOOOOOO

00:04:37.818 --> 00:04:38.818
AHHHHHH

00:04:38.818 --> 00:04:40.188
SO ANGRY

00:04:40.188 --> 00:04:42.418
You look happy and calm - but EEEEK

00:04:42.418 --> 00:04:45.418
New more explosives from the sky!

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:49.218
She didn’t appreciate war being part of
our science fair project

00:04:49.218 --> 00:04:51.968
How do you fight against the alpha dog?

00:04:51.968 --> 00:04:54.078
Make buildings cheap…er?

00:04:54.078 --> 00:04:55.868
Denmark is nice to us

00:04:55.868 --> 00:04:57.938
Rest of the world is… scary and unknown

00:04:57.938 --> 00:04:59.358
Thanks!

00:04:59.358 --> 00:05:00.858
That gold will go to good use

00:05:00.858 --> 00:05:02.548
Blowin’ up shit

00:05:02.548 --> 00:05:06.378
And Machine Gun upgrades - expensive and not
really worth it

00:05:06.378 --> 00:05:08.848
Red Arrows of Destruction are where it’s
at

00:05:08.848 --> 00:05:11.638
And Great Generals mean his land is our land

00:05:11.638 --> 00:05:13.618
It’s the Silver Citadel!

00:05:13.618 --> 00:05:15.178
“Great Leader” eh?

00:05:15.178 --> 00:05:16.938
I like that

00:05:16.938 --> 00:05:17.938
Best friends!

00:05:17.938 --> 00:05:21.838
Wait, what, “Anyone who you don’t get
along with is clearly worth building a friendship

00:05:21.838 --> 00:05:22.838
with.

00:05:22.838 --> 00:05:24.558
Give Arabia my regards”.

00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:26.568
Are you saying I pick bad friends?

00:05:26.568 --> 00:05:29.068
Let’s end this and go attack Sweden!

00:05:29.068 --> 00:05:30.068
I have lots of friends…

00:05:30.068 --> 00:05:31.518
I don’t need the Swedes

00:05:31.518 --> 00:05:36.248
Thanks Mr. Bluetooth - we make a good PAIR
- do you get it?

00:05:36.248 --> 00:05:37.728
Pairing Bluetooth?

00:05:37.728 --> 00:05:39.078
No?

00:05:39.078 --> 00:05:41.688
International Games in the 40’s or later!

00:05:41.688 --> 00:05:43.018
WAR BEGINS!

00:05:43.018 --> 00:05:44.358
War ends!

00:05:44.358 --> 00:05:45.538
Silk is essential!

00:05:45.538 --> 00:05:47.148
A Golden Age has Dawned!

00:05:47.148 --> 00:05:49.938
Sweden is too far away to actually attack
but the sentiment is there

00:05:49.938 --> 00:05:51.178
We’re sporty!

00:05:51.178 --> 00:05:53.668
It’s now the 50’s

00:05:53.668 --> 00:05:55.518
And everyone is our friend!

00:05:55.518 --> 00:05:57.418
That means nobody attacks, right

00:05:57.418 --> 00:05:58.418
Right ARABIA!?

00:05:58.418 --> 00:06:00.458
Don’t use your power for evil

00:06:00.458 --> 00:06:03.088
Rome is Arabian if you didn’t notice

00:06:03.088 --> 00:06:04.858
Also we got Information

00:06:04.858 --> 00:06:06.188
Launch the Hubble

00:06:06.188 --> 00:06:07.578
Back to World’s Fair building

00:06:07.578 --> 00:06:10.548
Again, Arabia needs to not be so ahead

00:06:10.548 --> 00:06:15.688
This part of the world also thrives, well
not Theodora in her valley village

00:06:15.688 --> 00:06:17.408
But our fake friendship!

00:06:17.408 --> 00:06:20.878
Doesn’t feigned international relations
mean anything anymore?!

00:06:20.878 --> 00:06:23.838
The Internet can’t keep up with Arabian
Knights

00:06:23.838 --> 00:06:27.408
Wait those aren’t Knights, those are far
scarier units

00:06:27.408 --> 00:06:29.688
Ouch - our feelings!

00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:31.138
Again - what’d I do?

00:06:31.138 --> 00:06:32.138
Hey!

00:06:32.138 --> 00:06:34.198
We are the ones being attacked here

00:06:34.198 --> 00:06:37.248
Trying to keep our tradition of not winning
projects

00:06:37.248 --> 00:06:39.078
Machine Guns gun

00:06:39.078 --> 00:06:40.508
Other types of guns gun back

00:06:40.508 --> 00:06:42.458
Can’t get him to stop

00:06:42.458 --> 00:06:46.208
I knew you didn’t want to fight in the first
place!

00:06:46.208 --> 00:06:48.148
Dream of Giant Death Robots

00:06:48.148 --> 00:06:50.888
Planes can hold ‘em back, maybe

00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:52.208
Denounce the weakest Civ?

00:06:52.208 --> 00:06:53.208
Why?

00:06:53.208 --> 00:06:54.208
That’s just mean

00:06:54.208 --> 00:06:55.438
So much negative energy

00:06:55.438 --> 00:06:57.528
Pick a unit and pray

00:06:57.528 --> 00:07:02.818
This isn’t gonna end well

00:07:02.818 --> 00:07:04.248
I see you’ve put your own spin on the jeans
look

00:07:04.248 --> 00:07:05.248
Damnit!

00:07:05.248 --> 00:07:06.258
Mighty Arabia is number one!

00:07:06.258 --> 00:07:07.918
Mother Russia isn’t bad at all.

00:07:07.918 --> 00:07:09.048
What was I, fifth?
