Hi. I'm Lanie Evans and on behalf of Expert
Village, I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.269
a memory box out of old valentine candies,
or boxes. So come look down here. You're going

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.910
to need an empty candy box, a sharpie, marker,
something that you can write with. You're

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.640
going to need a ruler, some scissors, some
kind of glue. You can use regular white glue,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.510
it will work fine, you'll just have a longer
drying times. I like to use hot glue. It gets

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.610
it done quick and dries quickly. The first
thing I'm going to do, also you're going to

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.920
need paper for wrapping. You can buy these
craft, old valentine's bags. I think they

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.710
make great wrapping paper. I'm going to be
using these. I've taken one of these bags,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:52.530
I've cut it open so I have a large, flat area,
and I've traced the heart. The bottom of the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.010
heart, I've taken it off and I traced it here.
The next thing you're going to want to do

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.410
is take your scissors and cut about every
inch and a half or so around the heart and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.000
you're going to stop at the line. If you don't
go and make it actually to that black line,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.040
you're going to have some problems when you
fold later. So make sure that you do that.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.370
I've done a top and a bottom heart, that I've
traced and cut out and I've also done a band.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:27.250
I've done a long band. I've measured it out.
I've taken my ruler and I've measured. It's

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.050
one inch. And so, I like to have a finished
edge. This is going to be the last thing we

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:40.500
add on. And what I've done is I've just folded
it down. I'm going to first take my paper

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:49.730
go ahead and do an X with the hot glue, and
line it up. You want to make sure that I line

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:58.450
it up right where that black line is so those
folds come up. The next thing I'm going to

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:09.209
do is go along and crease each piece and fold
it up. Next thing I'm going to do is run a

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:20.700
bead of glue right down the side and then
just gently get it to stay. And that's what

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.160
it's going to end up looking like. So you
have a nice shape you no longer see the candy

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:37.790
logos. We're going to do the same thing with
this heart. Now I have two hearts. They will

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:45.349
fit together but I want a nice edge here.
So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to take

00:02:45.349 --> 00:03:03.269
this and just wrap it around. Put a bead of
glue. So here's your finished product. You're

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.139
going to have a wrapped heart. You can also,
these are great for storing those photos in,

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:16.779
you can put photos in here, letters, you can
actually even put candy in here. Re-gift them,

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:17.689
they make great gifts.
