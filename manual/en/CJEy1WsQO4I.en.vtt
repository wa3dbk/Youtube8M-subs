On behalf of Expert Village I'm Nicole and
I'm here to tell you about Uromastyx. As far

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.070
as feeding supplements for your Uromastyx
what you should do is use a supplement that

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:20.390
has multi vitamins such as the I use this
Hervipe here but what this does not contain

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.210
is the calcium this is something that I like
because it doesn't contain the calcium. My

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.730
Uromastyx gets a avert diet so I don't want
to give him access calcium cause this can

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.510
cause problems. You need to be careful when
using your supplements a very small amount

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.170
with every feeding. Something that I found
very useful was put my supplement inside of

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.100
a salt shaker I can just kind of sprinkle
it on top of her vegetables when ever I do

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:57.879
feed her. They also have this out there it's
called Uromastyx Does, there are different

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.719
formulas there is insect formula and veggie
formulas, this one is a veggie formula. This

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:09.320
can be used when you don't have that wide
variety of vegetables that are recommended

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.080
for the Uromastyx. What this will do is complete
the Uromastyx natural value of the vegetables

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.610
that you do give your Uromastyx. So that is
something you want to look into if you can't

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.510
provide the wide variety on daily bases. Now
as far as frequency goes the juvenile Uromastyx

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:33.780
should be eating on a daily bases. Of both
vegetables and insects the adult Uromastyx

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.680
don't tend to eat as many insects. Mine is
a little special but most of them don't prefer

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.500
to eat insects they mainly like vegetables.
This is something that should be fed to them

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.820
on every other day bases. Uromastyx don't
require food on a daily bases actually only

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.270
every other day, where they are from in the
wild does not provide the opportunity for

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.700
them to eat on a daily bases. This is natural
to their native habitat to only be fed once

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.500
every other day.
