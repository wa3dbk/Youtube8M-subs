We just trapped a Feral Cat

00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:26.111
She kept smelling that food

00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:28.044
Feral Cat meaning wild animal

00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:30.291
This is a wild cat here and we're trying to rescue it

00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:31.357
Oh look how cute

00:00:31.412 --> 00:00:32.412
We're gonna try to tame it

00:00:32.512 --> 00:00:33.512
It's starving to death (meow, meow)

00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:34.851
Just a minute, we had to trap the animal

00:00:36.152 --> 00:00:37.152
We been feeding him for days

00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:38.312
Why don't they have a door for this thing on the front?

00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:40.292

00:00:45.697 --> 00:00:46.697
Ok, of course she's gonna bite you

00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:48.791
No she's not, they don't call em feral for nothing

00:00:52.472 --> 00:00:53.472
Come on let me get her out of here, I told you she was hungry

00:00:53.672 --> 00:00:54.672
and little, she's a little bitty thing. 

00:00:58.611 --> 00:00:59.611
We had to rescue her or somethings gonna kill her

00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:04.391

00:01:08.847 --> 00:01:09.847
Here's the Feral Cat

00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:11.911
the feral kitty cat that we caught

00:01:13.832 --> 00:01:14.832
2 days ago Hannah has been playing with it

00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:18.751
and working with it and she's

00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:19.691
able to hold it now

00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:23.171
hey Kirstie

00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:25.991
Hannah's named this kitty cat Kirstie

00:01:25.991 --> 00:01:26.604
(laughter)

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:27.378
FEMALE!

00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:28.911
Here kitty kitty, kitty

00:01:30.037 --> 00:01:31.037
Whoa don't bite me

00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:35.851
and this is her little kennel we got for her its all fixed up nice

00:01:36.332 --> 00:01:37.332
complete with Dr Pepper wallpaper

00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:42.231
and the whole nine, the Dr Pepper box is actually a little shelter

00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:43.451
house where she goes and hides when she's shy

00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:47.111
but she doesn't hide anymore because she's not scared

00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:50.331
I think we should take it out, well when we first trapped her

00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:52.351
 she was very wild and scared

00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:55.151
so we put that box in there so she could get some security

00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:00.791
and now she's very in love with this toy

00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:01.791
rattles

00:02:04.732 --> 00:02:05.732
she loves to play with this toy

00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:06.971
this is a very small baby kitten feral cat

00:02:09.372 --> 00:02:10.372
but it's no longer feral (wild)

00:02:13.352 --> 00:02:14.352
rattling, she's gonna have fun with this string toy

00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:20.711

00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:24.751

00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:28.951
hold on get this box out of here we don't need it 

00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:33.972
well give me the Dr Pepper box, just put this in the garbage

00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:39.071

00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:44.291

00:02:48.932 --> 00:02:49.932

00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:51.792

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:04.391
and there is a couple of other characters but I named her after Kirstie

00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:08.291
because she's a lot like Kirstie she's got sassy attitude

00:03:15.478 --> 00:03:16.478

00:04:16.112 --> 00:04:17.112
