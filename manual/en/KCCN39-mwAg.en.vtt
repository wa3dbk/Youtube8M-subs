00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.700
A love for animals and a passion for writing
led Ole Miss professor Ben McClelland to Wildrose

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.990
Kennels located in Oxford, Mississippi.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.490
There he learned just how powerful a canine's
nose can be in helping to alert Type 1 diabetics

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.430
of potential life-threatening chemical changes.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:30.290
When I first came here I didn't even know
the real particularities of how a dog alerted

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.210
a diabetic and exactly what the interaction
and function was in helping the medical health

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.960
of the client.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.320
We import them from the United Kingdom because
of three reasons.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.280
One, they have a very calm temperament.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.579
Two, we like their size.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.270
They're smaller than American Labradors.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.239
And three, they have natural game finding
abilities which means they have superb noses.

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.190
They can smell the chemical change that's
taking place in a diabetic's body before the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.530
meter tells them.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.920
Working with owners Mike and Cathy Stewart,
McClelland set out to write a book about some

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.740
of the 40 dogs that have been trained at Wildrose.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.740
He allowed clients like Sharon Stinson to
write their experiences about how the dogs

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.020
have changed their lives.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.049
Just the piece of mind that my family has
and that I have especially at nighttime when

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.360
my blood sugar drops and I can't feel it.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.860
And I can't really feel my highs and lows
anymore.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.020
And without her and she's ahead of my meter
a lot of times letting me know, I would not

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.020
be here.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.020
I would not be alive today.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.850
My role has been a modest role of simply trying
to spread the word, trying to collect the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:45.409
stories of these folks and able them to tell
the real life family story of what it's like

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.849
to work with a diabetic alert dog and how
it is that a type 1 diabetic's life can be

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:57.139
so improved dramatically with the use of a
dog.

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:01.899
The diabetic alert dog program is a not-for-profit
entity at Wildrose.

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.549
McClelland and the authors are donating all
book royalties to the Wildrose Service Dog

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.700
Foundation housed at CREATE, Tupelo, MS.
