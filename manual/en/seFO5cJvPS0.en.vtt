Hi. This is Julie and welcome back to
Beadaholique.com's video series Just Bead It

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.950
Quick and Easy jewelry. This is our
second installment and in it we are going to

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.890
explore all the really cool jewelry you
can make by just gluing two or more

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.549
objects together.

00:00:20.549 --> 00:00:23.499
For all these projects we're gonna be
using E6000 which is

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:27.459
industrial strength adhesive. This is
my favorite glue. It produces a very

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:30.169
permanent waterproof bond.

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.789
When working with E6000 make sure
you have a well ventilated room. It does

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.670
has quite a strong odor. Try not to get
it on your fingers as it is difficult

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.890
to get off.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.100
Wipe away any excess glue before
dries if it spills over onto your piece

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.020
at all.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.030
This just a couple quick tips for
using this glue. It's a great glue. You're going to

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.810
absolutely love it.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.740
In terms of drying time I'd like to let
it dry overnight. The manufacture

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.120
recommends that you wake up to 72
hours for maximum bond to form.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.700
Great stuff though we use it for each and
every one of these projects.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.960
To begin I want to show you an overview of
some projects you can make by using

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.200
glue and by gluing two or more objects
together.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.990
Here we have layered pieces of metal
filigree that we've then accented by just

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.760
gluing on some flatbacks rhinestones
and gluing all that to a metal

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.960
bobby pin.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.200
You can see there's a whole bunch of different
styles you can do.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.940
I also have a magnet here. This is just
a piece of stamped brass.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.950
We actually went ahead and accented with
guilders paste. That's a extra step but you don't

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.130
have to do it. This will look lovely

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.980
just in the brass form.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.110
I have a whole host of rings over here.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.480
Some of these started as buttons and we
removed the shank

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.310
but other says started as cabochons

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.800
and we just glued it onto a ring finding.
Here we have another one where we've taken a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.140
floral cabochon and glued it onto a piece of
metal filigree

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.010
and then glued it onto a ring finding.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.560
I have a pair of earrings over here that started
as buttons and we just removed that shank,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.430
and glued it on a earring back.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.900
I just have a couple other earrings
here that were very simply done just

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.649
by gluing a decorative cabochon onto a
finding.

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.789
So here's the finished pieces. Now
I want to show you what they looked like to

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:07.970
begin with.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.170
So here's the breakdown of what a lot of
those projects looked like.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.330
These are not the exact ingredients. It's an overview on
how they start. So let's get started with the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.329
base finding which is going to be metal
stamping blank, perhaps a bezel,

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.719
a pin back, an aanraku bail and a bobby pin with a
glue on tab.

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.069
Maybe a ring finding that has a glue on
surface.

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.599
Even you can use domino tiles,
bottle caps and scrabble tiles. Anything

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.189
that you can glue on that has a nice
flat surface.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.179
So then what you'll need is a focal
point which is going to be a cabochon

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:43.559
usually. It doesn't have to be used. It's just
the easiest way and a cabochon is

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:48.519
gonna be a nice decorative object that
has a flat glue on back and has no hole

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.799
in it. So unlike a bead of course it
which is going to have a hole through it.

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.259
These don't have a hole and there's perfect for
gluing. That's actually what they're

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:56.649
meant for.

00:02:56.649 --> 00:03:00.259
What you can do is you can glue them on
as they are. So if you wanted to just

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:01.979
glue this on

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.029
to a metal stamping you can do that.

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:09.229
Or you can actually mount it onto
another finding

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:13.049
and then glue it on. So you have a bunch of
different choices.

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.910
I want to show you how to make a ring super
quickly here so that you can get the idea

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.999
of how easy it really is.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.439
So I just got a scrap piece of wire

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:27.339
and I've got some E6000 glue.

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:30.129
I'm just going to take a dab.

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.009
of the glue.

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:38.279
Place it on the tip of the wire.

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:39.309
Take one of my

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:40.999
cabochon

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:44.040
and put that glue on the back of
it.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.779
Spread it out a little bit

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:55.279
Then I'm going to put this into a ring
finding.

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:57.089
Just like that

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:58.799
I have an instant ring.

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.510
So that is all there is to it

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.429
to making a great piece of jewelry using
glue, a finding

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:06.699
and a pretty decorative object such as a
cabochon.
