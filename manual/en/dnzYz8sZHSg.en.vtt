00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.970
Okay, so what we're doing is we are checking
our oil in our vehicle, and this is really

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.249
important. Oil, has been explained to me a
few times, the lifeblood of your car and you

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:21.380
obviously don't want that to go bad. How often
do you want to change your oil is a good question.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.660
Generally most people say by 3,000 miles or
3 months, your oil sitting in your car, so

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.170
that's a pretty good estimate, I mean, it
kind of depends on your car, it depends on

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.110
the oil. But you definitely want to get your
oil changed, you want to make sure you're

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.969
changing it because it's really, really important.
So what we're going to do right now is check

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.190
our oil, which is pretty straight forward.
Generally, most cars you'll find a dipstick

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.520
with, for example, this one has a little oil
graphic on it. So what you're going to want

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:04.059
to do is, you just pull this out, go ahead
and wipe off the oil that's on there right

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.850
now because the oil might have jumped up and
down or it might have rubbed up against something,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:17.750
just to get a clean read. So wipe it off first,
you put it back in, make sure it goes all

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.630
the way back in, and then pull it right back
out, and there should be a level on there.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.140
For example, this one looks a little low,
there's a little place marker on this one

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.250
that says "add" and "safe", so "safe" is going
to be, obviously you're going to be good on

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.150
your oil. If it's below the "add" line, then
obviously you want to go ahead and add some

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.479
oil. But for our purposes, we're going to
go ahead and change the oil. So that's just

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.420
a good way to, you want to monitor this every
once in a while, just to make sure that you've

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.490
got enough oil in there, because if you have
too little oil, that could really damage your

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.930
car. So, that's checking your oil, and next
we're going to go into actually changing the

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.949
oil.
