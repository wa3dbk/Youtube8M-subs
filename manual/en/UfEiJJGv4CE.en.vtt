DR JAMES GRIME: So today, I want
to tell you that almost

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.980
all integers contain
the digit 3.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.990
So the integers are
the whole numbers.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.990
So I'm saying that almost
all whole numbers

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.240
contain the digit 3.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.960
It sounds strange, doesn't it?

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.430
Yeah, because I can think of
infinitely many numbers that

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.750
contain a 3.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.850
I've got 3, 33, 333,
3,333, and so on.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.960
I can think of infinitely
many numbers that

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.579
don't contain a 3.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:40.640
7, 77, 777, and 7,777,
and so on.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.700
So how can almost all integers
contain the digit 3?

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.080
So 23 contains the digit 3.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.730
310 contains the digit 3.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.770
9,002,023.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.760
So what about the numbers
less than 10?

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.120
How many numbers less than
10 contain the digit 3?

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.959
It's just 3, isn't it?

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:05.890
Yeah, it's just one of them.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.500
Right.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.940
So one of those, just
the number 3 itself.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.780
So what's the proportion
of numbers?

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.360
Well, it's one out of ten.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.820
So it's 1/10.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.350
It's 0.1.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.510
It's 10%.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.390
What's the next size up?

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.920
Let's look at numbers
less than 100.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.730
We've got 3.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:31.310
We've got 13, 23, 43,
53, 63, 73, 83, 93.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.290
You may have noticed I skipped
off the 30s there.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.730
So we've got 30, 31,
32, 33, 34, 35--

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.151
so I reckon we've got 19.

00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:42.434
19 out of 100, that's 0.19.

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:45.170
It's 19% is what I'm saying.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.150
So the percentage has gone up.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.940
Let's try numbers
less than 1,000.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.970
Well, we've got the 19 we
said already, right?

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.330
But we've got all those
numbers again,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.680
but with a 1 in front.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.320
Like it's 103 and 113 and then
we get 200 and something.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.440
We get 400 and something,
500, 600, 700, 800, 900.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.090
And then we can include
all the 300s,

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.820
which I skipped there.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.160
So just the 300, 301,
302, 303, right?

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.050
So it's 271.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.490
What's the percentage?

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.226
It's about 0.271--

00:02:18.226 --> 00:02:19.170
27%.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.660
It's going up.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.990
Now, did you notice the
trick that we used

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.740
for that last one?

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.260
I said, think of all the numbers
with a 1 in the front.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.800
It was the same copy but with a
1 in the front, with a 2 in

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.790
the front, and then it
was all the 300s.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.040
You can do this in general.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.870
The numbers containing a digit
3-- let's call that T for 3.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.000
Let's call these 10.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.120
Less than 10 to the power n.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.420
So these are the numbers
containing a digit 3, less

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.070
than 10 to the power n.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.580
If you want to find
the next one-- and

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.990
that's going to be 10,000.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.680
You take the last of your
previous number, times it by

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.090
9, and add on 10
to the power n.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.350
And you can find the
next number.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.050
You can do that.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.450
So that would be the next
one we're looking for.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.665
So there's a little
formula there.

00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:10.540
So let's do it.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.300
All right then, I'm going
to use my calculator.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:19.700
So 9 times 271, plus 1,000.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.210
And I get that number, 3,439.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.750
What's the proportion?

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.320
It's about 0.3439.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.800
It's going up all the time--
about 34% now.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.300
It's going up all the time.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.190
In fact, there's a nice way to
work out how many numbers

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.270
there're going to be with a 3.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.000
Imagine if I was allowed to
write my numbers like this,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.290
with zeroes.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.630
So that would be a zero, but
with all these zeroes there.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.120
This is a four-digit number.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.900
So here's another one, and
here's another one.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.976
How many four-digit
numbers are there?

00:03:57.976 --> 00:03:59.860
It's actually 10
to the power 4.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.000
10 choices there, 10 choices
there, 10 choices, 10 choices.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.610
How many of them
don't have a 3?

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.960
Well, if I'm not allowed to use
3, then I only have nine

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.060
choices for that place, nine
choices for that place, nine

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.870
choices for that place, nine
choices for that place.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.959
So that would be 9
to the power 4.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.670
If you want to find out how many
integers that contain the

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:33.935
digit 3, it is 10 to the power
n, minus 9 to the power n.

00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:38.840
See, these are all my n-digit
numbers minus the ones that

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.140
don't contain a 3.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.760
The proportion, then, is going
to be this thing divided by

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.950
this thing--

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.900
just 10 to the n.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.150
So it's this.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.650
And what is that proportion?

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.930
10 to the n divided by 10 to the
n is 1, minus 9 to the n

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.050
divided by 10 to the n.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.570
Here's another way
to write that--

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.350
9/10 to the n.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.480
That's the proportion that
contain a digit 3.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.930
And just what happens?

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.550
Well, as this gets really,
really big, this fraction gets

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.830
smaller and smaller
and smaller.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.780
And it will go to 1.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.230
That will disappear.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.440
It will barely be worth
mentioning.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.840
And that is 1.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.830
So it goes to 1--

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.500
we say, as n gets big.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.940
So this is getting closer
and closer to 1 minus 0.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.710
As that gets closer to 0, as it
gets big, this gets closer

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.100
and closer to 1 minus 0.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.400
So the whole thing is
going towards 100%.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.700
100% of numbers contain
the digit 3.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.680
And this is the proper technical
definition of when I

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.690
said almost all numbers
contain the digit 3.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.610
"Almost all" sounds like a
wishy-washy vague expression.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.450
But in mathematics, it
has a proper meaning.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.300
It means that the proportion
is going toward 100% as you

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.565
get more and more numbers.

00:06:13.565 --> 00:06:16.700
BRADY HALAN: Would it be equally
true to say almost all

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.345
numbers contain the number 5?

00:06:18.345 --> 00:06:20.710
DR JAMES GRIME: That would
be equally true.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.870
And you can do the exact same
thing to say almost all

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.120
numbers contain a 5.
