00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.629
the steps of constructed by go to the online
meetings made easy enough refried doesn't

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:12.629
mean that conflict on the five we've gotten
and answered comeuppance

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:18.339
what caught up in the that is a fascinating
character it did a poll that on the south

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:19.630
he's the one

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.580
but wait until the book than they did in nationwide
poll n_b_c_

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.019
news wall street journal poll

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.500
one all across the nation for obviously uh...
republican voters that they're just testing

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.280
the waters right now it's not the actual primaries

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.079
but it's so that they could have one twenty
five percent you want these

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.050
day so hot and it's a lot of surprising momentum

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.670
now uh... i don't know one of the ways he
built that moment in is my doing met nonsense

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.770
like this

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.130
this is the most program

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.510
of course conservative radio

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.830
and this entire about the birth certificate
issue and i'll listen to what mike huckabee

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.780
says

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.010
about or bottle being raised and spent let's
listen

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.560
indicate the barge

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.000
maximum with artillery and virtual agrarian
talked with the british but then if you think

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.250
about it

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.830
his perspective as

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.640
growing up continue with the canyon potter
in grandfather

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.140
uh... they argue would amount to a revolution
in kenya is very different than ours because

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.690
i think probably grew up hearing that the
british were a bunch of imperial is to uh...

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.060
persecuted grandfather i_q_ despises the west
he despises the prints and i think he could

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.510
take it all out on israel that's like this

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.710
that you saw there that that's not the case
that that uh... obama was recently and becky

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.040
said wants

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.440
uh...

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.150
of course i was not recent that way so the
question of

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.790
is going to be doing this on purpose i_t_c_
trying to paint

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.160
plaza four and stand up when i don't want
any more about that born resent any as he

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.340
sat there

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.850
uh... or just about bobby came and said no
come on is ridiculous

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.770
obviously i just looked up

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.610
uh... i meant that he was raised in indonesia

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.619
budget baffled by what they spent several
years in indonesia where he was younger

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.329
overall he was reasonable i ate

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.310
but you know they thank you for your kenya
indonesia where there is a mate

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.839
and it sounds a little scarier

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.390
uh... to our base

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.739
so let's go with that

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.400
well capable of the state you slipped up on
it

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.500
you know i

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.489
side that

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.429
big a deal that if he's got others it's a
much bigger deal

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:25.120
it's this is an attempt to smear

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.610
it he just looked up okay

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.430
so what we're gonna kill ugly get concerned
that this uh...

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.290
uh... how to be when i heard on the program
to clarify it

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.069
it is the

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.420
brian fisher radio show of course of the conservative
that got a lot of these

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.319
and that's because this will make it very
clear

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.680
and uh... it's really an indication of just
output doubt it

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.379
uh... some of these folks are a bit point-of-view
journalist and reporters

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.790
and have failed to do it atkinson choc not
admitted that i misspoke on that but i corrected

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.509
it

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:57.469
but if i had never gotten

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.619
is taken the position of obama

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:04.159
uh... was born in kenya are indonesia are
getting where other than for white britain

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.859
claims to pinpoint frankly bond that's not
a popular privileged with interprets unique

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.639
position aren't consistent bacon

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:17.539
and i just in perry amazed at uh... the firestorm
this has caused specially will deny the fact

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:21.259
that they pick the talk show host himself
and said there's nothing to exploit governor

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:24.929
weld got lost in all this awful as it is the
legitimate points that you were making is

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:28.870
that we may have a president who has some
fundamentally

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.999
campsite american radios

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:37.029
that may be rooted in a childhood where we
had a father who was very lovely anti colonial

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:41.209
hated the british might have something to
do with the president returning the bust of

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.400
winston churchill

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.870
aback edta in blood you know i was struck
by the fact when he made his steward indonesia

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.349
he made a point of going to an indonesian
memorial

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:56.529
that celebrated for the victory of indonesians
over british troops again part of an anti

00:03:56.529 --> 00:04:00.579
colonial thing and so uh... i'd like to comment
on that if you think i mean

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.319
you seem to think there's some validity the
fact that there may be some fundamental anti-americanism

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.919
in as president

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:11.339
well and that's exactly the point that i make
in the book and i don't know why these reporters

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:16.149
maybe they can three cash that's part of it
because pathak it's clearly spelled out and

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:18.639
i'm quoting a british newspaper

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.859
crew really were expressing the outrage at
the press

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.960
where that box being returned and the point
was that they felt like to do to uh... obon

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.729
those uh... father and grandfather it could
be that his version of uh... and and to you

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.560
about the mammal revolution was very different

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.849
and most of the people who perhaps will grow
up in the united states

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.099
and i've said many times publicly

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.539
that i don't think he has a different world
view

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:48.580
and i think it's in part molded out of uh...
of very different experience most of the script

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.310
wonderful way scout meetings that i do know
our communities were filled with rotary clubs

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.159
not matrox is i think that made it back hello
worker okay

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:04.880
saying most of us style were brought up inquiries
of course that some rotary clubs

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.319
not mud roster

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.820
pocketbook at any doubt

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.939
that part of the withstand that

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:15.740
drive a car bomb is a former employees have
no doubt law but now

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.849
because he says he's indy america and

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.070
his father was canyon abroad about what these
basically

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.699
and he western uh... velocity brittany claudio
etcetera

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.630
and you know he didn't grow up like a little
rotary club unless they have to grow up with

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.680
mcgraw says

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.249
month or not

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.740
those are muslim fundamentalists closing teach

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.270
you have in of the koran etcetera

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.969
obama ever want to open roster

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.989
defeating drove around the process wasn't
talking about

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:47.779
so i thought it out before i i guess i was
to travel to my thoughts maybe just looked

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:53.869
up no is entirely sleek an attempt by i thought
to be are purpose to label president bomb

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:55.330
is a former norm

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.340
you know being the most love and not like
you guys

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.710
something i don't like the good white folks
of america problem was that some other clubs

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.490
about these former brussels did that are dangerous

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.939
now i think this statement

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:12.479
is actually much worse than him say that he
was raised in kenya incorrectly

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:13.979
nevada surveys also

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:15.150
million percent incorrect

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.089
and much more of a smear

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:20.979
since it's been in new york it really sucks
because we have to have all these meetings

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:23.889
to pick out what kind of clips that we want
for you to know

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:27.999
