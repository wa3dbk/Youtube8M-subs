00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.510
Tasting a blueberry - it's a surprise, it's
all

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.350
kept together in one little bite and then you put in your mouth and it like kinda explodes.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.490
They're tart, they're sweet. There's a really nice balance to them.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.570
I love that they're so easy to prepare.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.560
You don't have to cut it or prep it. There's a wow factor, and

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.539
you didn't do much!  They are a perfect example of how a little change

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.959
can make a really big difference.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.010
We are here at The Gourmandise School

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.160
about to do a Blueberry Throwdown, there
are two

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.260
pastry chefs, two chefs that are doing
savory foods, all involving

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.329
blueberries, and we're going to make our dishes

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:38.949
and see what the judges think.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.500
I'm Ali Sweeney and I'm here with Chef Josie. We're doing a savory dish with blueberries

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.940
which I'm really excited about, it's like short ribs with a blueberry BBQ sauce

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.379
She actually was afraid to cook short ribs and I was going to  show how easy they are

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.579
cause it's almost like a crockpot thing you can walk away from too.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.180
Yeah, and so I'm learning how to make a Blueberry BBQ Sauce. Like, it's going to be awesome.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.870
It's interesting that you use frozen blueberries and fresh.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.670
You know, the frozen, to me, have a lot of flavor

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.310
I like that.  Yeah you're right.  I like to start
with a little bit

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.700
of vinegar first, a cup of the dark brown sugar

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.990
about a quarter cup of soy, honey,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.140
and it's going to cook in the oven for about two and a half to three hours.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.400
I think it's going to be amazing.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.520
Well I've been watching our neighbor Josie here play with some delicious-looking red meat

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.509
so I'm feeling not only envious but also excited.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.520
I'm Chrystal, Chrystal Baker, my blog is The Duo Dishes

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.179
and I am here today helping Valerie of Valerie Confections. What I'm making today

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.179
is a slightly intricate and a very casual
version of a Blueberry

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.009
Earl Grey Cake with lemon frosting, and a lemon glaze.

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.759
I think that blueberry with lemon is sort of a more exciting thing

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.599
you actually get more of the nuances of the fruit

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.000
same thing when you pair blueberries with Earl Grey.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.739
So I'm pairing it with bold things, to create this dessert.  Similar to like a pound cake, so there's nothing too crazy,

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:03.700
nothing you can't find in like a regular grocery store which I think is really important

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.039
I'm actually a home baker that turned that
idea and that commitment into a

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.839
company, so pretty much everything I do I
always feel that it's something that someone can do at home.

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.900
It's like a house of cards, and as long as you have your base, nice and strong

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.569
you can just keep going up.  We're making
meringues with ice cream.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.589
Wait, should I be telling the other team what's happening?  I think so, does it matter?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.239
Hi.  Hi, Roxana.  This is my friend Lynn.

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.049
We met online.  That's right.  Apparently my friend Lynn

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.290
has never made meringue before. Never. So we're gonna make a blueberry meringue

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.950
and then we're gonna throw in a good amount of beautiful dried blueberries

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.940
that are kind of like my new favorite ingredient.  And then we're going to prepare blueberry ice cream

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.799
and blueberry compote.   If you wanted to make a more user-friendly version you would just take

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.260
a meringue, and you would top it with some whipped cream

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.860
and some fresh blueberries, and it's also lower in calories.  Yes.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.980
But I will make you make meringue.  Still got to make meringue.  Yes, exactly.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.740
Oh My God!  You're thwacking it.  Okay.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.250
Oh look at this.  Yeah.  A little sweetness, a little tart.  You gotta try this.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.220
This is good.  Yeah, that's good.  I wonder if you could use this on a savory dish?

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.600
I'm Daniel Mattern with Stacey Sun, food blogger extraordinaire.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.230
And we are having fun with blueberry, so we're making some

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.510
buffalo meatballs with sweet
and sour blueberry sauce.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.140
For the blueberry sauce we use a couple
different kinds - the natural dried

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.600
and the sun-dried, and those were mixed with a little

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.620
champagne vinegar, sugar, star anise and

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.010
cinnamon stick, with a little Earl Grey tea.  Spoon that over these meatballs.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.030
That sounds good.  And they sit inside a little phyllo

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.090
nest, as it were.  This looks really good.  I'm going to see if I can Instagram this.

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.749
So everyone the moment we've all been
waiting for.  Whenever I'm cooking

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:01.900
I feel like there's always something missing

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.340
and I feel that through today I've really learned that

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.790
blueberries could be that great solve for that thing that's missing.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.030
i think there's a lot of things that I'm going to incorporate in my cooking

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.810
Josie's Blueberry Barbecue sauce was not only delicious but

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.009
versatile, I mean she made it with short ribs but why couldn't you make it with turkey?

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.169
and I just made that up just now, like that's the point is that you could try

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.370
anything.  So the judges have spoken, it's the blueberry short ribs

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.970
and Chef Roxana.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.170
Blueberries, it's that component that brings it together, it's that missing piece.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.880
And so that's what I'ver really learned today and I'll definitely take that learning home, and I'll have a

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.680
carton of blueberries in my fridge every week.
