00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.750
Use the associative law of
addition to write the

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.800
expression.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.700
We have a 77 plus 2 in
parentheses, plus 3, in a

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.680
different way.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.860
Simplify both expressions
to show they

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.710
have identical results.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.230
So this associative law of
addition, which sounds very

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.460
fancy and complicated, literally
means that you can

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.670
associate these three numbers
in different ways or you can

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.500
add them in different orders.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.760
Now let me just make
that clear.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.920
So the way they wrote it right
here, they wrote it 77 plus 2

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.090
in parentheses, and then
they wrote plus 3.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.530
These parentheses mean
do the 77 plus 2

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.980
before you add the 3.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.280
So if you were to evaluate
this, you would evaluate

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.930
what's in the parentheses first.
So you would say, well,

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.550
77 plus 2, that's 79, so
everything in the parentheses

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.730
just evaluates to 79.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.050
And then you still
have that plus 3.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.430
And 79 plus 3 is 82, so
this is equal to 82.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.690
That's if you just evaluate
it the way that

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.570
they gave it to us.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.190
Now, the associative law of
addition tells us it doesn't

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.080
matter whether we add 77 and 2
first or whether we add 2 and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.860
3 first. We can associate
them differently.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.590
So this is going to be
the exact same thing.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.250
This is the exact same
thing as-- we could

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.610
write it this way.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.520
Let me write them all.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.765
77 plus 2 plus 3.

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:26.090
If we have no parentheses here,
this is actually the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.750
same thing as this over here,
because we'd go 77 plus 2 is

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.430
79 plus 3 is 82.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.510
But the associative law tells
as, well, you know what?

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.380
I could do 77 plus 2 plus 3.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.430
I could add this first and then
add it to 77, and it's

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.970
going to be the exact same thing
as if I added these two

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.790
guys first and then add the 3.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.710
Let's verify that
for ourselves.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:56.240
So 2 plus 3 is 5, so this
evaluates to 77 plus 5.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.130
And 77 plus 5, once
again, is 82.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.840
So it doesn't matter how you
associate the numbers.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.570
Either way, you get 82.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.729
And that's the associative
law of addition.
