00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.520
Three themes this week, bird attacks, summer
fishing and rabbit gutting.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.211
They are all on hunting YouTube which aims
to show the best hunting, shooting and fishing

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:08.990
videos which YouTube has to offer.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.809
Thanks to everyone who sent in their favourite
films.

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.670
We have 3 films the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds don't want you to see.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.369
The first has been doing the rounds on Facebook
pages this week.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.390
It shows an osprey chick snatched from a nest
by a buzzard as the mother bird leaves her

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.419
nest at Lochter Oldmeldrum.

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.779
The buzzard sweeps in and grabs one of the
chicks.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.270
This film comes shortly after the government's
U turn on the possibility of a proposal of

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.850
potential future control on buzzards by picking
eggs, probably.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.920
British buzzards spend a lot of time eating
pheasant poults and along with badgers ensuring

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.260
the annihilation of most ground nesting birds.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.440
None of which bothers the RSPB which is of
course staffed entirely by politically active

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.440
buzzards.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.820
This one reminds me of oldie a bit of goldie
again showing that not all wildlife dies cuddly

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.480
in its bed surrounded by its grandchildren
as the RSPB would have you believe.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.710
Sea gull takes baby goose shows exactly that.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.189
Mark, game for everything also known as our
own Mark Gilchrist , or strictly speaking

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.840
his own Mark Gilchrist would of course have
liked to put up a video of bird on bird action,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.439
but instead we get him versus crows.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.010
It is a summer morning in Kent.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.770
God is in his heaven and Mark is shooting
straight.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.770
Now we turn to angling.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.139
And if you ever wonder why any one bothers
going to Scotland for salmon fishing, look

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:20.560
on YouTube for the videos.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.560
There aren't any.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.679
Well there are a few, but they are far between
which is why it is a pleasure to see Joch

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.539
Montyth's River Takes Salmon Fishing Guide.

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.729
Filmed with a handicam in a high wind, it
simply shows an Australian playing a Tay Salmon

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.021
in the ash trees in the ....As the commentary
says he has come from Greenland and you have

00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:37.469
come from Australia and you meet here.

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:38.639
Crazy isn't it.

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:41.429
At the other end of the fishing filming scale
is Hugh Miles.

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.409
We featured Hugh on Fieldsports Britain before.

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.030
He is among the finest wildlife cameramen
alive and his passion is angling.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.020
So much so that he made the two extraordinary
TV series A Passion for Angling and Catching

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.020
the Impossible.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.679
He has a YouTube channel and here is his latest
which is on the Avon roach project.

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:59.679
Speaks for itself.

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.999
Now there is a land grab going on on YouTube,
but it is for the prime subject videos.

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:08.080
If you put up the first film called how to
gut a rabbit it will always show up in search

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.560
results for that however bad it is and this
week we have been sent 3 versions of that

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.760
very subject by viewers who enjoyed them.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.220
First up is Country Pursuits TV and the world's
fastest rabbit gutting technique?

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.620
It is good, but strangely it must have been
filmed during a partial eclipse of the sun.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.540
Country Pursuits acknowledges he got the idea
from Fieldsports 1, so here is that video

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.280
which is also well put together and clear
though he bangs on a bit.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.490
Still so do I.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.280
Finally, here is one from the land of the
rabbit proof fence.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.040
He is the feral Tucker fellow which is impossible
to say properly without an Australian accent.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.040
So please forgive me.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.570
Good news for Brits, he is coming to the UK
for a year and for any .... out there isn't

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.390
he exactly the kind of foreigner we should
be welcoming.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.270
You can click on any of these films to watch
them.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.830
