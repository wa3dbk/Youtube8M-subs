Hi, I'm Dave Andrews. Today I'm going to show
you how to partition a laptop hard drive.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:15.410
Let's go to the computer, which I'm using
my laptop here, and on our desktop, let's

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.280
just right click on "computer". If you don't
have the "computer" icon on your desktop,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.540
it's under your start menu; you can right
click on it there as well. Just right click

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.780
on "computer", click on "manage". Now, you
have to be an administrator for this, and

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.930
it's going ask you for your permission to
run the management; just say continue. Now,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.490
what we're interested in looking at in the
computer management window is under "storage

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:52.870
disk management". Just click on "disk management".
As you can see, that's showing me all of the

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.700
available disk that I have on my computer.
I have a "C" drive, a "D" drive, and an "F"

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.260
drive. My "C" drive is the laptop hard drive,
and I happen to have twenty gigabytes, or

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.189
so, of unallocated space on my "C" drive.
If your laptop hard drive is already full,

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.520
you're going to have to right click on your
"C" and run a shrink volume, but we're not

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.389
going to do that. We're just going to be partitioning
this twenty gigabytes that I have available.

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:27.939
To partition it, right click on it, and say
"new simple volume". It's going to bring up

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.020
your new simple volume wizard. It's going
to ask you how much space you want available,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.389
and I want to use all twenty gigabytes, so
that's twenty thousand mb's, or megabytes.

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:44.649
It's then going to ask you what drive letter
you want to give it; I'm going to call it

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.450
drive "P", and say ok. It's going to ask you
then what options you want to do when you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.959
format. The file system, it's important to
use NTFS because that is Microsoft's newest

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:03.549
version of their file system, but if you want
to access this from a Macintosh or a Linux,

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.560
you have to use FAT32. Let's give it a label
as well, I'm just going to call it data. If

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.410
you check perform a quick format, it will
format faster, but it won't check the drive

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.489
for problems. I don't want to that. For this
demonstration, I'll have it do a quick format,

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.650
but typically you want it to check the drive
for problems. It's going to tell you that

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.500
you are finishing, so just click finish. As
you can see, my twenty gigs is now blue, and

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:39.769
it is formatting. When it's done formatting,
it's going to appear as a "P" drive under

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:48.959
"My Computer". My name is Dave Andrews and
I just showed you how to format your laptop

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:49.459
hard drive.
