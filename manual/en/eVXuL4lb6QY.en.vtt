00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.990
hello and welcome to another episode
of Five Minutes with Franza.  I'm your host

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.119
Doctor Thomas Franza in this episode I'm
going to show you how to configure your microphone

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.500
I am just using a cheesy microphone but you
want to use one

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.689
you know

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:23.000
they are lying around everywhere easy to get in
Windows XP click on Start control panel

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.320
your control panels is going to open up if

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.630
you are in a different view this is
just

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.500
good old fashion if you want classic view that will work too let's just stick with the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.570
way it will probably look for you

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.739
you click on sounds speech in audio
devices

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.040
and you can click on sound in audio
devices

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.420
the secret is that in the old microphones there
is something called

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.580
boost that you see set up and if you don't
when you try to record with your microphone you don't

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.210
get anything

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.600
we click on the voice tab now there's
two ways to do it

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.079
we can say test hardware and we can run
through that

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.500
or if you just wanna take the lazy way
out click on

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.500
volume see for Voice recording let's stop for a

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.170
second see it says sound if I had multiple
devices I be able to choose them

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.490
but this is a simple computer and all I have is a
simple microphone

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.180
I click volume if it looks like this

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.479
right my microphone a selected I go to
options I choose

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.450
advanced controls I click on the
Advanced button and here's the secret if

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.930
this is

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.000
unchecked my microphone is not going to have
the power it needs

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.580
and its going to sound faint at best so you check
that off

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.540
then you would say close you close
that

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.520
you say okay and that's all there is to
it and now your microphone is configured

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.610
if you wanted to test it one of the
simple ways to do it

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.939
is from the start menu you can go to all
programs

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.720
accessories and in entertainment you have
the sound recorder

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.720
sound recorder is a cute little program and
you can say

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.990
record and when you start talking hopefully
you will see these little lines pop up and appear

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.170
hit stop don't worry about the not enough
memory

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.810
and then you hit playback and you'll
hear your voice

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.239
okay if you don't hear it and that's
another possibility

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.190
no we don't want change that change that
and that's all there is to it

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.760
and now you have your microphone
configured in Windows XP

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.829
if you have multiple devices again on that
tab you may see

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.930
other choices you may see other choices
listed

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.380
over here for voice recording

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.810
but that's it and with this you can now
use it in voice over

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.830
PowerPoint or or anything else Skype

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.129
what have you but you don't need
expensive fancy hardware

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.480
again sounds a little bit less exciting
I'm using

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.900
a really cheap microphone and I'm not using a new
computer this is a relatively old computer

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.140
so that's it that's all you have to do
it so if you want to

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.190
add voice to something that you are working on
adding a microphone is as

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.060
easy as that again just under volume you
have advanced controls

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.340
here's the secret your microphone boost
needs to be adjusted

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.890
once that's done you're done you don't usually
have this problem with USB based

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:10.840
microphones

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.620
but if you're using older equipment like I am
this is how you do it well

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.730
that's it for this episode hope you
found it useful

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.459
once again thank you for watching Five
Minutes with Franza.  I'm your host

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:23.459
Doctor Thomas Franza.
