00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:07.945
Stay in your places.

00:00:19.459 --> 00:00:20.721
Get back to your room.

00:00:20.793 --> 00:00:22.192
(boy #1)
ls he here? ls he here?

00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:23.592
(boy #2) l can't see anything.

00:00:23.663 --> 00:00:25.153
That's him.
Cry-Baby Walker.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.191

Mrs. Vernon-Williams.

00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:05.368

00:01:07.406 --> 00:01:09.375
'Cause, uh,
l'm gonna sing tonight

00:01:09.443 --> 00:01:11.377
and l thought
she might like to hear me.

00:01:13.714 --> 00:01:15.045
Mind your manners.

00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:16.980
This is what we think
of your kind of music.

00:01:18.986 --> 00:01:22.786
How dare you hit him!
You don't own me, Baldwin.

00:01:22.856 --> 00:01:24.983
l have the right
to hear Cry-Baby sing.

00:01:25.392 --> 00:01:27.553
Don't get all worked up, honey.

00:01:27.694 --> 00:01:29.719
The punk got what he deserved.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.459
Come on.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.894
Allison.

00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:40.405
Get up. Go! Go! Go!

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:43.269
Hop on, honey.

00:01:43.343 --> 00:01:44.867
Just one minute,
young lady--

00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:47.778
l'll take good care of her,
Mrs. Vernon-Williams.
l promise.

00:01:47.848 --> 00:01:49.577
And it's okay about my face.

00:01:49.716 --> 00:01:51.479
lt don't hurt much.

00:01:51.852 --> 00:01:53.217
Please.

00:01:53.287 --> 00:01:56.085
lt's not a school night,
and l have been a good girl.

00:01:56.256 --> 00:01:59.123
Just one night of happiness,
that's all l ask.

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.986
But what if you
get your dress dirty?

00:02:03.263 --> 00:02:05.163
[sighs] Thank you, Grandmother.
