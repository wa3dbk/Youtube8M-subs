00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.280
however if i need to say that...

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.480
we will prepare "Cream Chocolate" with the difference of mütevazý Lezzetler

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.200
ofcourse firstly the ingredients list

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.880
1 liter of milk

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.520
1 cup granulated sugar

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.600
1 small package of chocolate, about 40 grams

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.920
2 tablespoons of cocoa

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.200
1 tablespoon hazelnut cream with cocoa

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.200
2 tablespoons wheat starch

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.280
2 tablespoons of rice flour

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.320
and 1 package vanilla

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.520
as it can be seen the ingredients list is so short

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.840
it is also an easy cooking sweet

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.400
first of all we transfer the 1 liter of cold milk into the pan

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.760
1 cup granulated sugar

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.800
2 tablespoons of rice flour

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.920
2 tablespoons wheat starch

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.280
2 tablespoons of cocoa

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.560
we mix until the rice flour and the wheat starch are dissolved

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.080
now, we add 1 tablespoon hazelnut cream with cocoa

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.480
there are different ways of cooking "Cream Chocolate"

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600
today we prefered cooking by this method

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.520
we have such a chocolate drop it, anyhow it will melt during cooking
27 
00:02:02,280 --&gt; 00:02:05,200
we put the "Crem Chocolate" on the middle fire

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.200
i suggest you to use especially such a mixer

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.520
we baked by mixing continually until it reaches the consistency

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.240
how do we understand that the "Crem Chocolate" reached the consistency?

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.600
as you see there is honeycombed shapes

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.240
lastly, we also add 1 packet vanilla

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.760
we mix and turn off the fire

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.960
After taking from fire, we mix for a few minutes it...

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.640
to lose its steam

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.320
if you recognized, it is more slime than pudding

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.040
now we can transfer to the bowls

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.280
we fill the bowls

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.640
it tastes wonderful, a beautiful sweet

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.560
we will place it in the refrigerator, after it gets cold...

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.000
we will service by decorating on it with some materials

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.400
in this episode of the cuisine Mütevazý Lezzetler we prepared "Cream Chocolate"

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.120
as you see so practical, and elegant servicing recipe

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.360

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.720
