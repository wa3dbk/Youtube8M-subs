00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.440
[Jai] I just want to go out and round off
my career how it should be.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.000
On top.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.880
Two weeks to go and we're just trying to
qualify for the Paralympics...

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.020
and that was unheard of even a couple of years ago.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.980
[Narrator] The Wheel Blacks. 
Triumphant gold medal winners in wheelchair rugby

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.000
at the 2004 Paralympics in Athens.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.780
But the once mighty Wheel Blacks 
haven't even qualified for the 2012 Paralympics.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.120
They must achieve first or second place at
the upcoming Oceanic Regional Champs if they are to qualify.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.820
In the past we'd won a lot of games leading into it 
and you know, played a lot of tournaments.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.140
We just had faith that we'd do well.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.429
This time it's an unknown.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.420
[Barney] All of these guys have been playing for a lot of years.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.320
They like... I might have the speed, 
but they got the knowledge.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.180
That's why I respect them.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.160
- What up bro. Hey Jaisar.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.680
[Dan] Without a doubt,
 the last 10 years have been phenomenal. 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.920
You know, it's been action packed.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.300
[Jai] We're 12 hours away from 
a pretty important tournament for the Wheel Blacks.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.700
It's make or break.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:52.980
[Fast music]

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.900
I think for us, for the young guys in the team,
it's our time to step up 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.000
and to go from being the young guys 
to being a member of the squad.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.640
Pulling all the same weight as what everyone else is expected to.
