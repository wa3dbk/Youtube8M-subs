Hi This is Alia and welcome back to my kitchen!

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:14.186
If you have been watching be for a while, you properly know how much I love chocolate!

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.520
Today, I'm going to show you how to make the most chocolaty chocolate cookies ever!

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.320
These cookies are like a bites of heaven in your mouth. So let's start!

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.520
First chop the chocolate

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.360
I am using real dark chocolate, 60-70% cocoa, and it makes a difference in the cookies.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.080
You can also just use your favorite chocolate chips instead

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.820
In a large bowl, sift powdered sugar and cocoa

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.880
Add a pinch of salt, corn starch, and mix.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.000
Time for the egg whites!

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.260
Mix in the first egg white, and once it’s well integrated add the second one.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.840
Now blend in the vanilla paste and the white vinegar.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.940
For the finale, add the chopped chocolate… hmmmmm

00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:14.749
Place the chocolate batter in the fridge for 30 minutes before using it.

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:20.060
Next spoon the chocolate batter in a baking pan covered with parchment paper

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.380
and make sure to keep space between each cookie as they spread.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.080
Bake in a pre-heated oven to 360 F / 180 C for around 15 minutes

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.880
until the center of the cookies seem solid and there are some cracks around the edges.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.425
Let the cookies cool down completely before removing them from the parchment paper.

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:46.060
Look at these beauties!

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.260
So chocolaty, so smooth, so Yummy!

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.220
Chocolate bites from heaven! Bon Appetit!
