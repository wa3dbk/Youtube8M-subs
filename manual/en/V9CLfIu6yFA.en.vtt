LAUREN FARRAHER: My name is Lauren, and on
behalf of Expert Village, I'm here to talk

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.850
to you about curly hair updos that you can
do at home. There are different diameters

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.880
as to curling irons. Whenever you walk into
a shop, whether it be a salon or whether it

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.860
be a beauty supply store, you're going to
see a lot of different diameters of curling

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.510
irons. You have your inch, you have your half
inch, and you also have your one and a half

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.050
inch. They also become actually bigger than
this, and then you have your in-between sizes.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.230
I recommend that everybody have at least one
inch and maybe like a two inch or one and

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.940
a half. The smaller the diameter of the curling
iron, the tighter the curl is going to be.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.250
So if I take the small one--now also, the
smaller the diameter, the smaller the section

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.219
you have to take. You can--if you take too
big of a section, the hair is not going to

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:58.690
wrap properly and it's not going to go around
all the way. You want to create that smoothness,

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.900
again, from taking it from the base and continuously
dragging it down to your ends. That heat is

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.690
ultimately going to help your hair. So this
one, being a smaller diameter, is going to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:19.020
do a lot tighter of a curl as compared to,
let's say, this one. So this way, you can

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.520
see the difference of the curl and the way
that they overlay each other. Again this one,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.200
you can take a bit of a bigger section because
it does have a bigger diameter to it. Again

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.490
to the base, bring it out. Now, some people--I
happen to find it easier to actually start

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.270
the curl and use my good old piece here in
order to get this piece completely underneath.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.460
I feel like the curl stays on longer, and
it's actually easier to maneuver. Some people

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.470
cannot do that. If you cannot do that, it
is fine to drag the curling iron from the

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.110
base all the way to your ends and then start
rolling. Just remember to be aware of that

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:07.549
crank. As you can see, the curl here is actually
a little bit tighter than what the curl is

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.480
here. The diameter is a little bit--the S
is a little bit softer on this one. So depending

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.341
on the look you're going for, it's going to
depend on the size, diameter of curling iron

00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:22.230
you want to use. The larger the barrel, the
softer the curl.
