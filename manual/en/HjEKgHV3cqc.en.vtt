00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.620
The next step for painting a bathroom I am
going to show you how to use the caulking

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.700
gun and that is going to repair all of the
cracks in the ceilings and get everything

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.709
ready for final painting. So what we are going
to do is we are going to take our caulking

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.420
gun and we have a new tube of caulk so we
are going to have to open it. Most caulking

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.400
guns will have a razor blade or something
like that. This one has as you can see a little

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.699
razor. I'm just going to stick it in there
and open the surface right here. I did it

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:34.500
kind of wide because we had pretty wide gaps
that we had to fill. So we are going to just

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.600
stick it right in there and slide this as
far as it can go and now it is ready to go.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.850
The caulking gets pretty messy so we want
to also have handy a water pail and I like

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:53.520
to have a little bit of water in the bottom
of the pail. You have your rag and you want

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.469
it damp and you want to be constantly wiping
our finger off so it stays clear because this

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.671
stuff gets pretty gunky pretty fast. So now
we are going to go around our area and we

00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:05.331
are going to look for all the gaps and cracks
and seams that are exposed and open and we

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:09.090
are going to fill them with the caulking.
So at first we are going to start over here

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.070
and just squeeze until it comes out and you
want to just lay a bead of the caulk right

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.430
over the seams that we are going to be repairing
and you are going to want to basically spread

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.600
the product over an area that we can work
before it dries so we will work in segments.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.320
After we have applied the product we are going
to do what we call tooling the product and

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.440
for this tool we are going to use our finger.
It is going to be wet and we are basically

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:46.710
just going to smooth it right into the seam.
Wipe off the excess, smoothing it, wiping

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:55.530
it, smooth, wiping, smoothing, wiping. There
is a lot of areas that we have to caulk over

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.500
on the trim. You have to pretty much caulk
every seam and what the caulk does is it seals

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.000
the cracks in the gaps and it is flexible
and it dries into it like rubber so it makes

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.519
it watertight and when the surface wants to
crack it has a little bit of flex to it so

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:24.810
it will resist cracking. I am using all latex
products which as I mentioned before dry rubbery

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:47.819
and flexible and tend not to crack as much
as oil. So now I'm just going to put down

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:54.329
the gun and we're going to tool the area.
We are going to work reasonably fast because

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.769
we don't want it to set up on us. So keeping
the moist finger we will start tooling the

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.459
product. I went pretty heavy on this because
there is a lot of wide gaps. You can really

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.380
feel the product and you can smooth it exactly
the way you want it to be because you want

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:28.609
the final end result to be very smooth and
uniform. You can use your thumb, you can use

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:38.689
any finger you want. Now as I'm doing this
I notice that there is a crack running along

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:44.010
here and that's the kind of crack that needs
to be caulked. So we are just going to go

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:57.389
ahead and apply a little bit here and a little
bit there as needed. Just kind of wiping it

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:03.659
over the surface. You always want to run a
bead along the side where the trim meets the

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:26.130
wall as it tends to crack the most, so run
a bead right down the corner. So when you

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.250
fix this it will stay fixed. This makes a
big difference in your final paint job because

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.340
you can see when the seams and the cracks
tend to disappear everything looks brand new

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.660
and your eyes aren't drawn in to any of the
defects or the damage. Now it looks like we're

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.980
done with this step we're just going to let
this caulking dry. Caulking tends to take

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.700
about four hours to set up. I like to let
it dry up overnight so that when it dries

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.230
it doesn't shrink and create more cracking.
So you want to let it dry completely before

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.230
you go on to your next step which is going
to be to paint.
