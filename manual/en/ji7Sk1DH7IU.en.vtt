00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.410
Take that Commander Cody! Ok, so they play
pretty rough up there on the moon. Now it's

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.920
time for the time and or temporal evidence.
As you may know, it's estimated that our universe

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.680
is about twenty billion years old. This figure
is in debate. But from a nineteen seventy-seven

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.230
Livermore study from Brown and Burman, using
rhenium-osmium decay rates, they determined

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.560
that that figure, twenty billion years seems
to be accurate. Others have pared it down

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.050
to thirteen point eight billion years. And
yet a new study from Ohio State University,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.730
indicates that it may be fifteen point eight
billion years, or fifteen percent older than

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.850
they thought. But, the point is, that we on
earth are decidedly on the younger side of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.969
the cosmological time scale. We're four point
five billion years old, so anywhere from sixty-six

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.760
to seventy-seven percent of all extent planets
should be older than we are. Now what does

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.290
that mean in terms of time? Well if you were
to teleport a sixteen-oh-seven Londoner to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.450
seventeen-oh-seven, I dare to say he wouldn't
see any difference in technological progress.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.399
But if you were to teleport a nineteen-oh-seven
New Yorker to two thousand and seven New York,

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.219
he would definitely suffer a severe case of
future shock. That's because once you enter

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:26.499
the computer era, the atomic era, the nuclear
era, progress shoots up exponentially. So

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:31.700
that a difference of a hundred years could
mean a ten, twenty, or a thirty fold increase

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.250
in technological progress. And we're talking
not just about planets older than us, that

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.479
are a hundred years older, but perhaps a thousand,
ten thousand, even a million years older.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.130
For those entities on such planets, everything
and anything in terms of inter-planetary , inter-stellar,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.590
even inter-galactic space travel might be
possible. Now I acknowledge, a planet that's

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.159
three point five billion years old, might
actually be more advanced than we are. One

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.059
five point five billion years old might be
less advanced. But overall, time argues for

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:10.560
technological progress. And it certainly argues
for the possibility of ancient astronauts

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.890
visiting our planet, even of the distant past.
In fact, they might have been responsible

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.230
for the demise of the mighty dinosaurs sixty-five
million years ago.
