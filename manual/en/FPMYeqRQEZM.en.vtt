00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Hello my name is Tubby. I live here in this wonderful library

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and I love to eat books. I live here with my friends Gumbo and Freckles.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Gumbo, Freckles come out, come out, wherever you are

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Over there, On that great book is Grand Old Holy

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
She is really old and wise and tells us wonderful stories, when she is awake that is.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Oh and we love to sing.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.320
I see that the three of you are back again.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.000
Today I shall tell you the story of Cain and Abel.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.356
So listen carefully after God had thrown Adam and Eve out of Eden.

00:01:06.356 --> 00:01:09.000
Abel grew up to be a shepherd who looked after sheep

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.960
They started living outside the garden.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.160
There they had two sons Cain and Abel.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.360
Able grew up to be a shepard who looked after sheep

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.000
and Cain became a farmer who worked on the land to grow food.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
One day both brothers decided to make an offering to God.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Cain offered his best produce, while Abel offered his best sheep.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
God was more pleased with Abel's gift and did not even accept Cain's gift

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Cain was very sad and also very angry and jealous of Abel.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
God warned came that there was sin in his heart.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Cain did not listen and instead plan to kill his brother.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
He asked able to go for a walk and when and when they reached a lonely place.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.000
He killed Abel. When Cain returned God sensed something was wrong

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and asked him, Where is Abel? Cain lied and said he did not know

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.520
You are lying Cain,you have killed Abel. I cannot forgive you

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.000
You shall be punished from this day onwards you shall be a restless wanderer

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and no land will give you food.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Cain knew if he left his life would be in constant danger and difficulty.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So he begged God to forgive him

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and not be so cruel. But God did not relent.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
He was very angry however God placed a special mark on Cain

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
to make sure no one ever harmed him.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Cain left and went to live in a land east of Eden.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So I shall now ask my question, I hope you have all been paying attention.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
What did Cain and Abel offer god?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I got it, Cain offered his best produce and Abel offered his best sheep.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.200
That is absolutely right.
