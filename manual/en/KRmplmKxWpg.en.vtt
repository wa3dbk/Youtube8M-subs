Recruitment Video Transcript
(0:13) You'll look good in blue!

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.330
(0:24) From the instant that I stepped on
campus for my very first tour I just knew

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.430
that I could live here.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.970
(0:30) I fell in love with the campus that
day, I applied as soon as I got the opportunity.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.260
(0:34) My tour guide completely sold me, the
whole process.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.420
There's always cultural events going on, there
is always music al events, there is sporting

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.710
events, there's clubs, organizations groups
volunteering.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.720
The world's largest water balloon fight and
here's ten percent off at the book and store

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.430
and I was like I'm sold.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.000
Like this place can't get much better.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.100
(0:51) A lot of kids when they come to a campus
and they are just like I would never be able

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.559
to find my way around but I have never had
that feeling.

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.449
(0:57) You've got people that are so welcome
and so warm they are always looking to help

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:02.449
you.

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:03.449
(1:01) I just want to be here.

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.199
There is not a day that I don't want to be
on campus.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.110
(1:04) The campus is absolutely beautiful.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.619
There are a lot of flowers and pretty spots
and pretty benches.

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.650
(1:11) As soon as you step foot on campus
I felt a part of the family.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.140
(1:14) Campus is very safe.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.870
There are these paths with huge paw prints
and it's called the Cat's Path and these are

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.090
very well lit areas.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.310
I really appreciate living on such a safe
campus.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.909
(1:25) I am a sucker for Commons.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.170
Not only because it's five feet from my dorm
but it can't get better than a buffet.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.010
(1:31) I really like Ovid's.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.960
I enjoy eating there, the food is great.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.340
(1:36) There are people coming from all over.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.549
There are international students.

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.700
(1:39) The Global Village is a living learning
community.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.840
(1:42) It gives you the opportunity to be
in a small little class with people who live

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.840
in your building.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.620
(1:46) You learn more about different cultures
and to just hangout with different people

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.799
from all around the world.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.260
(1:50) Just getting to meet new people from
different places is so much fun.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.119
(1:53) I'm from Middletown, Maryland.

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.119
Geneva, Illinois.

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.119
Cincinnati, Ohio.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.119
Long Beach, California.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.119
Louisville, Kentucky.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.119
St. Louis.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.119
Indianapolis.

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.119
Virginia.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.119
Ashland, Kentucky.

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.119
Harbin, China.

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.119
Cleveland, Ohio.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.119
Lexington, Kentucky.

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.119
Columbus, Ohio.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.119
Nashville, Tennessee.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.119
Surabaya, Indonesia.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.119
Atlanta, Georgia.

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:12.119
Paducah, Kentucky.

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:13.119
Dayton, Ohio.

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:14.119
(2:08) I met so many new people and they were
all extremely nice.

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:16.370
(2:14) I love the city of Lexington.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.940
I love that it is sort of smaller because
you could be on campus and then five minutes

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.150
later you are downtown.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:31.850
It has the different local restaurants, all
the shopping places and then there is Keeneland

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.980
watching the races...green grass and the horses.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.980
It's a beautiful place.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.300
(2:35) There's so much to do.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.400
There is just always something for you to
get involved with.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.190
(2:39) From the beginning I got involved with
undergraduate research.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.910
All of a sudden I'm working in the lab of
a world-renowned professor and I'm just a

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.910
freshman.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.250
(2:48) Research opportunities here at UK are
incredible.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.750
They are something you are really not going
to find anywhere else.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.150
(2:53) We are pretty much breeding these two
fish that have two different genes and seeing

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.530
what happens when we have a fish with both
of those genes.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.980
(3:01) It's just really cool to be able to
have these top tier staff here for us on campus

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.070
and to be able to learn from them.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.670
(3:07) My honors class has 17 kids in it.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.880
He knew all of our names by the second class.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.060
(3:12) You're not just a number here at UK.
(3:15) He just had a way of making the class

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.790
fun and making you want to learn.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.070
(3:18) They really want you to succeed they
are there to help you and guide you.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.540
(3:21) My advisor is awesome.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.270
(3:24) They are emailing you internship opportunities.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.560
(3:27) I got to intern in the State Senate,
the British Parliament and the U.S. Congress.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.040
(3:32) You really get to discover who you
are and what you're capable of.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.500
Like this internship where you look around
and you've got people from Harvard, Yale and

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.540
not only am I competing with them in terms
of our projects or assignments I'm exceling

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.540
past them.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.800
(3:45) UK core is essential.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.220
It allows students to take classes that are
going to benefit them in where they want to

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.220
go.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.040
(3:53) UK is really becoming an elite school.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.140
(3:35) We are going to have the most modern
living learning space you can find anywhere

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.480
in the country.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.860
Where relationships will be born, where innovations
will be born.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.070
(4:05) With this Kentucky promise I think
a vision greater than any of us could imagine.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.000
(4:09) The amount of things that are possible
on this campus is just amazing.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.979
(4:15) It's really important to get involved.

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.910
(4:17) K Week is the best way to get involved
from the beginning.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.979
K Week was just a great overall icebreaker
to the whole college experience.

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:31.680
It's nine days of nonstop fun, free food,
free t-shirts, tons of people everywhere.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.509
If you pay for a meal during K Week you have
done something wrong.

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.580
(4:35) Just the opportunities that are made
available it makes you want to try new things.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.430
(4:41) If you look at some of the organizations
that have grown over the past couple years.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.990
Dance Blue is always talked about a lot.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.689
It's a 24-hour dance contest.

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:49.999
Look how far it's come.

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.580
It's such a complete experience.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.229
(4:54) I really enjoy Greek life just kind
of the bond you get with those people.

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.919
The academic side of it I have older people
in the fraternity that help me out with classes.

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.039
(5:01) I am going to study abroad in Argentina
this summer in the city of Buenos Aires.

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.220
(5:06) The campus has so many resources to
students.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.970
(5:09) I currently have the Presidential Scholarship.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.300
I have the Singletary Scholarship.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.340
If you just sit down scholarships are so easy
to apply for.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.259
There are so many scholarships out there.

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:22.909
That scholarship means everything.

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:27.159
(5:23) My favorite place on campus is definitely
Willy T Library.

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.259
Just walking in there makes you feel ten times
smarter.

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.999
It's both a social atmosphere and an academic
atmosphere and that's great.

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:36.999
It's big, quiet, comfortable.

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:38.610
Resources are just unbelievable there.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.979
(5:39) The Johnson Center is great it's probably
the best gym I've ever seen in my life.

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.590
There's so much to do you can never get bored
in one area.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.229
(5:48) They have a rock wall.

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.300
Just the environments as a whole, the school
spirit, the sports it's all here.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.789
There is definitely a spirit that UK has that
no other school has.

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.939
It has a spirit of unity but also school spirit
for sports.

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:01.139
The fans are crazy.

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:07.360
University of Kentucky basketball is like
something I have never seen before.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.059
I got shivers just in the stands.

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:14.270
It's crazy to be right there and have it all
at your presence and you kind of feel like

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.650
you are in the game.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.900
We boast excellence in a lot of other sports
that are up and rising.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.189
We all have one common goal and that's to
support the Wildcats.

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:27.749
(6:22) Yeah everything thing I see is blue.

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:29.050
See blue.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.349
See blue.

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:34.289
See blue really isn't just our slogan it really
is what you feel and see on campus.

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:37.849
When you have athletics, when you have academics,
when you have that social life it all comes

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:39.310
together in a really good blend.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.770
UK is making me into a more well rounded person.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.570
I don't want to go home.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.940
You should come.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.229
You should come now quickly.

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:50.740
It's a great feeling to say that I am part
of this tradition.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.919
UK has been a great experience.

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:56.099
I am just happy to be a Wildcat.

00:06:56.099 --> 00:07:00.299
Big Blue all day.
