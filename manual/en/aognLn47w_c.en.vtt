this is a birdy that we saved outside our house we researched on the Internet how he can live

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.839
so that we can feed him

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.300
that he can learn how to fly you need to provide him

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.590
dog food and this is the dog food

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.650
