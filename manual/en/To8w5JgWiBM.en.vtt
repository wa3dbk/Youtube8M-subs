Hi! This is Elise McMahon for Expert Village.com
and in this video series we are talking about

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.079
making your own dog food. If you would like
to find out more about my services, you can

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:26.070
visit my website at canineheadstart.com. So
we are going to be talking right now about

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.239
grinding your own food. I am going to show
you grinding vegetables, grinding fruit and

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:36.760
grinding meat. We have got a great little
grinder here. When you go to purchase your

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.450
grinder, it is always a good idea to either
talk to somebody who has a grinder and has

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.329
a grinder that is reliable and they like or
definitely do your research when shopping

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.499
around. Get yourself a good grinder that can
grind small bones. You probably will not be

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:59.699
able to find a home grinder that is going
to be able to grind large beef type bones,

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:07.229
beef ribs, but certainly grinding chicken
necks, chicken backs that kind of grinding

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.452
you can get with a nice home grinder. This
is a great little grinder here and we are

00:01:12.452 --> 00:01:20.570
going to start off with some vegetables. I
just got some carrots here and you have seen

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.049
what we can do with the carrots in a stew,
which is cooking right now. So we are going

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.039
to put the carrots in here and we have got
a receptacle, do not forget this, it is silly,

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.700
but rather important part and we are just
going to drop these carrots in here and grind

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:55.429
away.

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.359
Great, so now you have got some nice ground
carrots and I am going to add some apple into

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:11.440
this. So what I am planning on here is just
making a nice light apple and carrot mixture

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.310
and I am going to just add some chicken into
it and I am actually going to take advantage

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.990
of the little package that was in the chicken.
I am going to be grinding some of the liver,

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.440
the heart and the neck. You want to make sure
with your vegetables and your fruit that you

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.104
are cutting everything in to a size that will
fit in to your grinder and we are going to

00:02:34.104 --> 00:02:34.720
grind some apple.
