00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:16.802
Hygiene &amp;amp; Cleanliness

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:19.580
One thing thats very important to us in AWOL Tattoos is cleanliness.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.518
we make sure that the whole studio is cleaned every single 
 day every single thing we use is sterilized 

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:31.084
Or is disposable, we open everything in front of customers 
 just to show them that its one use 

00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:34.823
and anything that is used more than once 
 goes through a rigorous sterilization procedure 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.175
First of all the sterilization process starts with the dirty sink 

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:53.681
So all the dirty equipment comes, is rinsed in the sink, 
 its scrubbed it is then put into an ultrasonic

00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:59.209
which shakes it and the water and we put chemicals 
 in there to make sure everything is clean

00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:03.424
so it shakes the dirt and biohazard off the equipment 

00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:09.258
from there it is dried, then it is bagged, by bagged 
 we mean it is put into these sterilization pouches 

00:01:09.258 --> 00:01:13.442
obviously all done with gloves and changing gloves all the way through

00:01:13.442 --> 00:01:17.815
Once it is sealed in this pouch, it is put into an autoclave 

00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:21.602
Autoclave is like a pressure cooker that vacuum packs 
 and seals everything so once its 

00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:24.685
in this and it has come out of here 
 it is sterile and ready for use.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.558
So this is the piercing studio, first of all we have the piercing bed

00:01:29.558 --> 00:01:33.325
which obviously is cleaned before and after every customer and we 
 usually use bedroll  when there is skin contact.

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:35.875
over here we have everything the piercer needs

00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:40.780
from your sterilized instruments to disposable things like gloves, cotton buds

00:01:40.777 --> 00:01:48.620
Jewelry, and as you can see, all of our jewelry is individually 
 vacuum packed sealed and sterilized and we only use titanium. 

00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:07.390
Sterilization and health and cross-contamination, there's no government body regulating this so we 

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:14.730
go by Canadian, American, English law and their guidelines on 
 how to keep the place running clean and sterile

00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:18.360
and how to make decisions on ages of people 
 who can get tattooed and pierced 

00:02:18.362 --> 00:02:22.350
You have to be over 18 to get a tattoo and you have to 
 be over 16 to certain piercing and over 18 for other piercings

00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:24.170
all of which require I.D

00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:27.810
We have to take it upon ourselves to have responsibility  
 to make sure that we are clean and sterile 

00:02:27.807 --> 00:02:30.310
so that people can feel comfortable when they come in here

00:02:30.307 --> 00:02:32.570
