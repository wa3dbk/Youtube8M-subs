00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:09.120
Hi guys, I'm Vegard and in todays video you're going to learn a fast and easy way to iron your shirt.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.260
In this video I'm going to use my steam iron; 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.340
- my aerosol can of heat activated spray starch; -

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.900
- a cup of tap water for the steam iron; -

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.990
- in addition to a 13x18 inch grip seal plastic bag; -

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.310
- and of course, you're going to need your shirt.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.439
I have, by the way, added links to these products below this video, if you want to check them out.

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.480
By the way, if you'd like to learn more about my ironing gear, -

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.820
- you should check out my "Ironing Gear" video tutorial by clicking the link on screen, -

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.920
- or down below this video now!

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.040
Before we start ironing, I would like to share my favourite trick with you -

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.440
-  that makes ironing any garment so much easier.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.560
The tick is simply to spray the garment you're about to iron with some water -

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.000
- and leave it in an airtight plastic bag to rest for about half an hour.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.740
When you do this the fabric becomes damp and about 10x easier to iron.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.260
For this job I simply use my stem irons built-in spray nozzle -

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.260
- and a 13x18 inch grip seal plastic bag.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.880
These are by the way the same plastic bags that I used in my "How to Iron Dress Pants" video, -

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.900
- which you can check out by clicking the link on screen or down below now!

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.939
I've already prepared another shirt. It's spent the last 30 minutes in a plastic bag like this -

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.199
- and it's now probably damp and ready to get ironed.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.780
Before we start, I need to top up the steam iron with some water -

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.679
- and I also need to adjust the heat settings according to the shirts care label.

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.960
Looking at this shirts care label, I can see it has an ironing symbol with two dots in it, -

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.060
That means that I have to adjust my steam irons settings wheel, to the position with two dots on it as well.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.320
However, I will leave the steam irons steam setting on full, for most part of this video.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.741
Because I'm right handed, I like to start with the shirts right front side.

00:01:55.741 --> 00:02:00.321
That way the parts of the shirt that I've already ironed will hang down on the other side of the ironing board, -

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:03.701
- out of mine and the steam irons power cords way.

00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:08.641
A fun fact here, is that shirt made for women always have their buttons on the opposite side, the left side.

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.060
The reason for this I believe, is that they where made that way to make it easier -

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.220
-  for the right handed maids to dress the women of the household.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.880
Men on the other hand were expected to dress themselves -

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.620
- and since most men are right handed, we ended up with shirt with buttons on the right side.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.600
When placing the shirt on the ironing board, -

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.920
-  it's important that the side seam of the shirt aligns with the edge of the ironing board.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.740
That way, hardly any part of the shirts front is left unironed.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.600
We start ironing and make sure to give the hem some extra attention, -

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.220
- as this can be quite hard to iron flat.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.040
Also, we make sure to iron in-between all the buttons on the front placket.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.810
When we're done ironing the right front side, we grab the hem and the shoulder -

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.720
- and shift the shirt over, placing the
right back side on the ironing board.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.120
Again it's important to align the side seam of the shirt with the ironing board.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.530
The shirts back side will have to be ironed in two steps -

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.690
- and once we're done with the right side, we shift the shirt over once again -

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.150
- and align the left side seam with the edge of the ironing board and iron the left side.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.900
My shirt has some pleats here on the back -

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.670
- and chances are that your shirt might as
well.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.480
The best way I've found to tackle these pleats, are actually to iron into them -

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.880
- while slowly and gently wiggling your iron from side to side.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.520
When we're done with the back, we shift the shirt over again and we focus on the left front side.

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.220
Once we're done ironing the left front side, we simply grab to bottom and top of the front placket -

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.700
- and place it reverse side up on the ironing board.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.840
As you can see with my left hand, I make sure to never let go of the shirt, -

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.589
- because if I do, it will slide off the ironing board.

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:09.469
While holding on to the shirt, I apply some spray starch to the reverse side of the placket.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.730
Once the starch is applied, I turn of my steam irons steam function -

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.609
- and activate the spray starch by ironing it until it's roughly dried up.

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.571
Next is the left arm and we place it on the ironing board with the gauntlet button and wrist placket facing up.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.160
Then we locate the arm seam, like I've done here -

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.900
and make this the starting point for our steam iron.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.856
While holding on to the arm seam, I gently pull on the arms fabric, -

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.620
- to remove as many of the folds and wrinkles as I can before I start ironing.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.080
Now I have turned my steam irons steam function back on -

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.300
- and I start ironing the arm in an from-the-arm-seam-and-out motion, -

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.280
- which will create a nice crease in the topside fabric of the arm.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.860
We start ironing on the upper arm and we work ourselves down to the wrist placket.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.120
At the wrist placket we iron around the gauntlet and we pull and a dust the fabric as necessary.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.620
Then we iron the reverse side of the wrist placket, -

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.240
- before applying starch, -

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.580
- turning the steam function on the steam iron off -

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.810
- and activating the starch by ironing it until it's roughly dried up.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.360
Once that's done, we fold the wrist placket into its natural position, -

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.680
- turn the steam back on and give the wrist placket a light pressing.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.360
When we're done ironing the left arm, -

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.760
- all we have to do is to repeat the steps and do the same with the right arm.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.840
Now the shirt look damn good if I'm to say so myself, -

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.200
- we just have one final step left and that is to iron the collar.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.140
If you have a high quality shirt, there's a good chance that your shirt has removable collar bones.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.820
If it does, you need to remember that they should always be removed before you wash it -

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.460
- and before you iron your shirt.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.100
My shirt, on the other hand, do have collar bones, but they are not removable.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.840
So I will just have to leave them in while ironing the shirt.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.700
I also have to mention that button down shirts, like the one I'm wearing today, -

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.220
- aren't suppose to have collar bones.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.020
So if your shirt is missing collar bones, that might just be the reason.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.140
As I was saying, all we have to do now is to iron the collar -

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.660
- and to do that we simply place it face down on the edge of the ironing board like this.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.080
With the steam function on, we iron the reverse side wrinkle free, -

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:40.789
- before applying spray starch.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.920
Now with the steam function turned off, -

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.788
- we activate the spray starch by ironing the collar until it's roughly dried up.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.120
If your shirt had removable collar bones, now's the time to but them back in, -

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.700
- because we're going to put the shirt on a clothes hanger.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.580
As you can see, the shirt is now on a clothes hanger -

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.210
- and all I did after I activated the spray starch was simply to fold the collar back to its normal position.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.100
Next we're going to button close the top two buttons and the last button on the front placket.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.180
The reason why I buttoned these buttons is because it helps keep the shape of the collar, -

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:26.849
- as well as it helps prevent the shirt from getting wrinkly when it's hanging in the closet.

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:30.469
If you need to pack your shirt, rather than hanging it on a clothes hanger like this, -

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:32.740
- you should check out my "How to Pack a Suit and Shirt" video -
