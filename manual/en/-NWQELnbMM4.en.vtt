00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:03.449
I was born to eat this shit

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.789
Sorry Mom, but this is my favorite food: the Big ***

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.380
This is my passion

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.940
The Big *** to me is more of a family thing. Me and my brother got matching tattoos.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.720
My passions are my parents, my studio, my husband, my daughter and my Big ***… until I die.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.220
what's this

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.580
Burger King?

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.380
You’re a true burger lover.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.040
We’d like to invite you to come to Brazil…

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.440
… and try a new burger

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.240
Are you in?

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.520
what do you mean?

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.020
I say hell yeah I’m in!

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.560
Brazil, I’m on my way!

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.680
Just to let you know that I’ve arrived and everything’s OK.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.660
It’s freaking awesome!

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.980
The meat is delicious.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.980
That’s flame grilled right there.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.900
Big King, right?

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.440
What’s up guys?

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.080
Hi!

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.740
Is this real?

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.760
So you liked the Big King with the flame-grilled patties?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.620
yeah!

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.720
Is that a Big ***?

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.420
Would you want to change that burger into a real king?

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.399
So the next step is: we’re going to flame grill your tattoos.

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:31.079
right now?

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.580
For sure.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.900
I’ll meet you guys at the tattoo shop!

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.940
So I'll see you in a minute. Here we go! Let's do it!

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.880
Best day! Best day ever man!

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.420
I can't even speak!

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.200
Are you guys ready?

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.060
Yeah!

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.160
We’ll start grilling you.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.860
Yeah!

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.260
Before it was a burger. Just a burger.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.260
It’s improved now.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.300
I hope Burger King invites me for the next fries’ commercial. I’m ready for the potatoes!

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.320
Me and my brother have the same exact tattoo.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.260
What do you want to do?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
I’m just not… I’m not going to change it.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.060
Alright.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.420
I loved the Big King, I thought it was really good

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.180
but I wouldn’t change my tattoo for anything in the world.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.850
I’ve always been so crazy about *********…

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.560
change is good, we shouldn’t be so close-minded, like I’ve been.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.900
There’s no reason not to change.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.240
If you have something that could give you more, something better, why stick with the same old thing?

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.280
Change always leaves a mark

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.370
I want one just like this, please.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.340
Burger King. Your Way
