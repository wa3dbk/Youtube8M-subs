00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.279
(Cletus) And they are entering the track, as they will be racing today.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.788
There's Sam Jackson, and there's Topher Robinson, entering with Toby,

00:00:07.788 --> 00:00:09.393
and the crowd reacting.

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:12.000
And oh, looks like Toby is getting a little restless.

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:17.002
He's fighting him a little, but there he goes, he's heading back now.

00:00:16.886 --> 00:00:24.886
As they're both heading to the starting positions, let's just think about 
 how this will affect the rest of the season. 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.449
First race, most important.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.933
Everybody wants this, Kentucky Goat Derby.

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:37.048
Looks like Toby is having trouble getting in the block, TimBib's ready.

00:00:38.117 --> 00:00:41.059
And he's in backwards, they're trying to get him in.

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.936
He's got him in now, he's got him in the block. We'll be starting.

00:00:45.137 --> 00:00:46.814
And their off.

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:50.491
Oh look at TimBib with the fast start as he comes around the turn.

00:00:50.692 --> 00:00:53.700
Oh my goodness, Toby's riding his back, Toby passes him! 

00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:57.611
What a strong finish! Oh my goodness, Wow!

00:00:58.012 --> 00:01:05.237
Look at that as he celebrates, this is a great win 
 for Topher Robinson and an amazing start to the season.

00:01:05.672 --> 00:01:09.249
Wow, i cannot believe this what a comeback

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:12.524
And look at him with this goat there, this is great man, wow!

00:01:12.524 --> 00:01:16.168
And there's the results of the race as we rap up this exciting day.

00:01:16.168 --> 00:01:21.422
We'd like to thank the Kentucky goat Derby and 
 M'ownah race tracks for hosting this great event.

00:01:21.422 --> 00:01:26.369
Congratulations to Topher Robinson on winning the first race of 
 the season and earning those 100 points. 

00:01:26.603 --> 00:01:31.103
Let's go down to the track with Debbie Jackson for 
 W-G-O-A-T who will be talking to the racers.

00:01:31.483 --> 00:01:32.051
(TR) Are you excited?

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.867
(DJ) Topher, Topher, Debbie Jackson from W-G-O-A-T.

00:01:36.268 --> 00:01:36.904
(TR) Oh hey.

00:01:36.904 --> 00:01:37.672
(DJ) How does it feel?

00:01:37.873 --> 00:01:41.780
(TR) Oh it feels amazing I cou... I 
 just, I wanted this race so bad.

00:01:42.285 --> 00:01:44.360
(DJ) What do you have to say about your goat?

00:01:44.558 --> 00:01:49.780
(TR) He made an incredible comeback, we had 
 a bad start, but, he recovered nicely.

00:01:50.013 --> 00:01:53.890
(DJ) We saw how he stumbled at first but then 
 he sped it up and pulled you to victory.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.090
(TR) Yeah, It was amazing.

00:01:55.094 --> 00:01:55.930
(DJ) Congratulations

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.900
(TR) Thank you.

00:01:57.667 --> 00:01:58.500
(DJ) Mr Jackson.

00:01:58.804 --> 00:01:59.340
(SJ) Yep.

00:01:59.339 --> 00:02:03.780
(DJ) Debbie Jackson from W-G-O-A-T, tough loss.

00:02:03.784 --> 00:02:13.550
(SJ) Very tough loss. Not sure what happened there, I don't know just, 
 I don't know he just didn't feel like running at the end.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.630
He really, he always has a good start, 
 but it's like he just didn't, 

00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:21.910
get to the speed i expect him to get to.

00:02:22.214 --> 00:02:25.690
(DJ) Do you think he was a little tired today.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:33.610
(SJ) You know I highly doubt that, he was 
 fine, I don't know, he seemed fine.

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:42.680
You know I, I was just, I was on the 
 outside there um, he was right on my back,

00:02:42.676 --> 00:02:49.760
I don't know it's like he just wanted to slow up a 
 little bit and uh, he didn't want to run hard,

00:02:49.963 --> 00:02:52.840
I guess it just wasn't his day today.

00:02:53.445 --> 00:02:56.390
(DJ) What do you have to say to the hometown fans from Sand Gap.

00:02:56.621 --> 00:03:00.730
(SJ) You know I just, I'd probably have to apologize but,

00:03:00.933 --> 00:03:07.160
a tough loss, so, I know, I know their 
 feeling pretty bad right now after that,

00:03:07.155 --> 00:03:11.530
we really could have had it this year, I 
 thought I had him trained for this.

00:03:11.534 --> 00:03:15.010
You know but this is just the first race, 
 we've got the rest of the season. 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:22.040
You know, it wasn't a terrible run you know 
 getting off to the lead starting off,

00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:22.500
(Goat burp)

00:03:22.687 --> 00:03:26.820
you just got to finish these that's the bottom 
 line, if you're going to win that.

00:03:27.017 --> 00:03:27.480
(DJ) Thank you

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:29.660
(Cletus) So there you have the words of the two racers.

00:03:30.025 --> 00:03:34.700
Oh looks like Jackson's going over to congratulate Topher, let's look at that.

00:03:35.473 --> 00:03:38.920
And there you have it, that's great as we head over to Victory Lane.

00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:51.520
(Celebration as G.O.A.T. by The Twangers plays in the background)

00:03:54.438 --> 00:03:57.210
(DJ) Great win Topher, what do you have to say to your sponsors.

 Goat Derby. It's been an exciting time,

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:59.370
we've seen the good, we've seen the bad, we've seen the overcoming of adversity.

00:04:59.742 --> 00:05:07.560
The thrill of victory, until next year, this is Debbie Jackson at W-G-O-A-T.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.750
