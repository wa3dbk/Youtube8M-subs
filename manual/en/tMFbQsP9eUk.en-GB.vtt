Hello guys, impaKt here with another quick
tip video. This is going to be my second one

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.980
and it's going to be about Annie. Her stun
duration at early levels got nerfed in patch

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.379
4.1 meaning your trading potential isn't as
amazing as it used to be. You could pretty

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.770
much stack your Incinerate at level 1, land
a stun in lane, an auto attack and you still

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.380
would have enough time to back off. Your trading
potential was absolutely ridiculous as she

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.440
never really fell off at any stages of the
game either. Not anymore though. If you try

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.109
to pull this off against a Thresh for instance,
you're risking getting caught on his death

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:40.489
sentence or flay and getting dragged into
a more extended fight which can lead to summoner

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.089
spells burned or even in a kill.

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.390
I've actually seen people struggle with Annie's
early game a bit recently, so I decided to

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.680
share a couple of tips that may be of some
use:

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.409
First of all, you don't need the CC at level
1. See Karma, for example, she can just start

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.569
poking you down at lv 1 with her Q and it
doesn't mean she's bad for it. What I'm suggesting

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:05.909
is that you start with your Desintegrate and
use it to harass your opponents as soon as

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.880
you reach the lane. It has a lot more range
than Incinerate, it's safer, does a lot of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.000
damage and by the time you get to level 2,
you should have your stun almost ready to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.049
go, meaning you can go for a more extended
trade.

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.280
My second tip is a purchase suggestion. Instead
of going Doran's Shield, consider Doran's

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.560
Ring. First of all, you'll slap people in
the face a lot harder since your damage is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.869
gonna go up. Secondly, you'll have the mana
regen that the shield doesn't give you and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.920
that you'll need for harassing. You'll be
lacking 40 HP comparing to the shield, and

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.020
you'll be lacking the HP regen. However, consider
this: annie's range is incredibly high so

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.719
you shouldn't get harassed that heavily in
the first place, meaning HP Regen isn't as

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.680
necessary as in a Leona for example. Also,
by going Doran's Ring you'll be able to buy

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.520
at least 2 HP pots, so you'll have that little
extra safety net with you just in case.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.639
These little adjustments helped me regain
my confidence with Annie, which was something

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:09.390
that I was kind of lacking since the patch.
Hopefully it'll help you guys as well :)
