00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:02.570
This sword is

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.150
absolutely beautiful.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.139
You could almost call it...

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:10.139
...heavenly.

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.839
Yes, as the title suggests...

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.889
I am here to discuss Heavenly Sword.

00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:21.899
Now from what I remember this was one of the earlier
graphic intensive games for the PS3's advertising

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:25.919
campaigns. I remember seeing a lot of advertisements
for this game. So after a couple years of not seeing it,

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.819
I decided I'd get it. And I did.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.649
One of the things about this game that stood
out the most to me

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.630
just...how beautiful the cutscenes were.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.980
They're just...

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.440
they all look so great. I mean I've never
seen

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.600
such vivid

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.020
facial animations in a game before.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.150
Actually it's pretty on par with CG movies.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.640
The facial animation is just

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.970
amazing

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.870
The voice acting

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.920
is really good.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.029
And the story

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:55.040
it's

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.670
thought out, it's developed,

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.930
it's very progressional

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.489
and relatively easy to follow.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.870
This was one of those games that liked to make use of the
Sixaxis. At certain points in the game you

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.640
need to steer these arrows through the air.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.550
At first it can be pretty annoying,
but once you get the hang of it...

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.410
it's fun. It can get really fun.
Basically you hold the controller flat like

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.860
this

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.140
and you turn the arrows

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.760
whatever way they need to go.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.729
It follows

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.670
pretty well.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.480
It's also...when you're controlling the arrows
everything's in slow motion too so

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.940
aiming is

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.979
a little bit easier.

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.700
That was

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.110
one of the more fun parts of the game. So like I said it
started out annoying, but once you get used to it it's fun

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.790
The normal sword battle parts of the game are
mostly button mashers.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.689
But if you're one of the people who really
likes to make

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.090
awesome combos and just really destroy your enemies

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.270
that option is available. You can do some
really cool moves and you can...

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.670
there's counterattacks there's combos you can
string together. I think you can string together

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.940
combos with other combos. Just a lot of
stuff you can do. I certainly

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.910
didn't do

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.379
even half of the stuff available.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.599
But if you want to just play through the game

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.709
you could button mash your way through.

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.169
Although there is this one part...

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.409
But yeah...this was a really

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.039
just a really good game. There's not a lot

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:22.409
I can say

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.849
that's bad about it.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.539
If anything, it's

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:28.920
probably the shortest PS3 game

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.359
I've ever played.

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.279
It only will take about six
hours to beat.

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:36.749
And um...

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.639
There's only a couple
of extra things you can do

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.569
and

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.919
for the most part they're not worth it

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:45.340
But it's...

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.219
it's one of those games that I look at as
the kind of movie that you want to own.

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:54.429
It's just one of those things you...every
so often you go, "Oh I want a good story with

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:55.389
some

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.169
good graphics and

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.719
well made..." *laughs*

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.019
So...just like a movie

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.109
sit down

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.699
put the game in

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:04.859
six hours, that's it.

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:10.259
And from what I remember there's only
one part that drags a little bit

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:11.830
and it's...

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.929
it's a sequence where you have to

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:18.809
defend somebody using arrows.

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.069
You're pretty far away and it can...

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.939
It goes on for so long that it gets
pretty droning, but again...

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:30.089
by this point you'll probably be having
fun with the arrows.

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:35.720
A lot of people like to say that it's a rip
off of God of War and in some ways it kind of is

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.389
because the attack styles can get pretty similar.

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.150
It's not a problem. I mean...

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.819
if you like God of War's style of play

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.339
you should like this too.

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:45.330
So this is a game that I would certainly recommend.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.260
If you can get past the fact that it is a
short game...

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.999
possibly the shortest available on the PS3...

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:52.869
...probably not though...

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:54.639
then you

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.859
should get it. Now when I played this I
was playing it on a tube TV because

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.219
the TV I had, had just

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:02.150
randomly broken

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.559
for no reason at all.

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:07.999
But now I have a nice beautiful HDTV so I'm

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.519
kind of excited about what it'll look
like the next time I play.

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.999
One thing I would like to add for anybody who
does get the game...

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:14.960
the first fighting sequence

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.379
is a little bit laggy, but don't worry...

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:19.579
it's just that part.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.570
I don't think it does that for the rest
of the game.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.960
But I don't know why it

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.419
starts off like that. I mean I know there's a
lot of people to render here, but

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.999
still I think they could've worked their
way around it. I've seen

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:34.360
a lot

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.199
more rendering and no lag. So, uh...

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.469
Yeah...hope you enjoy it if you get it.

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:40.000
*Schwing*
