[Title] "Star Trek Barbie" "Fail Toy" Review

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.200
This is Mike Mozart of  TheToyChannel and 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.000
JeepersMedia on YouTube with the...

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.000
Barbie and Ken Star Trek dolls from 1996 to

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.900
celebrate Star Trek's 30th anniversary.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.800
That's right...they made a horrifying Barbie and Ken.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.550
Barbie on the bridge of Her dream Enterprise.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.700
There's Captain Kirk who comes in Barbie's box.... of course.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.850
I don't know...Captain Kirk is looking kinda....

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.600
longingly at Ken over here. Actually so is Mr. Spock

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.000
Search Kirk, Spock, and Slash on YouTube and see what I mean.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.800
I've opened up the box so we can get a better

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.200
look at the crew of the Enterprise.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.200
There's Barbie sewn into the box to make sure

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.100
she won't escape.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.500
Check out this sexist outfit that they put on Her

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.500
in the future. while all the men have uniforms.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.500
I guess they still appreciate pretty legs in the future...

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.400
..right Captain Kirk.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.500
[Captain Kirk] get me a (sammich) sandwich...woman.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.400
Uhmm...I don't know about that. If you look over here

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.000
does'nt Kirk seem to be looking longingly at Ken

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.100
Look at those eyes. look at those dreamy eyes.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.200
Now come to think of it I think Williams Shatner's

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.200
"b00bs" are bigger than Barbie's now.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.000
Look at this... Oh Captain Kirk.. where is that

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.700
hand going?? I think He wants to go where no 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.300
"Man Has Gone Before" ..... Uhhmm....

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.000
Wait a second.. the back of the box is over here.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.110
Check this out. Here is the back of this box.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.350
Don't forget Barbie has a red shirt on.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.450
We remember what happens to all the red shirts

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.800
that gets beamed down to the planet......

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.800
They Die .......

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.000
Of course it doesn't help that Ken has beamed 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.000
down with a phaser aimed at Barbie's back as they walk along

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.700
Look at Barbie here..[Barbie] Ohh that looks like

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.700
a mall over there. I think I'll go shoe shopping.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.200
Here is Ken here..[Ken] Little does Barbie know

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.100
that the malls here are actually aliens in disguise

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200
that eat humans. If I don't see anything I could

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.000
get rid of here forever and I can go back to Sulu

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.200
who I really love.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.500
[Barbie] Come on. Let's go check out the mall.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.100
I going to go shoe shopping.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200
[Mike Mozart] It comes with these little cheap

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.000
miniature plastice weapons and tri-corders and things.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.800
I love how the box at the bottom says....

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.700
" Barbie Doll cannot stand alone."

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.400
It's probably from those skinny legs from not eating.... I'm not surprised

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.100
Space intruments are non-working.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.500
What kind of a "bubble-headed", airhead would

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.100
have to be to think that these cheesy little plastic

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.200
weapons actually function?

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.700
[Spock] illogical. I don't recall seeing Barbie at 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.100
Star Fleet Academy.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.800
[Mike Mozart] Oh my God... Ken's toupee looks almost as bad as William Shatner's

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.400
I mean really....What where they thinking???

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.800
Perfect for that basement dweller in your life.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.250
So what do you think.. Is this Win or "Fail toy"???

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.250
Put your answer in the comment section.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.800

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.400
