00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:05.280
It’s early Monday morning and you realise
you forgot to pick up your dry cleaning, you

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.800
can’t find your keys and then you have no
idea what your Facebook password is.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.349
As you start to panic, it feels like your
memory kind of sucks.

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.369
But your brain is designed to forget.

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.970
And it’s not necessarily a bad thing.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.550
[BrainCraft intro]

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.140
Psychological theories try and make sense
of why we forget pieces of information, like

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.410
all of our passwords.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.749
Decay theory suggests we can’t retrieve
information because over time, traces of our

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:39.260
memories fade away and eventually disappear.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.309
Interference theory suggests new memories
compete with our existing ones.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.519
When new information is similar to a memory
you already have, the new information interferes

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.479
with your ability to recall that existing
memory.

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:58.299
And in some cases, we didn’t even store
a thought as a memory in the first place.

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:04.680
Neuroscientists suggest many of these theories
could be intertwined - at a tiny molecular

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.840
level in your brain.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.630
We have a “forgetting protein” in our
brains called Musashi.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.689
It messes with the function of our synapses,
structures that let nerve cells communicate

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.179
with each other.

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:22.429
Another protein called Adducin, has the opposite
effect and actually stimulates the growth

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.000
of our synapses.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.499
Remembering and forgetting thoughts is like
a street fight between Musashi and Adducin.

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:35.409
Their interaction and who wins depends on
whether our thoughts transmitted across our

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.700
synapses are stabilized and stored permanently
in our memory.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.770
In one study, researchers genetically modified
some ringworms - let’s just call them teenage

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.770
mutant ninja worms - so their brains didn’t
contain musashi.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:58.069
The regular and mutant worms learned new information
just as well, but the mutant worms -- without

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.110
Musashi -- had much better recall of information.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.070
They were less forgetful.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.619
By removing the “forgetting protein” we
learn more about how it works.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.390
It could help us understand disorders where
people lose their memories, like Alzheimers,

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.840
and how to treat them.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.360
But, sadly, we can’t go removing Musashi
from our brains to have a super powered memory.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.370
Our brains forget on purpose.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.680
We need to forget because the ability to lose
information keeps our brains flexible so they

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.070
can absorb new things.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.390
If we didn’t forget, we’d constantly recall
all kinds of random, extraneous information

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.459
and we wouldn’t be able to focus on the
present.

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.060
Forgetting your passwords is frustrating,
but it’s totally normal.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.990
As we go about our daily lives, we subconsciously
find a balance between remembering and forgetting.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.720
So a "brain fart" or a “seniors moment”
isn't all that bad.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.920
Forgetting actually helps you remember.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:17.650
