"Hi, I'm Andy ""the Magic Man"" Segal, I'm
here at Willow Billiards in Hoboken, New Jersey

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:13.860
doing some trick shots and pulling structures,
so, if you're ready, let's get started.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.949
Alright, so, for this shot, we're going to
learn how to control the direction of the

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:18.949
cue ball.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.000
We have a fairly straight end shot, we want
to know where's the cue ball going afterwards.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.210
If you remember from the Ghost ball video,
the cut shot video, here's the ghost ball,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.289
this is where i'm aiming the cue ball.

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.079
Now you take this tangent line, and this is
where the cue ball is going to travel, but,

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.190
it's only going to travel that way if you
shoot it like, a stop shot, now obviously

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.110
since you're cutting the ball the cue ball's
not going to stop but if you have that slide

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.829
happen right where the twelve is, the cue
ball will follow the direction of this tangent

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.239
line.

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.909
So let's try that.

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.459
Now you notice the cue ball hit right over
here.

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:05.690
So let's set that shot up again, and then
we're going to talk about altering that line,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.690
okay?

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.370
Here's the tangent line, right to that shaw.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.400
Now if I want the cue ball to go in a different
direction, i can use either top spin or back

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.400
spin.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.180
If I use top spin,what's going to happen is
the cue ball is going to be spinning forward

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:27.732
and it's going to push forward on this tangent
line, so it's actually going to go this way.

00:01:27.732 --> 00:01:33.860
You notice here the cue ball hit at this location,
and that with a backspin, you actually can

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:42.430
get the tangent line here, it pulls the cue
ball back this way, so you can actually get

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.490
a big difference in where the cue ball goes.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.600
And that's how you decide what to use first
look at the tangent line, that's your stop

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.821
shot, and then if you want to pull it back
from the tangent line or push it forward you

00:01:54.821 --> 00:01:56.320
use top spin, or back spin. "
