Hello, Sega of America. Long time no see. 

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:06.014
Good afternoon, Yakuza fans.

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:10.356
Sega, on behalf of the Yakuza fans here in the west, I think we

00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:14.025
would all like to know why Yakuza 3 
 is not going to come out here.

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:16.997
Because the last time we stuck our necks out for you fucking

00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:20.944
assholes, you only bought 40,000 copies of the game. 

00:00:20.995 --> 00:00:23.429
Go eat a dick, Yakuza fans.

00:00:23.847 --> 00:00:27.771
Sega of America, isn't it true that you did almost no promotion

00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:31.927
for Yakuza 2 in the west, and simply added a subtitle track to the

00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:34.923
game, and it's localization for a game that was on a

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.664
last-generation system?

00:00:38.452 --> 00:00:42.353
That is not true. We preserved the integrity of the project.

00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:46.277
We also added that sweet-ass guitar riff at the opening of the game

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.878
that goes like - *guitar flourish* 

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:51.246
Really?

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.592
Nah, that was already there.

00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:58.514
Sega of America, I am sorry to say 
 it, but you are a terrible publisher.

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.672
And I think I speak for all of us when we say 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:03.437
that we are sick of your shit.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.592
I see. Well, Sega fans, let me see 
 if I can try to make it

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:11.750
up to you. How would you feel about an all-new Sonic the

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:12.748
Hedgehog game?

00:01:13.213 --> 00:01:14.745
I just don't know about that, Sega. 

00:01:15.302 --> 00:01:18.182
The last one you made was fucking godawful. 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.711
(silence)

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.408
Fine.

00:01:23.847 --> 00:01:25.937
What is this piece of shit going to be like?

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.535
Please picture - if you will - Sonic the Hedgehog, in an open-

00:01:30.627 --> 00:01:31.917
world, 3D adventure.

00:01:32.346 --> 00:01:34.946
This is fucking terrible already.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.776
You hang on. I am not done. In this game, Sonic has to go

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:42.750
through various levels, collecting rings and chaos emeralds.

00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:44.470
I could live with that!

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.250
And he can turn into a pine cone.

00:01:48.228 --> 00:01:49.760
(silence)

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:53.240
And he has like about seven shitty friends.

00:01:54.196 --> 00:01:54.750
(silence)

00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:56.500
What do you think?

00:01:57.238 --> 00:01:59.280
I think I would rather have Yakuza 3.

00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:03.510
Well, let me tell you something, Yakuza fans.

00:02:04.064 --> 00:02:06.530
Do you see those tennis rackets over there? 

00:02:09.474 --> 00:02:10.540
Those are the ones.

00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:14.860
If you ever come into my office, and ask for Yakuza 3 again,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.930
I swear to God, that I will murder you with them. 

00:02:21.502 --> 00:02:22.430
Yes, you. 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.820
Now, if you will excuse me, I'm going to go approve awesome

00:02:25.868 --> 00:02:29.120
game concepts for the Wii that nobody is going to buy.

00:02:29.722 --> 00:02:31.630
Get the fuck out of my office.
