00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:11.460
This segment is about how to repair a punctured
tube by applying a patch. I have a tube that

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.280
went flat on the road, but it's apparently
a slow leak because I've partially inflated

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.119
it and I don't hear any air coming out. So,
I'm going to go ahead and dump it into a pail

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:34.910
of water, look for bubbles. Aha! Right here,
I've got some bubbles coming out. So I look

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:47.870
closely, I can see the hole. Need to let the
air out now so that I don't have any inward

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:57.721
pressure that's going to keep the patch from
seating itself. Dry it thoroughly. And in

00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:07.520
my patch kit, I have sandpaper. Using the
sandpaper to roughen the area. Ok, I've got

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.090
a tube of glue. I carry a nail in my patch
kit as well because the glue is sealed, and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:24.900
I need to puncture it so that I can withdraw
the glue. The reason I carry an unpunctured

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.840
tube of glue is because, now that it's open,
within about four weeks, it's going to be

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:42.710
dry and hard and unusable. So I apply the
glue, nice and liberally, lots of glue. And,

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:55.040
place the patch. Roll it on, to make sure
that it's nice and tight. And there we have

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.649
it. Wait a couple of minutes and you'll be
able to inflate your tube to full pressure.
