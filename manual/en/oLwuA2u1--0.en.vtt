00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.690
Hi, I'm Christine Pachini for Expert Village
and today I'm going to teach you some basic

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:11.679
knitting techniques. So the first way of holding
the yarn which is the way that I have always

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:33.960
knit, is to take the yarn going to the ball,
rest it over the last two fingers, the pinky

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.820
finger and the fourth finger. Then turn the
hand over and the working yarn going to the

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.699
needle is then held here. Now you're holding
on here to the tension as you like it against

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:48.800
the right handed needle and using this forefinger
to do the wrapping action. Then you tuck the

00:00:48.800 --> 00:01:08.600
needle under, wrap with this forefinger, and
then holding the working yarn here, you have

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:23.090
the proper tension to pull the stitch through
and off the needle. So wrap around with this

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:32.660
forefinger, under and over. One of the reasons
I like this technique is that you're not holding

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.660
on too tightly, tightly enough for tension
but not too tight that you can't take up this

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.860
yarn as you keep knitting without too much
strain. The second thing I like about this

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.350
technique is that because all of the wrapping
is done with the forefinger, it's really efficient.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.350
You can knit really quickly because all of
the motion is contained right up here at the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.160
top. You're not doing a lot of hand work.
You don't have to constantly be dropping the

00:01:48.160 --> 00:02:03.640
yarn and picking it back up again like so.
So that's my favorite method.
