00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.180
Many battery-operated toys can be adapted to run

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.669
with a switch by using a battery interrupter.

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.099
When choosing toys to adapt to use with switches

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:38.099
Select toys with simple on/off switches, On, Off.

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:49.389
On, Off. And if you choose to do a tape player,

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:52.449
it's actually the play button that is the On

00:00:52.449 --> 00:01:04.369
button. (music plays) Avoid toys that have motion

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.350
activated controls or sophisticated controls

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.850
such as 'press the paw'. (Toy speaking)

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.340
Choose toys that use double A, C, or D batteries

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.020
to use with a battery interrupter.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.820
Don't select toys that have watch or hearing aid

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.940
type batteries. Generally you'll find that alkaline

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.689
batteries last the longest. And when you're putting

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.100
batteries in a toy, the batteries should be all

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.920
the same kind, same brand, and same style.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.759
Rechargeable batteries won't work in all toys.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.199
Check your toy packaging to see if they are 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.880
compatible. It might be a good idea to invest in a 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.840
battery tester. If you leave your batteries in 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.280
your toys be sure to switch them to the off 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.120
position or it will drain your batteries. If you're 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.080
going to store your toys for a period of time, 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.080
itâ€™s a good idea to remove the batteries.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.920
The battery device adapter consists of a two-sided 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.190
piece of copper, that is soldered onto a wire

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.330
connected to a jack.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.240
This is where you'll plug your switch in.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.560
They come in different sizes. A small one like 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.180
this will fit double A and triple A batteries. The

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.220
larger ones are available for C and D batteries.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.880
Battery device adapters can be purchased or

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.420
they can be home-made.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.910
To use the battery device adapter,

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.670
insert the copper plate between the battery and

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.920
a contact point. Like that.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.240
If you're finding that the copper plate is just a

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.660
little too big for the place it needs to fit

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.920
it's okay to make it smaller.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.650
It may be necessary to make a notch in the case

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.470
of the toy to make room for the wire so it won't

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.340
be cramped when you put the battery door on.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.870
After your battery device adapter is in place,

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.870
turn your toy on, plug your switch in, and

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.860
activate your toy. (music plays)
