Ever wonder where your delicious sweet oranges
came from? Well here in Florida they were

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.150
brought by the Conquistadors, the Spanish
sailors who originally came to Florida. My

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.849
name is Richard Skinner. I'm the owner of
Hawkins Nursery. We've been in the business

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.740
for about thirty years and the nursery and
family has been in citrus ever since eighteen

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:33.480
fifty five. North America, South America did
not have citrus. The Spanish sailors brought

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.730
seeds and planted.Why? Because they wanted
fruit to prevent scurvy on their return trip

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.750
to Spain. So consequently, not finding any
here they brought seeds to plant it for the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.710
next sailings that would go along for years.
Well, citrus has been in Florida and North

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.471
and South America ever since. The tree I'm
standing next to is a, we know is a Florida

00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:03.320
seedling but actually it originated from those
Spanish sailors. This is the same orange that

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.190
they brought. The trunk here has quite some
size to it because it's a hundred and five

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:22.310
years old. The citrus industry today, the
different varieties derive mostly off of this

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:33.740
in plain oranges now. The history goes back
to actually in southeast Asia most of the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.590
scientists think and then was brought by seedlings
and by cuttings all the way over in to the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.340
Mediterranean area which still has quite a
citrus industry in places like Sicily and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.030
Cypress and Italy and Egypt and all along
the Mediterranean there where we've got a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.509
semi-tropical climate which is great for citrus.
Some of the tropics like citrus but different

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:10.710
variety. You cannot grow citrus commercially
in temperate zones that get in to freezes.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:18.310
So consequently citrus is a winter fruit by
and large and we have many different varieties

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.460
today. But this one was the old timey one
that is basically where our history began

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.220
here in Florida. This is Richard Skinner and
this is the history of oranges.
