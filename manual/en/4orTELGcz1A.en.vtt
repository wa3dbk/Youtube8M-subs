[music]

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:04.680
Hello, I'm Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.680
[pause]

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.200
And welcome to DermTV.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.280
I’m often asked my opinion about mineral
makeup,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.440
and in general, they’re well received by
consumers,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.429
tend to be very light in nature, and are much
less likely

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:22.239
to cause a reaction or problem in women with
sensitive skin.

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:26.039
Mineral makeup usually refers to a foundation
in a loose powder format.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.579
While mineral makeup is not a new concept,

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.640
it’s become much more popular in the past
five years,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.129
particularly for foundations and blushes.

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.630
The main ingredients,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.570
titanium dioxide, mica, zinc oxide and bismuth
oxychloride

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.730
are not new ingredients and have been used
in makeup for decades.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.120
So for that reason, many traditional makeups
call themselves

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.159
mineral makeups… and consumers need to read
the label

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.290
on a makeup labeled as mineral makeup…

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.019
to ensure that the minerals are in fact

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.089
at the beginning of the ingredient deck…

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.050
which tells you that the makeup is composed
mostly of minerals.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.040
Real mineral makeup has several advantages.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.540
It can be reapplied without removing the residuals

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.500
of your previous makeup application.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.610
Because there are fewer cosmetic emollients,

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.000
perfumes and fragrances, they tend to be much
less irritating

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.340
for sensitive skin.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.860
The minerals tend to have

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.100
light-reflective properties, or confer an
appearance of translucency,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.219
which adds a brightness to the skin

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.250
and decreases the appearance of fine lines
and enlarged pores…

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.799
provided your skin has been regularly exfoliated…

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.630
but paradoxically, it actually exaggerates
those lines and pores

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.440
in some wearers who don’t exfoliate.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.119
While two of the ingredients in mineral makeup,

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.700
zinc oxide and titanium dioxide,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.570
are the main ingredients used in highly effective
chem-free sunscreens,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.780
there isn’t enough of those ingredients
in mineral makeups

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.590
to confer any effective sun protection, and
accordingly sunscreen

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.549
still has to be used when wearing mineral
makeup…

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.450
unless of course that makeup is labeled with
an appropriate SPF rating

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.310
and broad-spectrum protection.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.560
But since zinc oxide

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.960
and titanium dioxide have anti-inflammatory
properties,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.220
certain mineral makeups can also have a calming
effect on the skin,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.780
which is helpful for people with sensitive
skin or rosacea.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.410
Another advantage to mineral makeups is that,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.050
in addition to being appropriate for sensitive
skin,

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.620
they're usually compatible with all oil and
water skin types

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.440
since they’re non comedogenic.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.620
The bottom line is that mineral makeup is
another option that,

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:52.530
like all makeup, is a favorite of many consumers,
but certainly not all.
