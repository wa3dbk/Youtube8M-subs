Hi everyone and welcome to Nicko's Kitchen's fast food Friday

00:00:05.102 --> 00:00:11.303
Today we are going to be making one of 
 the world's most popular fast food dishes 

00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:15.956
and I am guessing nearly every single one of 
 you would have had this at some stage

00:00:15.956 --> 00:00:22.310
of course I am talking about Subways Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki Sub

00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:42.687
So guys the first thing I am going to do to 
  get started on our Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki 

00:00:42.687 --> 00:00:49.597
is make the marinade for our chicken so just into a bowl 
 am going to be adding in some soy sauce 

00:00:50.473 --> 00:00:52.742
next I am going to be adding some pineapple juice

00:00:52.742 --> 00:00:55.715
I am also going to be adding some garlic powder 

00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:59.761
and also some ground ginger

00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:02.395
 Next I am going to be adding some dry mustard 

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.975
also I am going to be adding some pepper 

00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:08.070
next I am going to be adding in some brown sugar 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.259
sugar and lastly I am going to be adding in some honey

00:01:11.295 --> 00:01:13.859
Now just grab a whisk and give that a good mix around 

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:21.240
so that brown sugar has dissolved and honey 
 has incorporated with rest of the ingredients

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.797
Now once we had mixed the marinade well

00:01:23.797 --> 00:01:26.258
we will be adding our chicken

00:01:26.258 --> 00:01:30.984
Now the chicken I have got here is just some 
 chicken breasts that I have cut up into strips

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:36.101
To save you a bit of time, if you wanted 
 to use the chicken tenderloins, go for it.

00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:42.690
So just add them straight in and just mix that marinade 
 all over that I get it all really coated well

00:01:42.692 --> 00:01:46.120
Now I want you to cover that with some cling film

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.550
and I want to put it into the fridge for forty minutes.

00:01:50.554 --> 00:01:57.270
For forty minutes and in the mean time we are 
 going to get started on our sweet onion dressing

00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:02.680
So like I said we are going to 
 get started on our sweet onion dressing

00:02:02.681 --> 00:02:09.040
so again just into a bowl I am going to be adding 
 in some onion that I have just  finally chopped up

00:02:09.037 --> 00:02:13.440
next I am going to be adding in some red wine vinegar

00:02:13.437 --> 00:02:16.430
next I am going to be adding in some white vinegar 

00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:20.630
and I am also going to be adding in some balsamic vinegar

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.740
and again I am going to be adding some brown sugar

00:02:23.738 --> 00:02:30.990
and the next ingredient is a little quirky but trust me 
 it's going to be needed is some milk powder

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.760
I am going to season with some salt and pepper

00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:38.360
, next I will be squeezing in some fresh lemon juice,

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:40.740
next is some garlic powder,

00:02:40.945 --> 00:02:44.700
of course I am going to be adding in some poppy seeds 

00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:48.590
and lastly guys I am going to be adding in some corn syrup.

00:02:48.586 --> 00:02:55.350
But before I add it in is that I want you to put 
 it in a microwave safe cup and put it in the microwave

00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:58.880
for twenty five to thirty seconds on high.

00:02:59.352 --> 00:03:03.390
So once it's nice and running we are going 
 to be adding in to our mix. 

00:03:04.371 --> 00:03:16.930
Now just give that a good mix around and that is our sweet onion 
 sauce that's going to go on our subs, so just like that. 

00:03:16.926 --> 00:03:18.660
Now we are going to put it aside,

00:03:18.663 --> 00:03:21.390
leave it to cool down to room temperature

00:03:21.393 --> 00:03:24.950
and now let's get started in cooking our chicken. 

00:03:24.952 --> 00:03:31.030
So let's start cooking our chicken, so just into a 
 large pan on a medium to high heat 

00:03:31.028 --> 00:03:34.470
I am going to be putting our marinated chicken straight in.

00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:39.780
It want to Sizzle out . So obviously we 
 want to cook these all right through. 

00:03:39.776 --> 00:03:45.020
So they are going to need about two and 
 a half to three minutes each side 

00:03:45.023 --> 00:03:50.980
depending on how thick your tenderloins are or the breast pieces are chopped up.

00:03:50.983 --> 00:03:57.890
So our chicken is done, its ready to rock 
 and roll so let's start making our subs.

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:03.920
So in assembling our sub, guys, all you have 
 to do is grab some of these rolls.

00:04:03.923 --> 00:04:10.770
You can use any roll that you like, homemade, white, 
 multigrain it is completely up to you. 

00:04:10.768 --> 00:04:15.230
If you want to use longer ones like 
 a foot long, just go for it.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.350
Now I am just going to keep this really really 
 simple, you put the salads you want. 

00:04:19.346 --> 00:04:21.350
I am just going to start with some tomato,

00:04:21.353 --> 00:04:23.440
some lettuce,

00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:24.910
some red onion

00:04:24.906 --> 00:04:26.580
and I am going to be adding on our chicken 

00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:33.650
and lastly of course I am going to be adding our sweet onion sauce.

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:38.900
So guys just check that out, let's get stuck in. 

00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:50.350
Guys please give this one a go, it is so 
 easy to do and the flavors are amazing. 

00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:53.630

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.890
