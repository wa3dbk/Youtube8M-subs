00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.370
My name is David Handley, I'm with the University
of Maine Cooperative Extension, and we're

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.260
here to talk about how to prune and train
a young grapevine.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.350
This is a vine that was planted last spring.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.100
We got it from a dormant plant, or rooted
cutting, and you can see the original part

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.380
of the planting right here.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.099
This is what we got from the nursery, with
a good root system under it.

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.880
We planted it, and we had a bud break and
some vine growth.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.670
This is last year's growth right here.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.280
This was a green shoot.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.570
Typically, you may get more than one shoot
developing.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.400
You may have several buds on here.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.590
We want to prune this back to one strong vine,
your strongest one.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.040
We're going to arrange for that to be tied
up to a trellis, because this particular vine

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.480
is what's going to become our permanent trunk,
or the permanent part of the plant that's

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.850
going to be with us for the life of the planting.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.330
We want to make sure it's the strongest of
the vines that we can choose from.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.790
Any other one that developed that's very weak,
we can just cut that out, select our best

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.790
one.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.000
The time of year to make these cuts are when
the canes are dormant, and this is going to

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.800
be really any time after the new year, until
they bud out in late March, early April.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.880
We hope in the first year that we get enough
good growth that we can tie it to the lower

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.150
trellis wire.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.110
Typically here in Maine, we're going to be
pruning to either a four arm kniffin training

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.479
system, or an umbrella kniffin training system.

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.150
Those trellises consist of two wires, one
set at about two and a half feet, and a second

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.140
wire set at about five feet.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.600
We hope in the first year that we're going
to get enough good growth to reach at least

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.799
the bottom wire, but in order to make sure
it's growing straight, you can see we supported

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.900
this with a small bamboo pole.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.950
Any kind of planting stake will work, and
we just tie that vine up as it grows, rather

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.280
than let it grow along the ground where it
can get rot problems, and not develop a nice

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.070
straight growth like we want.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.860
We tie it up, just like you'd tie up a beef
steak tomato, get the growth that you want.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.030
As I said, we've got pretty good buds here,
reaching up to the first wire.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.130
You can see that I actually make it to the
top wire, but you can see the growth up here

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.439
is very scrawny and spindly, and isn't really
going to lead to a good, strong trunk.

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:17.360
I'd rather actually start new growth for reaching
to this top wire for next year.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.450
What that means is that I'm actually going
to cut this off here, rather low, to try to

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.340
get this bud here to break and give me a much
stronger shoot to develop my trunk to the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.790
top wire next year.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.520
I can just take that there, and then, instead
of using the bamboo pole this year, I can

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.400
just tie it to the wire.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.080
This bud will hopefully break, and give me
a good, strong shoot, that I'm going to reach

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.150
the second wire next year.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.390
Of course, these buds lower down will also
break, and if this one happens to be weak,

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.310
I may select one of these.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.950
But, if this bud does turn out to be a strong
shoot, I'll be cutting these off next winter

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.460
and getting my single trunk back up to the
top wire.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.160
Next year, when this does reach the top wire,
eventually what we'll be doing is taking one

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.160
year old cane, and either draping it over
this top wire and connecting it to the bottom

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.520
wire in an umbrella kniffin, or we'll be taking
one cane at the top wire on each side, and

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.660
one cane at the bottom wire on each side,
to create four arms of one year old growth,

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.690
for a four\uc0\u8209 arm kniffin system.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.970
Both systems work pretty well for concrete
type grapes here in a cold climate like Maine.
