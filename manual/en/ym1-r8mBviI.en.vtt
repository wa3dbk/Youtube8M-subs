00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.850
Well I have been away for a little while and
that is because my wife and I decided it was

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.250
time to sell the old house and buy the new
one. As you can see I have a slightly different

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.279
set up behind me. Now, this house was a forclosure
so it required a little bit more work to make

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.180
it habital really. One of the first thing
that my wife and I decided that we wanted

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.200
to do here was to get the garden beds up and
running. Now that was a difficult task because

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.620
the backyard was really a jungle. So I had
to bring in a company and they just laid waste

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.070
to everything back there. That was a good
thing because now its sort of a clean slate.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.850
There is no grass because of the canopy that
was back their. But it was a bad thing because,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.900
well I had to dig up all the roots from all
the tree that we had to take out. But after

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.570
that was done, I laid down a couple of garden
beds and I thought well while I am at it why

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.170
don't I just make a garden planter as well
for the kids. I kept the design on this simple

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.739
and easy to assemble. Anybody can do it. For
a complete list of cuts and materials used,

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.490
go to my website, simply easy diy dot com.
The first thing I did, set up a stop block

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.990
on the miter saw. I am making mine out of
cedar but, you are the boss of your shop.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.990
Make out of anything you want. Cut all the
side and bottom slates. 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:45.079
There are a lot of these for which I will not bore you wit;h...so...on
we go. I am going to lay my sides out. 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.960
Take a measurement for the bottom rails. 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.480
Back to
the miter saw.

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.919
 Always, always, always check that first cut.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.279
Now these pieces that I just
cut these are going to be the top and bottom rails. 

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:09.219
I am going to rip them in half on the
table saw.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.900
Alright so lets assemble the sides.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.920
Lay the rails down on the work surface. Then
the side pieces.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.740
Mark an inch and a half in from the sides.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.400
Line up my side pieces flush
with the top rail, and attach.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.890
Mark three quarters of an inch from the bottom of the
bottom rail and again...attach. 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.120
Just FYI I happen to be using one and a quarter inch
screws for this. 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.580
The long sides require only the three quarter of an inch measurement from
the bottom rail. 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.060
Otherwise just attach flush with the top. 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.340
Now the fun part, time for assembly.
Place the lsides top side down. 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.320
and then attach with two inch screws. 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.600
Since the bottom of
the planter is already facing up,  

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.230
all I have to do is place the bottom slates in place.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.800
After drilling a few drainage holes, its time to play in the dirt.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.540
