00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.380
Now if you have back pain, if you have a disc
problem like a herniated disc or protruded

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.290
disc or if you have a nerve problem like sciatic
nerve that's causing nit pain in your hips,

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.740
in your legs, also numbness, problems with
sensation and circulation in your legs then

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.570
you should be using the pain therapy together
with the decompression belt.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.052
Alright you can read up more on our website.

00:00:26.052 --> 00:00:31.789
Now the decompression belt helps to support
your back but more importantly and also the

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.050
second function, it actually helps to traction
your back.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.780
It helps to stretch your back, the muscles
deep inside so it gets its normal length and

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.600
it takes the pressure off your disc to allow
the disc to absorb moisture so the disc can

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.010
expand because it creates this vacuum in your
disk.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.850
And because of that your nerves will not be
pinched and then you'll have less pain okay

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.239
so this is very important.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.350
So the pain therapy, i recommend you use it
first for about 20-30 minutes to relax the

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.220
muscle, reduce the pain then right afterwards
you put the decompression belt on to help

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.210
stretch your back to help to restore normal
back muscle and disc function.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.049
Alright now this is very easy to use, you
just basically, it comes with a hand pump,

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.540
we're just going to put together the air valves.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.259
So screw the air valves together and then
I'm gonna turn around here, here i'll show

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.119
you what happens when I pump this up okay,
the belt actually rises against my back.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.110
See, every time I pump it gets higher and
higher.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.560
And what it does, it actually lifts my upper
body weight off my lower back, taking the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.350
pressure off, so, because it offers a very
strong support, it acts like a barrel to you

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.890
know, support the core and improve my posture.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.619
You actually get lifted up a little bit and
you stand taller.

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.509
But more importantly, with time, 20-30 minutes
okay, the inside of your back start to do

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.509
this, it starts to expand vertically, all
the pressure coming off your back and it just

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.479
feels so good if you have circulation problems
in your legs or if you have chronic back problems

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.280
or your back always feels tense, this is something
you should be using together with your pain

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.610
therapy system.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.290
Try it and you're going to see incredible
results.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.954
Now this belt is very easy to use.

00:02:18.954 --> 00:02:23.880
You just have to pump it up and it will increase
in height by about 3 inches.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.080
What is does, it helps to support your back
while helping to stretch your tight muscles

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.330
and to decompress the spinal disc.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.170
You can use this belt anywhere; while you're
standing for a long time its great, when you're

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.450
walking, driving, especially those bumpy rides
on a motorcycle or terrain.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.000
Now what I love about it, is that you can
use it in the office while you're sitting

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.210
in front of your computer, all day long.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.466
It just gives you great support, it helps
you to stretch out your muscles, take the

00:02:48.466 --> 00:02:53.100
pressure off your disc so you get better circulation,
from your back, all the way down your leg.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.740
You can use it while doing household work,
doing dishes, laundry, while you're bending

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:06.920
over okay, anytime you need support, anytime
you need relief this belt can help you.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.800
Its very and its very powerful and very effective
okay.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.440
There's no drugs involved so its totally portable,
you can use it while doing household work.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.250
Imagine, anytime you need support for lifting,
gardening, while you're excising you can use

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.480

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.950
Life is short, you want to be active and you
want to be able to relax at the end of the

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.950
day.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.490
Okay you can do it while you're sitting down,
while you're relaxing or especially those

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.160
of you who are having trouble lying down.

This belt is perfect, it relaxes your back,
it allows you to sleep better, without the

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.250
aches and pains when you use it.

for support, any time you have pain or tension

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.490
just pump it up, lie down, relax for 20 up
to 30 minutes, it will slowly stretch everything

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.330
out, take all the pressure off and you're
gonna feel..
