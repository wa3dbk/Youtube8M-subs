00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.040
(Narrator) I am Stefan Immler, an astrophysicist

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.060
at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. I'd like to 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.100
take you on a tour of two nearby galaxies in our cosmic neighborhood,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.170
the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, as captured in ultraviolet light

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.200
by NASA's Swift satellite. These images are the highest-resolution

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.240
wide-field surveys of the galaxies at ultraviolet wavelengths.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.320
Both of these galaxies are less then 200,000 light

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.350
years away, and each contains a few hundred million stars

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.390
like our sun. If you live or travelled to the Southern Hemisphere, you'll

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.460
see both of these galaxies as faint cloudy patches in the night

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.490
sky. Both galaxies orbit our own as well as each other.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.530
Of the two, the LMC is physically larger and nearer

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.600
to us than the SMC. Their messy shapes are products of gravitational 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.620
interactions between them, tidal forces from the much bigger Milky Way, and

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.680
internal processes like star formation. In visible light,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.770
we see a mix of sun-like stars, along with pink patches that 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.800
mark star-formation regions, where hydrogen gas is set aglow by the light

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.860
of young stars. These are especially prominent in the LMC.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.970
Viewed at higher energies, in the UV, the LMC looks

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.020
very different. This wavelength blocks out the older stars, 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.090
mostly showing those less than 500 million years old.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.110
These galaxies are relatively small, but they're also very

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.150
close to us. This means that they appear much larger than the field of view

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.230
of Swift's telescope. So we had to take many different observations and

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.260
stitch them together. Swift had to image 172 separate

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.310
fields in 2,200 short snapshots to take in

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.390
the whole galaxy. The LMC's most striking feature 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.400
is the dramatic Tarantula Nebula. This is the most active

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.440
star factory in any of the dozens of galaxies in

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.530
the Local Group, which includes the Milk Way and Andromeda.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.540
Thousands of stars form each year within cool, dark

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.590
molecular clouds. Once they start shining, they blow off their 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.680
birth cloud with powerful outflows called stellar winds.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.700
These winds, in turn, sculpt the gases into the Tarantula's

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.750
spider-like shape. One star here, named R136a1,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.810
is one of the most massive known, weighing more than 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.840
260 times the sun. The LMC holds more than 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.890
a thousand star clusters formed during previous rounds of star formation.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.960
We mostly see hot, young, luminous stars, plus a few stars

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.990
in exotic stages as they near stellar death.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.050
Wherever there are hot, young and massive stars there are also 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.130
supernovae. In 1987, the closest stellar explosion

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.170
in more than 400 years occurred in the outskirts, of the Tarantula Nebula.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.230
Even 26 years later, the after glow of the explosion

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.240
remains detectable in the ultraviolet.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.280
All told, the new Swift mosaics reveal about a million objects

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.360
in the LMC and about 250,000 objects in the

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.380
smaller, less massive and more distant SMC.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.420
For this mosaic of the SMC, Swift imaged about

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.510
50 fields and took 656 snapshots.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.530
One interesting feature is the massive young

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.560
star cluster NGC 346. It contains

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.630
the SMC's brightest star, HD 5980, 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.640
a triple star system where all members among the most luminous

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.690
stars known. The intense light and strong outflows from these stars

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.760
mold the surrounding gas into a shape resembling a cobweb.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.800
The Swift UV mosaics allow 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.850
us to study the evolution of young stars in the LMC and SMC

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.940
all in one view. That's impossible for us to do for our own galaxy

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.970
because we're inside it. The images

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.030
give us a panoramic window into how stars are born, evolve and die 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.120
across two complete galaxies. That gives us fresh

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.150
insight into the many ways stars transformed the universe

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.210
into what we see around us today.
