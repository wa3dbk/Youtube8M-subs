00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300
Hi, everybody.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.660
I am comedian Drew...Drew...Drew  Lynch.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.460
I have a stutter and...and... I have...I have...I have a....

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.190
Stella!   Boop!

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.849
What are you talk...what are you talk...talking about? My...my...my shirt.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.380
No!  Orange ...orange is...orange is the new Beyonce.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.920
&lt;&lt;laughs&gt;&gt;

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.800
I want to thank you guys for all of your... all of your...kind words

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.260
about my performance on America's Got Talent

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.640
Apparently, I hit people right... right in... right in... the... in the... in the "feels"... like I'm on "Wanted for Emotional Assault"

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.920
&lt;Bon Jovi sings..."I'm wanted...." &gt;

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.480
While my performance may have been... may have moved you, that doesn't mean that I'm perfect.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.640
&lt;Bon Jovi sings..."Ohh I ride..." &gt;

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.840
Nobody's perfect.  That's what my AGT episode was about.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.880
Was admitting that I was... I was... I wasn't perfect.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.860
and embracing exact... exactly what I... what I have I?

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.400
I drink soda.. I say... I say... I say... I say swear... swear... swear... swear words

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.979
I drink...drink alcohol.

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.849
&lt;&lt;Jamie Foxx sings..."Girl, what you drinking?  Go on let it sink in." &gt;&gt;

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.960
I get...I get crazy with bottle of Pinot Noir.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.580
More like Pinot no... no... no... no... no... no more.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.440
&lt;&lt; laughs &gt;&gt;

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.740
That was way to...to...to sassy b*tch.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.700
Oop!  There's the swear word.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.300
I had to take down a picture on... on...Instagram

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.100
because someone thought

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.600
I photoshopped a picture of me smoking a cigar.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.940
No, it's just... It's just so much easier to

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.620
to smoke the cigar.  Not ...not... not every day.  Not..not every week.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.400
But occasionally, I'm like...

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.636
Hey, I want to feel like I'm... I'm...in the Mafia.

00:02:03.636 --> 00:02:05.360
"Give me all your bones!"

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.500
Who's your boss?  Is it Ron...Ron...Ron the poodle?

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.780
See?  It hurts. yaa!

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.140
These are the things out there that people do...

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.680
that make them...them  human?

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.380
Every person in the pub... in the public eye should be able to live... live... live their.. their life.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.780
&lt;&lt;Rhianna sings..."So live your life..ayy ayy.ayyy ayy ayy..ay."&gt;&gt;

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.820
Want to know about other imperfections that I... that I have?

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.720
There's ...there's a... there's a gap in my teeth.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.260
I'm like Eddie...Eddie Murphy.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.660
