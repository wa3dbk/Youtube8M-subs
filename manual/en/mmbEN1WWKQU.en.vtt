00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.960
A template is a predesigned page layout that
you can use to create new documents with the

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.530
same formatting.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.680
Templates make it easy for you to create documents
because the big design decisions such as page

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.590
layout, fonts, and margins have been made.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.150
To open an existing template, click the Microsoft
Office Button, and select New.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.460
The New Document dialog box appears.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.019
Here you can select Blank document to create
a document from scratch, or you can look at

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:42.059
templates.

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.570
Templates are available in two locations - installed
on your computer or through the Microsoft

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.820
Office website.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.530
There are many templates installed with your
version of Word and hundreds more available

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.940
online.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.330
Let's take a quick look at the online templates.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.689
To access those, all I need to do is click
any of the categories under the Microsoft

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.290
Office Online heading.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.930
As you can see, there are many types of templates.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.280
We have brochures, calendars, flyers and more.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.650
To look at any category, simply left-click
it.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.110
Word uses your browser to connect to Microsoft
Office online and displays the templates that

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.520
are available there.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.470
Once you find one that you like click Download
and follow the instructions that appear.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.900
To use a template that is already installed
on your computer, left-click Installed Templates

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.790
and the templates appear in the window.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.530
I want to work on my resume, so let's look
for a resume template that we like.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.940
I like this one.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:05.940
To select it, simply left-click the template
and click Create.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.190
The template opens in the Word window.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.890
Now I'm ready to get to work.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.010
Templates come prefilled with placeholder
text that is surrounded by brackets.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.781
Often, this placeholder text gives us information
about what content should be included in a

00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:23.100
certain area.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:31.220
For example, it shows me here that I should
include my phone number and address.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.870
Word also prefills some information.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.900
We can see that Word has prefilled my name
in this area.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.700
How does Word know what information to place
there?

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.060
This is based on information stored in Word
when your computer is initially set up.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.770
If the information there is not correct, you
can simply replace the text, or you can change

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.790
it so that it will appear correctly in additional
templates you use.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.980
To change this information, click the Microsoft
Office Button and click Word Options.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.980
In the dialog box that appears, make sure
the Popular section is highlighted.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.790
Change the user name.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:20.820
I'm going to change the first letter in my
first name to a capital J and the first letter

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:28.800
in my last name to a capital D. Then, I can
simply click OK.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.490
I'm ready to enter some text.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.350
Place your insertion point near the text you
want to replace.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.040
Notice how it's highlighted and has this little
tag on the end?

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.790
In templates, placeholder text is held in
table cells.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.319
In templates, there is no need to delete placeholder
text it simply disappears as you type.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.500
All you have to do now is type the text you
want to appear.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.489
Sometimes templates give you other options
that can change the way the template appears.

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.270
You'll know that a template has extra options
when you see a drop-down arrow beside a section.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.670
Here, beside Resume Name, we have a Quick
Parts section.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.239
Click the drop-down arrow to see the menu.

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.780
The template gives you two choices of how
to format the top of this resume template.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.300
We can choose to do it with a photo or without
a photo.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.629
Left-click one of the options to change the
template.

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:30.749
Hmm...

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:38.009
My picture looks pretty neat here, but I think
the standard resume doesn't include a photo.

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:43.639
Remember, just because you can do something
or a template includes something, doesn't

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.409
mean that you should use it.

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.770
Let's hit Undo and go back to the template
without the photo.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:58.949
I'm going to go ahead and fill in the rest
of my text and then save my document as My

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.199
Resume.

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.500
Spend some time exploring the Word templates,
and then take a closer look at the Origin

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.569
Resume to see how templates work.
