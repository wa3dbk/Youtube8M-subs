00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
Hi everybody! Coach Dom Costa again with

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.670
another edition of Damn Trick Sets/Trick

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.940
Plays! A classic! A lot of different ways

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.950
to run and put your personnel in it-the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.670
old "Swinging Gate"! Why it's kind of

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.730
effective? There's a lot of reasons!

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.800
For you folks who are passive aggressive

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.449
coaches, it's kind of nice to have this

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.420
in because you make that other teams got

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.010
to use some of their defensive time

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.519
during the week to set up and you got to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.439
get your scout team to go do it, and not

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.850
only do they have to do it, you got to

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.469
spend time to teach them to do it, and

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.090
then you got to show it to your defense

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.520
a bunch of times. I've seen it where the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.950
quarterback is literally a very athletic

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.600
person and just by simply spreading the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.329
defense out like this, you create a lot

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.410
of space between this tackle and this Z

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.539
receiver where the quarterback can

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.969
easily go in on a two-point conversion

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.270
from the 3-yard line. I've seen that the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.010
pass over on the right with the Y

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.760
slanting, the "A" doing an out or a fade, the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.560
Z wheeling. I've also seen it

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.990
first sound with a quick pass either

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.850
taken from the tee but usually from

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.670
shotgun, quickly over to the "B"back

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.990
over on the left, the x or q,

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.280
whatever you want to name them is all

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.590
the way on the left. I've also seen them

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.090
do another pass pattern with this

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.340
gentleman over here as well. So there's a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.520
lot of little options here but again the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.650
best that I've seen it done is when you

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.430
had a very athletic quarterback. I would

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.009
have to go back to a quarterback that

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.970
was at Locke High School in Los Angeles

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.829
back in the day named Darian Hagan when

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.229
he played at Locke High school. This was

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.880
a pretty good play for him. He ended up

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.579
going to Colorado and he was a Heisman

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.159
Trophy candidate and we found out why

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.590
later. Well at least we understood why

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.930
because we had to face him in high

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.460
school and that guy was such a dynamic

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.450
runner ball-handling type young person.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.200
So when you have an athletic quarterback

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.849
and you give him a bunch of options of

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.930
either rolling and throwing or taking

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.500
off and running or the first sound, throw

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.250
it over to the "B" back  and most of all

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.680
making that poor "D" coordinator spend

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.840
some "D" time teaching the scout team on

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.209
how to line up and having to run it or

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.209
repeatedly. It's just an annoying thing

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.250
and sometimes as a coach it's good to

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.569
have some annoying things in your

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.450
package and it's also fun for your own

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.700
team to practice it. They just dig it!!!

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.859
Anyway like, share, comment, subscribe!

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.200
Thank you for all your ideas that you

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.859
message me! I love it! I get more ideas

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.599
all the time and go out there coach and

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.669
have a good time and get some points off

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:55.919
of this and you "D" coaches get ready!
