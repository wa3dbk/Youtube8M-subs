00:00:00.122 --> 00:00:01.886
- Hey guys, it's everybody's favorite day.

00:00:01.886 --> 00:00:02.594
What day is it?

00:00:02.594 --> 00:00:03.430
Tunesday.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.857
And today I'm joined by
very special guest (gasp)

00:00:05.857 --> 00:00:06.948
SUPERFRUIT.

00:00:06.948 --> 00:00:07.726
- It's us

00:00:07.726 --> 00:00:09.201
(laughter)

00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:10.396
- Oh good, did we get it right?

00:00:10.396 --> 00:00:13.067
- Are either of you familiar
with the concept of Tunesday?

00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:15.029
- Um, vaguely.

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.409
- So you know how YouTubers
always answer people's questions

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:19.394
and like, none of us
are experts about life

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:20.509
or anything like that.

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:21.449
- Yeah, well we pretend to be.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.540
- Right, exactly.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.748
Well if we're going to
be answering questions,

00:00:23.748 --> 00:00:25.745
we might as well do it
over royalty free tracks

00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:27.150
and make them into catchy songs.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.078
- That's brilliant.

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:28.879
- For those of you that don't know,

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:31.689
we just got our two fifths of
the amazing a cappella group,

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:32.560
Pentatonix.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.187
- Yay.

00:00:33.187 --> 00:00:34.325
- Let's go.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:35.171
- Yay.

00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:37.494
- filthyignoramus asks how
to stop eating chocolate

00:00:37.494 --> 00:00:39.793
and feeling miserable after a break up.

00:00:39.793 --> 00:00:41.430
(concerned moaning)

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.428
- Tough one.

00:00:42.428 --> 00:00:44.228
- Oh, that's actually how I
just warm up my vocal cords.

00:00:44.228 --> 00:00:45.203
Ooh.

00:00:45.203 --> 00:00:47.708
- Oh oh oh.

00:00:47.708 --> 00:00:49.135
(humming)

00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:50.006
(playful music)

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:53.872
- ♫Oh, I'm sad.

00:00:53.872 --> 00:00:56.217
- ♫Step one, no more sugar.

00:00:56.217 --> 00:00:58.110
♫Step two, hydrate please.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.851
♫Step three...

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.347
- ♫You need to watch some...

00:01:02.347 --> 00:01:03.357
- ♫TV.

00:01:03.357 --> 00:01:03.984
(laughter)

00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:05.319
- ♫Some comforting TV♫

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:06.295
(laughter)

00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:08.262
- You guys are such pretty singers.

00:01:08.262 --> 00:01:08.820
- Thank you.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.621
- But not (mumbles)

00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:11.430
- Okay, okay, now talk about hydration.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.567
Why is that good for break ups?

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:14.158
- Hydration is important because

00:01:14.158 --> 00:01:17.896
I feel like literally
whenever I don't feel on,

00:01:17.896 --> 00:01:19.034
I just drink a ton of water.

00:01:19.034 --> 00:01:19.905
- Uh, me too.

00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:20.903
Same thing with your singing voice,

00:01:20.903 --> 00:01:22.540
it's always 100 times better
if you drink a lot of water.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.272
- Yeah.

00:01:23.272 --> 00:01:25.640
- So lydie114 asks how to stay positive.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.546
- Ooh.

00:01:26.546 --> 00:01:30.186
(depressing music)

00:01:30.186 --> 00:01:34.078
- ♫How to stay positive

00:01:34.078 --> 00:01:38.212
♫It's not always easy to do

00:01:38.212 --> 00:01:41.927
♫But if you're in great company

00:01:41.927 --> 00:01:45.096
♫Than things are looking up for you♫

00:01:45.096 --> 00:01:45.630
- Wow.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.188
- That's good.

00:01:46.188 --> 00:01:46.966
- That was a good one.

00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:48.405
- That was just a rhyme.

00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:49.817
My advice was make some friends.

00:01:49.817 --> 00:01:50.665
(laughter)

00:01:50.665 --> 00:01:51.361
Okay, next.

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:51.760
- Stunning.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.271
- Now you guys are getting it,

00:01:52.271 --> 00:01:53.633
we're getting into the groove.

00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:57.069
stuckasamaniac for
septum piercing emotions?

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.705
I'm going to try and pick you
what's a rough sounding track?

00:01:59.705 --> 00:02:00.262
(laughter)

00:02:00.262 --> 00:02:01.470
Whiskey on the Mississippi?

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.073
- There we go.

00:02:02.073 --> 00:02:05.835
(bluegrass music)
(snapping)

00:02:05.835 --> 00:02:06.555
- I'll do your backgrounds.

00:02:06.555 --> 00:02:07.321
- Okay.

00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:09.283
♫I was real nervous walking in

00:02:09.283 --> 00:02:11.988
♫But the piercer gave me a smile,

00:02:11.988 --> 00:02:14.589
♫She said here's a needle,
put it in your nose

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:16.830
♫And leave it there for awhile♫

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.190
(laughter)

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.807
- That was good.

00:02:18.807 --> 00:02:19.527
- That was my emotions.

00:02:19.527 --> 00:02:20.195
- Those were your emotions?

00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:21.263
- There wasn't really emotions.

00:02:21.263 --> 00:02:25.768
- Was it like ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

00:02:25.768 --> 00:02:26.592
- Is it sore today?

00:02:26.592 --> 00:02:27.173
- Yeah.

00:02:27.173 --> 00:02:28.032
- But worth it?

00:02:28.032 --> 00:02:28.566
- Yeah.

00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:29.344
- Have you ever had your septum pierced?

00:02:29.344 --> 00:02:29.742
- God, no.

00:02:29.742 --> 00:02:31.135
Okay Scott, this one's for you.

00:02:31.135 --> 00:02:33.271
It's easy, much easier
than septum piercing.

00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:34.281
(laughter)

00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:34.908
- Yeah.

00:02:34.908 --> 00:02:37.010
- graffiti_to_infinite asks what is love?

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.809
(somber music)

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:42.211
- Ooh. That's a nice chord there.

00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:44.716
- Where's she going?

00:02:44.716 --> 00:02:46.724
- Places.

00:02:46.724 --> 00:02:50.196
- ♫What is love

00:02:50.196 --> 00:02:52.897
♫Love is when you're
with your best friends♫

00:02:52.897 --> 00:02:54.325
- That's us.

00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:56.264
- ♫And they're here for you,

00:02:56.264 --> 00:02:58.028
♫To drink with you

00:02:58.028 --> 00:03:00.164
♫And have a lot of fun♫

00:03:00.164 --> 00:03:05.164
(laughter)

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:10.384
- ♫Love is drinking and
having a great time♫

00:03:11.844 --> 00:03:14.723
- And that's it, that's all.

00:03:14.723 --> 00:03:15.956
- Can I tell you something that I found?

00:03:15.956 --> 00:03:17.918
I found that the people
who have the hardest time

00:03:17.918 --> 00:03:19.822
with Tunesday are musicians.

00:03:19.822 --> 00:03:20.321
- Really?

00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:20.571
- Really?

00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:23.352
- Yeah, actual musicians
have the hardest time.

00:03:23.352 --> 00:03:25.024
- And we've had like 50
song writing sessions

00:03:25.024 --> 00:03:26.893
in the last two months,
but for some reason,

00:03:26.893 --> 00:03:28.263
that's all we can come up with.

00:03:28.263 --> 00:03:30.062
So _kateomalley_ says
what was the best advice

00:03:30.062 --> 00:03:31.363
you've ever been given by someone

00:03:31.363 --> 00:03:33.162
and who was it from?

00:03:33.162 --> 00:03:34.689
- Ooh.

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:36.998
Okay here we go.

00:03:36.998 --> 00:03:38.461
If I keep leaning forward and laughing.

00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:40.109
- The more you do this,
the better it will be.

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.010
- ♫The best advice I was given came to me

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.520
♫Was from my sister

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.714
♫Her name is Naomi

00:03:47.714 --> 00:03:49.781
♫And she said two things

00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:52.486
♫She said just two things

00:03:52.486 --> 00:03:55.620
♫She were add Tabasco sauce chicken wings♫

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.025
(laughter)

00:03:57.025 --> 00:03:58.233
- That's good advice.

00:03:58.233 --> 00:03:59.724
That is life changing.

00:03:59.724 --> 00:04:01.094
- One for the keychain too.

00:04:01.094 --> 00:04:03.404
- Yeah, Tabasco sauce
on chicken wings guys.

00:04:03.404 --> 00:04:06.028
But actually my big sister
did give me the best advice.

00:04:06.028 --> 00:04:09.075
She said to be honest and be kind.

00:04:09.075 --> 00:04:10.839
Yeah, which is tough, 'cause it's like

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:12.365
I feel like people are often choosing

00:04:12.365 --> 00:04:13.445
between those two things.

00:04:13.445 --> 00:04:15.302
About whether or not to
be kind or to be honest.

00:04:15.302 --> 00:04:16.080
- Oh that is true.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.147
- So good advice is to
be honest and be kind.

00:04:18.147 --> 00:04:22.814
VG C Love or VG Clove asks--

00:04:22.814 --> 00:04:23.917
(laughter)

00:04:23.917 --> 00:04:24.556
- Could be either.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:25.624
- We'll never know.

00:04:25.624 --> 00:04:26.761
- Could be either, we'll never know.

00:04:26.761 --> 00:04:28.758
Asks, how does one survive high school.

00:04:28.758 --> 00:04:32.590

00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:58.886
I feel like we had a lot
of anxiety in high school.

00:04:58.886 --> 00:05:00.012
We were really nerdy.

00:05:00.012 --> 00:05:01.417
But the thing is, we grew into ourselves

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:02.950
and now we're not worried about that.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.262
- You guys were friends in high school?

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:05.725
- Yeah, we've been friends
since we were like eight.

00:05:05.725 --> 00:05:06.560
- No way.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.536
- Yeah.

00:05:07.536 --> 00:05:09.765
- Do you guys talk to anybody
else from high school?

00:05:09.765 --> 00:05:12.029
- Um, yeah, well Kirstie is in our band

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:13.503
and she went to high school with us too.

00:05:13.503 --> 00:05:15.175
- You guys were like a high school band.

00:05:15.175 --> 00:05:16.301
Are you guys from Glee?

00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:17.474
(laughter)

00:05:17.474 --> 00:05:18.646
- No, we're not.

00:05:18.646 --> 00:05:20.672

00:05:22.843 --> 00:05:25.781
And layered parts, we're not from Glee.

00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:27.081
- We're alternative.

00:05:27.081 --> 00:05:28.684
- Yeah, I have a septum piercing.

00:05:28.684 --> 00:05:29.717
(laughter)

00:05:29.717 --> 00:05:32.317
Now, here's a really
special part of Tunesday

00:05:32.317 --> 00:05:34.686
'cause I've recently just
started awarding people

00:05:34.686 --> 00:05:36.358
best Tunesday ever awards.

00:05:36.358 --> 00:05:37.356
- Whoa.

00:05:37.356 --> 00:05:38.587
- Yeah, and you guys
are actually the first,

00:05:38.587 --> 00:05:41.095
and probably only,
recipients of this award.

00:05:41.095 --> 00:05:42.093
- Oh my god.

00:05:42.093 --> 00:05:42.957
- So, let me just grab it real quick.

00:05:42.957 --> 00:05:43.665
- Okay, yeah.

00:05:43.665 --> 00:05:46.474
- So the award is an actual Grammy.

00:05:46.474 --> 00:05:47.037
(laughter)

00:05:47.037 --> 00:05:48.697
- That's pretty cool

00:05:48.697 --> 00:05:50.102
The sax is beautiful.

00:05:50.102 --> 00:05:51.426
- Yeah, it's from 2014

00:05:51.426 --> 00:05:53.481
for Best Arrangement
Instrumental A Cappella.

00:05:53.481 --> 00:05:55.907
- Oh my god, wait, do we get to keep this?

00:05:55.907 --> 00:05:57.103
- Yeah, you have to share it

00:05:57.103 --> 00:05:58.612
with the other members of Panatonix.

00:05:58.612 --> 00:05:59.382
- Okay.
- Oh wow.

00:05:59.382 --> 00:06:01.286
- But here's a real Grammy.

00:06:01.286 --> 00:06:03.589
I might just hold on to it just
for one more second though.

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:05.551
- Okay, cool, we'll just pick it up later.

00:06:05.551 --> 00:06:06.248
(laughter)

00:06:06.248 --> 00:06:07.490
- [Hannah] Maybe, yeah.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.359
I'll also be borrowing your cars.

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:10.660
- Oh okay.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.321
- [Hannah] Bye dudes.

00:06:11.321 --> 00:06:11.995

00:06:11.995 --> 00:06:13.434

00:06:14.027 --> 00:06:16.035
(laughter)

00:06:16.035 --> 00:06:17.161
- She left.

00:06:17.161 --> 00:06:17.835
- She left.

00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:18.671
- She took the award with her.

00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:21.875

00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:22.606

00:06:22.606 --> 00:06:24.034
Yay, thanks for watching guys.

00:06:24.034 --> 00:06:24.673

00:06:24.673 --> 00:06:25.369
If you're wondering, yes,

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:26.995
I am still holding the real life Grammy.

00:06:26.995 --> 00:06:28.005
