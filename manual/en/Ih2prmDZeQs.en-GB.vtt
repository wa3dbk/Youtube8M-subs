Heather Nicholds: Hey guys this is Heather
from healthyeatingstartshere.com. So today

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.700
I have for you a recipe for a salad that we
are going to make into a meal and it's going

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.030
to be a really quick and easy weeknight meal
for you. And what I am going to base it on

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.349
is some lettuce and veggies of course. But
to make it more filling what I am going to

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:25.342
do is use some frozen lima beans which are
an excellent way to get protein really, really

00:00:25.342 --> 00:00:32.960
quick. And we are going to make a really interesting
thick spicy sauce and I am going to show you

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.820
super simple way to make this that will take
you a couple of minutes. Alright, so let's

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.460
get started with the lima beans.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.480
So I have already got some carrots and celery
chopped up and then I am going to take my

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.950
lima beans and good thing is -- ooh thatÕs
a lot. All you have to do is to put them in

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.730
a pot, add some water and then boil them for
a few minutes. And half a cup gives you 6

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.140
grams of proteins which means 22% protein
by calories.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.360
So I have just got them cooking back there
and they are also going to give you a ton

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.930
of iron. For women, 10% of your daily iron
needs from just a half a cup of lima beans.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.380
For guys its 22.5%. Guys need less iron overall
than women.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.229
Okay so, I have got some lettuce rinsed. You
just tear this, put it on a plate, top it

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.980
with the veggies and then we are going to
make our dressing while those lima beans cook.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.259
So I am going to put it in a bowl and what
I am going to use to start with is some salsa

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.870
and this is a salsa that I have bought. It
has just whole food ingredients so if you

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.509
can find one like that thatÕs awesome or
you can make your own. Or you can use some

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.399
canned diced tomatoes. ThatÕs another thing
I often use, but salsa of course has a nice

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.880
spiciness to it. So I am going to put some
in a bowl and then to it to make it nice and

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.979
creamy I am going to add some Tahini.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.939
You could use almond butter, you could use
cashew butter, you could use whatever you

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:04.090
like, but you just need spoonful and you are
going to stir it in to make a creamy tomato

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.190
sauce. So youÕre just going to stir it around
until you break up the tahini or the almond

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.190
butter.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.541
Now this one is pretty chunky so I am going
to have to stir it a little bit more. But

00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:18.720
if you have a nice smooth one, you won't need
to stir it too much at all. Then as I said

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:29.100
youÕre just going to tear up your lettuce,
spread it out on your plate, top up with your

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.080
veggies and you can use any variety of veggies
you like, celery and carrot is just what I

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.800
had in the fridge today.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.570
Another thing I like to do to make it more
filling is to use a bean dip. So I have a

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:51.230
bean dip here that I made the other day and
I am just going to put a few spoonfuls on

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.090
top. I love to do this with hummus, this is
a red lentil dip with some balsamic so it's

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.880
kind of brown and doesnÕt look terribly appetizing,
but it tastes really good, thatÕs what matters.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.400
Really good!

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.560
I do this a lot with hummus or with any kind
of bean dip. If you havenÕt checked out my

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.580
free three-day meal plan, do that. In there
I have a salad with hummus and I give you

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.610
the recipe for how to make the hummus. If
you go to my website healtheatingsstartshere.com,

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.232
you can download that for free. Just go to
the top right hand corner and youÕll see

00:03:25.232 --> 00:03:26.370
the link there.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.640
Okay, so cooked and strained. They really
only take a few minutes. They are really rich

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.560
in magnesium and potassium as well. ThatÕs
a lot! I really like adding them because they

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.930
work as bean as well as a vegetable. So it's
going to be a totally protein rich salad.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.310
And then on top we are just going to spend
some of this salsa tahini dressing. See how

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.130
thick that is, it's so tasty. And then you
just got to take a bite.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:02.070
So there you go. That is a super quick meal
with lots of proteins and nutrients and itÕs

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.620
a way to make a salad more filling into a
meal. So I hope you enjoy that. Give it a

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.010
try. Like I said you can vary all the ingredients,
the vegetables, the beans, the dip, whatever

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.010
you like.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.070
