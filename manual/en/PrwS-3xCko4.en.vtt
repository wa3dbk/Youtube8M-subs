00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:07.399
This will be an example of a slightly more
difficult Checkmate using a Queen and a King,

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:13.139
against a King, assuming that these are the
remaining pieces on the board, at the end

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:22.030
of the game. Basically, the idea is somewhat
similar to drive the King back to the edge

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.619
of the board. So, white to move, comes here.
Black can't take the Queen, it's supported

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.910
by whites' King, can't move to any of these
squares you'll notice, can't go here. So,

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.710
let's say to try to stay as central as possible
which is always the thing to do if you're

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:49.120
in a defending position, he goes here. Now,
white immediately moves into this file, because

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:57.160
now into that rank, because now he has blocked
the King from coming forward again. So, the

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.089
King is already getting pushed. Now, the King
can't come here so, let's say he goes here.

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.980
So, now the King is brought up, notice that
the white King is very necessary, the white

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.720
Queen alone can't do this mate. So, let's
say he goes back again, he's trying to hang

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:24.200
onto the center, gets checked again, once
again can't go to the sides so has to retreat,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:32.320
so he goes to here. King again, is moved up
towards him. Now notice that the, the black

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.670
King now has relatively few moves that he
can make. He can't go here, he'd be in check

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.050
from the Queen, he can't go here, he'd be
attacked by the King, here he'd be attacked

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.760
by both pieces, here the Queen, here the Queen.
So, already you've succeeded in forcing him

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.530
back to the edge of the board, and indeed
that's where he has to go. White would now

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.770
come across here preventing the King from
returning out, getting out and back towards

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.390
the center. Doesn't really matter much now
what the King does, let's say he goes to here,

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:15.560
the white King moves in, the only remaining
move at this point for black is to come here,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.200
and the white Queen comes in and Checkmates.
