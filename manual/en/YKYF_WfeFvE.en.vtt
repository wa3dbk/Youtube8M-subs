00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.110
Ragnarok's tried to be many things.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.130
Sure, one of them is the concept of doomsday
in Norse mythology, we knew that.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.440
But I mean Ragnarok the MMO franchise, which
hit it big and decided to branch out.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.910
Not happy with just having a hugely popular
MMO - a regular cultural phenomenon in Korea

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.690
that eventually got its own anime and worldwide
distribution - there's been a tactical RPG,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:46.059
an offline, self-contained DS version, and
now this... let's put it plainly, it's a desperate

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.670
attempt to cash in on all that sweet, sweet
Monster Hunter bank.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.990
Everything that Pangya was to Mario Golf,
Ragnarok Odyssey Ace is to Monster Hunter.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:03.339
And frankly, it's not all that bad.

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.979
The story's fairly light, but you get a very
Norse-flavored sequence of events: there's

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.040
an uprising of giants, and you're there to
put 'em down.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.110
You do this by picking a class, making a character,
and improving yourself by refining your equipment

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.640
and weapons using bits and pieces that fall
off of monsters you kill.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.619
Sounds familiar, don't it?

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.769
These are further augmented by cards that
you can find either in a shop or in battle

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:29.569
- because what good's a game if there's not
a card aspect to it, am I right - which further

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:34.990
increase your parameters and turn you from
a rank amateur into a lean, mean, giant-freakin-sword-waving

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.630
Ork-King-Killin' machine.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.590
As can be expected of a game where your primary
enemy is giants, you're going to be taking

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.369
down some freakin' huge monsters as you hack
and slash your way through chapter after chapter

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.670
of... well, of what are by-and-large fetch
quests.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.130
I'm not even going to bother splitting hairs
here.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.020
You're out there to collect the proverbial
bear asses, as it were, and then you come

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.299
back, tune up, and go out there for more bear
asses.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.040
Fortunately, you won't have to do all this
alone.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.780
In the single-player campaign, you have the
option of recruiting mercenary helpers to

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.140
aid you out there in the field, and who ask
for a chunk of your pay only after you've

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.000
completed the mission.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.350
Rather convenient, even if they're not exactly
blessed with the most intelligent AI the world

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.350
has ever known.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.250
Fortunately, you can usually make up for it,
by utilizing all your various tricks like

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.390
Ace skills, stuns, and the jovially-named
Dainsleif mode where you just turn into a

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.350
death elemental, chewing through your HP bar
but replenishing it with the damage you deal.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.600
It'll take a balance of these powers to bring
down some of the bigger baddies, as well as

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.410
just making it through the admittedly recycled
areas you'll be exploring over and over again.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.610
Of course, if computer AI isn't your thing,
you can enter into four-player online sessions

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.850
to lend friends a hand or just expand your
horizons a bit by taking on more challenging

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.570
versions of your missions.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.960
The presentation of Ragnarok Odyssey Ace lacks
the grittyness of a Monster Hunter, but sometimes

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.230
you don't particularly want gritty.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:15.320
You want a lineup of friendly girls in maid
outfits selling you potions.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.510
You want ridiculously-adorable slimes that'd
make those Dragon Quest jokers hide themselves

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.510
in shame.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.510
You want absurdity moreso than harsh realism,
even if "reality" is a rather nebulous term.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.070
If you're hungry for that big-game-hunting
action but somehow lack any platform with

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.190
a recent Monster Hunter iteration, Ragnarok
Odyssey Ace will scratch that itch for you.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.710
Now if you'll excuse me, I've gone and reminded
myself of Pangya and need to slam through

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.680
eighteen holes before I get the shakes.
