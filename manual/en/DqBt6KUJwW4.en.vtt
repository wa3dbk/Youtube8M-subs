00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:13.579
The Jaguar Sportbrake comes in 2 flavors.

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:20.464
A diesel, which is banned from
Utrecht and Paris, so don't pick that one.

00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:31.677
And there's the XFR-S. A confusing name with
its hyphen after 3 letters followed by the 'S'.

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:39.189
I always write it wrong, but now
you know: 3 hyphen 1. XFR-S.

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:46.873
It's a beast. You can use it when
darkness falls in the Netherlands.

00:00:46.873 --> 00:00:51.105
People go inside, so we can
let the Jaguar out.

00:00:55.534 --> 00:01:04.965
They predicted a bit of rain and hail
at 37ËšF, and they were actually right.

00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:11.811
This isn't the ideal car
under these conditions.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:21.322
It has RWD only, sporty summer tires,
and the supercharged V8 which we love.

00:01:21.322 --> 00:01:25.069
It's a bit much in this weather.

00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:31.773
542 hp and 502 lb ft torque is a lot.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:47.024
In these conditions it means wheelspin in
3rd at 2,000 rpm. That's not full throttle.

00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:49.170
It's just very slippery.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.759
At least we don't have understeer.

00:01:59.559 --> 00:02:05.517
In ideal conditions, the XFR-S Sportbrake
does 0-62 mph in 4.8 seconds.

00:02:05.517 --> 00:02:14.882
I think it takes 10-12 seconds now, after all
the wheelspin is solved and ESP is done.

00:02:20.814 --> 00:02:31.133
We can't reproduce it now. We can't reach
the limit of 186 mph now either.

00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:42.365
With these puddles it's not a good idea to go anywhere near that speed on summer tires.

00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:51.031
It's a shame, because we're driving at
night and want to tape the terror for you.

00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:53.429
Unfortunately, it's a no go today.

00:03:00.527 --> 00:03:10.279
It looks brilliant. I think it's a pretty XF.
All XFs are, but this one in blue...

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:18.714
The XFR-S trim with its nice
rims and spoilers looks cool.

00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:25.512
Still, Jaguar took on a hard job with
the XF; the Sportbrake in particular.

00:03:25.512 --> 00:03:32.799
The XF has been around for a long time, including
a facelift, after which the Sportbrake was introduced.

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:42.672
That's at the end of its life. The XFR-S
is late. It's still a cool car, though.

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:53.275
The only question is: do I pick this one or an E63
AMG? An S with AWD, which is great in this weather.

00:03:54.163 --> 00:04:04.026
The Audi RS6 has AWD as well. All this power on
the rear wheels is no good in these conditions,

00:04:04.026 --> 00:04:11.506
especially with summer tires. There's a big difference. Winter tires can be adventurous as well.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.892
The key question: is Jaguar good enough to
lure people away from Audi and Mercedes?

00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:33.885
Some parts of the interior do. It looks great
with its blue stitching, matching the paint.

00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:41.506
Pretty carbon. The satnav is touchscreen
only, which doesn't work that well.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:51.254
You can't operate it blind. Maybe you know
where to push when you've used it a long time.

00:04:51.254 --> 00:04:55.341
It's not as good as with the Germans.

00:04:55.658 --> 00:04:59.778
On the other hand, those are boring
Germans. This is a Jaguar.

00:05:08.995 --> 00:05:14.775
Better not ask for the price. Just
enter your pin code and hit 'OK'.

00:05:14.775 --> 00:05:16.330
That's better for everyone. 

00:05:16.857 --> 00:05:22.580
Do know this is the fastest supercharged
wagon for sale. 

00:05:28.777 --> 00:05:32.900
