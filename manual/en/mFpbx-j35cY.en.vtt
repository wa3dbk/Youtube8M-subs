Hey guys, David Glenn of davidglennrecording.com
and theproaudiofiles.com. Today we’re gonna

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:28.239
be talking about kicks and samples and why
I chose in mixing the song chosen, to use

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:38.079
Slate’s Trigger, Trigger 2, instead of using
the very well recorded live kick.

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.070
Now this isn’t how I would mix every single
song, I’m not using samples on every single

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.070
song. Most of the time I’m using samples
to blend or, you know, to add something. But

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.519
in this case I completely replaced it and
I’m gonna tell you why. So we’re gonna

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.089
look at the kick but let’s first go ahead
and hit play. You guys can hear the drums

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.019
the way they sound.

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:10.019
[drum mix with live acoustic kick drum]

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.939
Ok, so the reason why I went with Trigger
is for the most part the fact that, one, I was

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.680
on an extremely tight time crunch for this
song. So I pulled in my trusty — one of

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.500
the trusty kicks that I have from That Sound
— you can check out iwantthatsound.com.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.500
I rave about those all the time. But after
i pick this kick, Tighty Natural, what I did

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.229
is, you can come up here you can mess with
the tuning. You can see I dropped that down

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.149
a little bit. But in the curves I’ve got
the attack, sustain and release controls and

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.049
I absolutely love this. The ability to go
in and tighten up this kick. Let’s see if

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.130
this is it, 06 and 07, let’s put this back
to where it was originally and let’s take

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.119
a listen to the kick drum, the sample.

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.229
[kick drum sample]

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.229
You can hear the extra oomph in there, in
the room noise. Ok, so in the mix.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.020
[drum mix with sample replaced kick drum]

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.420
Ok, so it’s not that bad to our ear like
that. Now watch what happens whenever I come

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.440
over here. And I do this a lot when I’m
checking my low end. I’ll take a FabFilter

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.750
Pro-Q 2 and I’ll take a high cut, low pass,
and I’ll put that band all the way down

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.780
to say, 140 or so. I usually go a lot lower,
but let’s hit 135 and let’s take a listen

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.820
to what it’s doing now.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.820
[kick drum sample with low pass filter]

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.760
So now we can really feel and hear the low
end and how that low end is sustaining. Well

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.760
whenever I referenced the Jason Mraz track
mixed by Tony Maserati, produced by Joe Chiccarelli,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.950
this is The Woman I Love from his last record,
Love Is A Four Letter Word. Take a listen

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.950
to what their low end is doing in the kick.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.680
[reference track kick drum low end]

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.440
Ok, do you feel how it’s pretty tight before
I do the — it’s tight, it’s punchy,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.440
it’s got just the right bit of stuff we’ll
call it. The kick that I’m working with

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.000
sounds like this again.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000
[kick drum with high cut]

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.280
So it’s a little bit messier and I like
that Tony’s was tight, I like that it was

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.280
punchy and we’re gonna try to get that same
sound by coming in here and simply tightening

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:24.509
up this kick. Sustain and release.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.500
[Slate Trigger 2 + Kick Drum + ASR adjustments]

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:14.099
So the moral of the story. Look at this sustain
and this release to help you tighten up your

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:20.669
kick sounds and when you think about it, when
you hear this kick kind of be squished a little

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.759
bit, when you boost the low end, it’s gonna
kick of fluff it out a little bit more and

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.849
then when you add the bass guitar and you’re
mixing against the bass, the bass is gonna

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:33.939
add some fullness, add some body to the low
end — and for me, I prefer to have tighter

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:40.060
kicks. If you go and you go what I taught
you with the high cut/low pass filter against

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.699
reference tracks I think you’re gonna find
that a lot of the tracks you’re gonna reference

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:50.860
are gonna have way tighter gated kicks than
you might first think.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.860
So go reference some tracks, use this technique
for tracks where you really love your natural

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.819
sounds. Go ahead and sample them, create your
own Trigger presets with the sounds that you

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:08.949
love and take advantage of the flexibility
that these tools give us with being able to

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:15.949
control the envelope, the shaping, the dynamics.
So hope that helps you. Thanks again for watching,
