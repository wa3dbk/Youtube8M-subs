Hi this Julie with Beadaholique.com and I'm going to show you how to finish

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.319
memory wire. So here I have a memory wire
bracelet

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:18.160
what's great about it keeps it's shape. You can see it's got this wonderful

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.830
coil shape to it

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.380
and all you need to do to create a bracelet
with it is to finish off the ends

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.039
so here is some memory wire without beads

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.949
it just has that nice coil shape

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.739
I'm going to show you three different ways that
you can finish your ends after you've added

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.370
all your beads

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.180
so the first way and probably the
easiest is to just

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.480
make a little loop at the end of your memory
wire. So I've got some wire

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.450
looping pliers here

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.070
put the wire in it

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.330
and twist around

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.960
and we have a loop and that will
secure your beads from falling off and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.560
then you have something that you can add a
little dangled to

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.980
that's one way

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.840
another way is with these little
crimp beads that have a loop already

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.430
attached

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.340
I'm going to do that on the other end

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.480
so to work with these what you're going to
do is

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.640
just pop it on there

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.090
take your crimping pliers now we're not going
to crimp up near the loop because you

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.820
run the risk of actually hurting the loop
itself

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.590
so what you're going to want to do

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.060
just crimp down at the bottom

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.060
You're just going to crimp down like usual

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.000
there you go and that's gonna stay on there
securely

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.700
so the third and final way I want to show you
and this way looks very clean is using

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.880
one of these little end caps

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.810
it's got a little hole in it

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.680
on one side and then it's nice the round
ball

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.140
to apply these your going to take some GS Hypo cement

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.140
put it on the wire itself

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.329
take

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:13.599
one of these little guys, find the
hole

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.289
and press onto place and then we're
just gonna let that dry. It's going to dry

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:18.799
solid

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.829
So those are three separate options on how
you can finish memory wire

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.769
it will allow you to make it great piece
memory wire jewelry
