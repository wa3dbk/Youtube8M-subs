Hey guys, what is up!

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.940
If you have ever downloaded an application
just to find out that it doesn't work because

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.759
of your device being rooted,
I have got some good news to you today as

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.719
there's actually a way to bypass that!

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.920
And to that you will need Xposed Framework
installed on your device.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:29.720
So yeah, you just go to Xposed Installer and
you have to search for a module 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.699
called RootCloak.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.969
Here it was... okay, here it is!

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:43.489
And now all you have to do is simply
download the application.

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:51.660
Okay, now we have to install it.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.810
Once it's done, as always with Xposed Framework's
applications,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:05.010
we have to activate the module and to do that
we have to check the module in Xposed Installer

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.660
and reboot our phone afterwards.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.680
Alright, and after rebooting your device you
will now have this new application called

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.060
RootCloak and in it you can actually
add and remove applications from being able

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.530
to see that your device is rooted.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.000
You will have to add the application manually
because not all of the apps are automatically

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
added.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.560
So in my case it is the Nokia Z launcher.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.850
Adding it is as simple
as tapping on it.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.790
But now, as you can see, the app still does
not allow me to run it because it sees I am

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.790
rooted.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.780
It is not a bug or anything, you just have
to go to the application's settings and force

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.560
stop it.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.310
And now once I run the application it works
just as intended!

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.530
So yeah guys, hiding the root from specific
applications is as simple as that!

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.420
Thank you for watching and see you next time!
