00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:05.161
Hi, I'm gonna talk to you today about how
to pack your bag. It's really important that

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:09.650
you pack everything all together the way you
need it so that way you don't have to unpack

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.230
your bag later on in the day. So let's have
a look at how to pack. Got my empty back pack

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:23.590
here. Now, I'm gonna start by thinking, what
do I need? Okay, well I don't anticipate it

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:35.690
raining today so I'll probably put my rain
jacket at the bottom, so that's down there.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.760
Since again it's not raining and it's not
very cold, I put my pants down there as well.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:51.079
I'm already layered correctly, so, I'll just
put my shirt in just in case I need it later.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:59.129
Again, it's not cold so I probably won't need
my gloves. I have a bandanna, which I like

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.339
to use for wiping the sweat off of me, it's
a little bit nasty but, so I'll just put that

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:12.410
on the side for whenever I need it right there,
as well as my hat. I got a little bit of food

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.800
here but I don't want to have it crushed in
the bottom of my back pack or slide down so

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:24.470
I'll put it in my front pocket. I also have
more layers here, which I don't anticipate

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:35.110
using but I'll put them up here just in case
I need them. Now, for this stuff, I've got

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.320
my water which I'm gonna need all day, so
I'll just put it on the side over here where

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.460
I can easily grab it. I want to have my survival
kit where I know I can get to it easily, in

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.220
case I ever needed to pull it out quick to
help myself or someone else. Same goes for

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.061
the medical kit here. I'll put that in up
top so I can easily get it in case I need

00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:05.360
something. I've got my radio in case I get
lost, maybe someone will pick up. If I turn

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.270
it on perhaps I can use it. They're small,
you should carry one. So, I'll just put that

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:19.040
in with the rest of it. Now, one of the most
important things is having a good map. So,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.620
I've got my maps here and I want to have them
up to so I can easily reference them if I

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:36.450
need to know where I am so I'll put them in
my top pocket up here.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.260
Now, I don't anticipate using the guide, but
they're a good thing to have on hand so I'll

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:52.829
keep them up top with the medical kit.
That's about everything I'm gonna need, so,

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:59.019
just strap up your bag, know where you're
going and you'll be good to go.
