00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:03.089
This is Diana Sullivan in Austin, Texas.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:10.349
I'm doing another beginning machine knitting lesson, and I'm talking about short rowing again.  In this video

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.789
I'm showing a different way to do the same shoulder.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.160
This is going to create the same slope.  When I short rowed the previous shoulder

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.129
I did one needle, then three,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.219
one needle, then three, one needle, then three, one needle, then three all the way across.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.459
It took two rows to decrease four stitches

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.940
because I put one needle out on the first row and three more needles on the second.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.660
In this technique, I'm still short rowing,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.309
but I'm going to take four needles out of work each time that I short row -- take four needles out of work,

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.629
two rows of knitting, four needles out, two rows of knitting.

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.419
So I'm beginning with the carriage on the right,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.080
and I cannot decrease four stitches on the same side as the carriage.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.480
I can only do that when I'm over on the opposite side.

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.058
So if you have that situation in a pattern, you have to knit over to the opposite side before you can begin to short row.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.630
We're going to the opposite side.  To short row

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.450
you have to have the machine set on Hold and this machine is set on Hold, and I'm going to reduce

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.820
the width of my row by four

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.609
stitches, so this is a four needle short row decrease.  And I knit back.

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.949
It knits two here, then it comes across the top of these four.  In the previous example

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.450
I brought another needle out to avoid a hole, but in this example, I'm going to wrap.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.360
So -- it was short row knit across,

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.570
and then wrap and knit back.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.279
I'm going to bring four more needles out, knit across,

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.868
wrap, knit back,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.440
four more needles to hold position,

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.659
knit across, wrap, knit back,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.380
four more needles to hold position,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.300
knit across, wrap,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.020
 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.180
Oops -- one needle, wrap one needle.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.059
And that completes the shaping on the shoulder.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.780
I think you can see it a little bit

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.850
but it will show up much better after I knit a few rows of waste yarn, so I'm going to cut the yarn

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.160
 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.040
and I'm going to thread this darker purple yarn

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.140
 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.900
and put some waste knitting on and take it off the machine,

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.940
hold it in front of the camera so that it's easy to see the slope.  The machine has to be put in

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.750
Normal instead of Hold setting to knit all the stitches.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.989
If I had inadvertently left it in Hold position, it would have just

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.889
knitted the ones that we're back and skipped over the ones on top.

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:13.469
And now I'm going to take this knitting off and I'm going to show the slope that it created.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.720
So here is the shoulder shape

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.649
using the second method, and let me turn it over and show it on the stockinette side.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.709
I think that with the little stripes

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.069
that were created by using a variegated yarn

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.560
you can really see these rows getting shorter toward the top.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.910
So that is short row shaping of a shoulder.
