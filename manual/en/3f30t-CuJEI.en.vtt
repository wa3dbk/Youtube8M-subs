00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.120
Where are you going now?

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.260
Over to the blue tractor.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.780
See. It's blue.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.620
It's a good tractor.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.740
Where are you going?

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.880
Who wants to join me?

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.660
Okay, then hop on.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.740
What does it cost?

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.200
Where are we going?

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.120
We're driving to the sea.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.120
You're coming with me.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.500
Come on. Just hop on.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.800
Shall I sit up here?

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.200
Just hop on.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.020
Come on.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.560
Come on!

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.140
Come on.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.340
Want me to hop on?

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.280
Go!

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.520
We can't drive without lights on.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.420
- Can't you start it?
- No.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.040
Isn't it working?

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.040
Maybe it's out of oil?

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.860
There aren't enough lights on.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.300
And the seat is all wobbly.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.380
When I drive, it gets all wobbly.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.280
I'm jumping down.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.540
- Isn't it too high up?
- No

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.440
Oh, I think so. Need a hand?

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.320
You need to put gas in the others.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.380
Are you ready to jump on?

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.380
Without me. Okay?

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.700
Without you?

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.840
- Yes. Without me!
- Why?

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.700
Because I need to fix something first. Okay?

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.440
In the engine?

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.040
Yes. This wheel needs fixing.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.940
No, no. It's this old tractor.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.140
It's very old.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.400
Come on. Hop on.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.840
Don't you want to hear the engine?

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.520
Come on. Let's hear it.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.300
It's cool, huh?

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.040
- It smells.
- Yes, it smells.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.820
Why isn't anyone driving it?

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.940
That guy over there just started the engine.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.580
He just wanted to start the engine.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.860
- Why?
- So we could hear the sound.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.860
- Why?
- So we can hear what it sounds like.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.400
- Why?
- It sounds pretty good, don't you think?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.900
- When is he going to turn it off?
- I don't know.
