00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:14.020
In "Part One : The Importance of Food Safety" you'll find out how many Americans are affected by foodborne illness nationwide.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.180
We'll meet an Environmental Health Inspector and discuss how cleanliness is a key factor in his work.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:29.880
Every kitchen requires a person-in-charge, and we will introduce a PIC to talk  their responsibilities.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:41.360
Then we will focus on "Who is at Risk" - where we learn which segments of the population are most at risk for foodborne illness or injury, and how you can help keep them safe.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.800
Without proper food handling practices, the public becomes at risk for foodborne illness or injury from hazards in the foods they consume.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.920
Anyone who has had “food poisoning” or a foodborne illness or injury knows that it is an unpleasant experience

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:09.240
- but with estimates that about 48 million Americans get sick, with 128,000 hospitalized, and over 3,000 deaths annually from unsafe food nationwide

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.560
- it’s important to remember that following food safety rules saves lives.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.340
We asked Zach Manning, an Environmental Health Inspector for Lane County in Oregon ,

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:31.120
to tell us about his role in maintaining public health and what he looks for during his inspections of restaurants and food service facilities.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.200
The most important thing is, is this restaurant clean?

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.240
If you have a dirty kitchen that tells me a lot.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.240
That means there’s miscommunication, the restaurant is unorganized, and there is a lack of effort being put forth.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.360
This all falls on the Person-in-Charge. Cleanliness is key to any restaurant or kitchen.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.920
A dirty, disorganized kitchen is less likely to be following good food safety practices.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.340
The second thing Zach looks for is the competence of the person in charge.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.100
A Person-in-Charge that is competent and knowledgeable is required in all restaurants at all times.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.060
If I do not have a competent and knowledgeable PIC it makes my job very difficult in ensuring food safety.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:35.360
A Person-in-Charge, or PIC, must be on the premises during all hours of operation, and must know the Food Code and Procedures used in the the establishment.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.960
They should be able to answer all employee questions regarding food safety, and provide training on how to perform jobs correctly.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.620
As the Person-in-Charge I’m responsible for all the food safety and sanitization in the department.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.700
I’m responsible for all the food that comes in, as well as all the meals that go out.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.680
Food safety is everyone’s business. if the public feels unsafe, the entire industry suffers.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.840
The general public needs to have trust that the establishments they patronize follow the basic food safety guidelines,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.520
but no matter what precautions are taken to ensure their safety,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:22.200
certain segments of the population are still more prone to becoming sick or experiencing worse than normal symptoms from foodborne illness.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:29.040
It’s easy to remember how to identify highly susceptible populations by using the acronym YOPI.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.260
The Y stands for children younger than 5 years old.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.360
O is for older than 65 years of age.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.880
P for pregnant women.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:54.160
and I stands for those that are “Immune Compromised’, meaning having a serious illness like cancer, HIV, diabetes or other conditions, as well as those prescribed certain medications.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:04.380
Our compliance rules are really geared toward those susceptible populations, so by following basic food safety rules, we can mitigate any impact on those people at risk.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:19.000
Because of people in the YOPI category extra caution needs to be exercised when dealing with undercooked meats, raw oysters, undercooked eggs, sprouts, as well as unpasteurized milk or juices.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.300
Before we move on to Part Two, let's recap some important facts about the Importance of Food Safety.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:35.940
In the US there is an estimated 48 Million cases of foodborne illness or injury resulting in over 3,000 deaths annually.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.300
What is the most important factor in food safety?

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:48.460
Cleanliness, according to our environmental health inspector, because an unclean restaurant or kitchen is often a sign of larger potential health hazards.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.440
A person-in-charge is required at all times to ensure proper food handling practices are being followed.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:08.080
We learned the acronymn YOPI. That stands for Young, Old, Preganant, and Immune Compromised - and helps us remember the types of people who are most at risk for foodborne illness or injury.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:19.760
Finally we listed some food that require extra caution due to people in the YOPI category - including meats, oysters, eggs, sprouts, and unpasturized juices.
