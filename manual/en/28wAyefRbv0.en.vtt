00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:19.350
So this is kind of weird.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.980
This is Sega Sports Tennis for the PlayStation
2, which is actually a port of a Dreamcast

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.529
game called Tennis 2K2...which was the American
version of Virtua Tennis 2.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.529
Don’t worry.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.259
That’s the most complicated thing about
this game.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:48.350
It’s...that whole paragraph of names...for
the PlayStation 2.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.260
So this game was originally released in 2001
as, again...Tennis 2K2, Virtua Tennis 2 internationally,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.030
but regardless, very much a Dreamcast game.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.570
Since, like, five people bought a Dreamcast,
it only made sense to bring this outstanding

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.680
tennis game to a platform where people could
actually play it.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.550
And to change the name.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.970
Erase all the evidence.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.409
But obviously, the game itself is very much
the same.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.189
There’s a roster of 16 real tennis players,
from Serena Williams to Lindsay Davenport

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.170
and some awesome Swedish guy named Magnus
Norman.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.320
Sounds like the guitarist for some melodic
death metal band.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.940
Turns out he’s just a tennis player.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:35.700
Which is, like, the exact opposite profession.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.520
Mathematically.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.580
Anyway, pick a player and hit the clay.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.579
I think that’s a tennis phrase, right?

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.320
And that’s where Sega Sports Tennis really
shines.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.920
This is a fantastic game of tennis, pairing
an immediately accessible control scheme with

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.540
silky smooth gameplay.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.659
Move with your choice of analog stick or d-pad,
use Circle, Square and X for different shots.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.180
And what’s brilliant is that...this is pick-up-and-play
simplicity worked into what is an otherwise

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.569
complex tennis game.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.190
For starters, the AI is just...brutal.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.700
I mean, it’s not an easy feat to advance
in the game’s tournament mode.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.940
Especially when it slams you with the Williams
sisters back to back.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.660
Poor Monica Seles...I lost, like, ten times
in a row before I finally figured out Venus’s

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.660
tendencies.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.090
Then I get to Serena, and it’s like a whole
new game.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.840
That’s kind of awesome.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.940
Maddening, but awesome.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:50.560
And you know, for a decade-old sports game,
this thing is actually pretty packed with

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.560
content.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.099
You’ve got a tournament mode, exhibition
matches, this RPG-like World Tour that gives

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.020
you hours of matches and even character-strengthening
minigames.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.799
The game certainly isn’t short on content,
and for its time, it’s downright impressive.

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.770
Of course, this is eleven years later, and
Sega Sports Tennis does show some rust.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.150
It’s not a great looking game, even by PS2
standards.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.230
But the gameplay is as awesome as ever.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.610
Sports games are, by their annual nature,
sort of disposable products.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.560
But if you want a really good tennis game
for your PS2, Sega Sports Tennis still has

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.880
it.
