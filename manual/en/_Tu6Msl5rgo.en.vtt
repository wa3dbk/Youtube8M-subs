00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.629
What’s going on I just wanted to do a video
about rock band 4 and guitar hero live now

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.559
for those of you who didn’t see the announcement
today the first shots were fired in the next

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.849
generation rhythm game war between Activision
and Harmonix.

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.070
Now let’s talk about Guitar Hero Live which
was announced today.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.620
Now I am going to go through each category
and compare each game based on the information

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.510
we know to date and as time goes on like when
E3 comes I’ll do another video to serve

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.610
as an update.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.029
So let’s talk about Guitar Hero Live that
was announced today.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.789
It’s going to be coming out for all current
and next generation platforms including the

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.560
Wii U which is unfortunately something Rock
Band 4 is unfortunately not doing.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.430
It’s only coming out for the PS4 and Xbox
One.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.850
So let’s talk about what Activision announced
today.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.730
So the game is being developed by Freestyle
Games, the same guys who made DJ Hero so Neversoft

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.140
is not returning ot make Guitar Hero and a
lot of people from what I read online were

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.160
really disappointed by that news.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.960
The other thing they announced too is that
the game is no longer a full band experience,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.380
it is strictly a guitar game and it comes
with a new guitar peripheral which has 6 buttons

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.050
instead of five and the button configuration
is changing too.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.530
There’s going to be two rows with three
buttons on each row.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.520
There’s going to be a row of black buttons
and a row of white buttons and the developers

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.800
have done that because it sort of simulates
a player playing different chord shapes together.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.800
So the note highway when you watch the gameplay
footage it’s just basically three frets

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.450
and you’ll either be playing the black or
the white or the black and white together.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.370
The other thing that’s been announced is
that as you can see from the trailer behind

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.200
me is that the entire game takes place in
front of a live crowd so everything you see

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.790
like your bandmates on stage the crowd is
all live so there’s not that animated screen

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.730
anymore and the band you see on stage is actually
playing the real song you’re playing so

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.580
it’s not just one take that they’ve repeated
for every single song in the game and the

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.641
crowd reacts based on how you play.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:51.880
If you play really good they’ll be cheering
and they’ll be singing along and if you

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.070
don’t play so good they’ll be getting
upset at you and same with your bandmates.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.840
And the other thing they’ve announced too
is that because all the gameplay footage is

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.570
all real video I guess you really can’t
customize your character and I think that’s

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.060
going to disappoint a lot of people because
character customization is something we’ve

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.160
known to love from the guitar hero franchise
as well as the rock band franchise.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.380
Let’s talk about DLC support and backwards
compatibility.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.150
It was pretty apparent from Activision’s
announcement today that your old guitars will

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.650
unfortunately will not work and all your old
DLC you bought from Guitar Hero 3 all the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.990
way through to the last Guitar Hero Warriors
of rock will not be compatible either.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.280
So I think one thing you will see with the
new guitar hero is a lot of returning tracks

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.260
we’ve seen before in so many games whether
it’s Rocksmith, Rock Band and Guitar Hero

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.910
whereas Rock Band 4 is going to support all
the DLC you’ve purchased to date it’ll

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.970
only be compatible cross platform so if you
have an xbox 360 you can’t bring all your

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.300
DLC over to the ps4 and it’s the same for
a ps4.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.010
The other thing that harmonix has announced
or at least they’ve seemed to indicate is

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.099
that all your old instruments will work.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.849
So let’s talk about setlists and the setlist
for rock band 4 we have no clue what it’s

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.680
going to involve and no songs have gotten
leaked so far, but they’ve said it’s going

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.270
to be pretty top tier and it’s going to
have artists we haven’t seen before in rock

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.790
band and I think it’s going to be more focused
because keyboards are no longer supported

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.940
in rock band 4 they are going back to the
core experience just featuring 4 instruments.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.530
It seems like harmonies are up in the air
I’m guessing harmonies may not be included

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.370
from the information we’ve seen so far and
that allows harmonix to be more focused on

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.660
catering to a certain genre of rock rather
than bands we saw in Rock Band 3.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.420
Seeing artists like Lady Gaga, Elton John
or Billy Joel . I don’t think some of those

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.090
artists will return whereas Guitar Hero has
been pretty open about the artists who will

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.090
be in the game.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.950
It’s going to be pretty eclectic and it’s
going to be a lot different than what we’ve

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.090
saw in past guitar hero games which I think
may upset infact a lot of people.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.230
Some of the artists announced today included
people like Skrillex, which I think is a rather

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.010
interesting addition to Guitar Hero.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.510
There will be Green Day who had their own
game if you remember back in 2010, there’s

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.780
going to be Gary Clark Jr., there’s going
to be Fall Out Boy, There’s going to be

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.160
American Authors, there’s going to be Of
Monsters and Men.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.689
So there’s a pretty broad variety of artists
we’re going to see and compared to previous

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:21.969
Guitar Hero’s the previous Guitar Hero games
have always been very focused they are usually

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.539
on the harder rock side.

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:29.500
This one seems to be catering to what the
developers have said a festival of Coachella

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.050
proportions the kind of artists you would
see at those festivals I think it’s trying

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.849
to lean more towards the poppy side, but you
know we’ll see what comes with their actual

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.289
setlist announcement at E3.

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:48.039
Let’s talk about the DLC after it is released
after Guitar Hero and Rock Band 4 are released

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:54.389
and Activision announced something interesting
what they call Guitar Hero TV now it’s basically

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:00.589
going to allow you to jump in and out and
play along to music videos of different songs

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:06.120
and they are separated by genres as well and
they didn’t elaborate any further on that

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.930
and they didn’t announce what the pricing
model for that would be but they have been

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.960
really adamant about saying hey we aren’t
going to release yearly Guitar Hero games

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.999
like we did on the last generation of consoles
so it looks like Rock Band and Guitar Hero

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:23.379
are going to be releasing one game for this
platform at least as a platform for this generation

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.779
of consoles and keep supporting it with DLC&gt;
Harmonix has said while they are going to

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:33.689
release songs as DLC they are also going to
be upgrading the gameplay experience which

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:39.509
is something that is a stark drastic difference
between both franchises . The thing I fear

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:44.150
with guitar hero is that the gameplay is going
to get stale and maybe the songs will keep

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.810
the gameplay fresh, but when Harmonix is improving
the gameplay experience based on what the

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.919
player’s feedback is I mean that says a
lot about keeping the game fresh and brand

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.249
new.

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:59.520
While we haven’t got any more details past
that we’ll probably see more at E3 being

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.520
announced.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.719
I think it’s safe to say that for DLC support
it’s going to be Harmonix once again.

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:12.189
They supported Rock Band 1-3 with over 256
or 258 consecutive weeks of DLC and and that

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:16.849
song library has grown to over 2000 songs,
most of which will transfer over to Rock Band

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:21.099
4 . Harmonix has talked a lot about making
the core band experience much more realistic

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:25.199
and more interactive and they haven’t really
elaborated on that but they have said that

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.940
they want to basically make the way a band
interacts much more realistic and be able

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.839
to interact more with bandmates as well as
put your own personal mark on each and every

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:37.500
song and that’s all the information that’s
been released to date about Rock Band as far

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.619
as we know.

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:41.330
We know that both games will be coming out
this fall.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.969
Personally I feel like I am leaning more towards
rock band 4 I feel like you know guitar hero

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:49.809
I feel like they have a really good opportunity
to do something new and innovative and you

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:53.689
know to me it feels like they are going back
to where their roots are and they are not

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:58.650
really bringing anything new or different
that could take the genre in a new direction.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.270
It feels like a rehash of what we saw in the
first three guitar hero games.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.081
But I am open minded to seeing what Activision
is going to be bringing this fall and I am

00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:07.860
definitely going to be playing the game.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.550
We do know that activision’s game will be
$99.00 with the guitar bundle.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.830
Harmonix hasn’t really announced pricing
for their game but there will be a couple

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.720
bundles available including one with the guitars
well as the full band bundle like we saw with

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.569
rock band 1 and 2 I’d like to know what
are you’re guys thoughts.

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:25.929
Which game are you preferring and which one
are you leaning towards.

00:07:25.929 --> 00:07:28.720
