its basically a futuristic game

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.330
I arena where lot ways to happen so in a
minute you have an alarm

though I G open sea they go now

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.399
using the alarm go off annette doors
open get to see some like

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.280
stuff behind slight camera crews unlike
what you would win

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.880
a few actually playing this game the
best thing is for the field or to

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.130
