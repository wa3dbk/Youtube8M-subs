00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.460
Blackmagic Design is one of the
sponsors on my trip here to BVE 2014 in

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.030
London

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.860
and I want to give you a chance to
understand a little bit more of the

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.580
strategy

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.849
that Blackmagic Design is going through
as they've expanded their product line

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.210
I'm talking with Stewart Ashton who is
the director for EMEA which is Europe

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.380
Middle East and Asia

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.300
and Stewart is, let's just say he knows a
lot about what Blackmagic is doing

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.850
Stuart, welcome. Glad to have you with us.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.470
Hi thank you for having me again. 
Is there anything new with the show?
Nothing new.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.600
Nothing new but what this is an
opportunity is for everybody who, in the

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.450
UK, has not seen these products
from IBC and NAB

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.760
Really to get that such and feel experience.
Being able to get close to the products. Being able to see how

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.710
they work and ask all those Blackmagic guys

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.470
really, what these products actually do.
You have to understand

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.960
that this is about, just about two
minutes before the show closes. The booth

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.800
is packed.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.180
Earlier today there were so many people
standing in a booth with couldn't even

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.810
record the interview without being about five
booths away

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.920
so to say people are getting their hands
on is a relative. They're crowded

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.040
around the booth just to be able to see
some of the products that are here

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.689
What's been some the most popular stuff.
Well I think, I think for us we

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.649
look at the color correction, we look at
a time, we look at the cameras. Those are

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.270
three areas they are showing a lot of
interest to our customer base and for all

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.319
these users out here

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:25.889
The UK's a very creative space with a
lot of very interesting projects going on

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:29.420
at the moment and I think that when
people are starting to look at our ultra HD

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.200
workflows

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.049
it's really starting to capture their
imagination about where 4k can fit

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.219
within their day-to-day

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:38.770
You finally started shipping the cameras

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.030
The most recent is the 4k camera.
Why the 4k camera? What does it do?

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.259
What makes it special? Well I think that
the first thing with this camera is is

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.579
that anybody whose experienced working
with the 2.5K Blackmagic

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.399
Cinema Camera

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.539
will experience these fantastic wonderful
looking images

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.380
and also a camera that is so diverse, so
diverse but yet easily utilized

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.609
with many different third-party
accessories and interchangeable lenses

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:07.490
it really gives you the complete package
The 4k camera is the same form factor

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.390
the same weights

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.590
but the main differences are it's got a super
35mil sensor

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.040
It's also got a global shutter and it's
got 12 stops of dynamic range

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.560
with 60 guess the eye output. So what
you're getting here for less than two

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.820
thousand pounds or

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.470
less than $3000 is a
hell of a camera with a lot of features

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.150
a great opportunity to work
with all those beautiful lenses and see you already

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.490
own

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.080
and what codec doesn't use for recording
so you can

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.600
you go to record in progress in the
prior shd your progress Paul K

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.130
but also as well as going to be released
for a lot officially lost was cinema DNG

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.620
role as well was so anybody wants to
work on a roll file type

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.920
I'm can actually utilize like kodak has
well I was just reflecting

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.520
over the last five ten years and black
magic has been around it started with

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.860
doing capture cards

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.760
and then all of a sudden it seems to
explode in a lot of different areas

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.000
watch the strategy driving behind the
products which are coming up with why so

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.060
many in Washoe wildly different

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.790
I think this has been a fantastic
response fantastic roller coaster ride i

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.010
mean i i look at the experience so we
had within one magic over the last few

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.600
years and

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.410
and some the successes we've had this
been it's been a great great opportunity

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.050
for us to

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.410
really really help our air is the
industry where there was a demand

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.350
I think that when you start with capture
cards you you really focusing on the

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.350
area that you're

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.470
most proficient at which was the post
production area and then with

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.250
acquisitions lied when she was all

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.030
um and office acquisitions with the 8m
production switchers

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.860
and then obviously more recently was
sent I'll what does it start to open up

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.810
your imagination into all these new
areas are you keen

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.340
you can take that and existing
technology and just emphasize it'll make

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.270
it slightly better

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.360
also as well drop on this attitude that
we've got as well of

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.480
I'm answer that the entry a barrier
railey which is making sure this most

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.690
affordable for everybody

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.040
I think that one the greatest challenges
are you having any business when y'all

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.580
make why we are manufacturing products
is not

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.910
you set the price too high and that
means that

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.510
nobody ever really get the opportunity
to work with that perot's we very much

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.160
hold

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.319
in value the quality on the
accessibility and obviously that cost

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.440
and I think that's what was work very
well for Israel wanna problems that

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.019
you've got

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.000
when you start to diversify wildly issue
outside your comfort zone

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.570
Anderson chance to stop falling to the
crotch and I look at the

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.210
the shipping delays with the commerce is
a classic example there was something

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.190
new for the company and some other
cameras took a whole lot longer

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.490
design and release them were conducted
you run the risk

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.570
I'll to me too much into any different
areas in too many plates bulging at the

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.180
same time should I don't think is so
much about china balance too many plays

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.280
I think it's about making sure that the
quality level up what you produce is

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.260
always at the highest possible level

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.600
arose as a as a manufacturer what we
don't want to do is deliver parts out

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.750
since the market

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.550
with with substandard quality you know
he can be shouted out thousand times

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.690
because something's a month or two
delayed

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.900
and people can be knocking on your door
saying when you gonna deliver it well we

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.970
owe all we owe our customers and we are
so ourselves the right ensured up

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.440
we deliver what we said we were gonna
deliver and which commits delivering a

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.310
quality

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.250
and furrows you know sometimes have to
take the rough with the smooth sometimes

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.410
has been delays

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.410
but most importantly for us is that we
don't deliver a product that is not what

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.950
we said we were gonna deliver

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.480
are you doing anything new for an AB
this year I'm sure there may be some

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.419
things it maybe even trust by

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.300
nobody will know I won't tell a soul you
can just whisper in my ear what you're

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.200
gonna do

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.710
amor I think he was gonna be greater
than AB this year is that people who

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.330
follow up on my cheek along that the
last few years

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.660
know that one magic an AB is got bigger
and bigger and bigger

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.840
as a love our announcements have been
craving crazy announcements

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.970
a I think perot's every time that we
week-old

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.730
ok so April and we look an AB we get a
bit of a factor

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.790
it sends a tingle down the spine and
make sure things yourself
