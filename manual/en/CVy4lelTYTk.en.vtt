Hey there Undertow viewers and spidey fans.

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.190
It's been a long time since I've gotten to
play a Spiderman game I've enjoyed.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.690
I mean, the last one I played was Spiderman
3 for Gamecube and I can't say I enjoyed that

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.620
one but I still go back and rock a little
Spiderman 2 every now and then.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.699
Now what always appealed to me about these
games, other than my love for Marvel, was

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.920
the fighting styles they have Spiderman using
with his web slinging abilities.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.059
And my spidey senses were tingling when I
found out that Spiderman: Edge of Time was

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.579
coming out.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:13.590
And this was Spideyâ€™s chance for some redemption
for me.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.450
Now in edge of time you start out in some
crazy sequence and throughout the game are

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.920
going back and forth as either future Spiderman,
aka Miguel O'Hara or the amazing Spiderman,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.860
the man, the myth, the legend, Peter Parker.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.780
After a mishap in 2099 with a time machine
everything goes crazy.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.800
Also Eddie Brock on top of all that has gone
off the deep end again and anything you do

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.629
in the past seems to affect the future whether
you're opening a door or unlocked a security

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:45.629
code.

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:51.310
The coolest factor in all of this gameplay
before I get into any bad was the actual storyline

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.330
and the ability Spiderman had to speak with
future Spiderman, or vice versa.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.420
The voice acting for Peter Parker was done
well and the two communicating adds to the

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:17.590
feel that the game and makes it more interesting.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.370
The actual gameplay is very short in the game
was only a few hours long which is the bad

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.370
side.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.420
But I feel you can still replay the game a
few times and play the other modes such as

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.569
the challenge mode to make up for that.

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.960
Combat in this game was easy to get the hang
of and you very much could button mash your

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.569
way to success in certain situations.

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.710
However there are really spectacular graphics
in the combat as far as the ability to slow

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.840
time and use other special abilities against
your opponents.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.430
I also enjoyed the use of your y button when
you wanted to throw some badass web attacks

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.560
at the enemies.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.840
Generally your enemies are cyborg looking
guys who want to shoot at you so it's also

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.590
best to shoot some quick web shots at them
as well while taking out the other people

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.959
in the mob you're currently fighting.

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.200
Boss fights gets very repetitive also in this
game as well as you wondering around collecting

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.010
keys off enemies you fight to open the next
door you need to go through.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.660
The movement of Spiderman with the Xbox controller
kind of bugged me.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.240
I think there should have been a way to invert
or not invert it if you wanted to but going

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.530
into the options in game you notice it doesn't
seem to have a way for you to do so.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.150
I feel that would've made climbing on the
walls and the fall sequences a bit less frustrating.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.709
The levels in edge of time are very pretty
as far as their futuristic and mechanical

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.230
design goes and are great to look at but it
almost gets a little repetitive.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.209
This was a feeling I didn't enjoy too much
as I kind of was hoping for more iconic Spiderman

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.280
places to be in this game but the levels didn't
stop me from enjoying this.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.099
But throughout the levels you'll go through
tasks that are a little bit challenging such

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.610
as when you're free falling as future Spiderman
and clunking into stuff on your way down almost

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.819
seems unavoidable.

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:12.099
I can't say this game made me 100% satisfied
but it was an enjoyable game for the most

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.350
part aside from my frustrations with a few
flaws in the game.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.259
I'm just really hoping the next Spiderman
game is a little bit longer with more replay

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:34.119
value.
