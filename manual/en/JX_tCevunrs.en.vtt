Hey everybody! This is Randy Santel, "Atlas"
with Atlas &amp; Zeus Promotions. I'm pumped!

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.740
I was here last year and I'm back again. I'm
in Glasgow, Scotland. I'm at The Ark. I'm

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.400
going for win #9 of my Europe trip. I'm at
the Ark, taking on their "Ark-AOS" Burger

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.400
Challenge! It's got 5 burger patties (6 ounces
each), we got chili on top, delicious lettuce,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:39.520
onion rings, and surrounded by a moat of nachos
and cheese. I've got 45 minutes to do the

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.000
challenge. They just started this food challenge
not too long ago. About 12 people had tried,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.730
with 2 people winning so far. The record is
by a girl who finished it just over 44 minutes.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.110
For those who have watched my videos, you
know what's going to happen today. Lets get

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:00.110
this thing down! If I win I get a free t-shirt
from The Ark and I get this meal free, and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.200
If I set the record I'll get a nice beer too,
so lets get it going!

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.300
Alright, lets get this thing down. I don't
want the cheese to cool down, so I'm going

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.800
to start with the nachos first and let the
burgers cool. Lets go! One, two, three!

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.600
Less than six minutes in - Nachos are basically
down. Lets get these five burger patties.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.640
Very good nachos. Very good cheese. Hopefully
this chili is just as good!

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:40.900
11:40 - Just got this wee little burger left.
Lets get it down in under 15 minutes.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.700
Alright, going to have win #9 of the trip,
on day 10. Very, very good burger. That was

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.100
probably the 2nd time I ever had nachos with
my meal, rather than just a nacho challenge.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.209
The record was just over 44 minutes, you have
45 minutes to do it. Very, very good burger.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:25.209
Record is now under 15 minutes!

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.900
14:33! For setting the record, they're going
to get me a beer. I'm also getting a t-shirt,

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.530
and I got that awesome meal for free! Thanks
for watching!

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.130
Hey everybody! Randy Santel here, just wanted
to thank you guys for watching me beat the

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:00.600
ARK-AOS Burger at The Ark in downtown Glasgow.
Awesome challenge! I won in a record 14:33.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:09.900
Got to sign my name at the top of the list.
For winning, The Ark gave me this sweet Scotland

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.100
flag. Very, very proud to have that. I also
have one of their t-shirts, so I get to add

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.300
that to my collection. I also got that meal
free, they're going to get me a beer, and

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.160
the cook said since I beat that food challenge
in under 15 minutes I'm going to get a free

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.530
dessert too! Very, very good challenge. Win
#9 of the trip. Thanks for watching!
