hi I'm Peg from sony and I'm going to
show you an incredibly easy and useful

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.340
application available on the Sony
Tablet S called the remote control

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.210
this app allows you to replace your existing
remotes for your audio and video

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.460
products with a single remote
application available right on the tablet

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.340
so let's go ahead and show you how this works

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.120
from the Home screen open the remote control application

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.770
tap on Register device

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.320
you can select either the Easy registration option

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.220
which is the recommended setup

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.500
or the Learn from a remote control option

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.500
this option is used when your device is
not listed as a category or a manufacturer

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.540
I'm going to show you how to use the Easy registration

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.530
to begin

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.760
tap on Easy registration

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.230
and then select Next

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.630
tap on Category

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.380
to see all the product devices listed

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.160
simply use your finger to swipe up and down
to scroll through the entire list

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.880
once you've found your device just tap on that

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.320
now select the manufacturer

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:34.140
again you can use your finger to scroll up and down
through the list to select the manufacturer

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.160
remember if you can't find the category
or the manufacturer of your device

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.959
go back to the previous screen

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.250
and select Learn from a remote control

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.850
you can send the most frequently used
commands such as changing volume or

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.040
changing channels by making a gesture

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.750
such as flicking or tapping without
looking at the screen

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.770
select the features you want

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.540
to send with gestures by tapping here

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.640
my options for gestures are Volume only

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.279
Volume &amp; Channels Volume &amp; Playback Controls 
or No Gestures at all

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:17.529
just tap on the option you want

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:19.919
select Next

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.269
now I'm ready to test it

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.919
tap on Remote control test

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:32.009
I can now change the volume of the tv

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:37.389
using the tablets remote control app

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:42.339
when you are done testing it just tap on Finish test

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:45.639
and then Finish

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.639
you will now see that your device is registered

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.519
you can register up to five devices

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.339
to register and other device

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:57.179
tap on Register device and repeat the same process

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:59.049
