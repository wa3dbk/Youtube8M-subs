00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.490
I started painting graffiti during the 90's

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.170
but back then I was very young.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.220
Since the first time I painted graffiti I have been stuck in the graffiti culture.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.290
The big difference from when I started painting graffiti is that nowadays I can choose the time

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.510
that I want to be engrossed by it and the time that I don't want to be engrossed by it.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.880
Graffiti is always fascinating me in different ways

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.090
and the reason why I have continued painting since the first day is because graffiti has become a part of me.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.280
During the time I grew up, since I was a kid

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.370
I have dedicated my entire life to the graffiti culture.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.550
It has affected which friends I have and 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.690
where I have chosen to live. 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.750
Graffiti has brought an incredible amount of positive thing to my life

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.930
Of course it has taken a lot of time from me

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.090
but if you are dedicated to something it will take a lot of your time. 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.460
And I think that it should take a lot of your time if you really are dedicated to it.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.650
For me it's not important to be focused on painting just walls or just trains etc. 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.210
I think that it is pretty common in the graffiti culture

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.390
that writers are focused on painting a specific thing.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.480
I don't feel that I need to be focused on a specific thing

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.650
because I get a kick from whatever i'm painting on.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.840
It can be from painting on a canvas, a wall or on a train.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.030
Yeah, pretty much from everything that I paint on.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.190
One thing doesn't need to exclude the other.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.380
Sometimes I like to describe my creating like a cake with a lot of pieces

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.520
and if one of the pieces are missing, for an example that I don't paint

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.740
on trains or that I don't paint

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.920
on canvas a lot of my creativity goes away so I really feel that I need to paint a lot of different things.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.110
As long as it's about color, 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.300
it's fun.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.340
The graffiti culture has given my a lot of different friends

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.470
and it has given my a lot of good trips to different countries

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.680
and it has put me in situations that I never would have ended up in without graffiti.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.850
It has also given me the ability to see a step further sometimes and that I need to be

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.040
aware of the consequences my choices may lead to.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.100
I'm always very devising.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.490
For me graffiti is a lot of the "cake" that I spoke about earlier. 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.670
It really depends on which kind of graffiti i'm painting,

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.810
It can be about different

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.020
places I have been to 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.200
different smells and the feeling of being creative

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.400
and create something.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.580
The friendship with the people that you paint together with is also a very big part of the graffiti culture for me.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.760
The graffiti culture is kind of introvert, 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.980
it is very hard to explain what the graffiti culture is about to someone who is not a part of it. 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.200
If you're not a part of the culture and don't have any insight to it

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.400
I can really understand that you don't understand anything about it.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.580
I think that can be one of the reasons

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.760
why it is so easy to get stuck in.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.060
It is a problem and a strength that the graffiti culture has according to me.
