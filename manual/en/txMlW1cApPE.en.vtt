00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.990
All right so we got our dressed up soft shell
crabs here and we've got all the lungs out

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.559
of them and gills if you will. We have taken
out the innards as well. This is what we have

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.640
left. I've left the top on because you can
eat this and we are going to eat the shell

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.700
and everything. That's the beauty of soft
shell crabs. You can eat the whole animal.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.370
We've taken off the faces as we showed you
in the previous video. There is meat in the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.590
claws as well as the legs and we are going
to eat all that too. So there are two different

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.920
ways we can bread these and what we are going
to do is I am going to sear them in a non-stick

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.969
Teflon pan with some clarified butter on the
stove top behind me. Some folks like to just

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.649
dust these in flour so we are going to do
one just that way actually and I've got some

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.210
straight run of the mill all purpose flour
here. I've done no seasonings or anything.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.690
The reason being this is a delicacy in a sense
that it is real subtle and it is a real nice

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.860
subtle seafood flavor so we don't want to
adulterate it with a bunch of seasoning and

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.909
things of that nature. So again I am just
going to dress this in the flour and after

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.369
I've got a nice covering all over this fellow,
I am just going to kind of shake off that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.210
residual flour and again I am using some gloves
here, some Latex gloves that helps a whole

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.469
bunch. So this stuff doesn't stick to you
and at the same time I am not leaving finger

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:34.140
prints in this crab. So I've got a nice even
dusting of breading there. So we'll set him

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.380
off to the side. Now this guy we are going
to do the 3 step breading process which I

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.079
showed you in previous videos. So I am going
to dust him in flour first and then right

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:52.929
next door in the second bowl, I've got a milk
and egg wash. We are going to dunk him in

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:58.219
that and I've just got a store bought corn
mill mix. The seafood mis that you can use

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:06.850
for shrimp or oysters or fish even and I am
going to finish breading him in that. We'll

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:15.489
show you the two finished products and the
differences they are in, in a bit. Sea food

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:23.260
doesn't take long to cook anyway, these won't
take long. I'm just going to use a little

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.099
bit of clarified butter so we will get this
breaded and we will flip him over and we will

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:38.239
return shortly and show you how to finish
these off on the stove top and non-stick Teflon

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.480
pan with some clarified butter.
