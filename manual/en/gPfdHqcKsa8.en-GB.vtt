Maria Doulton: Baselworld is the biggest watch
and jewellery show in the world, so if you

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.560
want to see amazing things, this is the place
to come. I've spent the week here, and I've

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.210
picked out those jewels and watches that I
think will truly amaze you.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.190
There was one thing that everybody was talking
about at this show, and it's the Graff Hallucination

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.150
Watch. Made up of coloured diamonds, it's
worth $55 million and probably the most valuable

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.499
jewel on display at Baselworld. It is truly
amazing.

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:36.010
Jacob &amp; Co. takes jewellery to places it's
never been before. The Rare Touch Bolero jacket

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.239
literally drapes you in gold, and you wear
your jewellery in a very different way.

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.190
The Grappoli watches from de GRISOGONO are
just exploding with colour, which is very

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.250
typical of this Genevan jewellery house. And
as with everything that de GRISOGONO does,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.010
there is a touch of lightness, making these
both playful as well as highly precious and

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.680
certainly attention-grabbing watches.
This watch is called the Emerald Cluster,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.410
and it brings together both Harry Winston's
love for the emerald cut as well as the famous

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:14.360
cluster design that this house is known for.
This watch packs an impressive 73 carats of

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.220
diamonds, and to see it on is just spectacular.
How would you feel having this snake winding

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.860
around your neck? Shimmering with sapphires
and diamonds, this is the work of Roberto

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.020
Coin.
If it's a tiara you're after, then Garrard

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.000
is the place to head, and this one, called
the Timeless, has 32 carats of diamonds. If

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.530
you don't feel like wearing a tiara every
night then you can take it apart and it becomes

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.880
a necklace and a pair of earrings.
Mikimoto, the king of pearls, each year presents

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.030
some spectacular jewels, and these masterpieces
show just what can be done with pearls. This

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.420
necklace, made of pearls and diamonds, quite
literally drapes over the entire body.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.200
If you ever thought you needed a watch to
find out whether he loves you or loves you

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.700
not then Christophe Claret has created a watch
that spins randomly to tell you the truth

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.500
about his emotions towards you.
With so many amazing watches and jewels at

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.859
Baselworld 2014, what will they think of next?
