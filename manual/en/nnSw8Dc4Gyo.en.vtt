00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.730
with have found something new in our

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.799
or depth look at this

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:08.049
reminisce

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.329
otherwise known as a party for short
acute little named for her

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:15.250
and she was actually eight-year i'm
sorry million years

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.740
all within lucy

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.189
anxious for four point four million
years ago

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:20.619
and uh...

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.599
he goes

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.230
in what length that we thought that we
had started walking two legs

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.449
when we went to the savannah

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.050
no uh... and the grasslands but no she's
in the woods which is what got too lax

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.370
and she has a lot of eight like features
publishing also has human-like features

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.659
on the look most important one is a
walking on two legs immediately user has

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:42.030
for other things

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.230
what useful climb on trees

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.940
so she's got a little about

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.160
that's why some people referring for as
the missing link

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.450
that's what he said

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.280
ic in a layman's terms a transitional
fossil transitioning from eight to human

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.859
right although as i explained we all
transaction to wherever worker

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.080
the project

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.400
why did she while she still in the words

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.190
if you prefer

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.410
representing

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.140
all that

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.750
people uh... people expect the animals
within

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.870
ordered the tickets remedies

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.050
species now

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.080
but whatever you want to call vicky
amily

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.610
family not bad

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.850
damnit genomic talk show host outside

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.330
bilateral are so we moved forward

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.200
uh... in this slight oversimplification
so but why did she uh...

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.140
in the words and walking out to where
the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.530
right and only the ones your at easier
requirement using all for leads

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.850
well uh... scientist uh... status
because

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.700
of the mails in a speech

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.020
the problem was

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.250
normally in evolution what happens as a
woman shows that she's

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.560
populating in some

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.630
in a lot of cases in some obviously
right at n and her generals my swell up

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.319
where they might become red

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.390
uh... is that cool to have the males in
the species

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.639
hey it's time to hit ok i through the
world a simple fact right

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:07.359
uh...

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:12.110
and so that's when the big mails in this
species with the larger canine teeth are

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.030
stronger

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.960
comment compete with one another and
they wind up with the biggest in the top

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.570
us one was a winning over the woman and
then you get more and more alpha jeans

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.469
out there

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:22.629
uh... so in order to compete

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.359
the ones that were not as big came up
with the idea of hate

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.459
why don't buy bring her

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.310
may be off

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.159
curry favor that point

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.309
kinda reminds me of a and call them

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:37.889
where we think about the good

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:38.519
and this is

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.559
this is totally true okay this was great
an amazing about

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.139
and so why are they walk into a fee

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.659
to be able to hold the food

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:52.549
so they would go pick up the fruits
whatever else not not sit cetera in

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.650
order be able to hold that they go
walking two feet which is otherwise not

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.319
is advantageous so may bring it over

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.059
now this lease the more monogamous
relationships at least two evolutionary

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:07.629
advantage for those that particular
kinds of mails okay

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.700
or all the species transition in this
case

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.929
this particular species transitions

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:18.700
so now the problem is the women could if
they have obvious signs of ovulation

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.600
obvious the males and two themselves

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.889
you know that's great food really
appreciate it

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:28.149
and while he's not working in the middle
of relational it

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:29.809
career right

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.239
right

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.109
it that and they go and mate with with
the bigger debt is right and there's a

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.269
win win for them

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.279
but in

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:38.269
as are

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.529
as holistic means developed visa line

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:45.109
uh... e inauguration was not

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.529
physically apparent in women

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:51.039
now you know you have your cycles et
cetera anger to learn the cycles right

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:53.329
but it's not like there's a big glowing
sign saying

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.359
now enter birthday

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.719
but the fact that forgot it's physically
agree but i corrected

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.489
he then has to stay with somebody

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.969
throughout the whole exercise if you're
offended

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:09.769
so the guy who brings her food there i
like this kama ke come around great

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.430
because i don't know what i'm andrea
lady

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.119
i need to him they hit me

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:18.769
distorted by picking it up is the better
but that anyway

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.919
uh... and i can't have inheriting quit

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.180
recapping

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.050
evolutionary advantage goes to the
people walking on

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.020
males walking and compete

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.990
and carrying a food to the web

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.680
so that's why we transition to walking
into feet and that's where party comes

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.560
in the picture right that's when they
start collecting the food and using the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.060
two feet it's ever

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.510
but now carino islip and i might even
gotten small details a little law rights

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.090
because family cetera

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.419
and i know it's a gross
oversimplification but that's the bottom

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.889
line of how it happened

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.949
and then you've you look at all that
pineda well wired and

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.789
god just at the rate of from had a
mandate he in

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.009
artillery but

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.939
oakbrook about that's not how it
happened

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:03.819
it's still broccoli
