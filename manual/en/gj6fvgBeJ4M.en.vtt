00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.120
So, what is Horses Inside Out?

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.839
We all have the best interest of our horses
a heart.

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.769
Whether they are Olympic athletes, much loved
ponies or anything else in between

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:19.170
As a sports and remedial physiotherapist and
anatomist, passionate about both the welfare

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.070
of our horses and correct anatomical training,
Gillian travels the world.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.180
Through her talks, demonstrations, courses,
articles, books and DVD’s she shows how

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.460
understanding the anatomy of the horse can
have a profound and beneficial effect on his

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.620
training and management.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.820
By painting the muscular skeletal and other
anatomical systems on the side of a horse

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.989
we can see and appreciate what is happening
on the inside, outside.

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.539
Anatomy and biomechanics are brought to life
in a unique, memorable, understandable and

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:51.539
applicable way.

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.539
Riders and trainers, at all levels including
such legends as Christopher Bartle, Richard

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.890
Davison, Lucinda Green, Wilfred and Laura
Bechtolsheimer and Patrick Print all approve

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.890
and recommend.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.140
With horses we never stop learning - it is
a passion.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.960
No matter how much we think we know - there
is always more.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.260
By coming to or arranging a Horses Inside
Out demonstration you can; improve performance,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.040
enhance suppleness, and manage your horse
even more effectively.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.680
A deeper understanding can also reduce the
risk of injury which can result in less time

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.470
off and even fewer vet’s bills.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.230
And that’s not all.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:32.310
We organise seminars and conferences inviting
leading speakers from all over the world,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.900
We provide numerous different educational
opportunities for owners, trainers, therapists,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.830

of the structure and function, we arrange

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.280
