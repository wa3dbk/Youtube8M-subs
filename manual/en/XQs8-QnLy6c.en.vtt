00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.250
RoboDK is a powerful offline simulator
for industrial robots.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.680
With RoboDK you've an access to our online library of
more than 200 robots.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.500
It's very easy to find your robot or select a new robot,
according to your project needs.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.800
You can select a robot by brand, payload, reach
and repeatability.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:36.420
You can also use a predefined set of tools or model your
own tools.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.800
You can double-click the robot and jog axis by axis in the robot panel.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.170
You can manually set the position of the tool with respect to the robot frame.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.270
Here you see how to change the robot configuration.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.860
You can visualize the
robot workspace for the wrist,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.350
the tool flange for your current tool.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.550
You can also drag and move any reference frame using the "Alt" key, such as the robot flange,

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.600
robot tool, or any other object reference.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:20.350
RoboDK provides a powerful and user-friendly way to create programs offline.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.020
You can move the robot to a target and create a new joint movement.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.280
RoboDK will automatically generate a new target that can be modified later.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.420
In this case the "Target 1" represents the
home target.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:42.500
You can repeat the same operations add other linear or circular movements, grab tools and other basic instructions.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.800
You can double-click your
program anytime and the robot will execute the sequence.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.650
RoboDK will warn
you if the movement can't be completed successfully.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.100
In this case joint five is
too close to zero degrees which is a robot singularity.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.530
You can easily select drag and move any target with the alt key and retry running the updated sequence.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.400
This allows improving the robot paths to
keep them away from singularities.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.440
Another way to move the targets while
keeping our path

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.150
intact would be using a reference frame. We can easily add a reference frame and

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.750
make the three targets over path depend
on the reference frame.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.020
if we drag and drop the targets, using the SHIFT-key, the
original path will be kept intact.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.370
We can update the program to use the new
reference frame and retry executing the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.720
same program. Now we can easily move the
reference frame and our targets are automatically updated.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.550
The icon of the targets will warn us if
that target is reachable as we move our reference.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.100
Finally, we can right-click the program
and output the appropriate program for

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.290
our robot. RoboDK will take care of handling the syntax appropriate to your

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.290
robot brand.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.200
RoboDK provides an example of a basic
pick-and-place operation. If you run this

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.230
first example you can see an ABB-robot,
moving five parts from one table to

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.370
another. With RoboDK it's very easy to
grab and drop a part with the tool.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.400
The robot will move the target selected,
depending on the active reference frame.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.680
In this case it can be either "Table 1"
or "Table 2". Finally, we can output the robot

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.070
program for the ABB-robot.
