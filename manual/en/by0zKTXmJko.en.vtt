00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.759
I'm Julia Szabo, also known as a Pet Reporter,
and I am the ""Living with Dogs"" columnist

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.220
for dogster.com.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.920
I've actually written 6 books and I'm hard
at work on my next one.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.370
It will be about about dogs -- that's as much
as I can say right now.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.950
I love dogs and I think nobody's life is complete
without one.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.270
So I'm here to tell you about a variety of
different dogs breeds that might suit your

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.270
lifestyle.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.400
I hope you'll adopt one soon.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.100
The Great Dane really is a great dog and there's
so much to say in terms of popular culture

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.910
Uh, the Great Dane really kind of rules.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.030
The Great Dane has really become part of our
collective American family thanks to the cartoon

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.420
strip, Marmaduke, there's, there's Marmaduke
the movie, but, there's also television shows,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.170
there's the famous Scooby-Doo, and to judge
from Scooby-Doo, you might not think that

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.879
this dog is super intelligent, but he is,
he's a wonderful, wonderful dog.

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.259
Um, he is also a lot of fun; he's very gentle
despite his size.

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.299
He's known as the ""Gentle Giant"".

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.400
The Great Dane is also super handsome, nothing
really as quite as majestic as a Great Dane

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.610
just sort of standing they're, looking princely.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.240
They are just like miniature horses practically.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.240
They're that big.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.480
They can get to be as big as 180 pounds.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.240
So, you're looking at a super gentle dog that
is big that doesn't always know he's big.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.970
So, as a puppy, maybe, you don't want to have
him on the bed, and in your lap, because he's

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.670
going to get used to that, and, what are you
going to do when he's 200 pounds?

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.189
So, you know, if you're ready for a 200-pound
lap dog, fine.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:46.450
Otherwise, Do work in terms of training with
having him have his own dog bed and, and,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.450
his own chair.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.020
Even, a lot of Great Dane owners give their
own dogs their own char.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.240
The only downside to having a Great Dane is
their short life spanned.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.229
Sadly, because they're, such a giant breed
they only live to, about 8 or 9 years old.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.990
It's always hard to say goodbye, to our dog
friends, but it's especially hard if a, I

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.649
dare say, twice as hard when they only live
to 8 or 9 years old.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.290
So, um, you have to sort of steal yourself
for that when you fall in love with a Great

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.510
Dane, because there, time on Earth really
is limited and you want to make it the best

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.529
you can.
