00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.499
So you're an antique dealer and you're not
quite sure of the essentials that you need

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:07.840
behind your counter. I'm Blake Kennedy with
Kennedy Brothers Estate Services and I'm here

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.360
to help. Every antique dealer doesn't necessarily
need to know how to refinish furniture, how

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.490
to strip furniture, but if you knew how to
do a little touch ups and how to make that

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.880
piece just a little bit better. Behind every
counter at the antique shop, there are things

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.510
that you should have. Things that you can't
live without are these things that are called

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.539
touch-up markers. By Guardsman. You can't
get these at any Home Depot or Lowe's, but

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.530
they come in different colors depending on
the color of the wood. If you have a little

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.720
scratch on your piece of furniture, you know
pick out the color, it's just like putting

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.680
in a little marker. But you got to have the
color markers for touch-ups. Another thing

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.610
that you got to have is scratch cover, good
Olde English scratch cover with a nice cotton

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.770
rag, you know you put that on there and it
just covers up the whole surface. Make sure

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.930
you don't do it too greasy because when people
put their hands on things, they always say,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.200
if they put their hand on a piece of furniture
and they keep that hand there, then you have

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.059
a pretty good shot at selling that piece.
But if they put it on there and it feels sticky

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.310
and tacky, you know make sure you wipe up
all that, all this scratch cover on it, but

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.510
it'll seal that scratch nicely. Another thing
if a wood feels dry, it's just like skin,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.760
you got to make sure you oil it and put some
nice orange oil on it, but I also like to

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.979
put a nice wax on it, a paste finish on that.
I like to get this special dark - I use a

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.600
lot of dark woods - but you can get a nice
neutral color, but just look to see what color

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.979
you're going to buy, and just again, wipe
it on all over if it's nice and dry, then

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.630
put a good wax on it, always have a pair of
gloves around if you're working with chemicals.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.299
If you need a nice smooth finish I always
have extra fine steel wool with me, I like

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.250
to use steel wool more than sandpaper, 'cause
sandpaper really works at the wood, steel

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.010
wool just kind of knocks off all the imperfections
that that piece has on it. But always have

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.920
these little things behind your counter, always
have a good cleaner behind the counter, because

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.070
everything needs to be touched up, a good
dust rag, just keep all our furniture and

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.190
all your figurines and everything you're trying
to sell clean and fresh looking. I hope that

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.289
helps. I'm Blake Kennedy.
