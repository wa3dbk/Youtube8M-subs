focusing on the the alleged haunting of

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.549
Mayo Hall.

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.619
I felt like somebody was standing over me and I had to like put my head under my covers and go to bed.

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.670
It was so... It was the weirdest thing ever.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.699
I've walked past there and I heard screams coming from it.

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.289
So I just believe it. 
Weird stuff like doors opening and lights flickering, and alarm

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.009
clocks being changed.

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.339

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:31.560

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.800

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.540
