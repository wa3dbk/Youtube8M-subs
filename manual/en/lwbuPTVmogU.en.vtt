00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What is The Meatrix?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Here you go, Leo.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Psst, Leo.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Who are you? And how did you know my name?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I am Moopheus, and I know a lot about you.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Have you heard of The Meatrix?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The Meatrix?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Do you want to know what it is?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Ok.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The Meatrix is all around you Leo.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It is the story we tell ourselves about where our meat and animal products come from.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This family farm is a fantasy, Leo.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Take the blue pill and stay here in the fantasy, take the red pill and I'll show you the truth.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Welcome to the real world.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Wow. What is this horrible place?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is a factory farm, Leo. Places like this are where most eggs, milk and meat come from.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
How did this happen?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'll show you.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:37.000
In the mid 20th century, greedy agriculture corporations began modifying sustainable family farming to maximize their profits at great cost to both humans and animals. Factory farming was born.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Animals are packed as closely together as possible. Most never see sunlight, touch ground or get fresh air. Many can't even turn around.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.000
These cruel conditions cause fights and disease amongst the animals. To fix this, the corporate machine began systematic mutilations, practices such as debeaking chickens,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and they started adding a constant dosage of antibiotics to their feed, just to keep these poor wretches alive.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:16.000
This overuse of antibiotics breed super strains of resistant disease-causing germs, every day we get closer to an epidemic that cannot be stopped.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Eeeuw! What's that smell?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:32.000
12 million pounds of excrement! This pollutes the air and ground water. That's why communities near factory farms often suffer from high levels of related sicknesses.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Well, it smells like shhhhhâ€¦

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And what is more, Factory Farming corporations have been destroying communities and mistreating their workers for decades. Since 1950, over 2 million small hog farms have disappeared. If they continue at this rate there'll be no real independent family farms left.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
That is the Meatrix, Leo. The Lie we tell ourselves about where our food comes from.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But it's not too late, there is a resistance.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Count me in!

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
How do we stop them Moopheus?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We are going to spread the word. But it's you, the consumer who has the real power! Don't support the factory farming machine! There is a world of alternatives!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and I'll show you what you can do to escape the Meatrix.
