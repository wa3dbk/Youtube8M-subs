00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:05.790
Hey guys!

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.090
I'm Sonia, and welcome
to Pantene's New Hair New

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.020
You series, where we give women hair
makeovers when they need it most.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.710
Now, today we're talking to Nerissa.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.740
And she's just about to graduate
college and move across the country,

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.845
so we want to give her a new
style, and this is her story.

00:00:20.845 --> 00:00:22.150
Hi Nerissa.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.170
Hi Sonia.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.740
So, I know we found you in one of our
comments in our last New Hair New You

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.280
video, so welcome.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.930
Thank you.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:30.940
Thanks for having me.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.310
Tell us a little bit about your story.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.900
Well, I've lived in New England my whole
life, and as a transition from college,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.080
I plan on moving to
California from Boston.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.876
So it's a big step
and a big jump for me.

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:48.680
But with that change, I feel like
I want to just change up my style

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.085
and transition into a
new lifestyle, I guess.

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:57.170
So speaking of style,
what are you looking for?

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.730
I'm looking to cut my hair
really short, and in that case

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.250
I'm going to donate my hair.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.750
Really?

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.060
Yeah.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.560
Awesome.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.980
I donated it once a few years ago,
and I figure I might as well share

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.300
the love of my hair.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.640
And if I'm going to do
that, I might as well

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.892
go big or go home, really, so I'm going
to go really, really short and maybe

00:01:14.892 --> 00:01:15.850
something asymmetrical.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.070
So, we'll see.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.580
Well, you're in luck, because we have
Pantene celebrity stylist Danilo here,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.398
and I can't wait to introduce you guys.

00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:23.314
I'm so excited!

00:01:23.314 --> 00:01:24.690
Yay!

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.354
Nerissa, this is Danilo.

00:01:26.354 --> 00:01:26.854
Hi!

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:27.596
Hi Nerissa.

00:01:27.596 --> 00:01:28.096
How are you?

00:01:28.096 --> 00:01:31.780
Now, she's got really great
hair, as you can see, super long.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.405
And she's planning to
donate for her second time.

00:01:34.405 --> 00:01:34.905
So--

00:01:34.905 --> 00:01:35.970
That's incredible.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.691
--good for you.

00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:37.190
Thank you.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.880
She's looking for an edgy look.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.380
Yep.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.830
Something a little bit more trendy,
something really fashionable

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:43.729
and just new.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:44.270
Sounds great.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.560
It would look great on you.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.060
Thank you.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.170
I love the idea of taking it a
little asymmetrical and shorter.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.982
First of all, you're going
to give a great donation.

00:01:52.982 --> 00:01:54.182
It's about eight inches.

00:01:54.182 --> 00:01:54.890
That's fantastic.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.300
Yeah.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.000
Well, I'm going to leave you guys to it.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.082
So have fun, and I'll
see you guys later!

00:02:00.082 --> 00:02:00.582
All right.

00:02:00.582 --> 00:02:01.074
Excellent.

00:02:01.074 --> 00:02:01.574
Bye!

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:28.626
How exciting!

00:02:28.626 --> 00:02:29.660
Hello!

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.496
Oh my goodness!

00:02:31.496 --> 00:02:33.002
It's so much shorter on this side.

00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:34.376
So what are you going to do next?

00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:37.150
Well, now I'm going distill
the cut, really build

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.640
the drama that she's looking
for, the asymmetrical drama.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.140
I've already calculated that
a little with her donation.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.310
We really have somewhat
of a reveal to see.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.432
Oh wow, yeah.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:47.890
It's got a longer side on one side.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:48.730
Do you feel lighter?

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.522
It feels great.

00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:51.418
Like angels.

00:02:51.418 --> 00:02:56.006
Well, I'm going to let him finish the
style, and I'll come right back, OK?

00:02:56.006 --> 00:02:57.161
All right.

00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:00.160
So, Nerissa, while you were at the
shampoo bowl, I gave you a treatment.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.395
It's a Pantene Pro-V detox rehab.

00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:07.410
And it's something that's really great
to do for your hair once a month,

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.500
just get your scalp happy.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.000
Mm-hmm.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.125
So now I'm just going to
clean you up with your cut

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.875
and start getting the drama
in that you're begging for.

00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:15.375
Perfect.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.790
So what should I do as far
as taking care of my hair?

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.250
Make sure you have a great regime,
hair regime, shampoo and conditioner.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.790
Mm-hmm.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.550
I love Pantene Beautiful
Lengths for many reasons.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.730
It echoes the cause
that you've donated to,

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.700
but also it really prepares hair
to be strong and grow out long.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.710
This is a trick that I
like to use a lot, which

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.500
is a leave-in heat protection.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.080
OK.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.180
It's a leave-in spray.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.030
It's going to give you emollience and
protection to your hair on any styling.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.501
Even if you're not going to style, it's
just a great way to reboot your hair.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.562
I pin the curls just
to get them to cool.

00:04:05.562 --> 00:04:06.062
Mm-hmm.

00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:07.010
It is.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.510
Oh wow!

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.100
And then you can start to
see I've got a body in it.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.970
Yeah.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.540
So what are some tips for
keeping my hair in place?

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.459
Well, for starters, I like to
take a little bit of mousse.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.849
Ultimately I'm using it, again, like
many people would use a gel or a spray.

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.265
I'll let it dry in this direction.

00:04:23.265 --> 00:04:27.670
And the great thing about these Pro-V
mousses is that they come right out,

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.690
and they don't flake.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.850
So they're going to
leave your hair shiny,

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.804
and yet structurally in the
direction I want though.

00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:43.124
Hey guys!

00:04:43.124 --> 00:04:43.624
Hello!

00:04:43.624 --> 00:04:45.097
Oh my goodness!

00:04:45.097 --> 00:04:46.870
It looks so good!

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.890
How do you feel?

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:48.810
I feel great.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.260
This is such a bold new look, and
I feel so mature now and really,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.940
really confident just in general.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.690
You look fabulous.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.189
Yeah.

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:58.464
And you should be even more
confident because you've

00:04:58.464 --> 00:04:59.964
given a gift with your hair as well.

00:04:59.964 --> 00:05:00.864
Very California.

00:05:00.864 --> 00:05:02.072
Thank you guys for having me.

00:05:02.072 --> 00:05:02.780
Thank you, Sonia.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.008
Thank you, Danilo.

00:05:04.008 --> 00:05:04.976
This is amazing.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.340
Wow.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.290
What an amazing transformation.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.840
Now she's definitely
ready for her big move.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.990
