Hi, I'm Stephanie with MENDA

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.900
and I'm here to demonstrate the difference between a One-Touch and Pure-Touch Pump.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.200
Here we have a One-Touch
Pump.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.100
When you first receive your pump, you are going to want to prime the pump.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.000
To prime the pump, all you do is just unscrew the cap...

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.500
Pour in your desired solvent to
the desired level.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.300
When you fill it up to where you want it to be in the bottle,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.000
screw the cap back on...

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
...and continuously push down on the pump until the water [or other solvent] shows up in the dish.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.800
Since this is a One-Touch pump,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.800
it has easy access and all you need to do is just use one hand,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.300
leaving the other hand accessible for other things.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.200
The One-Touch pump has the liquid
coming out from underneath the bottom of the dish,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.100
And settling in the dish.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.800
If you don't use all the liquid that is inside of the dish,

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.319
the liquid will eventually seep down into the bottle with the remaining liquid.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:12.439
The One-Touch pump also comes with a locking
cap [version], called the Take-Along.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.200
This is our Pure-Touch pump.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.000
The Pure-Touch Pump is special

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
because the liquid from inside of the bottle comes out from under the mushroom head.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.200
When you get your bottle, you are going to want to prime it as well.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.800
You will see how the liquid comes out from underneath [the mushroom head] rather than from coming up

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.229
[into the dish] as the One-Touch does.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.779
The Pure-Touch is called "pure" because the mushroom head does not allow the liquid to

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:57.000
go back into the bottle, contaminating the
rest of the liquid.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.000
The Pure-Touch also comes with a locking cap [version], just like the One-Touch, but it is called the "Pure-Take".

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.219
