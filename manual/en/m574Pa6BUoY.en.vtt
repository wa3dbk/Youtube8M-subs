00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:13.170
welcome to Sodegaura Forest Raceway for Dsport's first drive of the Scion FR-S
0:00:13.170,0:00:20.170
s

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.849
Today we're going to have the opportunity to drive some manual and automatic versions of the scion FR-s

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.570
in both the left hand and right drive configurations 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.210
thanks to the weather we'll be driving in both

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.390
a wet track and dry track during the day

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.260
let's go see how it does

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.140
critical one of the here

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.710
yet used that word

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.710
we were

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.550
b

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.550
lindsay

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.170
sc

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.450
the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.290
My name is Tetsuya Tada, Chief Engineer of FR-S

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.290
I made us our slogan in the development

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.219
build by passion

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.660
not by committee

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.250
president Akio Toyoda, 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.710
always support this kind of vehicle in Toyota's lineup

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.140
when you drive it, you can feel the meaning of
built by passion

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.140
that neither of them but lost

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.900
I didn't really get to open it up with the vehicle

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.650
overall pretty good, i didn't get loose at any one point

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.079
uh... i would like to try.  The track is wet so you know

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.059
taking it a bit easy but uh

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:18.699
The car shifts right, feels right, the clutch works well.  Steering inputs nice.  everything works well

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:22.539
well which is uh... you know you can't always say that

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:23.580
pretty nice piece

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.999
so we'll see what happens i'm looking forward to a future session later today and hopefully we willn't be 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:34.609
behind johnny who's just really slow

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:41.609
sis

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.489
well so far we been able to drive both the scion frs.  

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.559
both the right hand and left hand drive vehicles, both in manual

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:02.689
now we'll be testing out the automatic which does have paddle shifters as you see here

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:07.249
opposite of the Gt-r, they move with the steering wheel

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.219
we're going to be trying the VSC sport mode

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:14.639
now when we drove the right hand drive, we got an opportunity to get a little bit loose and play with the car

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:20.099
a bit more, and just see at the limit what the car does.  The tires, they did give you good feedback

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.299
they talked to you, let you know you're going a little to fast

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.549
and make adjustments based on that

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.169
everything it does, it does pretty well.  very good turn in
0:03:28.169,0:03:29.780
corner stability

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.869
great coming out of the turn
0:03:31.869,0:03:34.840
the car just does what you want it do, which is nice

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.680
scion has not released all of the specs on the 2013 scion frs, but we do know that power 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.650
will be delivered by a subaru  fa20 engine classified as 4ugse

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.659
4ugse

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.619
this 2 liter boxer platform 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:49.439
features both port and 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:50.839
direct fuel technology

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.269
the 86mm stroke and bore engine 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.399
delivers 200 horsepower and 7000 RPM, the chasis has been to take advantage

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:02.219
of the boxer's layout deliver a low center of gravity

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:08.029
with a twenty seven hundred (2700lb) wet weight, the frs sits at a center of gravity that's lower than the GT-R, 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:10.419
STi or Evo

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.749
with a fifty three forty seven weight balance

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:19.749
the FRS exhibits excellent track behavior 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:25.080
well there you go, the twenty thirteen scion FRs.  going to have to give it a big thumbs up 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.820
because

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.930
even with the automatic, you're not trading away that much

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.650
this is a car thats fun to take out on the track

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.290
i mean yeah you can't do a burnout still because it's an automatic.  you can't just drop that clutch and have that fun

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.470
but you can go out there on the racetrack

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.809
and it's just as fun as the manual but you're keeping your hands on the wheel

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:45.769
while final pricing has not been set

00:04:45.769 --> 00:04:50.989
we expect to see a base price of around 25 thousand

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:53.930
there simply might not be a better buy for anyone looking for a entry level sportscar

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.229
with a solid foundation to build upon
delivery is expected before the end of june 
0:04:59.229,0:05:01.500
this year.  Oh my god, this thing sticks on the road like a beast

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.990
