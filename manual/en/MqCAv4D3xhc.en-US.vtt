00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.000
I was such a mess
The other day

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I hurt myself to see
Oh... if you care

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.600
If you believe
Like cracks in the mirror

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:05.000
Oh, I slit my skin
'til I, I felt something real

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:13.500
Cause I was losing
Losing my reflection

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.500
There's a hero
In you

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.500
Inside of you
Oh, who resolved the down

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.400
But I'm asking why I'm still here
Standing in the rain

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.100
Did I fail you dear
Like painless suicide

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.000
You burried the cream
Beneath blood-red roses

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:17.500
Had life... life had just begun
I knew nothing could stay the same

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:26.000
But feeling, can feeling last
Forever?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
There's a hero
In you

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:42.100
Inside of you
Oh, who resolved the down

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:53.000
But I'm asking why I'm still here
Standing in the rain

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.500
They said there's a hero
In you, who'd flied with fears

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Who could set you free
From death

00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:25.800
From the world
In a world you've been left alone

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.500
There's a hero
In you

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:41.200
Inside of you
Oh, who resolved the down

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:48.200
But I'm asking why I'm still here
All by myself

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:56.000
Feeling the touch of red
From my skin

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:20.000
THE END
