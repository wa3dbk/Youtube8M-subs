00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Mutations - selection: the bacteria resist

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Aha, here’s our patient!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The patient has received all known antibiotic treatments to no effect!

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In conclusion: either he is not ill, or we have a new strain of microbes!

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Hmm! Or this could even just be a case of resistance to antibiotics. Let me explain...

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
When the body is infected by bacteria...

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
...it attempts to defend itself in several ways...

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
...by increasing its temperature...

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
...but mainly by using its immune system.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
As soon as a foreign body enters the organism, it’s detected straight away and alarm bells ring.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Lots of white blood cells come along to identify the culprits...

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
...and get rid of them.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But sometimes these defences are overwhelmed by bacteria.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
That’s when the illness really begins.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Luckily, since antibiotics were discovered, we can help patients protect themselves.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
These drugs destroy most bacteria,...

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
...or create a hostile environment for them.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Antibiotics soon became a quick-fix solution.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
For the slightest scratch, a course of antibiotics!!!

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It was so effective in preventing infections from developing...

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
...that the use of antibiotics increased...

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
...they became widely used to treat battery-farmed poultry and pigs.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But before long the illness returns...

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
...and antibiotic treatments suddenly stop working. What happened?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Well, before bacterial cells divide, they duplicate their genetic material.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
This material is composed of DNA.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Portions of the long molecule can hold precise information on the activity and development of the bacteria.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
These portions are what we call genes.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Each gene is composed of a sequence of four elements called nucleotides,...

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
...of which two are always matched in pairs because they are complementary.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
As DNA is copied very rapidly, errors in the copy frequently occur.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
These errors are called mutations.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Most of the time these mutations are of no consequence, but sometimes they can be harmful to the bacteria.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
However, with such a high number of mutations, some of these copy errors can result in resistance to antibiotics.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
When in contact with the antibiotic, the resistant bacteria will be the only ones to survive.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
In fact the drug will have chosen THE resistant strain!

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And then, since there is no longer any competition for food, the bacteria can multiply very fast.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
It’s exactly like natural selection!

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Individuals with the most favourable characteristics reproduce more than the others...

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
...and will be able to continue to evolve.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Indeed, with antibiotics, we are reproducing what nature did 4 billion years ago that led to the evolution of species.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Well miss, are you demonstrating here that the patient is suffering from acute Darwinitis?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Hmm..you could say that...

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Aha! That’s exactly how I see it!

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Gentlemen, this case is very interesting! Let’s move on to something else!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
