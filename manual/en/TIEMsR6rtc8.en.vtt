[Music]

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:13.106
Oh, Chelsey was funny when she was a kid.

00:00:13.106 --> 00:00:17.646
She always knew what she wanted; 
she was very strong-headed,

00:00:17.646 --> 00:00:19.526
...never gave up on anything she did.

00:00:19.526 --> 00:00:22.046
You know, as a little girl, 
I knew she’d go places.

00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:25.186
She wanted to be a Marine; 
she wanted to go into the service...

00:00:25.186 --> 00:00:27.226
She wanted to be a mom.

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:30.056
You know, those dreams were gonna come true.

00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:32.356
She became pregnant, 
which is what she wanted.

00:00:32.356 --> 00:00:34.816
She got an apartment with her significant other.

00:00:34.816 --> 00:00:38.276
She called me up to tell me 
she had just got the keys,

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:42.126
and could I take her to drop her stuff, 
you know, start moving her stuff in.

00:00:42.126 --> 00:00:45.396
She was gonna walk to my house, 
and pack the rest of her stuff.

00:00:45.396 --> 00:00:47.106
She only moved a block away.

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:51.546
I was coming home from my meeting,

00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:55.546
and ambulances and police cars kept 
passing me as I was coming home.

00:00:55.546 --> 00:00:58.006
I actually made a phone call to her cell phone...

00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.076
... thinking, ""God, I hope that’s not my child."

00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:02.086
And I knew it.  
Just in the pit of my stomach...

00:01:02.086 --> 00:01:05.966
I knew that that accident had something to do with her.

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.986
So, I ran over to the intersection.

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:11.006
I asked the gentleman, what happened here?

00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:14.296
And he said two young girls just got hit by a car.

00:01:14.296 --> 00:01:16.656
And I said, I think one was my daughter.

00:01:16.656 --> 00:01:21.176
And, you know, I kinda was looking around, 
and I saw her shoes and her purse.

00:01:21.176 --> 00:01:25.096
She lived five days.  But, in a coma, never woke up.

00:01:25.096 --> 00:01:31.136
[Music]

00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:34.286
The person who hit her, he was 18 years old.

00:01:34.286 --> 00:01:37.006
And he fled the scene.

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:39.036
The next day it came out, you know, 
he was on his cell phone.

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:41.066
But I didn’t know nothing about distracted driving.

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:43.066
I talked on the phone.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.816
Distracted driving kills.

00:01:44.816 --> 00:01:49.916
You know, she’s not the only one. 
There are a lot of people out there.

00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:52.426
A lot of accidents. 
It’s not worth it.

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:54.576
My dreams and Chelsea's dreams 
were the same.

00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:56.076
You know, I wanted to see her go into the Marines,

00:01:56.076 --> 00:01:58.076
Wanted to see her be a mother.

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:00.076
She would have made a great mother.

00:02:00.076 --> 00:02:02.076
She loved children.

00:02:02.076 --> 00:02:05.076
You know, having her memory 
kept alive through what I’m doing,

00:02:05.076 --> 00:02:07.076
If people would just put their cell phones down...

00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:11.076
And say, you know, "I learned this from Chelsea Murphy..."

00:02:11.076 --> 00:02:13.076
...that would be great.

00:02:13.076 --> 00:02:18.076
[Music]

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:19.526
Distracted driving kills.

00:02:19.526 --> 00:02:21.006
Safe driving starts with you.
