00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.290
hey folks this is Rhykker bringing you a
Diablo 3

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.440
2.1 guide to the treasure realm AKA

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.450
greets domain for those who don't know
this is a special bonus level and which

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.139
you get

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.440
tens of millions up to hundreds of
millions for

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.039
gold plus a legendary gem called Boone

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.220
over the Horder which allows you to get
even

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.840
more gold outside of the treasure realm
a portal to the treasure room has a

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.810
chance to spawn

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.940
anytime you kill a treasure goblin in

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.980
adventure mode outside of a rift
difficulty doesn't matter

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.140
your character level doesn't matter and
location

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.079
doesn't matter any act any area outside
a rift

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.640
in adventure mode killing a treasured
girl has a chance to open that

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.879
golden portal now the art is happening

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.539
are Gary very rare playing over the
weekend it was only when I farm to a

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.550
specific route for two hours

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.379
that I finally got the spine the route
Iran was

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.369
the Korova Harriet in act three the
reason I chose the core various because

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:08.740
it is

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.890
a small area with a linear predictable
path

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.049
urine after scan around a huge area
searching for the goblins you simply

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.140
follow the path

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.350
and if the girls are there you'll come
across some on

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.490
that path you have to sneak down
different corridors

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.360
you don't have to do the circumference
of an area and spiral inward

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.100
scanning every note and cranny in the
big empty center

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.409
the core various is very straightforward
and the gobble spahn rate was

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.119
roughly one out of every three runs and
what I would do is I'll just keep

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.130
running by all the monsters and I only
stopped for a couple reasons

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.159
first by find a goblin obviously

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.649
I would kill the guy wants and if the
treasure on getting spahn at that point

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.700
I would and the run

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.390
camp or allowed and restart if one
goblin sponsor then dogs are there's not

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.439
gonna be a second goblins law so simply

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.540
remake and hopefully the next game will
also have a goblin

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.040
the second reason I stopped is free
cursed chest event which

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.860
also has about a one in three chance of
spotting

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.770
with my wizard fire hydrant mirror build
I'm able to melt the champion pack

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.110
that the first response in a couple of
seconds so

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.400
it's very fast and easy XP

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.480
gold and looted from that resplendent
chest

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.730
with the curse just gonna I keep on
running

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.430
the third reason I stopped is if there
is a bowtie in the area if there's a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.720
bounty which sponsors periodically maybe

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.140
one out of every five runs or less often
than that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.480
complete the bounty again fasten easy XP

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.340
before thing that stops me is if
monsters just getting my way in block my

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.150
path and stop me from running all

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.150
stop all kill a few just in order to
keep running

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.420
or if there's some kinda believe packet
has a port executes second year in a row

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.370
waller that's blocking my path in his

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.480
really frustrating all stop to kill that
but otherwise

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.120
I keep running and keep running until
you reach all the way the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.340
and if the area leading down to the as
mode and fight

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.530
treasure problems can spawn all the way
down on those

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.230
step so do clear the whole area go all
the way down to the steps

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.620
at that point if monsters are chasing me
and I think it'll take me more than 10

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.709
seconds to kill them

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.239
I simply go through I going to the Aspen
and fight area

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.120
hit escape exit game you can town portal
out from there so

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.190
you have to wait for the 10 second
cooldown timer if I do think that it's

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.620
your safety town portal out from the
steps for can kill the monsters

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.320
in less than 10 seconds I'll do that
town portal out

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.900
and remake now some tips for when you're
in

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.340
that treasure on when you finally get to
spawn if you can notice from the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.600
gameplay footage here

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.470
I was so excited after two hours that I
forgot how to play Diablo

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.239
this is me sucking at the Apple because
I was so excited

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.480
after to ruin fury eating hours I
finally gotten around to spawn

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.640
remember to loot everything is in the
destructible objects you're going to get

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.540
homes for goal it's going to be many
inches in any goblins

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.079
chill everything make sure the goblins
don't escape

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.069
kill everything destroy everything in
fact you can even backtracked through

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.500
the area as I did there were some
destructible that I

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.759
just miss right in the beginning good
thing I

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.340
turnaround double back went to get them
once you get to the actual fight

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.850
with the Baroness with greed herself

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.419
this a couple trips that can help you
maximize your time

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.050
in the vault first of she will
periodically drop

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.020
treasure goblins offer back now there
are reports that she does this

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.080
right after she charges she charges she
hits

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.940
a wall or a central object and a
treasure goblin

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.789
pops off her back these treasure goblins
cannot be interrupted when their opening

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.289
their poor also you have to act fast

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.570
waits before killing greed don't be too
greedy

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.150
don't killer fast wait for her to drop
ur five or six treasured office you can

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.449
see them on her back

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.150
once she's all-out then you can killer
or

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.190
you can even do the second trick which
his fighter kill you

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.759
if you die you get the start the fight
over again

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:20.320
can you kept more about loot and you can
just keep doing this over and over and

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.870
over

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.370
and getting that loot now of course
rewards are gonna be staggering relative

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.949
to everything you've got so far

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.300
it's just Russia doubles at that point
but still if you want to milk it for all

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.050
its got

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.560
go for it I know I don't plan on ever
farming

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.490
this level game if I run into
accidentally that's fantastic but

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.139
I'm never gonna go out of my way to farm
this and the reason for that is that

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.289
once you kill her a giant treasure chest
drops they're gonna get a lotta luv

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:47.250
lotta gold

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.669
plus you're gonna get the Boone over the
Horder legendary gem

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.550
and generally some other legendaries as
well at least one other legendary

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.580
