Hi everyone this is Keith's Toy Box and
today we are reviewing the Hot Wheels

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.540
Loop and Jump Track Set

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.490
we got this set at SNR membership
shopping

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.849
for 549 pesos so that's about 12 US dollars

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.960
it comes unassembled with the gravity
clamp

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.619
and one car. Now let's look inside

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.960
the set

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.140
comes with 4 tracks

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.489
each about thirteen and a half inches long

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.280
3 connectors

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.410
one gravity clap for fast dropping

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.840
2 blue tracks for the loop. The base

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.560
and the connector for the loop

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.700
it had stickers also but as
you can see we

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.170
attached some of the stickers already.  It also comes with

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.210
one racer

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.080
my son has had this set for about
three months now

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.840
and this racer is one of his favorites

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.900
and he plays with it a lot that's why as you can see some of the paint

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.040
has worn off already but its

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.680
actually very durable and it has a very
nice

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.680
aerodynamic design. Okay now let's put
the set together and try it out.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.659
this clamp is a good design because

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.239
it allows you to attach it to any furniture

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.730
in any angle so i'm just now gonna
attach this

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.730
to this drawer handle that we have and screw it tight

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.030
we have to attach the clamp to
a certain height

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.079
or else the drop will not be fast
enough for the car to go around the loop

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:47.820
this height is about a little over 2 feet, so let's try it.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.200
now let's try it with other Hot Wheels Racers!

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.640
the number 8 car as my son calls it, works
the best

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.640
so let's try it first

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:48.480
if you have a Launcher like this, it also works very well with the Loop

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.620
so that's the Hot Wheels Loop &amp; Jump Track Set

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.220
