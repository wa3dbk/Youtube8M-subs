00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:13.356
It probably won't have escaped
your attention that we've

00:00:13.356 --> 00:00:16.156
driven a few AMGs this year.

00:00:16.156 --> 00:00:18.716
That's because the remit of this
show is mainly to drive

00:00:18.716 --> 00:00:21.886
the most interesting and
exciting new cars.

00:00:21.886 --> 00:00:23.816
And AMG seemed to release
of those every

00:00:23.816 --> 00:00:25.696
other week just now.

00:00:25.696 --> 00:00:28.296
And just to warn you, there's
another one coming on Drive

00:00:28.296 --> 00:00:29.465
pretty soon.

00:00:29.465 --> 00:00:33.476
But 2012 also marks the
company's 40th anniversary,

00:00:33.476 --> 00:00:34.891
and so they threw
a little party.

00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:38.069
It was mostly a tour of the
factory and a decent teaser of

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:39.196
what was coming soon.

00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:42.956
Amongst other things, the A45
hatchback, a faster SLS that

00:00:42.956 --> 00:00:46.266
we all know will be a Black
Series, and I suspect an E63

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.576
coupe at some time.

00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:50.406
After the tour, they
said we could drive

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:52.466
some of the old cars.

00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:57.506
There was a CLK Black Series, an
original C32 wagon, a C55,

00:00:57.506 --> 00:00:59.956
and even a lovely C36.

00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:03.716
And there was also the Hammer.

00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:05.636
Affalterbach is a sleepy
little village

00:01:05.636 --> 00:01:07.286
northeast of Stuttgart.

00:01:07.286 --> 00:01:08.856
Drive through it and you'd have
little idea that it's

00:01:08.856 --> 00:01:12.626
home to some genuinely
deranged machinery.

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:15.496
In fact, it's mostly full of
apple orchards, a fact

00:01:15.496 --> 00:01:17.916
reflected in the AMG logo.

00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:20.466
The main site is now split
between vehicle research and

00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.926
development, engine production,
and specialist

00:01:22.926 --> 00:01:24.256
interior fitting.

00:01:24.256 --> 00:01:27.796
Each motor is hand-assembled
in a workshop worthy of a

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:30.076
James Bond baddy's lair.

00:01:30.076 --> 00:01:32.486
People wander around
in clean uniforms.

00:01:32.486 --> 00:01:34.296
And the further you move
towards one end of the

00:01:34.296 --> 00:01:36.867
building, the more the assembled
bits of metal look

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:38.946
like engines.

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:42.676
Each engine maker has his own
name plaque and that is bolted

00:01:42.676 --> 00:01:45.226
onto each motor.

00:01:45.226 --> 00:01:48.776
The dyno room is a kind of
engine torture chamber.

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:51.916
This is the new A45's
four-cylinder turbo motor

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:54.926
going through a full-load
cycle.

00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:57.826
After this, it did a virtual
lap of the ring and then it

00:01:57.826 --> 00:02:00.586
went back to being
red hot again.

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:04.016
Punters who want extra special
interiors or widgets can have

00:02:04.016 --> 00:02:06.405
them done here at extra cost.

00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:08.846
And there's always something
interesting hanging around.

00:02:08.846 --> 00:02:11.546
This time, it's the
SLS E-Cell and its

00:02:11.546 --> 00:02:14.036
stunning carbon chassis.

00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:16.186
But enough of walking
and talking.

00:02:16.186 --> 00:02:18.956
I wanted to drive one
of these old cars.

00:02:18.956 --> 00:02:22.026
And despite all of them being
covetable, when there's a

00:02:22.026 --> 00:02:25.296
Hammer in the house, nothing
else matters.

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:28.266
So we elbowed the others out
of the way and walked--

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:29.966
in slow motion, naturally--

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:33.336
past the display of every
production AMG engine and went

00:02:33.336 --> 00:02:34.586
for a drive.

00:02:47.336 --> 00:02:52.176
In 1986, if you were very, very
rich, wanted to go very,

00:02:52.176 --> 00:02:55.896
very fast, and wanted
four seats, there

00:02:55.896 --> 00:02:56.746
weren't many options.

00:02:56.746 --> 00:03:00.066
You could buy an M5, but then,
M5s are probably too common

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:01.946
for you if you are
very, very rich.

00:03:01.946 --> 00:03:05.086
What you could do is come to AMG
and say, I'd like to take

00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:08.936
a W124 E-Class please,
and go a bit quicker.

00:03:08.936 --> 00:03:10.956
And then they could
do something

00:03:10.956 --> 00:03:12.916
very special for you.

00:03:12.916 --> 00:03:16.286
What they created was a car
that became known as the

00:03:16.286 --> 00:03:19.146
Hammer, which to me, is still
the most evocative, best

00:03:19.146 --> 00:03:21.756
sounding name for a car ever.

00:03:21.756 --> 00:03:23.286
And I'm driving a Hammer.

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:25.096
This is in my top 10 cars.

00:03:25.096 --> 00:03:26.756
I just love it.

00:03:26.756 --> 00:03:29.026
It is utterly outrageous.

00:03:29.026 --> 00:03:32.636
A massive V8, four-speed
automatic gearbox, locking

00:03:32.636 --> 00:03:37.496
differential, and the wide
body on it, too.

00:03:37.496 --> 00:03:39.306
I'm just juttering
with excitement.

00:03:39.306 --> 00:03:39.736
So here we go.

00:03:39.736 --> 00:03:41.276
Hammer in the wet.

00:03:51.576 --> 00:03:52.906
What's it like to drive?

00:03:52.906 --> 00:03:55.166
It's a mixture of the
surprisingly good and the

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:56.656
surprisingly bad.

00:03:56.656 --> 00:03:58.296
I'd forgotten that Mercedes
from this era don't really

00:03:58.296 --> 00:03:59.736
have a throttle pedal.

00:03:59.736 --> 00:04:02.216
They have this sort of piece of
wood down there that you've

00:04:02.216 --> 00:04:04.516
got to kick as hard as you can
for anything to happen.

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:06.576
So that's disconcerting.

00:04:06.576 --> 00:04:09.236
The throttle feels like it's got
a really old spring on it

00:04:09.236 --> 00:04:09.926
and a cable that's stuck.

00:04:09.926 --> 00:04:13.056
It hasn't, they all just feel
like that from the era.

00:04:13.056 --> 00:04:14.096
The steering is surprisingly
nice.

00:04:14.096 --> 00:04:14.785
It's light.

00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:17.485
And of course, being an old car,
it has this lovely, thin

00:04:17.485 --> 00:04:20.446
steering wheel, which I really
like on my hands.

00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:21.336
Gear box.

00:04:21.336 --> 00:04:21.676
Wow.

00:04:21.676 --> 00:04:23.396
Transmissions have come
on a long way.

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:25.606
Kick down.

00:04:25.606 --> 00:04:27.228
Down two gears.

00:04:27.228 --> 00:04:29.156
Kathunk.

00:04:29.156 --> 00:04:30.166
Uhh.

00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:31.536
And then fourth gear, when it
comes in, comes in with a

00:04:31.536 --> 00:04:34.646
massive kaboom bang.

00:04:34.646 --> 00:04:39.656
Inside is just like a grotto in
honor of Tubs and Crockett.

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:41.146
We've got buttons everywhere.

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:43.676
We've got 19-way
electric seats.

00:04:43.676 --> 00:04:46.356
Although we've got manual wing
move, which is a bit odd.

00:04:46.356 --> 00:04:47.866
It's just an utter joy.

00:04:47.866 --> 00:04:50.836
The classic Mercedes
dashboard.

00:04:50.836 --> 00:04:51.286
I don't know.

00:04:51.286 --> 00:04:52.916
I just love being in it.

00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:56.351
If I had to choose a car, now,
to drive from the UK to Le

00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:57.936
Mans in, I'd go in a Hammer.

00:04:57.936 --> 00:05:00.276
It's just fantastic.

00:05:00.276 --> 00:05:03.176
It's subtle enough so that only
people that know what it

00:05:03.176 --> 00:05:04.886
is look at it and don't
think, ooh, is that a

00:05:04.886 --> 00:05:05.936
horrible kit car?

00:05:05.936 --> 00:05:06.536
And the noise--

00:05:06.536 --> 00:05:08.796
[ENGINE HUMMING]

00:05:08.796 --> 00:05:11.396
--there we go.

00:05:11.396 --> 00:05:12.276
Yeah.

00:05:12.276 --> 00:05:13.849
I'm kind of in heaven now.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:36.076
