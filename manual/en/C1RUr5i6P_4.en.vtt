Arturo Sandoval:
You know, one of the things I
like about this award the most,

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:08.400
the name of the award, freedom,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.433
because for me it is
the most important word

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:14.967
in the whole dictionary, freedom.

00:00:14.967 --> 00:00:17.533
I always say,
"No freedom, no life."

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:21.433
And this is the main reason
I want for so many years

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:25.066
to come and spend the rest of my days 
in this wonderful country,

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:28.600
because this is what this
country stands for, freedom,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.500
respect of the human rights
and so many important simple

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.600
but extremely important
values in life on principles.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.500
I started playing music
in 1960, many years ago,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.500
and I came from
a extremely poor family.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.266
We don't even have floor
in the house, we got dirt,

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:59.133
and I couldn't -- not even
couldn't make school.

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:04.834
I finished school when
I'm starting the fifth grade;

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:06.500
that was it.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.400
And then I was kind of
hopeless kid, you know.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.900
The music saved my life.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.567
I think God send music to
me to be able to save my life

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:22.700
and also to be able
to help my family,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.600
every member of my family,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.533
which is such
a privilege, you know,

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.867
when you are able
to do such a thing.

00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:34.767
I think it's important
for everybody as an immigrant

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:38.367
when you come to a country,

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:41.467
you have to do your
best in every sense.

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:44.367
You have to respect the law.

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:48.367
You have to act according
and behave according

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:54.867
to the regulation and procedure
of the way you should act.

00:01:54.867 --> 00:01:57.133
You know, that's
very, very important.

00:01:57.133 --> 00:02:01.633
And also we are not here
only to take advantage

00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:04.066
of the privilege
to live in this country.

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:09.967
We are here also to add a
little grain of sand, you know,

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:13.166
to put a little condiment
in the big soup.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.533
That's what America
is, you know.

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:18.500
We put a little spices and
people put a little salt

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.834
and people put a little chili.

00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:26.800
And I always say,
"Oh, my goodness, thank God,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.033
it's the people from so many
places of the world here;

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:31.967
otherwise,
what are we going to eat?

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:35.266
Hamburger?"

00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:39.500
Try your best every 24 hour.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.600
Whatever happened,
the history, you know,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.033
the past already
we have no control,

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:53.266
but in this current 24 hour try
to do your best in every sense.

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:57.500
If you are a student,
study hard.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.734
If you are professional,
do your job as good as possible.

00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:06.000
So happy to be here,
it's such a privilege.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.700
It's a big honor for me,
and I would like to tell you

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.166
that it's so rewarding to know 
that God have good surprises

00:03:17.166 --> 00:03:19.867
for you when you
behave correctly.
