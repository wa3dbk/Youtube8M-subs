Hello, you are watching Alexa from stealing-beauty.com

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.440
today's video is going to be something I
don't normally talk about

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.670
it's something I've been doing for
about a year or a little bit over year

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.680
and it's all thanks to video by nuberxo

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.990
you can check out her channel, I will
link the video where she talks about this

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.480
down below and yeah I'm avoiding

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.220
saying what it is like it is the plague
because it sounds crazy

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.640
I shave my face, yes!

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.739
That's right, all that little peach fuzz on my face

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.879
I shave it and I've noticed a
significant difference

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.440
in overall appearance of my skin and also

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.770
my makeup application because when you
do your foundation

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.000
it just doesn't go on as smoothly
while you're like combing

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.449
your hairs up and down and actually
normally if you do have a lot of peach

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.430
fuzz on face you have to finish with
downward strokes

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.859
so as not to cast a strange arse

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.229
shadow. Anyways, all that aside.

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.470
I know exactly what you're thinking: "Alexa, 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.070
I'm sure your face is so damn hairy now. Like, 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.119
does your hair grow back like you're man
because

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.030
that's scary. No, it doesn't it, it does not
at all!

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.830
And to prove it to you I will show you a
close up what my skin looks like

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.030
with it grown in basically

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.400
so this is what my face look like when
all the peach fuzz is grown in and as you

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.079
can see

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.210
it's not thicker than it was before or
at least casually the exact before but

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.570
it's not thicker than it was before and
I'm going to tell you guys

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.350
how I do it I'm not advocating that
everyone should do this

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.840
I'm just saying that this is something
that has worked

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.750
really well for me you probably don't
wanna do this if you have very sensitive

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.610
skin

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.360
I'm but overall I don't find it
irritating at all really depends on the

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.750
razor that you're using

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.880
and here is the second shocker

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.320
I use a man's razor to do this

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.520
because it's got a bajillion blades and
it gets the job done

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.370
and soft and you can't cut yourself or at
least I haven't cut myself yet. This

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.560
is the Gillette Fusion. I actually have two
have these in my bathroom that are

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.120
for shaving my legs and my mother's
legs respectively, but I keep

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.650
another one on the side, separate for

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.590
my face because face and body let's keep
it separate

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.250
The other thing that I also use
 because

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.269
I don't want to go around my
eyebrows with this thing beause it is not as

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.019
precise

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.349
as one of those little
brow

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.569
single razors.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.860
Tthis one is actually on its way out so
I'm not gonna use it.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.989
I would use this just to make
sure that I get a crisp line on top and

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:00.870
down the side

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.980
and when I'm extremely me lazy to

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.330
plucked my eyebrows I will go down the
center

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.650
but I typically don't want to do that
because it grows back

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.269
in like two seconds because I'm not
exactly the

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.819
must hair free lady on the
planet so there you have it

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.260
this is my face after I shaved and 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.069
it it feels amazing. Okay, so basically my
process is: wash your face, 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.489
leave it a bit damp, go into the washroom, 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.670
or wherever it is that you want shave
your face, with a magnifying mirror I use

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.830
this one, and it has around plus five
magnitude I think I'm not

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.250
I'm not quite sure and then I just go in

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.480
hold my skin a bit taught and  shave 
very slowly

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.170
I'm not in a hurry to cut my face, you
shouldn't be either

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.920
and then I rinse my face with cold water
and

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.810
dab it dry and apply some moisturizer
and that's it that's all

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.430
basketball! Some minor things I want to
touch on: don't go over your face too

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.250
many times you don't need to get

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.180
perfect peach fuzz removal. No one is
going to notice

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.299
if you miss a spot it's not like your
man

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.329
You want to not be doing anything
really abrasive to your face

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.900
before shaving or after because

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.860
you are already going to be shaving your face. You don't want to run the risk of 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.020
irritating your skin so I like to leave
my facial masks with glycolic

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.560
acid or my exfoliators for

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.460
the day after or the day before, so that
I'm not going to irritate my skin

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.650
you wanna go over any I wounded or
damaged

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.360
skin areas like raised pimples or
anything like that, you don't want to pull up scabs

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.660
so just be careful that you know kinda
the same rule applies when you shave

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.699
your legs you don't wanna go over rashy area or anything

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.680
like that. I feel like I want to say
something else, but I can't think of anything else is

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.770
coming to mind. If you have any

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.570
questions or comments leave them
down below. Let me know if you've ever

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.900
done this

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.990
I must not be the only crazy lady out
there

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.500
and I'm really grateful that I saw the
video by Nuberxo. because I would

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.300
have never thought

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.750
of doing this. Actually, me my mom would have never thought of doing this.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.380
Now, we love this. The foundation goes on
smooth!

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.759
I hope that you guys enjoyed this video,
stay tuned for the next one.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:27.180
