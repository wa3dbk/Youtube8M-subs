00:00:00.477 --> 00:00:03.640
Happy Presidents' Day, the day
we dedicate to our first

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.470
commander in chief,
George Washington.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.080
And super low employee
pricing on all this

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.160
year's makes and models.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.730
To honor the father of our
country, we are dedicating

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.840
"This Costs What?" to our first
leader, which honestly

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.160
is the least we can do, as he
keeps on getting the short end

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.010
of the stick.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.235
First, we took Washington's
birthday, which is February

00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:24.060
22, and changed it to
Presidents' Day, which is the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.660
third Monday of the month.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.990
Then, he doesn't even get a
real monument, just some

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.060
phallic statue.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.800
And then, they stuck
him on the lowest

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.280
form of paper currency.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.320
So here's to you, George
Washington.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.590
George was born near present-day
Colonial Beach in

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.370
Westmoreland County, Virginia.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.070
And for approximately $200,000,
depending on the

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.430
model, you, too, can live where

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.800
President Washington did.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.570
The waterfront community of
Monroe Point features four

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.260
different home layouts, each
with renovated kitchen,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.290
spacious living quarters,
and large bedrooms.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.890
If George was chilling here
now, he could use their

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.459
clubhouse, pool, marina, nature
walk, or expansive

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:06.860
private beach.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.130
Not too shabby, Mr. President.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.610
Later in life, Washington went
on to defeat the British at

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.460
Yorktown, which was the start
of the end of the American

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.510
Revolution, giving way to
American independence and

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.970
eventually, the Big Gulp.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.810
Living among such history,
however, does not come cheap.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.370
This four bedroom, six bath,
5,600 square foot home is

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.430
asking just under $2 million,
with a gorgeous kitchen,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.630
spacious living room, dining
room, office, stunning view,

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.890
and sprawling lawns.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.230
Frankly, this is land
worth fighting for.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.910
The victory at Yorktown set
George up to run for office,

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.550
although he was the only
president not to live in the

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.320
White House, as we know it.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.490
George instead lived here,
at Mount Vernon, which is

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.970
priceless and currently serves
as a museum and library but

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.040
features multiple dining rooms,
George's bedroom and

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.300
study, many guests rooms, a
distillery and grist mill, and

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.965
famous gardens.

00:01:58.965 --> 00:02:01.517
While you can't buy Mount
Vernon, you can have your Bar

00:02:01.517 --> 00:02:04.940
Mitzvah there, or wedding,
communion, Presidents' Day

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.250
celebration.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.949
Any kind of party, our
president's estate will be

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:09.852
there for you.

00:02:09.852 --> 00:02:11.180
So happy birthday, George.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.765
And thanks for helping to create
this great nation.

00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:16.680
To those of you at home, I hope
you learned something and

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.930
that you got the day off work.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.290
