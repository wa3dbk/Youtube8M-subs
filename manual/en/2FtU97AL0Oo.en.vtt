let's go check it out

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.099
 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.779
we're at the rear entrance of the brand
new Custom Cottage we're entering the

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.609
master bedroom actually at the beginning of this show come on and let's check it out

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.640
 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.350
so what do you think? this is the master
bedroom and as you can tell by the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.270
decor it's a pretty beautiful place

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.100
let's check out that bathroom

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.420
 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.109
now that's a killer bathroom. you gotta
check out this kitchen

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.530
and along the way we're going to see
some pretty cool design

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.320
come on

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.760

gotta check out the second bedroom

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.149
now my dad would definitely say I'm a little 
bit big for this bed

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.409
but this room is definitely big enough
for a set of bunks, great for an office,

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.770
and great for family to stay over

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.829
