00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.760
Hi, everyone!

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.730
My name’s Sergey Polanskiy

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.580
and today I’m going to tell you about
the SCHECTER SGR C-1 electric guitar.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.900
So, it has a basswood body,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.980
a bolt-on maple neck and
a rosewood fretboard with 24 frets.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.110
The guitar has 2 stock hum buckers,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.460
a three-position switcher,
volume and tone controllers.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.080
It comes with a light carrying bag.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.890
Let’s listen to the clean sound.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.460
And with an overdrive.
