00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.960
A lot of people would say you have got reason
more than most to hate sharks and yet you

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.970
don’t.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.290
Can you explain it?

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.060
&gt;&gt; It was in a spear fishing championship
that I was the reigning champion.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.810
It was a six hour competition.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.890
After four hours many fish had been speared
and each one had bled into the water.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.289
The tide had gone out, but nobody had seen
any sharks.

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.200
And I went out a bit wider and deeper to try
and find fish that hadn't been scared.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.120
And as I dived down I was just about to spear
a fish when this thump and crash hit me in

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.140
the chest, knocked the gun out of my hand,
the mask off my face.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.500
I was held through the water.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.290
Then I realized it had to be a shark.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.200
And I felt: What can I do to protect myself?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.320
So I gouged the shark’s head over with my
fingers trying to get its eyes.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.670
It seemed to let go and as it...

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.760
I fell away.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.700
I pushed at that shark to try and push it
away.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.620
But my hand went right in his mouth, ripping.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.210
I ended up with only one tendon left and 94
stitches in my hand.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.730
But I grabbed the shark around the belly and
still 30, 40 feet under water holding on and

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.820
then I realized air, because I was snorkeling
and I was going to drown.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.700
I pushed up to the surface.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.930
And on the surface I yelled out: Shark, shark.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:47.130
And I looked down and the shark was coming
back to attack again.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.479
I could see this great big head and white
teeth coming up through the blood red water

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.280
and I thought: I have got nothing at all to
protect myself.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.610
I kicked at the shark.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.610
But then a miracle happened.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.880
The shark turned and swallowed the float that
I had attached two or three fish to.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.050
It dived and as it dived it dragged me under
water and it...

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.010
I am on the rope.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.590
And as it dragged down I tried to find my
belt to get rid of it, but I couldn’t find

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.590
it.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.920
I couldn’t find the catch.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.890
And I hadn't breathed... deep breathed much.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.569
And I was just about to gasp water and drown
when another miracle happened.

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.590
The line broke.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.200
It was severed when the shark bit me around
the chest and it managed to break.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.670
As I came up to the surface yelling out: Shark,
shark, shark, a boat actually had seen the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.770
bright red water, my blood, and was coming
over to investigate.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.060
They quickly picked me up, rolled me into
the boat and with really great precision I

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.030
was in a hospital within an hour given blood
and luckily stitched up.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.610
The photographs that were taken on the operating
table and my stories went around the world.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.360
People wondered whether I would go back in
the water.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.440
It was when I was at the Adelaide Zoo looking
at the lion cages that I came up with the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.440
idea.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.959
I will make a cage.

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.400
I will lower it over the side of the boat
in an area where these great big great white

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.830
sharks habit and I will have a look for myself
to see if I want to go diving again, because

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.740
I loved diving, but I was really scared.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.280
We made the first cage and on that first expedition,
you know, 48 years ago, we made the first

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.490
great white shark films ever.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.109
&gt;&gt; That firs time that you put the cage in
the water, did that cure your fear?

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.510
&gt;&gt; Not really at all.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.769
It helped.

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:57.390
The first shark that came really looked like
a small submarine with a deadly front on it

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.069
like a torpedo to the teeth.

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.629
We thought maybe the sharks were interested
in the people inside.

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.790
But then we found that they would come up
an bite on the cage even when there was no

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.540
one in it and what we ended up finding it
was the electrolysis that was sent out by

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.299
the salt water on the seal that attracted
them.

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.590
&gt;&gt; And so now that you spend so much time
with sharks, I mean, how do you feel about

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.590
them?&gt;&gt;

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.370
They are a wonderful, interesting animal.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.460
And even today they still need help, because
people still fear and dread them because they

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.370
are the last major predator that will eat
you.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:42.440
But with education, it think people will understand
that we need them in our oceans and of 400

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.440
varieties, there is only a handful that may
bite people.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:55.830
The more I got interested in sharks and the
more I loved the sea, I was able to return

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.090
and go abalone diving all around... along
our coastline.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:08.910
I spent 16 years and 5000 hours or more underwater
and on those occasions I only saw three sharks.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.360
Normally they don’t have humans on their
menu list.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.449
They prefer to stick to their own food.

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.871
Thank goodness they didn’t, because along
our beaches they could ... there would be

00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:24.470
a real smorgasbord if they wanted to.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.930
&gt;&gt; A lot of people would say you have got
reason, more than most, to hate sharks and

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.229
yet you don’t.

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.229
Can you explain it?

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:40.949
&gt;&gt; It is the anomaly of this fear that was
generated and shown to me after my shark attack

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.020
made me think.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.860
Going back into the water was a real relief
and I found it wasn’t as bad as everybody

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.979
thought.

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.520
So I spent the whole of my life trying to
put sharks in a different perspective.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.170
&gt;&gt; Because of that experience you had.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.860
&gt;&gt; Because of my experience, yes.
