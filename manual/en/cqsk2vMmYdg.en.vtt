MOLLY
Valerie, share that with Anthony, please.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.790
MEGAN
Share, buddy.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.530
LAUREL
Oh, Tomothy wants milk, I can tell. I gotta go breastfeed him.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.009
MOLLY
Oh, I didn't know you were still breastfeeding.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:15.169
LAUREL
I know, yeah, he's a lot older than I thought he would be to still be breastfeeding but...

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.060
nothing about having a baby has gone the way I've expected it to...

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.920
(flashback music)

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.560
1980s LAUREL
If I have a baby, I'm gonna nurse it no more than six months. It's about getting back to my life!

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.720
MOLLY/MEGAN
Totally! / For sure!

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.820
(flash forward music)

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.940
TOMOTHY (Offscreen)
Mom! Milk!

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.760
LAUREL
Okay, Tomothy. Coming! I'll be right back.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.100
MOLLY
Ugh, I can tell Valerie's getting cranky. You know what, I'm going to go turn the TV on.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.070
MEGAN
Good idea. It's the best babysitter ever, isn't it?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.080
MOLLY
(sighs) Yeah.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.620
(flashback music)

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.440
1980s MOLLY
All I know is, when I have a baby that kid is never watching TV.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.580
In fact, they're not getting any screen time at all.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.059
MEGAN/LAUREL (laugh)
What's screen time?

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:01.930
(flash forward music)

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.690
MOLLY
All good, I also gave her my iPad and my phone, just in case.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.900
LAUREL
We're all set.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.900
MEGAN
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. I think Anthony just pulled Valerie's hair.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.680
MOLLY
Oh...

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.409
MEGAN
Let me go take care of this.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.789
LAUREL
What is that for?

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.920
MEGAN
Oh... the only way Anthony will let me discipline him is if I'm dressed as Santa.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.820
(flashback music)

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.190
1980s MEGAN
When I have kids, I'm not doing that whole Santa thing. First of all, Santa is so creepy,

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.250
second of all, parents who rely on using Santa
to discipline their children are so pathetic.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.330
It's like, set some boundaries on your own,
people!

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.689
LAUREL/MOLLY (snoring)

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.500
MEGAN
Anthony you don't want to get on Santa's naughty list, do you? Ho ho ho!

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.120
MOLLY
I'll tell you what, if I ever have another kid,the one thing I will never do again is flashbacks.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.500
LAUREL
Yeah!

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.440
(flashback music starts then stops)
