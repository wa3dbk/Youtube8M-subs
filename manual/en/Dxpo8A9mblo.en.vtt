00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.400
If there is a financial crisis in my country, would you leave? 8 vs remains 5

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.400
If there is a financial crisis in my country, would you leave? 7 vs remains 6

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.740
If there is a financial crisis in my country, would you leave? 6 vs remains 7

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.700
If there is a financial crisis in my country, would you leave? 5 vs remains 8

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.200
Italy, China and Norway left.

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:17.239
What is the reason for leaving?

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.620
I would leave if that happens.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.520
Financial crisis is kind of disaster.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:34.240
Those who left the country in crisis went overseas to study and became great help when they came back.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.120
By becoming more capable

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.300
China leaves and comes back to help later.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.020
I don’t want to move permanently but want to avoid the crisis for a while.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.940
For a while? How about for a long time?

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.380
But the only country that would accept you is Japan?

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.900
That’s all right.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.320
Is Japan OK?

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.800
But the country which accepts you doesn’t have correct view on historical issues.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.920
That would be all right since it would be better to make money in Japan first and return it to China later.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.340
What?

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.680
What is wrong with you two?

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.320
I don’t think that makes sense.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.415
What?!

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.420
First of all, he doesn’t speak Japanese.

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:24.625
Look at him!

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.320
Where would you go without speaking their language? he likes it better lol help me this is sooo stupid

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.140
Zhang Yuan, let me tell you this. I am from Ghana.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.800
I don’t think you are?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.900
We have the same suspicion.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.940
Suspicion that has been going on for longer than a year.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.760
More than half of those who leaves country for economical reasons wouldn’t come back.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.440
Because they will live better lives by working and settling down there.

00:01:56.656 --> 00:02:00.876
Ghana remains and says that it is difficult to come back after getting used to new life.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.500
If 50% doesn’t come back, the rest 50% will come back.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.782
That’s ‘if.’

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:17.020
Greece leaves and will bring something useful to the country later.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.780
Andreas, that’s just an ideal!

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.080
(Startles)

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.440
You would want to go back but the reality might be different.
