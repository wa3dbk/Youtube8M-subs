00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:19.289
I'm here now on the campus of Grinnell
College in Grinnell, Iowa and as I walked

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.220
by the bookstore I saw these water
bottles that say on them, "where the hell is Grinnell?"

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.900
Grinnell definitely is in...well it's in Iowa.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:38.160
There's a lot of corn around it, but this is a cute little town and an absolutely marvelous liberal arts college.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.700
It has everything going for it. It's got the highest per-capita endowment of any college in the America.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.770
The facilities are second to none. The library right over here has been

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.000
renovated a couple of times. Absolutely
drop-dead gorgeous study spaces for

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.500
students, looking out the windows, it's
phenomenal. The Science Center has been

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:07.400
renovated twice in the last 15 years or
so. Fantastic facilities, great science.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.800
The gym and the fitness center:

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.080
oh my gosh, I mean I could go on and
on, the dormitories, we talked to one

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.530
student, he's from Angola. Okay how did
a student from Angola find Grinnell?

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.600
I'm not sure, but this is a very
international campus.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.160
Anyway, he was talking about the dormitories and saying I love my dorms.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:36.270
Look, if you are able, if you are interested in a small liberal
arts college of the highest quality and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.090
all you're thinking about is Williams
and Amherst, think again. Think Iowa.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.180
Think Grinnell. Grinnell has fantastic resources
for students, financial as well as human.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.939
I talked to a guy in a cafe downtown and
he was a graduate of Grinnell and he

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.659
said "oh no all the professors live here."
They don't go---

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.700
they don't live in Des Moines, which is about
an hour, hour and a half away, no no.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.080
They all live in this community.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.700
If you want
tight relationships with your

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.200
professors, Grinnell, my gosh it's really going to be hard to beat. What else can I say about this place...oh again--

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.300
international. This has one of the
highest ratios of international students anywhere.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.120
Here in Iowa! Why?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.430
Because people
are looking for the highest quality

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.420
education they can get in the United
States. There are many other places of

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.150
course and I don't mean to suggest that
other places aren't equally good, but if

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.170
you're really looking for a top-notch
school in America think about Grinnell.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.390
Another example: we were walking
through the Student Center and a young

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.140
man stopped us and said can I help you?
And I said well we're just looking

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.080
around, but can I ask you a question: how
did you decide to come here? And he said

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.190
well, I'm from Massachusetts and I was
originally thinking Williams and Amherst,

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.819
but I needed money. I couldn't afford
those schools. And Grinnell gave him a

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.600
hefty merit package to come here and he
said he has no regrets. At all.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.440
People here are extremely passionate about
whatever they're interested in and they

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.780
are pretty laid-back. I mean students who
are willing to consider Iowa, they're not

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.480
as pretentious as some people who are
looking necessarily for the name.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.870
Okay they're not looking for the geography of
American education, they're looking for

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.400
quality of American education. So you're
getting a slightly different tone here at Grinnell.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.680
Fabulous facilities,
International campus, really bright

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.740
student body, and it can be very
affordable.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.500
So if you haven't figured out where the hell Grinnell is,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.130
you had
better get it on your list.
