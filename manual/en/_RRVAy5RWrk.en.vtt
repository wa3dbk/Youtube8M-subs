&gt;&gt; David Helfand: I think a difficulty that
universities face today that they didn't

00:00:11.126 --> 00:00:16.236
so much 40 years ago is that they're
trying to do very many things,

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:21.446
most of which are good social contributions,
but they diffuse the energy of the institution

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:24.446
and the people in the institution
to the point that the focus

00:00:24.446 --> 00:00:26.726
on undergraduate education is lost.

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:30.106
So universities are supposed
to be real estate developers,

00:00:30.106 --> 00:00:33.286
and biotech spin off company generators,

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:37.896
and creators of new scholars
and caring for sick people.

00:00:38.286 --> 00:00:43.566
And all these things detract from the
individual faculty members' time to focus

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:46.916
on undergraduate education,
at least part of the time.

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:54.766
So I've seen this expansion of roles
really detract from the quality of time

00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:59.286
that undergraduates get to spend
interacting with experts in their fields.

00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:05.236
And I don't think that technology can replace
that human interaction that takes place

00:01:05.236 --> 00:01:07.556
around a small table with
a bunch of undergraduates.

00:01:08.516 --> 00:01:12.556

00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:17.706
Well I wouldn't want to presume to specify
how Dartmouth should spend its next 250 years,

00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:22.066
but I believe the strategic
planning process really needs

00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:24.786
to look carefully at what
you can effectively do.

00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:30.676
You are a modest sized research university
but you are primarily Dartmouth College.

00:01:31.326 --> 00:01:36.146
And I think there are people and I know
some of them on your faculty who manage

00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:43.426
to balance beautifully the deep engagement with
undergraduate education and scholarly research.

00:01:43.896 --> 00:01:45.446
Keeping that balance is critical.

00:01:45.836 --> 00:01:48.146
If you push too far in the
direction of research,

00:01:48.336 --> 00:01:50.266
you're going to lose what's unique here.

00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:57.526
And so I would like to see a real focus on the
problem of how one constructs a reward system,

00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:04.856
a tenure system if you will, and an ethos
that equally values both of those aspects

00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:11.836
and sees them as one as the way for an
intellectual to educate, not to train,

00:02:11.836 --> 00:02:14.036
but to educate, the next generation.

00:02:15.516 --> 00:02:17.636
[ Silence ]

00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:24.276
It depends how the reward system is set up as to
whether or not research and teaching are viewed

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:27.636
as oppositional or as an integrated whole.

00:02:28.576 --> 00:02:32.586
I think it's very important first for
scholars to remain intellectually alive,

00:02:32.896 --> 00:02:37.246
and secondly for them to give their
undergraduates a window into what it means

00:02:37.606 --> 00:02:40.736
to work hard on a problem to
which you don't know the answer.

00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:44.956
So I think it's critical that
faculty remain involved in research.

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:49.466
But it should be involved in research in a way
that can draw undergraduates into it rather

00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:50.976
than push them away because they're too busy.

00:02:51.516 --> 00:02:56.440
