00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.990
 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.309
Hi this is Kelsey Mays for cars dot com we're at the New York Auto Show looking at the

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.519
2009 Infiniti halfbacks

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.939
and this is the second generation have
an SUV is already pretty sporty to begin

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:16.230
with

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.109
and this generation gets even sportier
with things like a 5-liter v-8 has

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.840
390 horsepower that's pretty serious for
car like this

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.100
is also a v6 other details on that have
not yet been released

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.840
beside the really FX looks a lot like
the first generation it also looks a lot

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.289
like the a penny he acts which is their
smaller SUV

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.460
the front though you can definitely see
some differences the girls lower its

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.020
wider

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.210
and the headlights are a lot more
menacing than before

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.920
I'm not sure i'm too crazy about this
setup wavy grill here uses an

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.550
interesting material not close it looks
just kinda weird know inside

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.159
the FX has the same sure high beltline
the previous generation had which gives

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.120
you kinda hunker down feel when you're
driving it

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.229
on lot a nice touches from other insane
these include

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.299
the sorta chrome touches on this stock
sex is steering wheel

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:03.690
others navigation system here with lotsa
shortcut buttons and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.180
it's pretty easy to use there's also a
lot of technology here there's nissan's

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.479
around view monitor

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.780
which helps the park in tight spots
there's a lane departure prevention

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.430
system

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.070
there's a cruise control system that can
bring the car all the way down to a

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.080
complete stop

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.890
there's even an electron concierge at
all schedule nine holes at two o'clock

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.480
via

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.930
okay we're kidding about the concierge
other some nice touches here with

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.930
materials is kinda nice metallic in

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.340
would combination curling around the
door handles I we're not

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.560
too crazy about the seats they have the
store to diamond cut leather in the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.070
center

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.120
and I'm not sure that that's a car like
this now the general shape this car

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.950
didn't change a whole lot so that means
you still got a lower route finder

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.990
really kinda tapers off

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.560
yet I mean there's quite a blind spot as
you look back that low

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.680
reply also takes its toll on cargo space
if you look back here you'll notice how

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.960
slow down this is

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.970
not gonna be able to get very many
full-size suitcases behind the second

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.550
row seat

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.240
I'm the second row seat here doesn't
power down up like a dozen the EX if in

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.980
the says it did that to save weight

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.740
what it does do is lower with the Pooh
love these things right here

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.860
pretty simple stuff the course for all
its like kings in utility

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.159
the FX is nothing if not a sporty SUV
it's our attention probably comes when

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:11.200
you drive this thing

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.950
we won't know for sure until we get one
on the road but will tell you when we

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.610
find out

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.290

or any other
