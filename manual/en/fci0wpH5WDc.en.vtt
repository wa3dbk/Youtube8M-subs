Thanks Kyle. Welcome back! A growing
number of Australians say a desire to

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.220
fit in is driving them to undergo
surgery to have their eyes widened

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.540
while controversial patients say it's
like using fake tan or getting braces a

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.000
way they can make themselves feel
beautiful

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.020
If you are Asian and want more

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.000
features on your face, I can help.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
For many of Chinese girl, their dream is to look like barbie doll.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.500
I think wide eyes make me look a bit better and i guess

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.000
make me look more trustworthy

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.070
Tt's the controversial cosmetic trend

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.080
that's altering Asian facial features
across the country

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.930
Cosmetic surgeon Dr. Andrew Kim performs about eight
operations a week

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.000
the end result patients have more western looking eyes.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.149
They look too angry or
are you feeling sleepy if your eyes are too

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.399
small. They get all different comments. Dr. Kim says
procedures becoming more and more common

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.140
for teenagers who've been teased about
their appearance some as young as 12 or

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.750
13 years old. Is that too young for
double eyelid surgery? What I believe is

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.430
not too young it's more that the child
agrees and also parents agree. 27 year

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.689
old Susannah Han born in China knows
what it's like to be the target of

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.689
negative comments. People ask me this is
always look angry the eyes looks like

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.590
angry. No. So that's why I need a change
in my eyes. She had the surgery six

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.229
months ago and is happy with the change.
It's worked. After eyelid surgery, my eyes

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.710
obviously changed a bit bigger and I have more confidence. The procedure is called

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.170
double eyelid surgery using a stitching
method doctors create a new fold that

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.810
also makes the eyes bigger it costs
around three and a half thousand dollars

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.320
for an extra four thousand dollars there
are also more surgical options available

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.880
where incisions are made often used for
older patients. After I'd done the eyelid

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:20.180
surgery my friends who are in China, they said, "ah you look prettier". Inside I feel

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.280
Australian but outside I'm Asian
moving from Malaysia to Australia as a

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.370
toddler
Heidi Liao has admired the wide-eyed

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.480
look since she was in primary school. I
came from a school where I was pretty

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.959
much the only Asian in my year and you
know being Caucasian or being Australian

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:44.600
was beautiful. Not satisfied with just
the eye procedure she's had a number of

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.049
surgeries to alter her appearance. So
done my eyes I've done my nose doctors

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.850
put in a gore-tex implant here then he
has decided to work a bit more on the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.650
tip. Commerce student Kevin Wan invited
our cameras into the surgery for his

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.510
30-minute procedure. The 19 year old
surgery is being done under a local

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.660
anesthetic. He's fully conscious. Dr. Kim
says the double eyelid stitch method is

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.430
relatively painless apart from some
minor bruising that may last one to two

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.000
weeks. What do you think your friends are
going to think?

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:27.100
The're gonna have to get used to it. If they don't like it, they're gonna have to be used to it. So you're happy? Yeah.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.850
Caucasian wonder why do you need it. Same reasons we 
ask them like why do you need to do your

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.739
teeth. It's just with us Asians is that
it's a totally different field of what

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.410
we consider is our way to get beautiful
