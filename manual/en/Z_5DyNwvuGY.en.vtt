"Wart Cancer Viruses in Food"

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.860
Last year, I talked about butcher’s
warts, a condition that afflicts

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.960
those who handle fresh meat for a
living because of the viruses in meat.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.140
But it’s more than
just a cosmetic issue.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.500
Earlier this year, a landmark
study of cancer mortality in

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.780
poultry workers was released.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.740
We’ve known that people who handle
a lot of fresh chicken get

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.220
a lot of warts on their hands,
but the concern is that

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.080
some of the wart viruses are
oncogenic, or cancer-causing.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.680
Workers in poultry slaughtering and
processing are exposed to these

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.960
cancer-causing viruses — some of which
are the most potent cancer-causing

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.020
agents known in animals.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.140
But what does that mean for people?

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.200
Well, compared to the general
population, poultry workers

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.920
appear to have an excess
of cancers of the mouth;

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.680
nasal cavities; throat;
cancer of the tongue;

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.400
the tonsils; the inner ear;
then down the esophagus;

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.040
rectal/anal cancer; and liver, bone
marrow, and blood cancers as well.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.280
The reason it’s so important to study
this group is because it’s possible

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.540
that the cancer-causing viruses present
in poultry and poultry products

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.100
could be transmitted to
anyone handing raw poultry.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.800
Proper cooking will kill any and all
chicken wart and cancer viruses —

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.000
but the problem is that meat may
come into our homes fresh or frozen,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.760
and contaminate our hands or kitchen
surfaces before it gets into the pot.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.160
Same concern with other meat.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.540
There was a fascinating case
report about pork intake and

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.520
human papillomavirus — HPV — which can
cause cancerous anal and genital warts.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.200
Oh, the poor guy; 19 years old.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.360
Giant warty tumor, nearly an
inch in diameter, protruding

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.400
from the tip of his penis.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.900
They cut it off, but it grew right back, and
so they asked for a dietary history.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.820
He was eating more than
a pound of pork a day.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.260
They told him to stop the pork,
and the tumor completely

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.000
regressed on its own —
totally disappeared.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.740
The doctors were so blown away, they
even went as far as to suggest that

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.820
the low cervical cancer rates in Israel
could be because they eat so little pork.
