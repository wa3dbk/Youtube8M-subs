00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.600
President Obama:
There's incredible stuff going
on all across America and right

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.567
here in Austin that I think can
be good models for the rest of

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:16.834
America to follow.

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:19.767
I visited Manor New Tech High
School where students are

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:22.266
learning high tech skills
that companies are looking

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.266
for right now.

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.266
They are getting excited.

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.834
Speaker:
Welcome, Mr. President.

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:27.033
President Obama:
Congratulations on the great
work you are doing and we're

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:27.967
going to highlight it.

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:28.834
Speaker:
Thank you, sir.

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:30.166
President Obama:
We want the whole country
to see what's going on here.

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.300
Speaker:
We're excited you're here.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.600
We want to show
the whole country.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.700
President Obama:
What have you got to show me?

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.333
Come on.

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.133
I'm looking forward
to seeing it.

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:38.967
Whoa!

00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:41.100
(laughter)

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.967
So this is all
exclusively solar powered?

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:43.734
Speaker:
Yes.

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:44.934
President Obama:
That's got some speed there.

00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:47.400
You guys got some contraptions.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.467
Speaker:
Contraptions, yes.

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:51.100
President Obama:
That's the technical
name for it.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.500
There's the light
bulb right there.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.567
I just saw the light go on.

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:55.734
And how about this one?

00:00:55.734 --> 00:00:57.066
Speaker:
See what it's going to do.

00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.300
Everyone:
Whoa!

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.300
President Obama:
You want me to put goggles on?

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.800
Speaker:
Yes, safety first.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.667
President Obama:
All right.

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:02.367
Let's go.

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:05.066
I got my goggles.

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.033
This is just within
an inch, right?

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.433
Absolutely.

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:09.266
That's outstanding.

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.533
Speaker:
So we're FRC, and --

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:12.400
President Obama:
What's FRC?

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.166
You've got to help me out.

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:13.967
Speaker:
First Robotics Company.

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:16.467
President Obama:
Got it.

00:01:16.467 --> 00:01:17.800
When you guys are
doing these projects,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.467
is this incorporated into your
classroom learning or are you

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:24.767
doing this just after
school, after classes?

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:27.500
Speaker:
So this is the fifth year
that we've had this group.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.867
This is the first year
that we've actually had a

00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:29.900
course for it.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.467
So this year we actually managed
to be able to have class time to

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:33.700
be able to build our robots.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.867
President Obama:
Fantastic.

00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:37.533
And then I joined a few local
families for lunch to talk about

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:40.433
how we can make sure that hard
work pays off with wages you can

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.467
live on and raise a family.

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:45.333
I visited Capital Factory,
which, as some of you know,

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:48.700
is a place that helps
startups take off.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.133
And everywhere you turned,
somebody's got a new idea.

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:52.133
They're all thinking big.

00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:53.333
They're taking risks.

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:54.400
It's exciting.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.900
Speaker:
We are fully buzz
word compliant.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.667
We accept all buzz
words in terms.

00:01:57.667 --> 00:01:59.333
So we are a co-working
space, an incubator,

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:02.166
an accelerator and an investment
fund, all those things.

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.200
President Obama:
All together.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.767
I have spent the day in Austin
talking with folks about what we

00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:10.734
can do to reignite the true
engine of America's economic

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:16.800
growth, a thriving, rising,
middle class and dynamic cutting

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800
edge economy.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800
That's our priority.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.100
That should be
Washington's top priority.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.066
And I see three things that
we need to focus on to do it.

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:27.600
Number one, we've got to make
America a magnet for good jobs.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.333
Number two, we've got to help
people earn the skills they need

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:31.700
to do those jobs.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.400
Number three, we've got to
make sure people's hard work is

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.800
rewarded so that they can make a
decent living doing those jobs.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.900
We should do all that we can
to encourage this kind of

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.967
innovation economy.

00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:43.800
That's America.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.300
We innovate, we adapt,
we move forward.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.934
That's what Austin's all about.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.500
That's what's going
on in this city.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.200
And that's what I want to keep
on promoting as your President

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.567
of the United States of America.
