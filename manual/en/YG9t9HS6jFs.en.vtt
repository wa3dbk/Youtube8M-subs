00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.740
Speaker 1: So I've got a lovely assistant
here.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.740
Would you do me a favor?

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.740
Speaker 2: Sure.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.740
Speaker 1: Would you go ahead and cut the
cards wherever you like?

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.480
Great, just like that and then we'll take
this packet here and we'll mark the place

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.980
where you cut.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.020
We're going to try a little experiment with
magnetism.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.240
You know the earth has a magnetic field, obviously.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.369
We're going to try and tap into that field
ourselves, and you're going to help me out

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.369
with this, Okay?

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.369
Sounds good?

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.369
Speaker 2: Sounds cool.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.369
Speaker 1: Alright, let's try this here.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.369
Would you do me a favor?

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:35.320
Take two cards from the place you cut, and
I won't look.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.390
Do me a favor, look at them really quickly
and go show them to the camera and I won't

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.390
look.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.390
Good?

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.620
And what I want you to do is slide them anywhere
into the deck that you like.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.870
Right there?

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.540
Believe it or not, just by touching them you've
actually magnetized those cards a little bit,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.040
but you don't have to take my word for it
because with just a little bit of magnetism

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.760
and a little bit of magic, I can take those
cards....

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.760
Speaker 2: Wow.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.239
Speaker 1: ... right back out.

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.280
Okay, so that's the six, nine trick.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.410
I'm going to show you guys how that works
right now, would you like to see?

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.440
Alright, this is really cool.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.270
Believe it or not, these weren't the cards
you had, and this is a trick you can do entirely

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.190
with an unprepared deck of cards.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.140
You have to set the deck up a little bit,
but it's a totally normal deck.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.000
You can do this with a regular 52 deck.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.030
The cards you pulled were actually not the
six of clubs and the nine of spades, but the

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.270
six of spades and the nine of clubs.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.980
Now you're probably wondering how I got you
to choose those cards, well that's something

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.750
we magicians call force.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.160
Now here's how this force works, it's called
the crisscross force.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.330
Before I show that, though, I'm going to show
you the secret setup.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.440
You want to begin the trick with a six of
spades.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.610
It doesn't matter, but generally six of spades
right there on the bottom.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.060
A six and a nine look pretty much alike.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.390
The brain has a hard time separating them,
which is why we use a six and a nine for this

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.390
effect.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.509
So we put the six of spades on the bottom
and we put the nine of clubs right on top.

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.780
Above that we put the six of clubs and then
on top of that we put the nine of spades.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.701
Now what's going to happen is we're going
to force her those two top cards, the two

00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:20.470
top cards being the six of clubs and the nine
of spades.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.530
We're going to force her those cards.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.370
Here's how we're going to force her those
cards.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.250
When you cut the deck, you have the choice
to put the deck wherever you want.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.750
I had you mark it with the bottom half.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.750
Then I took your attention away from the deck
by talking about magnetism, by discussing

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.720
the trick with you, right?

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.530
When we come back to the deck, I asked you
to take two cards from the place you marked.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.930
In actuality, because we don't always remember
quite what we did a few minutes ago, most

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.000
people, in fact this is a pretty effective
force, will forget that this was actually

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.530
the top of the deck.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:03.230
She cut the deck here, but because we use
this as the marker in the crisscross formation,

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.500
I asked her to take two cards in the place
she marked, and sure enough she took the nine

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.550
of spades and the six of clubs.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.220
Then I just put what was the top half right
back on top, and we're good to go.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.260
She can slide those two cards anywhere she
wants, and all I have to do, because remember

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.750
we got the nine, crease that on top, and the
six crease that on the bottom.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.970
All I have to do is hold, squeeze a little
bit on the top and the bottom card and just

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.380
the momentum of quickly swinging my arm to
this side will actually throw the deck and

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.830
leave me with just those two cards.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.420
I'll show you real quick how it's done.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.240
It's really simple, it's just that motion.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.210
And you can do it even a little bit faster,
you can make it a quick... just like that.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.880
And that's how you do the six, nine trick.
