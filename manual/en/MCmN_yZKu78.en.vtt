Hi! I am Melanie McLeroy with Taurus Training
for Expert Village and today we are going

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:13.130
to talk about training dogs. So let us talk
about marking behavior. Marking behavior is

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:34.980
a very important part of dog training because
it gives your dog an instant signal that they

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.660
have done something right. This is Shira who
is a dog I have not worked with before and

00:00:43.660 --> 00:01:01.821
I know that she does not really know what
her mark is, so this is what it looks like,

00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:11.970
sit, good. The mark is the “good” the
second she does the appropriate behavior.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:24.670
The purpose of this word or sound, you can
use anything, it can be a clicker, it can

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.730
be good, yes, yep, anything, just something
that marks that the appropriate behavior has

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:45.549
occurred. It
acts as a bridge between the behavior and

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:55.659
the reward. That way the dog knows the second
they have done something, that they have done

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:06.300
it right. One of the main reasons we do this
is that as we, as humans are very very slow

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.620
especially in dog’s opinion and it can really
really help them know exactly when they have

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.590
done something right. Now a lot of us like
to use the word no when our dogs have done

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.769
something wrong. It is a matter of contention
in the dog training world as to whether this

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.030
is appropriate or not. Some people choose
to completely ignore inappropriate behavior;

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:34.849
others use what we call a no reward marker.
You can use no, I often use and I feel it

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:41.969
can help the dog learn that they have not
quite done the right thing and it gives them

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.629
another chance. So let us work again with
Shira… okay, sit, good, okay, sit, good.

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.989
Now you notice that Shira is sitting a little
bit slowly that is okay at this point, because

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.060
we have just started working, but eventually
you want to set your dog up to succeed by

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.489
incrementally speeding them up. Also notice
she moves her bottom just a little bit there

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:09.390
at the end, I want her to sit on my terms,
so I may use a no reward marker if that starts

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.400
becoming a problem, okay, sit, good, alright,
Shira has done a great job.
