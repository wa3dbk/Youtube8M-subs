Hi, my name is Gary Schutt and we are going
to be talking about harmonic minor scales.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:14.960
Thanks to heavy rock, harmonic minor scales
have become quite popular. It is a very dark,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:25.000
mysterious, eerie Middle Eastern kind of scale.
It is based on a minor scale. This is A-minor;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:43.409
a very sad scale. What harmonic minor is we
are taking from the 7th of that scale; G and

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:51.190
we are sharpening it to a G-Sharp. We are
raising the note so we have a natural 7th

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:13.720
borrowed from the major scale. This is a cool
run. Once you have the scale down, it’s

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.350
4th thread E-string, 5th thread E-String and
7ththread E-String and 5th thread A-string,

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:34.910
7th thread A-String, and 8th thread A-string.
That is the first pattern and then we are

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:42.200
going to repeat the same pattern of notes
on the D string and G string and the same

00:01:42.200 --> 00:02:16.799
pattern of notes on the B string and E string.
Play that coming back down too. It’s a little

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:42.590
tricky so watch it. Harmonic minor is best
when played over and E-major chord when the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.819
rest of the song is an A-Minor and suddenly
go to the E-major.
