00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:04.720
Let me show you around your embroidery screen.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.620
First off, you've built-in embroidery designs.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.650
If you touch the little flower in the top
corner here, that will actually open up a

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.940
drop-down menu.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.480
These are all the built-in designs and some
of the ones that are exclusive for the Ruby

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.590
Royale.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.890
So as you touch the slide bar towards the
bottom, kind of jump from screen to screen.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:32.220
You can also touch and drag the little bubble,
and all those designs are in the machine.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.130
Yay, there's lots to stitch out.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.180
So, just like we recommended you stitching
out your decorative stitches, it's going to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.250
be a great time to stitch out some of these.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.740
I won't require all of them, but you will
find a lot of these in your booklet that shows

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.000
the designs and how many colors they are.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.260
You can also use the Help.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.960
So if you actually touch the little - let's
see here, the Help.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.640
Yes, here it is, the question mark.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.111
Let it me do it while one of the windows is
open here.

00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:04.799
Here it comes.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.191
If you touch the question mark and touch a
design, it'll actually show you what the design

00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:15.860
name is, the size of the design, total amount
of stitches, and how many colors.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.270
So if you're looking for a really quick design,
well 3000 stitches is a very small design.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.000
So for example if you are looking for - how
about let's do this little flower here.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.909
That one has - well still not very many stitches,
it's still a small design.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.640
So there's some fabulous designs that don't
take a lot of stitching in this machine, right

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.760
at your fingertips.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.460
So why don't we go ahead, we'll touch the
little frog here.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.830
The first thing that's going to come up and
we're going to be told is what hoop size this

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.830
design fits in.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.200
It happens to be a hoop that is a 120 by 120
hoop, so that is actually your regular sized

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.850
hoop, I call it more of a medium sized hoop.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.549
But since I have the larger hoop on I'm going
to need to tell the machine I have a larger

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:01.549
hoop.

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.979
So touch the Hoop area, and scroll up to the
top.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.010
It's the largest hoop so it's at the top of
the list.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.380
And it will actually give you a bigger playground
and show you for example how big this frog

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.380
is.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.780
Then we can go ahead - we'll get to show you
how to move the frog around, bring letters

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.290
in, combine them, and when you're done all
you have to do is touch the trashcan, so the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.109
trashcan will delete that off.

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.889
It's not deleting it from the machine, it's
just deleting it off the work area.

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:36.599
So if we went ahead and went to another design,
for example the heart here, it will bring

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.599
it in.

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.239
We've told it which hoop we're using so it
still keeps that area.

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.310
We can zoom in if you want to see what you're
doing.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.579
Again, if a box is around it - and if it's
not you can touch it and a box will appear

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.610
- and then we can move it side to side.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.749
Kind of a nice touch and drag type option
here.

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:58.529
So, we will be able to do so many things with
this machine.

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:01.059
But this is how easy it is to do.

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:05.349
And when you're ready to embroider you can
go ahead and touch Go.

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.209
Once you're in the embroidery screen you can
move the design wherever you want, see where

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.870
it's going to embroider, and then go ahead
and get started.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.519
So let me show you what this means.

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.209
If I want to see where I actually want to
stitch, touch the Design Positioning - that's

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.859
the little flower with the 4 arrows down here
- and there is 4 options here.

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:31.950
I can move the needle to the top left corner,
the top right corner, the bottom right corner,

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.959
the bottom left corner, and back to center.

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.469
So if I want to center this design on my hoop
what I can do is go ahead and move the center

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:42.150
of the design.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.260
Notice as I hold this, it's moving my needle
all the way up, and then I'm going to move

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.739
it over here to the side a little bit.

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.230
Very small increments.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.560
So the more you hold this, the more that moves.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.709
I'm just going to get this really - well that's
pretty close.

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.020
Once I have it where I want it to be, if I
want to trace around it one more time, and

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.849
just make sure I'm not stitching over something
I'm not supposed to be stitching, that's a

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:06.849
great way.

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.629
We will come back to the design positioning
and show you more of that once you get started.

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.609
This is a one-color design, and I can tell
that because there's only one color block

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.790
showing on the right hand side.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.750
To get started started, you're just going
to hold the thread.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.069
You don't have to thread it down through the
foot or anything.

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:26.440
Hold the thread gently in your left hand,
and push the Start/Stop button.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.230
Count to 3 - 1, 2, 3, and when you do that
the thread will have been cut, and you can

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.370
gently pull and remove it.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.600
Then it's ready to stitch out.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.110
As it's stitching, what you're going to find
is a lot of designs have what we call underlay

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.530
stitching, stitching that goes down first
to kind of connect the fabric to the stabilizer,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.629
and also give the design a little bit more
body as it stitches over this.

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:51.800
So it's really kind of neat.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.300
I still sit and watch in amazement as these
designs are created.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:06.770
If you see any bobbin thread coming up, what
you can do is reduce down the thread portioning

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.020
system, and just by having it be a smaller
number you'll get more threads pulled to the

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.020
back side.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.680
You definitely don't want any white thread
or bobbin thread coming up to the top.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.870
Bobbin thread, we usually use white, so it
sometimes does show on maybe your darker colors

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.980
if it's not properly set.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.270
So because I have a little bit different weight
of thread in my bobbin I did need to reduce

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.270
that down.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.639
There we go.

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.280
It's looking fantastic.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.060
Now, I would never tell you to walk away from
your machine while it's embroidering.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.990
Stay with it, because you definitely can find
- just, it's fascinating to watch.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.270
Also too, if anything was to happen, you can
be right here to know how to back up and how

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.270
to take care of it.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.530
We're going to show you videos on all of that,
should you run out of bobbin thread, what

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.970
do you do.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.000
Can you take the hoop off during the embroidery
process?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
You sure can.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.650
If you need to leave the machine, go ahead
and push the Start/Stop button.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.280
It'll start right where it is, and it will
actually remember where that spot is, even

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.400
if you turn off the machine.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.360
You just have to have the Smart Save option
set in the machine.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.240
We were up here in the Tools area, and Smart
Save is going to be - I have to go look for

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.479
it always, but I know it's set on this machine.

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:26.389
So, Auto Smart Save, okay, it's got the checkmarked
box, so that means if I have any power out

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.180
issues then that way I can make sure that
there isn't a problem.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.969
Also too, plug your machine into at least
a surge protector, or better yet a battery

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:43.090
backup, and that way your machine will just
stay healthier if you have any power issues.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.659
We've noticed that as we get big groups together
that that really makes a difference.

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:53.120
So it was counting down here, and it still
is, because we've got it - and design is finished,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.919
sings a nice little pretty song, and we can
touch OK.

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.740
When you're done with the design you will
come back out of the embroidery screen, that

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.650
return arrow, and back to the embroidery edit
screen.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.199
Then if I want to go to another design, I
want to go ahead and select the design, put

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:13.830
a box around it, or do the Select All and
touch the trashcan, and it will delete it

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.830
off.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.319
Once again, it doesn't delete it from the
machine, it just deletes it from your work

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:20.069
area, and you're ready to pull in your next
design.

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:22.979
Your design has been trimmed so it's ready
to get pulled off.

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:28.080
Go ahead and remove your hoop and take everything
out, and be ready to go for your next project.
