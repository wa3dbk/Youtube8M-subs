00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.360
So what we're going to do is we're going to
pull out pin bones on the fish.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.849
This, again, can be used for just about any
process, whether it's striper, snapper, salmon,

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.100
anything that has those big, long pin bones.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.450
All you really need are some nice needle-nose
pliers.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.789
You can spend some money and go to a fancy
home cooking store and spend money on fish

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.840
pliers, but you can go to any hardware store
and get some needle-nose, and they'll do the

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.840
job.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.070
I actually like them better.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.450
So, what we're looking for is pin bones.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.240
The pin bones are these kind of weird little
bones that kind of run off the side of the

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.539
ribcage, and they only go about halfway through
the fish.

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.220
So, to find them, what you want to do is you
want to run your finger against the grain,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.800
so starting up at the neck and going down
toward the tail, and you just kind of run

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.570
your fingers down and you'll feel these little,
almost like little stubble.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.789
You just kind of feel these little pieces
sticking up.

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.281
And all you're going to do is take your needle-nose,
go up to those little stubble pieces, and

00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:08.030
pull out with the grain.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.049
So kind of go with it, going toward the head,
or where the head would have been.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.100
And you can see, they'll come right out.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.920
And again, you can feel it with your finger,
and pull right out.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.920
You want to be careful.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.700
On some of the bigger fish, or the ones that
have really strong, thick pin bones, like

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.470
wild striped bass and stuff, you might want
to keep your fingers down on the filet a little

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.159
bit, so as not to tear the meat or rip it
up.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.990
On some of the bigger fish, as well, it's
actually easier to take the pin bones out

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.640
once you've skinned it.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.060
If you like salmon skin and striper skin,
you're just going to have to tug a little

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.049
bit more, but otherwise, go for it.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.119
You should be able to just push down on it
for some leverage, take your needle-nose,

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.119
and pull them right out.

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.630
They'll come right out.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.950
These are pretty big so they're pretty easy
to find.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.190
Some of the smaller fish, you may have to
work at it, but you can really ruin date night

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.820
if you don't get any of the pin bones out,
so really try and get those out.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.600
And then you can take your finger, run back
over it, and really make sure you get them

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.810
all out.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.490
There we go.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.170
They should look a little bit like that.
