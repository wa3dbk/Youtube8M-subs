00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.280
Join the worldwide prayer movement of moms praying together for children and schools.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.059
There's an intense battle for the lives of our children. The greatest weapon,

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.080
that God has given us,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.529
is that gift of prayer, and then when it's incorporated with another mommy,

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.789
there's great faith added to it and great strenght to it and it defeats the enemy each and every time.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.200
Many of these women live in persecuted countries. Some of them

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.520
on a daily basis. They are persecuted for their faith.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.090
God's given them an incredible urgency and compassion for these kids.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.500
As we need to partner with God and witness and partner with these women around the world,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.410
and watch them be transformed, from the most hopeless situations you can

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.379
ever imagine. In some of these parts of the world we have seen,

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.420
that they've never heard the gospel and 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.370
through moms in prayer, not only did they learn how to pray, but they find Jesus.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.579
This one group of women,

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.789
they wanted our booklet translated into 10 different languages.

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.149
And they said, can you hear the gong on the left, that's Islam

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.250
coming in. If you could just imagine on a right side

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.619
child sacrifices, and we have seen within our own village the victory,

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.479
that these four powerful steps of prayer have brought. And we want our whole country

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.509
to have this booklet and to bring victory 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.440
throughout the country to heal our land.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.310
One lady after the moms in prayer meeting, she went back to her mud hut,   

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.369
had her child.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.899
What does she name her child, but prayer warrior and his middle name is Daniel.

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.619
She realizes that God has a great plan a mighty plan for this generation.

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.680
And nothing, no one can steal that away.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.720
 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.040
An incredible story in Nepal about a moms in prayer group, 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.100
hiking up a mountain in the Himalayas.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.320
This group, they go on top of the mountain and they fast and pray for an

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.460
entire day.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.600
And they pray not only for their own kids, but they pray for the kids

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.540
in that entire valley of Katmandu.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.290
These women get a hold of prayer and the word and they pray scripturally 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.010
over their kids

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.720
and their kids teachers and their schools. And things start changing, not only

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.460
in their kids and in their own families,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:29.460
but the teachers and entire communities start getting impacted for Christ.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.930
We had a mom, who had been driving a school bus for thirteen years

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.710
and had been praying for each child on that bus and the teachers of all the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.390
schools, where she did her drops

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.980
and gathering with women and 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.240
praying for four different schools. And she found us.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.120
So now she's connected with the Ministry and realizes, she's a part of something so

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.890
huge.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.400
Women go on mission trips and so as a part of their mission trip, they bring along

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.960
Moms in Prayer

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.110
materials. And they teach the local women about what Moms in Prayer

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.470
is and tell them how that has impacted their life.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.990
This booklet is of the attributes of God, it's his character,

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.140
its scriptures and to have that in their own language

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.450
just really helps explode the Ministry

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.160
in a country. As God raises up this army of prayer, nothing can stop it

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.910
and God hit this next generation. God is going to bring

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.520
victory and revival.
