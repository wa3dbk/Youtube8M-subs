00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.066
Hi there. Why don't you come on

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
in and take a look at my space?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This is my bedroom, but it's where I do most of my work,  and where I store all my work.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
All my work, when it's not being shown in a gallery  is always underneath the bed.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So this is where my work is stored when it's not showing.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.533
It's kind of makeshift,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but when you live  in a small place

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and you don't have a studio,  it's just kind of

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the way things have to be.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'd always been interested  in how people interact

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.666
with technology,  and the social aspects

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that I was interested in  kind of coincided with these

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
visual things that I was doing

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
developed into this connection and isolation  that technology brings us.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So down here, this is where I show my work

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.866
when I have people over.  So I lay it out, pull this stuff

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
out from underneath the bed

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This is my first body of work.  It was titled "The Illuminati,"

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
it was my undergrad thesis work.  It consists of 10 pieces.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's gotten around now.  It's in a couple

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.400
museum collections,  and it's been published fairly

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
thoroughly through Europe  and some places in the U.S.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Each piece is 30-by-40 inches,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and it's face-mounted to 1/4-inch piece of Plexiglas.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.533
The initial reason that

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
they were mounted on Plex was,  I had an old

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
first generation iPod,  and it actually had a clear

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
piece of maybe Plexiglas,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
some sort of resin over the top of it.  And since the subject matter

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.066
was dealing with

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
youth and technology,  and technology is so glossy

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and kind of shiny  and slippery

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and candy-colored,  I felt that the Plex

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
really kind of related to that.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.533
I never really had this

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
experience when I was young,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
inside this technology,  but I think that not growing up

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
with it in my hand all the time,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I think it gave me  a little bit of a perspective

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
from the outside.  On these long drives

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that I would take  down through southern Minnesota,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
there were lots of farms that were just lit up,  and usually I was

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
driving in the late night,  and there were kind of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
these little islands,  these little pieces of light

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.400
scattered throughout the countryside.  I began to notice that same

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
type of effect with people,  that same way the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
light would reach out  and kind of just touch the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
people that were so close to it,  but that it never really

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
extended beyond that.  (man) ¶¶ Well, they say, you know it's progress. ¶¶

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
(piano plays softly)  ¶¶ Well, they say

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
you know it's truth. ¶¶

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
(Evan)

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So The Illuminati, the work is paradoxical

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
in the fact that it kind of  has this subject matter

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that's both connected,  and it's both isolated

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
at the same time.  The light that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
they're kind of bathed in,  it kind of gives the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
viewer this impression

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that maybe they're gleaning something,  or that they're being--

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I use the term "illuminated"

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.600
as in, you are receiving

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
some sort of information,  you're making some

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
sort of connection  that's not very tangible.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And at the same time, it's such an isolating practice

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.800
because it's something that

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
really you have to do alone,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
you interact with the screen alone.  You don't interact

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
with a group of people.  The images, both they have

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
this beautiful light

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that makes you think  that there's this grace

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
to these devices.  And at the same time,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
they're completely surrounded

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
by this darkness and this cold isolation.  I always want the viewer to

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
leave thinking about something.  I want them to be thinking.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
That's really the hope for any work that I make

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
is that the viewer takes something away from it.  The viewer takes something

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
with them from the experience

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that they have with your work.
