We are at Bauru where we can see one of the objects...

that appeared in several cities this morning.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.750
 There are several rumors about the origin of these objects. 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.810
It is speculated that it is some... Some new meteorological equipment being tested,

 ...or a big advertising campaign or...

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.300

Rough day?

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.260

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.460
