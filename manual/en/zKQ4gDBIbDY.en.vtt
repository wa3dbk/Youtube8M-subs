00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.360
Hi.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.510
My name's Marie, and I'm the deputy manager
of the small animal department at Wood Green

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:21.590
Animal Shelters, and today I'm going to tell
you how to care for baby rabbits.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.540
Baby rabbits emerge from the nest at around
three to four weeks of age.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.700
Their eyes start to open at about three weeks
of age as well.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.340
After that time, they're very curious little
creatures and want to know what's going on,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.210
and want to try to nibble on everything.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.820
It's important that you are cautious with
their diet, as they can be quite sensitive

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.270
to a big change in their diet and to new foods.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.239
So it's really important that they've got
lots and lots of hay to feed on.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.060
As I've mentioned before, they should feed
up to 80% of their diet in hay.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.680
You'll also need to consider a small dry mix
for their food, and this should be, again,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.799
small brown pellets to form a food, and just
a small one that is made for baby rabbits.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.580
Only a small handful of this should be fed
once a day, and then they can be free to slowly

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.650
graze on certain types of grasses, and small
selections of wild plants, such as blackberry

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.880
leaves and strawberry leaves, which will be
fine for their digestive system.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.040
Rabbits will need their first vaccination,
which is their Myxomatosis, from six weeks

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.510
of age.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.920
They will then need worming, and their VHD
vaccination from three months of age.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.520
It's important that you do keep up to date
with these vaccinations, as rabbits are all

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.430
vulnerable to these diseases, particularly
at any age stage, and babies can be prone

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.430
to it.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.979
So your Myxy vaccination will help protect
them against it, and the VHD will fully cover

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.530
them for it.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.210
When you're first handling the baby rabbits,
it's a good idea to make sure that you rub

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.020
your hands in some of the bedding material
so you've got your ”the mum's smell” on

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.130
your hands, so you're not introducing any
scary smells to the environment.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.010
The best way to introduce a rabbit and help
them feel safe with you is to sit in the rabbit

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.720
run and let them come up to you.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.720
Let them take small amounts of food from you
and hop on and off your lap.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.810
Never try to keep chasing them and picking
them up.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.290
It's going to be a very stressful situation
for them, and they're most likely to grow

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.380
into rabbits who are going to kick, scratch,
and bite, and even growl at you.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.190
So let the rabbits feel safe, and that they
can come up to you.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.030
Sitting in their rabbit run for half an hour
or an hour every day will ensure that you

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.650
have a really friendly and relaxed and calm
rabbit, and as you can see, they'll be really

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.910
quite happy to be handled and socialized.
