00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:01.720
Recording...

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.200
What's up artists, welcome!

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.880
Hello Artists! Welcome! How are your days going?

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.060
Good? That's great

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.260
In this video, we are going to do a dessert. 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.800
And we are going to do Royal Icing

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.240
This is how we are going to decorate our cookies! 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.960
As you can see, my name is Pau Negrete Marin

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.340
Today's dessert day!

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.280
What we are going to need is:

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.880
330gr of powdered sugar/confectioner's sugar

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.220
2 Egg whites

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.540
2 tbsp of lemon juice

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.560
Remember that we have to sift the sugar first.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.140
This is what we don't want

00:00:59.014 --> 00:01:01.014
Ok, let's begin!

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:03.195
Let's put the egg whites first

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.500
Let's beat them a little bit

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.680
Let's not beat them so much, just a little bit foam

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.100
And now we will add the lemon juice

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.820
After mixing everything from 3-4 mins

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.860
We will be adding the powdered sugar

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.520
This means it's not ready yet since it still looks watery

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.100
The consistency must look firm

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.240
So let's keep up the beating

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.580
As you can see, it doesn't fall over and it's not watery

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.415
This is going to be our base mixture

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.320
We are going to use this to do the cookie outline

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.160
Now we are going to separate some of the icing for each color we will be using

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.200
It's important to use gel coloring(edible)

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.480
No we will divide the icing for each color we will use

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.980
In this case I will be using 4 colors

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.460
Now I have my 4 containers for each color, I will now color them

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.060
Remember that the icing in this containers are for the outline of the cookies

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.620
After we finish with this, we will continue with the filling(main base icing mixture)

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.960
After we finish coloring, we will take some of it

00:02:57.435 --> 00:02:59.435
This will be for the outline of the cookie

00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:01.050
And this will be for the filling

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.220
We will add some water to this one(the big one) so we can have a more watery consistency

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.540
This is for the filling

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.160
This is to give form to the figures

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.640
Take a closer look, the mixture integrates easily

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.180
And this is for the outline

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:33.794
You can see it looks very dense

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.020
To make myself more clear

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.280
I will make the mixtures and in the next video we will prepare the cookies

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.720
Once I have my colors and the mixtures

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.060
We will now use pastry bags or small bottles like this one

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.020
For the filling, we will use a bigger tip, for the outline a smaller tip

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.500
We will use the pastry bags or a small bottle like this one

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.260
After sometime, I have my pastry bags ready with the colors

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.700
This is how we will do the Royal Icing

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.540
If you want to see how I will use it, you can click this video(coming soon...)

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.100
There I will be using the pastry bags for some halloween themed cookies, very tasty and delicious

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:35.800
And if you *CLACK*... lol, *click* in this other video, you can check the recipe for the cookies.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.800
Thank you very much for staying with me

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.054
I send you a big hug!

00:04:39.054 --> 00:04:40.695
My name is Pau Negrete Marin

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.640
Hope to see you in the next dessert video!
