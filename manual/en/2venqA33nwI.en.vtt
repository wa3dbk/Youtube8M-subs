TIM MARTIN: Okay, so now onto keys.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.720
The way you make keys, really simple.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.240
Take your clay,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.080
not quite as thick, maybe half an inch.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.100
If you have a clay board that helps out a
lot.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.400
So now I have a thin sheet of clay.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.180
And I'm only going to make 3 keys.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.000
So I'm going to cut a strip

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.860
at a 90 degree angle,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.400
then the other one about a 45 [degree angle].

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.080
So you can see that I have a 45 degree angle
on one side,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.489
90 on the back.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.449
90 isn't important because it's going to be
on the outside of your mold.

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.360
So again I'm going to do another 45 degree
angle cut,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.119
45 degree angle cut

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.549
and that is a key.

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.229
That's what a key looks like in clay.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.380
So it's a lot deeper than it needs to be,
you'll see why.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.880
I'm going to press this really close to the
edge of the sculpture

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.700
and then cut it flush to my wall.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.100
So I've got this teeny tiny little key.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.840
That keeps, the three of these are going to
keep my mold from shifting against itself

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.800
when it's no longer got a sculpture in it

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.420
and you're trying to cast it up.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.181
Clean that up a little bit.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.140
And the 
reason you cut those edges at an angle,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.080
is because that angle makes sure that these
mold walls don't lock into themselves.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.000
If you did square keys, they're probably going
to break.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.180
You can do a few, depends on the size of your
sculpture.

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.180
I'm doing three,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.940
the top and the two sides.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.899
So I said "about a 45 degree angle"

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.419
don't worry if it's not exact,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.020
you don't have to sit there and

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.940
calculate or measure it somehow.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.420
Just eyeball it.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.760
And it looks really small, but this thing
is going to be so important.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.940
My final key is going to go on top.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.640
This one I can make a little wider, actually.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.200
So I made it a wider key but it'll still be
really shallow.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.600
Okay, so that is going to go right on top.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.900
Clean that off.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.440
Okay, so that's the end of our clay.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.960
Using my same sponge, cleaning up these

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.580
edges of this key a little bit.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.880
Now thinking ahead a little bit,

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.199
what I'm going to do is eventually when the
mold is taken off,

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.069
I'm going to then place it inside a bucket
upside down.

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.359
And that's how I'm going to fill it up.

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:35.459
If you don't have a bucket,

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.999
what you can do is, you can build the top
of your wall a little higher

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:41.269
and then cut it completely flat,

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.159
so that you still give yourself an edge

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.889
but the top of your mold is flat.

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.169
And what that does is you're basically preparing
to, then

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.049
when the mold is opened and cleaned up,

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:50.799
you'll flip it upside down,

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.709
you'll have a flat edge to rest it on.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.540
A lot of old school mold makers can sometimes,

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.609
they put wooden dowels in their molds

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.579
so it'll have four points,

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.760
basically you just set that over just like
a table

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.220
and that'll rest on its own.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.900
But, we're doing the quick and dirty version

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.729
so we're not going to be doing that.
