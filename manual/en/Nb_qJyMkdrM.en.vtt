00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.120
Silhouette can make for a very striking and
distinct artistic style in games.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.460
What makes things even better is when there's
a thematic reason for such a choice.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.510
In the world of Oscura, light keeps all manner
of nasty creatures at bay.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.190
When the lighthouse shatters, its crystals
spread across the land, shrouding everything

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.260
in darkness.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.640
Now these nasties are out and wandering.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.250
Bearing a lit torch, it's your job to light
the lanterns of each level (which act as checkpoints),

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.489
collect all crystal shards, and return light
back to the land.

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.050
The control scheme makes use of tapping the
screen with either one or two fingers.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.090
Touching either the right or left of the screen
will move your character in that direction.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.680
Jumping will occur when a second finger is
pressed down.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.820
The time spent pressing indicates the height
of the jump, and the whole system is quite

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.089
intuitive for precise platforming.

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:53.339
Where things break down a little is when you
have to change directions with your jumps

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.320
or jump from a small platform.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.420
Because you need to have one finger down to
jump, you almost always need a bit of room

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.070
to run up, and small platforms don't exactly
allow this leeway.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.030
This plus changing the direction of your jump
(either in mid air or after a landing) takes

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.240
some finicky maneuvering with releasing and
pressing fingers.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.600
It's not a deal breaker, but it does take
away from the flow of moving through a level.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.869
Luckily checkpoints are common, usually right
before tricky sections involving spikes, gears,

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.920
moving platforms, and areas sprinkled with
enemies for good measure.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.670
A level is completed when you reach the giant
glowing crystal at the end before you are

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.560
graded on your performance.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.450
This criteria includes the time taken to complete
the level, the number of times you died, and

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.009
collection of all the crystal shards and the
four secret gears.

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.299
This ensures that fans have something extra
to do once all the levels are completed.

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.689
The art style was mentioned at the start and
it is indeed striking.

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.180
Background colors shine through the blocked
out main character, the enemies, and everything

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.860
that is interacted with.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.490
The enemies themselves are eerie creatures
sort of reminiscent of the alien lifeforms

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.859
from the movie 'The Mist' (or perhaps that's
just a personal observation).

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.969
The soundtrack is other-worldly and ethereal,
and overall Oscura has killer presentation.

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.200
The only barrier to entry is either your love
or hatred of platforming, and whether the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.179
control scheme suits your liking.

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.640
Otherwise, this is recommended for all who
are looking for something visually striking

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:18.230
with solid play mechanics.
