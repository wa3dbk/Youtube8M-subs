00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.920
Build your willys, rear leaf spring installation.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.170
To begin, Insert a leaf spring pivot eye bushing
into the front of the leaf spring and align

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:34.450
inside the leaf spring to frame pivot eye
bracket, tapping into place.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:44.060
Secure the leaf spring to the bracket using
a leaf spring pivot eye bolt.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.489
Using a nut and the appropriate tool, pull
the bolt in further to create a groove that

00:00:49.489 --> 00:01:01.809
will keep the bolt secure.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.200
Remove the nut and slide on a lock-washer.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:26.600
Twist the nut back onto the bolt and tighten.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:40.670
Insert a cotter pin into the end of the bolt,
wrapping the ends around the tip.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:53.979
Finally, insert the grease fitting in the
open end of the bolt on the outside part of

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.249
the frame and tighten to finish.
