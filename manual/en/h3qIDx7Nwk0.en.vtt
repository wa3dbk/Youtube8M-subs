00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:06.049
hey guys!
It's GhMaster again with you and today we gonna 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:07.890
jungle Dr. Mundo

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.529
first of all our masteries and runes

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:15.579
I use standard masteries 9/21/0

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:17.029
and i use

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.600
attack speed marks

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.579
flat armor seals

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.230
magic resist

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.960
glyphs

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.319
and movement speed quints

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.739
We are ready to start

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.590
we take machete

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.280
and five potions

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.980
that's a standard

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.750
starting build for jugglers

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.680
and we are going to get red buff first
and then blue buff, because

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.870
D. Mundo

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.390
doesn't use

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.880
mana and

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.880
he has very low cooldowns, so he doesn't need blue buff

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.660
we start from wraiths because they spawn on 1:40

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.610
and red buff spawns on 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.210
1:55

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.549
so wraiths spawn

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.960
15 seconds earlier than

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.240
red buff does

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.180
When jungling Dr. Mundo

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.310
always take a look on your 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.340
health bar

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.300
and use your potions frequently

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.630
because you will loose

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.630
a lot of health, because of your skills

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.630
We got red buff

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:23.929
as you can see, even wwith using

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:30.929
our potions, we are getting very low on sustain

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:12.079
lastly we are getting our blue buff

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.109
ok, we did it in

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:19.760
3:18

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.819
that's a very fast time!

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.669
of course we are getting low 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.509
on HP

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:31.169
so we will need to go back,

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.219
heal up, buy boots

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:39.489
and come back for ganks

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.369
that's all for now

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.669
thanks for watching

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:51.599
