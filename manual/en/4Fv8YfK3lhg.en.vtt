Hi! My name is Courtney and on behalf of Expert
Village and in this clip we are going to be

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.250
making a flag using tissue paper. You are
going to want to start with a piece of poster

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.930
board and you are going to cut it down to
the size that you want your flag to be so

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.820
it could be as big or as small as you want.
Although the bigger that you make this the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.530
longer it is going to take you to complete.
I'm going to make our state flag which is

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:41.550
the Texas flag and so I'm just going to draw
the outline onto my poster board.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.840
Now once I have done that I'm going to take
my 3 colors of tissue paper and I'm going

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:56.129
to cut them into squares. They don't have
to be the exact same size. So we would take

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:16.450
and fold this. Once I have done that you take
a square and you can start anywhere on the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.040
flag that you want and you are going to take
one of the square of tissue paper and I'm

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.200
using a pen just because if you end up using
a pencil and the glue that we are using would

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.270
end up ruining your eraser. So I recommend
a pen but you take the square and you put

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.100
the pen down in the middle and you wrap the
tissue paper up and around the pen giving

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.530
you a flat surface at the bottom and the tissue
paper up on the edge. You then put down some

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:55.770
glue and you press the paper down and you
just lift the pen up. We are going to do that

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:04.780
over and over again to we fill up our whole
area. You want to kind of want to put them

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:14.560
close together so you can't see the poster
board in between the pieces. You are going

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:22.739
to do that until you filled up all the areas
and then if you got some pieces that off more

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.019
then the others you can always take your scissors
and kind of trim it up and give it a nice

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:37.689
clean edge. Then so we can hang our flag we
are going to take a white pipe cleaner and

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:49.949
we are going to glue it onto the back and
now we have our flag hanger.
