00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.528
Can you name a vegetable
that doesn't need sunlight to grow?

00:00:03.528 --> 00:00:04.474
You can't.

00:00:04.474 --> 00:00:07.005
I know you can't
because it's a trick question.

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.864
All vegetables get their energy
to grow from the sun,

00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:13.456
but there's something else we eat
that's mistakenly called a vegetable,

00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:15.164
which prefers the dark.

00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:18.505
It's a mushroom, but - How Does It Grow?

00:00:19.955 --> 00:00:24.225
Mushrooms are actually the fruit
of a fungus that grows underground.

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:28.735
They're great for your inmune system
and an amazing source of potassium

00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:30.567
- that's good for your blood pressure.

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:34.784
One portobello mushroom has even
more potassium than a banana.

00:00:34.904 --> 00:00:37.643
The reason you never see
a wide open field of mushrooms,

00:00:37.643 --> 00:00:40.236
like you see a field of lettuce or corn,

00:00:40.236 --> 00:00:42.906
is because farmers grow
their mushrooms indoors.

00:00:42.906 --> 00:00:45.894
But we're among the lucky few
who get to go inside.

00:00:46.027 --> 00:00:50.048
Chester County, Pennsylvania,
is the mushroom capital of America.

00:00:50.463 --> 00:00:53.954
Half of all the mushrooms 
produced in the US come from here,

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:57.878
and we're at Phillips Mushroom Farms, one of the area's biggest growers.

00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:03.847
Jim Angelucci has been growing
mushrooms here for 40 years.

00:01:04.716 --> 00:01:06.477
You can't look cute in a hairnet!

00:01:07.584 --> 00:01:11.155
The planting beds are six racks high
in this mushroom house,

00:01:11.155 --> 00:01:14.654
which can produce nearly
a million mushrooms in one harvest.

00:01:14.654 --> 00:01:16.295
Usually it's misty and wet

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:19.676
because if there's one thing 
a mushroom loves most is moisture.

00:01:20.094 --> 00:01:23.197
92% of a mushroom is made of water.

00:01:23.438 --> 00:01:24.698
(Jim): The mushroom...

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.735
On a mushroom, this is the cap, obviously,

00:01:26.735 --> 00:01:27.764
the stem,

00:01:27.764 --> 00:01:31.905
and this white stretched piece
of tissue here is called the "veil",

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.340
and as the mushroom matures,
and in a couple of days, this mushroom...

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.700
this veil will actually
pull away from the stem,

00:01:40.603 --> 00:01:42.475
and expose the gills.

00:01:42.475 --> 00:01:43.634
(Nicole): These are the gills?

00:01:43.634 --> 00:01:44.683
(Jim): These are the gills.

00:01:44.683 --> 00:01:47.792
Mushrooms don't have seeds,
they have spores; they're microscopic.

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:50.425
Every mushroom has
about 16 billion spores.

00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:51.644
(Nicole): 16 billion...

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.184
(Jim): 16...that's what they told me...

00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:08.034
(Nicole): This is the fungus, 
and the fungus works like

00:02:08.034 --> 00:02:10.120
the root system of the mushroom.
(Jim): Correct.

00:02:13.896 --> 00:02:16.965
(Jim): After about 14 days,

00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:19.134
the mycelium has reached the surface.

00:02:19.134 --> 00:02:20.763
The mystical thing about mushrooms

00:02:20.763 --> 00:02:23.198
is that it will double
their size in 24 hours.

00:02:23.198 --> 00:02:26.464
When they harvest the mushrooms,
what they...our harvesters do is --

00:02:26.464 --> 00:02:30.154
they grab the mushroom,
push down and twist, and pull it up

00:02:30.154 --> 00:02:32.944
and then this...the bottom
is trimmed with the knife.

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.026
(Nicole): Every single one?

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:35.705
(Jim): Every single one.
(Nicole) Wow...

00:02:42.355 --> 00:02:45.255
(Nicole): But not all mushrooms
prefer to grow in the ground.

00:02:45.255 --> 00:02:48.234
Some prefer to grow in trees
and decaying logs,

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:51.906
like Shiitake, a mushroom
you'll often find in Asian cooking.

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:53.715
To grow Shiitake,

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:57.941
farmers make their own fake logs
out of sawdust and other plant material.

00:02:58.393 --> 00:03:01.354
The logs, of course,
have to be kept moist.

00:03:01.354 --> 00:03:05.884
In the forest, that would be the job of 
the rain and the shade of overhead trees;

00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:08.264
on the farm, the logs get dunked.

00:03:09.904 --> 00:03:12.544
The farm grows 
other log-loving mushrooms,

00:03:12.544 --> 00:03:13.985
like Oyster,

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.394
Royal Trumpet,

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:18.005
and Maitake, also called,
Hen-of-the-Woods,

00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:20.454
they're famous for
their cancer fighting qualities.

00:03:20.454 --> 00:03:24.054
They are even these crazy looking,
spongy Pom Poms,

00:03:24.054 --> 00:03:26.406
sometimes called, Monkey Heads.

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:28.745
When all the mushrooms are picked,

00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:30.435
they come to the farm's packing center

00:03:30.435 --> 00:03:32.775
where they are sorted,
packaged, and shipped off

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:37.186
to thousands of grocery stores 
across the country, ready to be eaten.
