Hey guys today I’m going to show how
to get these gorgeous curls 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.770
using the Kiss InstaWave. If you are like me,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.140
you don’t like spending the time or the money recreating salon style curls

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.670
But Kiss InstaWave makes it a lot easier
Before we get started,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.730
I’m going to show you a little bit
how this InstaWave works.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.279
First of all, there is a high and a low temperature setting.

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.870
Today we are going to be using the high temperature because
I want a tighter curl.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.890
When this red light turns blue, you are ready to go!
you can also control which

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.059
which way you want your curls 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.950
with this arrow right here.
Alright, so we are going to start by sectioning off the hair

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.590
Just from top to bottom.
Nothing fancy. And then 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.610
you hold the InstaWave vertically tilt it
towards your head slightly

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.649
Grabbing one to two inch section 
For an outer curl, we are going to place the hair in front of

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:03.649
the barrel

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.590
You are going to press the outer button
until your hair is

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.590
fully wrapped around the barrel

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.860
After about 8 to 10 seconds depending
on how tight you want your curl

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.710
you pull it straight down.
Look how fabulous

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.040
For the next section, I’m going to curl
my hair in the opposite direction, 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.200
creating an inner curl.
So I’m going to place my hair behind the barrel 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.420
and press the inner button

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.420
Waiting for it to wrap completely
around the barrel.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.350
Once you wait about 8 seconds,

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.369
pull it straight down.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.000
Wow!

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.430
Now that I’m done with the bottom layer,
I’m just going to pin it back to make sure

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.900
it doesn’t get mixed up

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.789
And then go ahead pull the top layer down

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.739
Okay. I’m going to start curling the top
section using the same techniques as before

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.730
Alternating inner and outer curls
the front, make sure you curl it outwards

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.730
away from your face.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.360
After about 8 seconds, pull it straight
down keeping the curl intact.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.550
Wow! How Easy!

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.710
It picks up and wraps your hair around the barrel with just a push of a button.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.710
Once you get comfortable enough,
you can use it with one hand

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.420
Look what I was able to create without going to a salon

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.230
Do you know what that means? No more waiting to do my hair for special occasions

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.710
The InstaWave makes it super-fast,
super fun

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.320
and super easy
