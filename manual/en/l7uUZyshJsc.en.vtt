What up fish tank people ?!

Dustin's Fish Tanks
Species Sunday. That's right. Rolling at you.

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:15.269
Bringing it to you. Correct. With one of my
favorite plants, Red Tiger lotus. Nymphaea

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:25.870
zenkeri. Its tiger lotus. It's from West Africa
and it is balling okay. Do not use this species,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.280
do not buy this species unless you have a
dirt tank or substantial substrate because

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.489
it is a really really big root grower. Which
makes sense from the way it grows as it grows

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.469
up to the top. As it grows to the top it grows
shit houses as I like to say. Very very cool

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:54.469
plant. Love it. Great color patterns. Just
a really really cool plant. A lot of people

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.589
trying to buy these bulbs and plant them.
I've never actually had success doing them

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.729
and I recommend not doing it. I recommend
getting a plant because you can get some dud

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.440
bulbs you never know how they were treated
before. So that's my thought on that. Really

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.440
great plant I got a couple plants I'm trying
it in low light, high light. This plant has

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.840
CO2 occasionally. It's from Guinea West Africa.
It needs a lot of nutrients. They say to trim

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.670
it. I've never actually trimmed it. I let
it grow to the top for the aerial advantage.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.670
It gets more CO2 so it does better. Great
plant. Really like it. Good contrast. You

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.890
don't see naturally red plants that you don't
need to add a lot of iron to. This is a plant

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.240
you get away with without adding a lot of
iron just a lot of substrate. So I love it

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.960
anyone doing dirt check it out. Species Sunday,
folks.
