Hi, I'm Diana Stobo.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.390
Welcome to the Daily Juice, the show where
we teach you how to eat for health, vibrance,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.390
and beauty.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.520
We’re going to make some Thai lettuce wraps.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.060
This is a favourite in my house.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.250
It’s a favourite in my website.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.439
Let me show you how to make them right now
so you can do this at home.

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.270
It’s very, very simple – lots of ingredients
but a simple process so pay attention.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.270
Alright.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.199
In the processor, we’re going to put some
sesame oil.

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.510
Alright, some NamaShoyu.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.970
That is a raw, unpasteurized soy sauce.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.269
We got red pepper flakes, we got some sesame
seeds.

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.559
This doesn’t get any easier, raw honey,
raw wild honey.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:03.040
Use whatever brand you like, just make sure
it’s raw and it’s wild.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.690
Throw that into the processor.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.570
I like the thick stuff, yeah.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.510
Here we go.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:22.939
Fresh, grated garlic; garlic, ginger together
makes an amazing Thai dish.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.140
Those two flavors with some honeys and red
pepper, just imagine how strong and poignant

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.789
and exciting this is going to be.

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.350
Okay, now the processor can break this down
for you but I like to grate it first so it

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.049
really distributes evenly, so you don’t
get any chunks in your mouth.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:51.509
When you're grating ginger, you don’t have
to worry about taking the skin off, stick

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.509
it right in.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:02:10.621
Okay, let’s put that oil in and I'm going
to whip this together.

00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:22.569
You always want to 
scrape down the sides because things go flowing

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:29.250
up that sesame seeds up there, some honey,
the red pepper flakes.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:39.620
Alright, process a little more.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.000
I want you to see the sauce because it’s
actually sort of a creamy consistency, that’s

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.620
from whipping that oil and the honey together.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:56.510
Alright, now we’re going to throw in – this
is the meat of our product.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.250
So instead of using meat, we’re going to
use some high-protein walnuts.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.690
And throw in some carrots.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:21.510
Let’s get that last one, some celery, a
green onion, and then some fresh cilantro.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.750
I'm going to pulse this.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.260
I'm actually not going to process them.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:42.420
I'm just going to pulse it to break it down
until it gets to a consistency that I like.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.200
Always check and see this is very chunky right
now.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:56.360
I want to get it down to sort of like a minced
meat.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:04.780
There we go.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.620
It’s perfect, everything is mixed together.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.930
I like uniformity, that way you know the flavors
are distributed evenly.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.590
Okay, so that is the meat of our Thai lettuce
wraps.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.709
And we have some buttered lettuce here.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.030
Let’s take perfect little cups, lay them
out.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.610
You can use Romaine lettuce as well, I just
particularly like this lettuce because it

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.280
can fold over and you hold the cups when they're
done.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.460
Here we go.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:50.990
Let’s spoon in some of our meat.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:59.580
I never really thought this through but I
think that it probably will make about eight,

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.590
six to eight lettuce leaves.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.500
It really depends on how much meat you put
on it – I should say nut meat.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.979
Here we go.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:19.460
That’s pretty hearty there, let’s spread
it out.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.509
Nice.

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:29.190
Okay, now I like to garnish with some mung
beans.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:40.840
How about a little grated carrot, a splash
of color.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:52.230
Here we go, green onion to top it off.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.320
And there we have it, a Thai lettuce wrap,
how easy was that?

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:04.630
Less than five minutes and you have got a
meal.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:12.970
Let’s try this.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:19.800
Super spicy – ginger, garlic, red pepper
– all pulled together with just enough crunch

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.069
with the walnuts is absolutely fabulous.

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:25.580
This is a great meal, lunch, dinner, whenever.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.330
Just snack on this all day long.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.490
I love it.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.490
I'm Diana Stobo.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.230
Thank you for watching the Daily Juice and
