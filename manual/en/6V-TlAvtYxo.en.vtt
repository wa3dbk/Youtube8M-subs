00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.840
Meet Joe. Joe wants to help his
eight-year-old daughter Susan

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.410
and his 6-year-old son, Steven, get
better at math in school.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.260
their bright kids, but like a lot of kids
Susan and Steven

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.000
just need a little extra help with their
math homework. So Joe spoke to his

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.230
daughter's math teacher Miss Phillips

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.030
about a new math learning
aid called "Yamie Chess"

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.090
that could help both his son and
daughter's education

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.840
Yamie Chess is an educational K-8 Math learning aid

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.649
designed by a group of postgraduate math
educators, expert scientists and

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.850
U.S. engineers from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology or MIT

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.589
Stanford University, California
Institute of Technology or Caltech,

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.489
Vanderbilt University, Columbia University

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.149
and the University of Arizona who have
come together in a pioneering

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.889
 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:53.929
 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.469
 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.829
 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.379
 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.380
 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.079
 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:11.600
Based on the John Hopkins University
selected animation

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.850
King Tigermore In Strawberry Fields,
Yamie Chess uses a fun and magical

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.130
cartoon universe

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.640
where all the characters are the classic
chess pieces on the board

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.909
to teach kids math and science learning
for school

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.969
Thanks Miss Phillips! Joe like that Yamie Chess is made in his home state of

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.719
Michigan in the USA

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.299
and that as he often doesn't spend as
much time with his kids as he'd like to

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.280
because of work

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.420
Joe could finally do something to help
his kid's education

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.479
especially getting better in math. The
Yamie Chess math learning aid includes a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.390
tournament-size analysis classic chess set designed for little hands

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.289
and an educationally structured coloring

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:49.039
K-8 math comic book

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.390
which is aligned to the National
Council of Teachers of Mathematics NCTM

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.880
"Curriculum Focal Points"

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.670
to give elementary and middle school
students a grounding in algebra,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.450
geometry, data analysis, number skills, and
measurement

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.899
Joe like the results. As Susan and Steven
read and colored the magical math comic

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.470
they learned the math that underpins
classic chess and developed their

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.140
cognitive learning and mental
understanding for math concepts and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.020
math problem solving

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.100
in STEM education. That's Science,
Technology, Engineering and Math

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.630
Joe's wife, Marcy

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.550
liked that Yamie Chess only cost $24.99

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.640
and engaged her children with a
traditional hands-on approach

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.030
using classic chess, with a magical
story that is safe and family-friendly

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.640
with Christian themes of love and
friendship that contain no violence

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.050
because in Yamie Chess all the
characters battle by classic chess only

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.310
Backed up by the proven learning
benefits of classic chess

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.310
Yamie Chess uses a cartoonn framework to
develop kids' decision-making

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.570
intellectual perception abilities for
math and science

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.140
improve memory function and nurture
children's visuo-spatial reasoning skills

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.490
for algebra

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.290
geometry, data analysis, measurement, and
number logic

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.830
Yamie Chess teaches kids how to think
mathematically for the kinds of

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.370
strategic problem solving and math
modeling

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.190
that kids will need for college careers
in math and the hard sciences

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.430
Coloring pencils are included in the
set and best of all

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.490
no prior experience a chess is needed

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.520
Good job too, because even Joe didn't know much about chess before this

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.870
that is, until his six-year-old son
Steven started talking about

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.270
the algebraic notation of the king-side horses after playing a few hours with Yamie Chess

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.580
Then, when Joe got home from work, his
eight-year-old daughter Susan challenged

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.880
him and her mother to game of Yamie Chess

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.220
Joe is going to have to take a closer look at this

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.820
Yamie Chess math game himself

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.000
Yamie chess supports underachievers in
math and is expansive for bright

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.550
students with more academic aptitude too

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.070
Unlocking the door for kids all
abilities to

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.950
the mental beauty of math and classic chess

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.130
