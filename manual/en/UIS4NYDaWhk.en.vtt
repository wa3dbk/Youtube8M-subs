00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:41.789
Today in this old enclosed trailer we&amp;#39;re
going to install Part #RP66542 from 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.000
Reese Products.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:15.750
This is a Reese Weight 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:26.720
Distribution 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:02:00.149
System with a shank, the Trunnion 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:13.690
Bar Style ready for 12,000 lbs. gross ton
weight and 1,200 lbs. ton weight.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:33.200
The first thing 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:56.890
we need to do to install this is to get our
truck and trailer on level pavement.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:17.239
We&amp;#39;ll make sure 
we 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:26.780
have as straight a line as possible.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:51.599
Next we want to 
go ahead 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:04:05.270
and 
separate the truck and trailer and we&amp;#39;ll

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:43.580
go ahead and level 
the trailer out and get a 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:05:16.070
measurement from the top coupler 
down 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:25.160
to the ground.
