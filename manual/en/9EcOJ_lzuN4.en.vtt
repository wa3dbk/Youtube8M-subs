Hello,

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.819
this is Valeriy Leletko. Welcome to
Ask About Admissions screencast. Australia.

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.709
This country is one of the leaders on
the international education market

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.279
hundreds of thousands of international
students come annually to Australian

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.390
colleges and universities.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.190
Far not every prospective international
student

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.490
can pay for education in Australia on its own
and they want to know

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.600
what financial aid offers this
country to such studnets. Right now we go to

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.470
explore Australian scholarships for
international students.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.080
There are two major groups of scholarships:
scholarships coming from Australian

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.370
Government

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.060
and scholarships coming from Australian
educational institutions and

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.740
other organizations. The scholarships cover various educational sectors. Undergraduate

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.890
and post graduate study and research

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.270
vocational education and training and also student exchanges.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.290
some scholarships partially cover
expenses related to education but

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.720
there are more attractive full
scholarships for international students

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.310
in Australia.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.970
Let's get started searching for
scholarships. Australian Government

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.520

Australian Government has done just

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.410
excellent job and created this site

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.110
that is a convenient entry point to
start your search for Australian Government

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.750

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.329
I click "participating countries"

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.750
and we can see that in general
scholarship programs cover the entire

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.990
world. You can download printed version

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.840

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.640
this particular program

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.460
at the moment i'm making this screencast
this site doesn't cover two more

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.210
Australian Government scholarships for
international students.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.630
The first one is International
Postgraduate Research Scholarships

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.060

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.259

regulations

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:21.389
provides site Innovation dot G O V
dot A U which is one of the official

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:23.569
Australian Government sites.

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.229
The second program which is not
presented at the Australian Awards site

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:33.349
is Australian Postgraduate Awards. APA.

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.459
Information on this program can also
be found on the site

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.809

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:43.099
A short note.

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.689
Applications for IPRS and APA

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:51.869
should be made directly to
participating universities.

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:58.869
this site provides just generic
information about IPRS and APA.

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.199
Now when you know where to search for the
Australian Government scholarships time

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.120
to get familiar where to search for

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.779

international students.

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:15.409
Again, thanks to care of the Australian Government there is an excellent

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.469
starting point for this search which is

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:24.099

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.409
one thing I would like to mention about
this site it's available in multiple

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.029
languages.

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:32.040

we can see language selection section here. At this moment the site is available in

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.640

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.469
it gives some additional convenience

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:48.719
but the major point of our interest here is 
this tiny phrase

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:49.909
find a scholarship

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.939
and I click it.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:57.149
When the page loads we can see a minor
disappointment here that this page

00:03:57.149 --> 00:04:00.949
is only available in English but it's still OK

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:05.189

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.029

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:13.539
that match your parameters.

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:18.139
This page provides an interface and
gives you an opportunity to search in a

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.280
comprehensive database.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.410
The database is kept up to date and
gives you results related to all

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.740

Australian universities and other

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.259

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.729
Now you have all information necessary
to search for scholarships available to

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.599

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.520
