00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.980
Hello and welcome back to another Photoshop
tutorial.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.930
Today I'm going to be showing you how you
can steal the color and tone of one image,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.480
and use it on another.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.100
So here I have two images that have a drastically
different color tone and feel.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.259
So what if we wanted this first image of this
path to look a lot more like the color and

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.699
tone of the second image of the barn?

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.099
Now your initial thought might be to spend
a decent chunk of time with a few different

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.740
adjustment layers, or you could go ahead and
start by trying out the match color adjustment,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.699
which is what we're going to be doing today.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.640
So I'm just going to flip back over to the
first image here, and then go up to "Image",

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.410
down to "Adjustments", and then down to "Match
Color."

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.250
Now the first thing that we're going to look
at in this dialog box is this option called

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.290
"Source" down here under "Image Statistics."

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.550
Now this is where you're actually going to
select your second image that you want to

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.860
steal the color and tone from.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.260
So we're going to select that image, and mine
is going to be that bottom image right here,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.040
another file that's open.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.340
And you'll immediately see that it pulls up
the picture here and starts to apply the effect

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.630
to your image.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.100
Now some images will look good right off the
bat.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.670
This one is not one of those images, so we're
going to need to use some of these image options

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.130
to really refine this effect.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.259
So with these effects we have luminance here,
and luminance is going to control the perceived

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.920
brightness of the image.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.810
The color intensity is going to control the
vibrance.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.380
And the fade is going to control how the color
is faded from the new image we brought over

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.710
of the barn onto the original image of the
path.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.570
Now with all of these image options, when
we adjust these we're actually adjusting the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.569
properties of the new image since we selected
a source.

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.509
If we hadn't selected a source, then these
image options would then apply to our old

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.859
original image of the path, but since we do
have a source, then they're going to apply

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.600
to how the color is brought over and blended
from the image of the barn.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.389
So, lastly we have this "Neutralize" checkbox,
and this is going to neutralize the main color

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:50.650
that is being cast by the selected photo,
which is the barn.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.180
So it's going to neutralize any kind of major
color that's being cast over that photo.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.420
So I'm just going to go ahead and set some
of these.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.409
So I'm just going to put this one at about
125.

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.869
I'm going to put the color intensity at about
70, and I'm going to put the fade at about

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.080
45, and then I'm to go ahead and check the
neutralize color box.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.660
So if we then go up to the preview we can
see how this change has taken effect on our

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.660
image.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.320
So you can see the before and after, and that's
a pretty drastic change.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.460
So if we go ahead and click "ok" we can flip
between these images after its gone ahead

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.160
and taken effect.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.910
And you can see that these images now seem
like they fit a lot better into the same kind

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.910
of feel.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.530
It seems like they have the same tone to them,
and a lot of the same colors have been matched

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.310
from the original image.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.500
So this is a great tool for stealing the tone
of an image.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.530
It's not always going to be perfect, but you
can refine it and even use it as a huge head

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.540
start before going ahead and diving into other
adjustment layers.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.250
So that's my time, but as always, if you enjoyed
