[Subtitles by danielsangeo]

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.075
Alright, so what do we have here?

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:11.912
Semi-automatic, some sort of glock,

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:13.446
safety's off.

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:16.516
Man, good thing I've watched
Die Hard like 50 times,

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:19.252
otherwise, I wouldn't know
anything about guns.

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:21.254
Nice!  A full clip.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.657
That guard must've
reloaded before he died.

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:25.625
How considerate of him.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.463
Oh, this again.

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:31.565
Okay.

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:32.766
I'll play your game.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.304
In the future,
everything will be like this.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:39.372
Doors, computers...

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.640
[houndeye charges up]
No!

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.209
Man, come on!

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:44.945
That thing teleported out of
friggin' nowhere!

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:45.845
Why?!

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.781
I don't even know what this is.

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:49.783
Maybe I was hasty shooting it.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.585
This could be an ambassador.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:54.754
Okay, if I see another one, I'll
listen to what it has to say.

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:55.855
[houndeye squeals]
Speak of the devil.

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.691
[houndeye charges up]
[Gordon imitates sound]

00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:58.658
[houndeye sonic attack]
FUCK!

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:00.160
DAMMIT!

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.862
IT'S THE SAME STORY EVERY TIME!

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:06.600
YOU GIVE PEOPLE THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT,
AND THEY TRY AND KILL YOU!

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.135
THAT'S WHAT I GET FOR TRYING TO BE NICE!

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.605
Oh-ho, here we go.

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:14.541
[houndeyes chirp]
SUCK ON THIS, YOU JUMPING BOOGERS!

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:16.710
Someone up there?!

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:18.678
Guess not.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.281
Well, that felt good.

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:25.018
Ah.  I guess that's the Room of Death.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:26.987
Don't want to go in there.

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:29.256
Nice of them to put up signs, though.

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:31.524
Huh, that's the symbol for poison.

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.960
I bet these barrels
are filled with poison.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.596
Maybe we're just trying
to kill the whole world.

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:37.897
Doing a good job so far.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:40.000
[teleportation sound]

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.902
I'm guessing I'm not going to
like what's behind Door #1 here.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:44.471
[vortigaunt charging up]
I was right.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.773
[vortigaunt bolt]
Drurrhhh!  Drrruuurrrgh!

00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:48.408
Damn, that hurts!

00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:49.743
Daaah.

00:01:49.743 --> 00:01:51.077
Okay, that's it!

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:54.347
It's official:
All aliens are bastards!

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:55.715
Especially you!

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.617
And you!

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:58.685
Hold still.

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:01.021
[chuckling] Nice!

00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:03.189
That was a pretty good shot.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.126
Not so tough now that
I've got a gun, are ya?

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.228
Oh, this is a dead end.

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:10.230
Hey, a jack in the box.

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:14.668
Maybe I was being too hard on everybody
about them staying alive earlier.

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:18.405
I'm starting to see where they could
have some problems with that.

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:20.473
Now why do we have bars here?

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.876
Do we have our own prison block, too?

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:25.412
And you!  You're the problem.

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:28.315
You know how they say you're either
part of the help or part of the problem?

00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:30.150
Well, they were talking about you!

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:33.486
There.  Now you're part of the solution.

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:34.788
All right, let's see.

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:36.990
I've gotten out of
tougher cells than this.

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:39.693
[straining]

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:40.460
Or not.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.128
Wait, what's this?

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:44.431
I guess it's either this
or the Rooms of Death.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.767
Hey, wait, how do I get back up?

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:52.706
Damn.

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:55.875
White men in armored
hazmat suits can't jump.

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.979
You know, I'm not sure if coming
down here was either smart

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:01.748
or else really stupid.

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:05.352
Although the same could be
said for today's experiment.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:07.187
It would've been really
smart if it had worked.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:09.656
I guess this opens the gate.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.258
Oh, no!  That was stupid!

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:13.727
I'm gonna die!

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:21.267
[underwater mumbling]

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:25.071
[gasping]

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:26.906
Hey, I'm on the other side.

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:29.909
I guess I'm still not sure if
that was smart or stupid.

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.177
I guess it was both.

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:32.178
Smupid.

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:33.646
Oh, lovely.

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:36.282
This must be our Pipeline of Poison.

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:38.284
Yuck, I was swimming in that.

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:42.188
Knowing the toxic sludge we're so fond of,
my skin's gonna turn red,

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:43.356
my hair will fall out,

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.024
and I'll start pissing blood.

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:46.793
Thanks, Black Mesa!

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.195
Don't be a dead end.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.030
Oh, good.  It goes somewhere.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.033
I'm not sure I really want to be going
down into the center of the Earth,

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:57.070
but then I don't see an
emergency exit!

00:03:57.871 --> 00:03:59.406
Hey, some ammo clips.

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:01.674
At least somebody's
trying to cheer me up.

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:03.543
Ugh, they're covered in blood.

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:06.780
It was nice of him to die for me
so I could have his ammo,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.149
but I just don't know if it's worth this.

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:10.917
Now it's all over my suit.

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:14.587
I guess this starts the lift.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.122
Whoa!  Train's leaving the station!

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:17.123
All aboard!

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:18.224
No, not you!

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:19.526
You don't have a ticket!

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:21.394
Urgh.  Damn...

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:25.064
This suit does not protect
against gravity.

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:29.335
[clearing throat]

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:30.270
Hey, what was that?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.037
Face-huggers!

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:32.972
Yee... batter up!

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:34.707
Strike one!

00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:36.075
Strike two!

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.710
Str- Aah!

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.611
It's raining men!

00:04:38.912 --> 00:04:40.280
I-I mean aliens!

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:42.348
Why is this taking so long?

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:44.184
I could fall faster than this.

00:04:44.184 --> 00:04:45.618
NO!  SHUT UP!

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.654
NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR OPINION!

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:49.088
YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS!

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:50.824
YOU'RE ALL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS!

00:04:50.824 --> 00:04:54.260
NOW, DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD AND
JUMP IN THIS GIANT MEAT GRINDER!

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.196
NO!  YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG!

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:57.897
YOU'RE ALL INCOMPETENT!

00:04:57.897 --> 00:04:59.899
Come on, come on, c'mon,
cmoncmoncmoncmon!

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:01.534
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS!

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:03.937
OH, THAT'S GOOD!
TELEPORT IN MORE CREEPS!

00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:05.972
THIS PLACE ISN'T CRAZY ENOUGH, YET!

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:07.540
WHAT THE FUCK?!

00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:09.108
WHAT HAPPENED?!

00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:11.845
WHY DO ALL THESE CATWALKS SUCK SO BAD?

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.280
I CAN'T JUMP THIS!

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.582
What do I do?

00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:17.183
Uhhh...

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:20.220
Oh, good.  I was hoping you'd
come along to hurry me up.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.688
Okay, this is stupid.

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:23.923
So far, so good.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.658
Don't slip.

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:29.796
Now what?

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.601
This sucks.
