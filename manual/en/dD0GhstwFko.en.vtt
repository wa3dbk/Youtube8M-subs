&gt;&gt; HOST: Hi, my name's George.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.170
I'm using this excavator to dig a foundation
hole

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.150
for a new house.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.610
Building a house is a big job,

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.800
from clearing the site to driving the last
finish nail.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.599
But before we get building,

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.340
we need to do some digging.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.460
So grab your toolbox and put on your hardhat,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.770
we're going to build some houses!

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.270

[huge excavator and bulldozer sounds as they
clear land]

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:18.769
[big machine noises]

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.259
[huge bulldozers flattening the piles of rock
and dirt]
