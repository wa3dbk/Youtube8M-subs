00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.380
Okay I rolled you onto your back. The difference
between being on your back and being on your

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.100
side is now I can massage your abdomen. and
some people prefer this position and some

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.770
people prefer their side. I actually prefer
being on my back. So will you let me know

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.250
how you are feeling. Good. You are doing great.
You have a few good releases and we'll see

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.440
what else we can get out on your back and
with a massage. Now if I massage you too firmly,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:41.460
just let me know. Okay? You can feel some
nausea during a session. that is normal as

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.070
well. When toxins are released like I said
before you can feel some goosebumps, some

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:54.050
chills and nausea. That's normal and it won't
last after the session is over. Are you ready

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:06.340
to try another fill. Yes. You are doing great.
You are a trooper. Now when you do a colonic,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.890
it is actually the fastest and most natural
way to cleanse your colon. You can take colon

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.659
cleansed products. It will take a lot longer
and your whole body has to filter the product.

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.829
So even though there are herbal cleansers,
there are still some herbals that are harsh

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:30.130
on the colon so I would be careful of herbs
like ____, rhubarb and sena and sena is actually

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.779
habit forming. Those are herbs that I do not
recommend. Now if you are doing a specific

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:40.549
colon cleanse for a short period of time,
you can take those herbs. It is just if you

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.770
are dealing with chronic constipation I wouldn't
recommend taking products with those herbs

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.259
in them. Now when you do a colon cleanse,
it usually takes 3 months or so for you to

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.919
actually cleanse your colon well and your
whole body has to filter it and with those

00:01:56.919 --> 00:02:04.509
herbals in the product, the ones that I discussed,
you can get urgency and sudden cramping. So

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:11.560
colonic is really pure water cleaning the
affected part which you wish to clean and

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.450
you are out in an hour so I really do believe
it is the superior way to clean your colon.
