Hi darling, sorry for being late.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.000
Today it's your birthday, 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.880
and I bring you some flowers.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.400
Still looking for something?
There is nothing left to find.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 My Love, let's make a pretty bunch of flowers.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.000
With some marbles in the vase, 
the bunch will be perfect.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.840
Here it is.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.000
Flowers are pretty, just like you, my Love.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.720
I will also prepare myself to be handsome.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Is there anybody there?

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.560
- Hello
- Are you Mr. Vollaire?

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.840
- Yes I am
- I'm the artist Tran Bao Ngoc,
you have ordered a show, correct?

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.840
- That's correct, please come in

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.160
- Could I use this radio to play the music tape?
- No need, there is no music, Olga prefers without.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.880
- No music? Never mind. 
Where could I change clothes?
- This way, please.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.160
Happy birthday Olga!

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.640
Sorry, it's quite weird without music.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.800
No worries, Olga has loved the show. 
Thank you very much.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.480
Finally, I bring your present. You'll love it.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.760
Happy birthday my Olga! You are wonderful.
Let's take a picture together.
