00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.490
When you dive in to the 'classic' archives
for inspiration, Pong regularly comes up as

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.299
a concept that begs for re-imagining. While
some have taken a literal approach to the

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.630
task and others have taken far more abstract
paths, Haraka by Studio Joho and Mental Drink

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.260
only retains the one on one ball-bouncing
aspect of the game and still manages to dredge

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.650
up Atari-soaked memories of the past.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.070
Haraka divides the screen in half, giving
each player a portrait oriented court they

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.270
must defend. Basic virtual buttons allow you
to dash left and right, with the character

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.129
automatically whacking the ball as it approaches
them. Here's where things get interesting

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.890
though as the ball is deflected as though
you're covered in a circular shield, allowing

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.890
you to control the ball with a lot of finesse
if you can think ahead fast enough.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.000
Sadly 'fast enough' is where the game hits
a bit of a rough patch as each strike from

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.890
the players will increase the speed of the
ball, quickly reaching speeds that outpace

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.379
your character and your basic reaction speeds.
This places the game firmly in the domain

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.400
of the AI you're up against and you're bound
to experience plenty of frustrating losses

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.970
as a result of this.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.570
Thankfully clever use of power-ups including
'stat' bonuses, barriers and other goodies

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.331
allow you to control the pace of the game
(including the much appreciated 'slow down'

00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:18.650
to bring the speeds back to human levels),
though this does place you at the mercy of

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.430
luck when attempting to conquer the next of
nine AI opponents.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.250
In order to side-step this issue altogether
you can grab a friend and play against each

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.700
other on the one screen (an iPad helps here,
but isn't necessary). What makes this mode

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.950
really shine is the ability to fight over
power-ups and power-downs, flicking them about

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.830
to gain an advantage or mess the other player's
day. Strangely enough, it's the manic gameplay

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.440
that makes playing against friends so much
fun, which makes the issue of balancing the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.990
game for single-player and multi-player a
tricky one.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.920
Either way, Haraka has its ups and downs,
but if you need a fun and fast-paced way to

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.960
kill some time (and maybe ruin a few friendships),
this is worth checking out.
