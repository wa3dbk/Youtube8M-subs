Hi, my name is Mark Lanning. I'm the
assistant cultural attachÃ© at the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.080
Embassy here and I'm going to talk to
you today about two people. What's the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.199
connection between this man, Abraham
Lincoln, and this man, Barack Obama? Not

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.369
too much? Well actually they have a lot
in common. Let's talk about Mr. Lincoln.

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.630
First of all President Lincoln is
famous for two things; he helped keep

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.829
America together during the Civil War
and he made the monumental decision of

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.870
freeing the slaves, the Emancipation
Proclamation. That decision put America

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.250
on the path to being able to elect our
first African-American president, Barack

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.660
Obama. In fact, there's a lot more
connections than that. Both of them came

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.579
from humble beginnings (Obama from Hawaii,
Lincoln from Kentucky), moved to Illinois

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.199
and then became lawyers, worked in the
state legislature, got elected to

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.800
Washington DC, and eventually became
elected as presidents at a very young age.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.970
And more recently, Barack Obama, during
his inauguration oath, he swore on the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.470
same Bible that President Lincoln used
in the 1860s, and before the inauguration

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.820
Obama gave a speech on the steps of the
Lincoln Memorial and he gave thanks to

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.200
Lincoln for making it possible for him
to become president. This year, this

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.060
February 12th, is the 200th anniversary
of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, and I

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.240
think that he would be very proud to
know that in the 200th anniversary of

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.619
his birth, that America elected elected
its first African-American president. If

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.689
you would like to know more about
Abraham Lincoln and his legacy or about

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.950
Barack Obama and his new administration,
we would be happy to send a speaker from

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.420
the Embassy to your organization. Just
send us an email on the email address at

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.460
the bottom of the screen, londonspeakers@state.gov, and we'll be happy to talk

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.729
with you.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.820
