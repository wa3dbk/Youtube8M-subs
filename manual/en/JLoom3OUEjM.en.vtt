Hi I'm Tom Wright from Gingerbread Glass,
and I'm here today to show you how to make

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.780
a glass jar. Ok for this clip we're going
to take what we have already, which is all

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.710
the color melted down together with the tube
and now I'm going to take a small piece of

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.820
glass and I'm going to take it down to a point
and I'm going to drag some of the colors together

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.230
which will give it kind of a weird look, but
it will definitely look really cool. Alright

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.670
so we're going to heat up our tube again,
get it nice and hot. We got to get it hot

00:00:37.670 --> 00:01:03.359
enough so the colors will drift in to each
other here. So once we get this nice and hot

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:17.040
here we'll be able to do some dragging. Alright
so now I'm going to focus the flame so we

00:01:17.040 --> 00:02:13.880
can just do one part at a time here. See what
that did right there, it just added a little

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:55.700
bit of craziness to it. We're going to go
reshape that a little bit now, get that back

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.700
on there. We'll give it a little quick puff
here to blow it back out. Alright we're going

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.760
to pop that back in the kiln real quick, and
we're going to drag it one more time but,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.900
that's pretty much what we wanted to get.
