00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:03.189
 

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.830
The most important thing when you're setting your rollers up is to find a really flat,

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.990
smooth surface,

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.980
and make sure that the rollers are not moving.
Next thing that you have to look at is

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.160
the length of the rollers.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.490
The correct length will be a little bit
longer

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.740
than the front axle, so if you've got the
bike on like this, and here's the front axle,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.650
you want the rollers to be just a little bit longer. Well
the most important thing when you're

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.970
learning is make sure that you do have
two things on either side of you,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.900
whether it be a friend on either side or
a doorway is really useful because if

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.300
you've got your bike in the doorway

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.180
you can keep your hands on the handlebars and lean on the doorway with your hips or with your shoulders,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.710
so a doorway is the most ideal. Otherwise,
two things on either side, like chairs, are very

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.290
handy.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.510
The process of getting onto the rollers - first to check what gear you're in.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.120
anywhere near the middle of the rear cassette is the best place to be,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.440
in the big ring or the little ring, it
doesn't really matter but not too easy,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.079
not too hard, so find one of those gears in
the middle.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.020
And then it's a little bit of a tricky process to get on the rollers. I always put the

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.239
pedal at the bottom and put the first

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.770
foot into the pedal here. And then it's
all about the angle and the balancing of the bike.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.159
So I use this hip to rest on my seat like that

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.979
something close, and just clip in and

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.460
try not to keep the bike upright, just let it go in the

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.070
angle that feels most comfortable and then swing your leg over like that.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.909
So once you've clipped both of your feet into the pedals and you're holding onto something,

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.420
you might be in a doorway so you can lean your shoulders
against the doorway but

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.930
if you're holding on to the stool, the first
thing is to look one metre in front of you and just

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.979
remember that.

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.100
There's probably three things to remember, that's: look one metre in front of you,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.340
keep your hands loose on the handlebars, and keep
pushing on the pedals, because the moment you

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.970
take the pressure off the pedals

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.149
the wheel starts to move like that. So look one metre in front of you,

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.290
push through your hips, and keep your hands really loose

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.729
on the handlebars. Try not to steer.

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.790
The first thing you're going to feel
when you start to pedal is that the

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.920
handlebars and the wheel is
going everywhere

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.219
over the rollers. The harder you push on the pedals, the more that will

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.179
start to go straight. So just keep focussed on that point

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.860
1 metre in front, and when you get wobbly, maybe just push a little bit harder

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.980
on the pedals. If you have 10 gears

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.060
on the rear cassette, I personally do just 1 minute in each gear, so it gets harder and harder,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.830
so that's 10 minutes, so you pick a certain cadence, and you just stay at that same cadence which means when the gear gets

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.349
harder every time

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.129
the load gets more, so keep the same cadence.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.500
I think for a beginner, 30 minutes is
too much, because then

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.519
two 2 minute efforts would be

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.769
enough with 3 or 4 minutes recovery, and that would be
the whole session, then it's just a bit of a warm down

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:42.019
 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.010
for about 5 minutes. To get off the rollers,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.519
the best thing is to hold onto something next to you, slow your pedalling

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.590
down and hold onto the rear brake because that's
going to give your bike a little bit of

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.280
stability when you lean to get off.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.830
Unclip both of your feet, and then on the side that you're going to get off on, just slide your foot down to the side of the

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.409
rollers,

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:07.090
be very careful not to slip, and then
just dismount like this. So I've got 5 top tips on how

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.440
to ride the rollers:

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.030
the first one is to make sure you set
your rollers up in between two things,

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.510
two chairs or a doorway or something to lean on either side. My 2nd tip would be to

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.650
be in the right gear - not too hard, not too easy,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.549
just find the middle of your rear cassette and that will be great. The 3rd tip

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.110
is to just look ahead about 1 or 2 metres,
never look straight down at your front wheel

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.569
just keep

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.870
focussed on that point 1 or 2 metres ahead of you.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.920
The 4th tip is to not hold the handlebars too tight.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.769
When you get a bit tense and you start to hold tight you start to do a little bit of a wobble,

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.879
so don't hold the handlebars too tight, just leave your hands nice and loose on the handlebars

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.260
which brings me to the 5th tip, which is drive through your hips.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.260
If you get a little bit wobbly and a bit nervous, just push harder through your hips.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.000
