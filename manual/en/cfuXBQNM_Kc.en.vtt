00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.010
Let take a look at some of the highlights
in this release.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.780
One of the first things you’ll notice is
the New Tab.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.980
From the Create page you can access sample,
and recently opened files, product updates,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.930
and the online community.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.100
Use the Start Drawing tool to begin a new
drawing from a default template or choose

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.960
from the list of available templates.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.910
Under Recent Documents you can view and open
your recent drawings.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.480
You can also pin a drawing to the list.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.219
On the Learn page you’ll find Getting Started
videos, Tips, and other online learning resources.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.600
The new dark themed interface combined with
the traditional dark model space minimizes

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.510
the contrast between the drawing area and
the surrounding tools.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.870
The status bar is also streamlined, you can
choose what tools to display from the Customization

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.750
menu.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.620
With each new release, the ribbon offers additional
contextual tabs helping you access relevant

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.250
tools with minimal effort.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.700
As you explore new tools, be sure and check
out the help system.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.460
We added a new way for you to find the tools
you need.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.090
Simply click on the button icon or the find
link and an animated arrow draws your attention

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.259
to the tool on the ribbon.

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.460
We added smooth line display to enhance the
graphics experience.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.380
You can enable Smooth Line Display in the
new Graphics Performance dialog box.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.899
Objects such as lines and circles, as well
as drawing aids like grid lines, have a much

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.579
smoother display.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.530
To add more visual enhancements turn hardware
acceleration on.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.710
While creating and editing objects you now
have an improved visual feedback.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.960
When selecting any object, its color will
change and remains highlighted to clearly

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.330
identify it as part of the selection set.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.040
We added lasso selection.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:21.030
Click in a blank area of the drawing and drag
around the objects you want selected.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:29.690
The cursor has been enhanced with badges that
reflect the state of common operations.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.140
We also added a preview for common editing
commands.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.860
For example, when trimming an object, the
segment to be removed is dimly displayed and

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:46.970
a cursor badge indicates that the segment
will be trimmed.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.310
Model space viewports have been significantly
enhanced in this release.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.260
After creating multiple viewports in model
space, a bright blue boundary identifies the

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.620
active viewport.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.620
Drag to the edge of the boundary to remove
it.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.940
You can resize any of the viewports by dragging
the horizontal or vertical boundaries.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:17.590
Hold the ‘Ctrl’ key while dragging the
boundary to split a model space viewport.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.370
The orbit tool is also enhanced to give you
better control over the target point.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:31.620
The green sphere marks the orbit target point.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:39.670
Turn off ORBITAUTOTARGET to have better control
when working with these objects.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:50.700
Now you can click to specify the target point.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.260
Geographic Location functionality is also
enhanced.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.400
You can set the geographic location from a
map using the Set Location tool.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.710
When using online map data, the Geographic
Location dialog box will guide you through

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:13.510
the process of specifying a geographic location.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:28.030
New tools on the Geolocation ribbon enable
you to capture an area or a viewport for plotting.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.530
