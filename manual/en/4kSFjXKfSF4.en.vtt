00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.070
 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.980
 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.110
So in my first look at the Nexus 5
camera I wasn't particularly impressed

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.230
but I've spent a bit more time with it over the last few days and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.660
I have some observations and I don't
think it is the Nexus 5

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.180
camera's fault. I actually think all of the
issues I was having really

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.660
aren't down to the rubbish app that is shipped

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.750
with Android. Now why Google didn't make
any major improvements ie.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.860
completely overhaul the Android 4.4 camera is beyond me, because it needs it.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.370
So the problems that I have really are

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.450
its focus lock on time is rubbish. Most of the
time

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.130
it doesn't actually get the right focus, apparently that's not in focus. it looks in focus

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.660
to me.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.100
That's still not really in focus. I know obviously this is not the most ideal setup to

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.190
be able to demo this but

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.230
this is really what I've really noticed time and time again.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.610
It does not lock on properly at all. Its
focus

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.910
or focus hunting is rubbish frankly and it

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.960
needs vastly better detection algorithms
than it's current got.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.659
In low-light it's passable it's OK

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.409
but again this is all down to the camera app
itself not the actual camera.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.200
When I've used other camera apps I've actually found things have improved quite a bit, the lock on is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.049
faster everything is generally better

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.540
and so it does seem that if you're
not impressed with the Nexus 5 camera when

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.430
you first get it

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.490
it's the app that's really causing you problems. The images do have a slight softness

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.960
to them when viewed on the Nexus 5 screen.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.170
However when sent across looking at
those raw images

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.350
on my PC that softness seems to have disappeared so again,

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.180
is there some weird problem going on
there with the sharpening that

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.409
they're applying in the gallery?

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.960
Not too sure. I do think there might be a
few bugs and kinks they are still trying to

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.830
work out here.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.260
Now one thing to note is that the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.700
app hasn't really changed that much
and so it's still fairly limited.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.140
They've made a few changes within photosphere to  make it better at detecting scenes

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.640
stitching everything together and so on
and obviously we still have the settings

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.689
pop out here

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.340
which does have this new HDR mode.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.139
For my mind this HDR plus mode makes not a bally difference,

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:16.999
really doesn't. You'd be better off just taking a  normal image and then popping it into Snapseed and

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.290
hitting it with their new HDR filter.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.189
HDR plus does not strike me as being
particularly good

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.639
but again when you've got a camera that is taking so long to lock on and so long to fire every

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:29.359
frame

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.409
I'm not surprised the HDR plus isn't
working very well.

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.620
Realistically, we need to fire those frames
quite quickly

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.279
whilst adjusting the exposure to get
great HDR because we don't want things moving or

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:39.650
getting any

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.059
extra camera shake getting in there. For my
mind Google need to go back and try

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.559
again

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:47.769
with the camera app it simply isn't suitable

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.950
and it really is substandard in my opinion.
Now,

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.999
I did try focal, or focal app

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:57.169
but unfortunately the developer I think
needs to

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.949
release an update because it's not
working particularly well.

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:05.189
For instance we can't really interact
with the camera particularly well.

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:10.049
And it won't actually take the app so 
probably the best hope we have for a

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.499
replacement camera app

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:15.659
on the Nexus 5 is going to be focal but the dev needs to do a bit of work there I think to

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.529
make it compatible with the Nexus 5.

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:20.730
Overall the camera really

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.859
is a great camera when the camera app

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.639
works properly. When it locks on
beautifully when you have a nice steady

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:28.249
shot,

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:33.129
the images are great. You'll be able to see some of them linked from

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.459
this channel, I'll put them on my Google+ for you.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.569
Now, it's interesting

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.889
that we have now the best Nexus camera we've ever had, the

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:48.159
Nexus 5 but we still don't have a great
camera app from Google.

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.049
I sometimes wonder if part of the
agreement they have with all of the

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:51.650
hardware

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.819
partners is to, you know not produce some
elements

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.569
of their system to be brilliant. Do you know what I mean? They very much focus on

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.930
the base operating system, and, you know  things like the camera app are almost

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.249
an optional extra. If they didn't have to
ship one they probably wouldn't kind

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:06.719
of thing.

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:10.269
And so it just feels like it's case of well the camera app

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.099
is there like it or don't, use something
else instead.

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.250
Fair enough, you know, there are plenty of
better camera apps out there. Focal

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.430
is definitely one of the best camera apps out there but it

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.920
just would have been nice if Google had spent a  little bit of time really really

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.680
improving the camera app, especially when
it's matched up with great camera hardware.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.310
It just feels like people will get a poor
experience and it's not the hardware's

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.810
fault.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.230
Let's just talk very quickly about the
video camera. It shoots at 1080p

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.650
it's absolutely passable. The quality in my opinion

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.840
in low-light is absolutely excellent
for a video camera

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.920
very low noise very good ISO and very
good exposure. And

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.490
it does everything for you. You've got no focussing or anything like that and even tapping

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.990
the screen to

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.380
focus does nothing. So you are very much reliant on

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.910
the auto focus algorithm that Google's got in the

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.430
APK, the camera APK. It's not really brilliant. It does

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.060
occasionally wobble off and focus on
things that it feels

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.480
should be in focus when they shouldn't be. But overall

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.180
it's OK, it does a great job. More
importantly though the actual output video

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.940
images are

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.870
excellent and very low noise. Really really nice and that's actually something I should

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.380
say

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.350
about the images generally, even in
low-light the images are very low noise.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.690
They've done a great job there with their noise reduction algorithm.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.940
