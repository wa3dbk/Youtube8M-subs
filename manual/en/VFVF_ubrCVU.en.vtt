now everything starts and

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.399
acclaim okay their response to all this
controversy there saying wheelers

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.340
claiming that our phone contacts are
visible to everyone on face book our

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.899
faults dot state ms completely false
they are visible you can go look at it

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:42.630
right now

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.280
um... our contacts list formally called
phonebook

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.060
has existed for a long time the phone
numbers listed there

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.510
were either added buyer friends
themselves and the invisible to you know

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.340
or you had previously sync your phone
contacts with face book well then why

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.590
did my remarks transparent about it

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.159
if this really happened a year ago why
wasn't there something that was posted

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.350
on the front page of face book so
everyone knows hey your mobile phone

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.610
number is now accessible to everyone on
your friends list the analyst weekly

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.549
rate so it's not that your friends phone
numbers of your phone numbers appear to

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:15.490
the public

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.970
no it's not in the public

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.080
but if your friend who somebody let's
say you've got you know fared too i t_v_

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.979
viewers that our friends on your

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:26.789
it's possible to get that they would
then see your phone number and your

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:28.740
friends phone numbers and sarah

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.639
when using the data bs telepathic is

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.549
faced with is not the first time this
happened

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.909
they're constantly over sharing event
going wants caller they are and in all

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:41.519
using

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.899
realism in new york remission everybody
up orono

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:48.899
but you know what that these fucking is
in a bad place and i'll tell you why

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:52.609
the reason why they're so profitable is
because it's this great social etc

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.909
networking service that's for free right
that's what everyone can use it that's

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.959
where they have so many people on their
our website

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.589
now how did they monetize that they
monetize up by selling our personal

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:03.550
information

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.630
mhm okay so our personal information art
interest the things that we like the

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.090
things that we do on our from during our
free time this is all information that's

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.529
compiled by face book and information
that is sold to a third party

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:19.549
now here's the thing that that they swim
right in my opinion his never quite got

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:20.070
right

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.170
that there's a line and and they seem to
cross that line all the time so for

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.780
example if i write that's on my wall
that hey i really like coke for whatever

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.279
reason that which i do

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:33.800
and then they shoko casimir so that
whatever it might be

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.889
by finally some and getting most people
find it doesn't look like

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:38.790
is this

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.170
great in an

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.420
publish my phone number one idea when
they asked me and i said i didn't put up

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.229
for number there when i got on the face
book

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:49.850
everybody's anything that's over the
line right away

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.079
and you can't do it without people
checking off the box if you say that hey

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.079
you know what

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.480
be careful here

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.600
if you want your phone numbers for your
friends to see et cetera check out this

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.360
box in the book and then everybody then
they agreed to it was transparent up i

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.140
don't see why they can see that line
right after it did to me it's a little

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.440
bit of too much green they're like
there's a hundred different ways to

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.210
monetize it we get the you gotta make
money off it in fact if i was at my

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.170
probably sell to serve more as to be
honest alone is it that many ads on face

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.900
book

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.180
that because you but we get it it's a
business no nobody's naive about it

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.530
right

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.210
he'd keep violating people's sense of
privacy who eventually must say what i

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.489
want to be here

00:04:29.489 --> 00:04:31.999
uneasily doesn't really help you either

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:34.009
under the word lou waters for facial

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:35.989
if this is our government around saying

00:04:35.989 --> 00:04:39.240
the child out

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.980
actually

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.220
well you know my number

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.050
you can do that specificity picked up
