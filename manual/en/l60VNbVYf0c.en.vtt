00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.980
Today we will examine the process of
erosion of volcanic material in the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.780
Tongariro National Park which is located
in the Central North Island of New Zealand.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.600
Much of the North Island of New Zealand has been built up by the processes of volcanism.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.590
This has been
slowly modified over time by the agents

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.340
of water, ice and wind.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.080
In the Tongariro National Park these processes are most active at high altitudes

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:45.023
where vegetation is unable to protect steep ash covered volcanic slopes from the weather.

00:00:45.023 --> 00:00:49.760
First let's look at the erosive ability of wind.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.829
In this volcanic landscape
wind is most erosive on mountain tops

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.740
where strong winds are more frequent and powerful and

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.619
east of the mountains in the Rangipo Desert where rainfall is lower and
ash deposits rapidly dry out.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.300
This enables aeolian erosion and
transportation to take place.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.331
Only tussock gives soil any protection in this environment.

00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:23.091
In some parts of the Rangipo Desert these ash deposits have been blown into sand dunes.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.140
Wind in this region also distributes ash during
volcanic eruptions.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.310
Because the prevailing winds are westerly, ash
deposits are greatest east of the mountains.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.000
In past eruptions ash has spread
northeast into the Bay of Plenty region.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.140
Another erosive agent in this landscape
is running water which easily erodes

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.657
loose volcanic materials such as ash,
tephra and ignimbrite.

00:01:53.657 --> 00:01:57.938
The impact of running water is greatest at
higher altitudes

00:01:57.938 --> 00:02:04.500
where rainfall  is heaviest, the slopes steepest and the ground surface is unprotected by vegetation.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.840
Heavy rains may cause a mass movement of ash from
waterlogged slopes.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.580
Precipitation stored as winter snow melts to run into rivers during the drier summer months.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.960
These rivers transports the eroded material and
eventually deposits them.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.400
These rivers journey towards the sea.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.100
Some of the debris reaches the sea.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:38.330
For example, the iron sand of the west coast of North
Island originates from Mount Taranaki.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.460
Melting ice high in the mountains
eventually forms small streams.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.630
These small streams like this one here
eventually will flow into bigger streams

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.500
and eventually will make their way into
the major rivers around this volcanic landscape,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.400
such as the Tongariro and Whanganui River.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.350
High mountain rivers cut down into land surfaces carving out deep valleys and gorges.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.540
Lava is harder and more resistant to
water erosion.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.400
A river transversing over a soft rock layer will have a higher rate of erosion than another area

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.200
with a hard rock layer such as a lava flow.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.040
Over time the continuing erosion of the softer rocks

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.780
results in the steepening of the
river beyond the end of the lava flow.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.250
As the stream bed gets deeper, the velocity
of the stream also increases thereby

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.248
increasing the streams erosive power.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.489
Eventually the river's slope will become

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.400
vertical leading to the formation of a
waterfall.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.500
The base where the waterfall lands is called a plunge pool.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.380
Soft rock layers directly underneath the hard

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.459
rock's is undercut creating an overhang.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.740
Eventually the overhanging hard rock becomes
unstable due to the undercutting process

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.604
whereby it might collapse and retreat.

00:04:10.604 --> 00:04:14.500
There are numerous waterfalls around Mount Ruapehu

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.500
such as  Mangawhero Falls,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.554
Tawhai Falls

00:04:19.554 --> 00:04:22.220
and Taranaki Falls.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.900
All have formed at the end of lava flows.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I'm standing here at Taranaki Falls.This waterfall is plunging of the end of a lava flow from Mount Ruapehu.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:45.540
Further downstream the rushing water erodes away
the soft banks which are made up of

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.380
volcanic ash and tephra. The softer
materials erode much easier than the

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.080
hard volcanic rock that we see behind me.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.300
Erosion may strip soft tephra ridges away leaving a hard valley floor lava flow stranded as a ridge.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.620
For example, the Pinnacle Range on Mount Ruapehu.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.140
Lahars are another agent of erosion
processes on Mount Ruapehu.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:33.300
In 2007 the walls of Ruapehu's crater lake were breached, generating a lahar.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.240
It swept down mountain valleys into the Whangaehu River collecting vast

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.320
quantities of loose debris to deposit
downstream.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:48.300
Where I am right now is the site of the toilet block that used to exist here at Tangiwai.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:59.600
In about 2007 when a lahar swept down the Whangaehu River, the toilet block was actually dislodged from this 
place and taken down stream.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.520
Erosion by rivers has been modified by human 
activities,

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.900
principally by the Tongariro power scheme

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.870
which has meant natural rivers have been diverted into
man-made canals and blocked by dams.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.600
This reduces the natural occurring
erosion that would take place downstream.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.560
The diversion of rivers and
dams even led to the expansion of some

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.580
lakes such as Lake Rotoaira.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.220
Finally there is the erosive impact of ice.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.920
In many parts of the park frost's can occur all year round.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.300
During winter, ice needles penetrate through the soil taking soil particles with them,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:48.430
as can be observed here in the Rangipo Desert. As the temperature rises during the day

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.600
these pillars collapse causing the
particles to roll downhill.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.570
In winter the snow level extends down to an average of
1,500 meters above sea level.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.720
Precipitation stored as the snow gets into
cracks in high-altitude rocks.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:12.040
Freezing and thawing processes take place that
may cause the rocks to crack or even break away.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.320
At the summit of Mount
Ruapehu temperatures are often below freezing

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.180
and there is permanent ice in the form of small glaciers.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.729
Glaciers erode enormous
quantities of material

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.700
creating u-shaped valleys.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:33.938
They transport and deposit the
debris at the sides, floor and terminus of the glacier.

00:07:33.938 --> 00:07:39.680
These deposits form ridges of loose rock 
 fragments called moraines.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.500
The Mangetepopo Valley at the base of Mount Tongariro

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:51.330
which has the distinctive U shape due to an ancient glacier that is no longer present.
