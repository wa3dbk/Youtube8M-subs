One of my friends,

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:07.080
called me on Skype on day and said, "hey, have you seen this show? My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. It's so good."

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.519
And I was like, "Isn't that like a show for little girls?"

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.000
I wanted to have a show about six characters, 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.789
six girls, six ponies who were friends with one another.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.279
And next thing I know I was kind of leaning forward into my monitor and I was like, "This show is amazing."

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.000
The show itself, is extremely well done.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.970
The art is fantastic. The writing is wonderful,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.000
and the voice acting is just impeccable.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
"Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned."

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
There's this huge movement of guys that are just so into the show.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
"Ponies!"

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's not a show that you'd expect a lot of people my age and older to watch.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
How you doing?

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.200
♪ "I'm not a fan of puppeteers but I've a nagging fear someone else is pulling at the strings. Something terrible is going down through the entire town..." ♪

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.470
We have musicians,

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.240
we have artists, and they're all professionals.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.240
There's like armies of professionals, it's crazy.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.450

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.000
I was just sitting here, I was just living day to day.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.340
I didn't really have anything to look forward to. As soon and ponies came into my life I was like, "Wow, I never want the day to end."

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.960
If you choose to be a Brony in the Appalachia Mountains you're gonna have problems.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.910
They had tire irons, baseball bats. 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.500
They're all laughing and calling names, gay, girly, queer.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.340
Sometimes I'll just listen to a lesson and go, "Oh yea, why didn't I think of that?"

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.560
Before I watched the show I was kind of sad and lonely.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.019
And he said, "What would you think mom if I said I really liked My Little Pony?"

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.579
Here initial reaction was a bit like, "na..."

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:14.239
"I'd be worried about you Lyle."
I'm not interested in watching My Little Pony.

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.849
Well, when I heard about BronyCon I decided that I really wanted to go.

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.929
My son was hell bent on going, so I feel like I got roped into it.

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:23.409
Just being out of the norm.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.829
Well, out of their norm.

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:30.829
They just don't like that. I'm going to be who I am and nobody is going to tell me otherwise.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.529
Now I'm here 900 miles at the biggest con

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:40.759
Four times the population of my town is in this builidng

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.459
Before i was a Brony I had about seven friends.

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.089
When I become a Brony,

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:46.579
I had about a few hundred.

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.729
Bronies are some of the nicest

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:53.189
most accepting people that I've ever meet. It doesn't matter your age, your gender. No matter who 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.389
you are you can find a place in this fandom and you can be accepted.

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.119
I wouldn't be surprised if My Little Pony has

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:02.319
a hand in changing how people see things.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.989
I think it makes these little tweaks on people to sort of go "oh, okay."

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.769
These Bronies are taking these lessons to heart.

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.180
We need to allow men to be

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.040
sensitive and to care about one another and not 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.480
call them weak for caring.

♪ "from these happy friends of mine" ♪

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:39.009
♪ "We're a long way from Equestria. Long, long way." ♪
