00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:22.899
How to enable a 3GB switch on Windows Vista, Windows 7 
You want to make more memory available to 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:33.433
your Autodesk application by enable the 3GB switch on your 32 bit 
Version of Windows Vista™, Windows 7 

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:41.766
While the 3GB switch may be a useful tool that allows you to access more memory for your Autodesk application,

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:52.799
 It should be mentioned that 
Not all Windows updates or hardware and graphics drivers work well, or at all, with the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:02.400
3GB switch enabled. 
 In fact, some limitations may even apply to certain features that ship with your Autodesk 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:11.900
