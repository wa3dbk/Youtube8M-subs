00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.850
Hello, this is Keb, and I'm interviewing my
Dark Burst Bakugan, my Dark Burst Bakugan

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.670
cards, and my Dark Burst launcher.
First of all, I'll show you all my Dark Burst

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:24.820
Bakugan.
There's this one: Dark Burst Hiro.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:38.079
There's this one: Dark Burst Diablo.
One second...

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:47.969
I'm opening it.
This is my Dark Burst Dragonoid.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:01:06.610
By the way, all of my Dark Burst are Chaos.
This is my Dark Burst Stinglash; it's eyes

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:23.070
are covered, by the way.
This is my Dark Burst Rattelenoid.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:34.420
610 G's, by the way.
It's my best yet.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:55.770
And last, but not least, my Dark Burst Harpus.
520 G's -- not that much -- in my world, anyways.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.330
And this is my Dark Burst launcher.
As you can see, it's basically all dark.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:10.110
Well, not all dark, but, well, you get the
idea.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:24.709
Now I'll show you my Dark Burst cards.
This one is Blurred Heat: The player whose

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:31.239
Bakugan has the lowest G power printed moves
the blue or green ability card from their

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:40.269
used pile to their unused pile.
That was Blurred Heat.

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.709
This is called Stealet.
It has a picture of either Wyvern or a Naga

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:51.540
on it.
This Stealet does this: Play after a gate

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:02.230
card gets put on the field. Move any of your
used Bakugan to your unused pile. Put one

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:10.340
of your opponent's used ability cards into
your unused pile. And plus, you actually take

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:21.099
their ability card.
And this one's just Rattelenoid.

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:28.659
Just like my little Dark Burst Ratteloid here,
so it triples it's power.

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:34.579
And plus, each Dark Burst Bakugan, if it lands
on a Dark Burst Card, it doubles it's power.

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:43.040
And if it's their character card, it triples
its power.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:52.829
So, each Rattlenoid Bakugan gets a 50 G power
for each ability card left on their opponent's

00:03:52.829 --> 00:04:03.519
unused pile at the end of this battle.
And that's all my Dark Burst stuff.

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.060
I'll do more later.
Bye!
