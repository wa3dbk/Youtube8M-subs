00:00:03.745 --> 00:00:07.078
(warbling techno music)

00:00:08.981 --> 00:00:13.287
- Hey there, and welcome to Don't Be Dumb.

00:00:13.287 --> 00:00:15.413
I'm Josh Clarke.

00:00:15.413 --> 00:00:17.496
Thank you for joining me.

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:23.188
Have you ever heard that
little George Washington,

00:00:23.188 --> 00:00:24.688
when he was a boy,

00:00:27.074 --> 00:00:29.939
chopped down his father's cherry tree,

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.929
and when asked if he had been the one

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:35.668
to chop down his father's cherry tree,

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:39.716
said something like, "I cannot tell a lie,

00:00:39.716 --> 00:00:43.236
"I definitely chopped
down that cherry tree."

00:00:43.236 --> 00:00:45.986
Well that may or may not be true.

00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:51.333
See, that story first surfaced

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.277
in a biography of George Washington,

00:00:54.277 --> 00:00:57.694
written by a man named Mason Locke Weems.

00:00:59.723 --> 00:01:01.890
And in the original story,

00:01:02.955 --> 00:01:07.376
Washington didn't chop down
his father's cherry tree,

00:01:07.376 --> 00:01:10.376
he merely scraped the bark off of it

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:16.835
because he had a new hatchet
that he wanted to try out.

00:01:16.835 --> 00:01:21.002
And then the tree later died
because it lost too much bark.

00:01:24.173 --> 00:01:28.590
But historians say that
that story isn't true,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.340
that Mason Locke Weems made it up

00:01:32.274 --> 00:01:35.142
to show what an upstanding person

00:01:35.142 --> 00:01:37.975
George Washington had always been.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.043
But George Washington's grand-nephew,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.468
himself, says he thinks it could be true.

00:01:48.468 --> 00:01:51.809
He says that there were cherry trees

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:55.738
on the land where George
Washington grew up,

00:01:55.738 --> 00:01:59.134
and that he doesn't think
it seems that far-fetched

00:01:59.134 --> 00:02:01.713
that a boy like little Georgie

00:02:01.713 --> 00:02:05.880
would scrape some bark off
of one of the cherry trees.

00:02:09.772 --> 00:02:12.772
So in this case, no one really knows

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.673
who's telling the truth

00:02:16.673 --> 00:02:20.590
about whether George
Washington told the truth.

00:02:22.393 --> 00:02:24.143
And Mason Locke Weems

00:02:25.065 --> 00:02:26.990
has been shown

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.328
to have made some of his
stories about Washington up,

00:02:31.328 --> 00:02:35.623
so it's possible that he was
a fibber in this case too.

00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:37.916
But we don't know.

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.983
So the next time somebody tells you

00:02:40.983 --> 00:02:43.107
that George Washington chopped down

00:02:43.107 --> 00:02:44.744
his father's cherry tree,

00:02:44.744 --> 00:02:46.500
you set them straight!

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.613
And tell them Josh sent you.

00:02:49.613 --> 00:02:51.860
Thank you for joining me.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.277
(soft music)

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:04.296
Do you have a suggestion for
an episode of Don't Be Dumb?

I don't care.
