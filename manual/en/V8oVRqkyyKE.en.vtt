00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:07.399
Hi, I'm Emily Larew, and we are going to start
continuing to warm up our hips, going front

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.350
and back, side to side in a circular motion.
So we're going to start feet apart, knees

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.499
bent, with your hips. Now I want you to really
focus--you are going to release your back

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:23.179
and kind of open your chest a little bit,
but it's all from the hips down. Okay, not

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.449
adding your torso and your ribcage. So what
we're going to do is I want you just to take

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.689
it front and back. Isolating it, front and
back. And what I'm doing is I'm contracting

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.050
my pelvis in just like you did with your ribcage,
but I'm also releasing it--release your booty

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.060
back, so you have a nice arch in your back.
So from the side I'm going front and back,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.820
front and back, front and back, and you're
kind of like why are we doing this? And it's

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.240
going to help you when you do other hip hop
combinations and motions. Pancakes, chickens,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.940
to be able to move your hips as well. So,
let's move them back and forth. Here we go.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.110
Five, six, seven, so we've got one, two, three,
four, just the hips are moving. Let's take

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.680
it side to side. So we're just going to go
hips side to side. Now keeping your knees

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.490
bent you want to hit all the way over, farthest
you can to the right and left. Don't do this,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.700
because you're not going to be able to read
this. So make sure it's sharp. Right, left,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.170
right, left, right. Left, right, left, right,
left. Again, right, left, right, left, right,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.250
and left, right, left, right, left. So, now
that we've done our range of motion to the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.780
front and back and side to side, let's circle
it around. So, keeping your knees bent, we're

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:46.830
going to go front, side, back and to the front.
That's to the right. Right, two, three, and

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:57.600
four. Let's try left. Five, six, seven, and
eight. Again, one, two, three, and four. Keeping

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.290
your knees bent, let's try a little faster,
to the right and to the left. Here we go.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:11.360
One, two, three, four, left, six, seven, eight.
Good job. And that was hips circling around

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.650
and your pops and isolations front and back
side to side.
