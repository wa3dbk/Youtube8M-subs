00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.890
One of the easiest things you can do to your
computer to make it faster is upgrade your

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.930
ram. Hi, I'm Charles Stewart Jr., and I'm
going to tell you the, how to find the maximum

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.780
ram capacity of your computer. As you are,
one of the easiest things to do is upgrade

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.470
the ram in your computer, and if you've been
using it for a while or it's a an older computer,

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.240
you'll start to notice it either slow down
cause' applications are becoming more ram

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.150
intensive, so you're going to want to you
know, upgrade your ram to as much as you can

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:35.000
possibly fit it. The thing is with that is
you got to find out who made your motherboard

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.530
to support the the ram. So, if you built your
computer, you would go to the motherboard

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.379
manufacturer's website. I'm running an Asus
in my computer, so I went to the Asus website,

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.989
and I looked up and found out my computer
model number, or my motherboard's model number,

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.750
and then, or you can take your user manual
and it'll tell you how many ram modules, and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.570
what's the maximum capacity of ram for that
motherboard. But a lot of people have a manufacturer

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.140
computer from like Dell or an HP, so you would
go to your user manual and look through that

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.160
if you still have it. Now chances are some
people have lost it along the way. You can

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.520
go to their website and look up their support
section, and usually, in your manufacturer's

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.330
support section you'll be able to find a user
manual to download as a PDF file, and open

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.960
it up and look for yourself. And that should
tell you the maximum capacity that you can

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.570
fit in there. Now, let's say you find that,
and you see okay, I can fit four gigs of ram

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.970
in my computer. So, to find out how much ram
is on your computer you would simply go to

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.200
my computer, right click, go to properties,
and then on, under the computer section it

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.920
should tell you how much ram. So, with my
computer, it's showing I have two gigs of

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.590
ram, and my motherboard specs say I could
fit three gigs of ram. So I still have an

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.960
extra slot there available, and I can also
open up my computer and look for myself, and

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.850
since I built it, I know that there's an extra
slot in there. And that might be something

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.500
you want to do also is to open up your computer
and look to see if you have an available slot,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.599
cause' some sometimes for manufacturers to
make it cheaper, they'll use smaller ram modules

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.629
to give you a bigger ram number, so they might
use all your slots up and you might not be

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.620
able to upgrade anymore without sacrificing
some of that, so you might lose ram in the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.849
process as you upgrade. So that's all good
stuff to know, and that's it for finding out

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.629
the maximum capacity of ram for your computer.
