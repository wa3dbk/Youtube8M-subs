00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.099

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.349
I promise you, sir. You will not be disapointed with this pizza.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.686
I best be going. See you later!

00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:44.942
[Theme Song] This is Ubby, he is tubby.

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:46.945
[Theme song] His life is exiting when Dave's not igniting

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.980
[Theme song] It's Ubby's Exciting Series!

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:05.697
DAVE: Hey, Ubby, you want a drink?

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.176
What the...

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.180
It looks... dead.

00:01:21.883 --> 00:01:23.883
Why is there a dead lobster here?

00:01:26.588 --> 00:01:28.588
What the hell is it doing out here?

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:32.624
I guess I can cook it..

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.560
No point in leaving a dead lobster on the floor.

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:38.163
Just wash it and boil it... stick in in a stew...

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.600
Hey, Ubby, you want some lobster, man?

00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:44.000
Hey, Ubby? Mitchell?

00:01:50.644 --> 00:01:52.640
Ubby, you know were not even really playing a song right now, right?

00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:58.520
So, I got some lobsters.

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:00.080
Oh, really?

00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:01.090
Yeah, a red one and a blue one.

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:03.820
Can I see them?

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:05.810
Yeah, sure, let's go.

00:02:17.838 --> 00:02:21.840
Yeah, so, the blue one is Larry, and the red one is Mr. Lobster.

00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:26.870
OK, so, I see Larry, but where's Mr.Lobster?

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.100
Oh shit!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This is going to be a tastey lobster!

00:02:41.657 --> 00:02:43.660
No!

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:48.530
Hey Ubby, what's up, man? Want some lobster?

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.540
Dave, that was my pet?

00:02:54.642 --> 00:02:57.640
This is your pet? I guess that would explain how it got there

00:02:57.644 --> 00:02:59.640
but whatever, it was dead anyways, so I boiled it, and...

00:03:00.373 --> 00:03:02.370
chill out and have some dinner for God's sake!

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:03.450
What the hell is wrong with you, Dave?

00:03:03.317 --> 00:03:05.320
What's wrong with me? I'm trying to cook some god damn dinner here

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.420
I don't care! It was my pet!

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.190
It was dead!

00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:11.960
I loved him!

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I don't give a crap about what you 
 love, Ubby! Fact is, it was dead,

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:17.290
i felt liked eating, and I cooked you something and you're not even grateful

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:19.900
All you do is just think about yourself

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.400
Dave, you're a son of a bitch.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.040
You're an asshole, you know that?

00:03:24.196 --> 00:03:26.200
Ubby! I think I just killed your lobster

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.210
What?

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:43.020
What the hell happened here?

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.790
I cooked his lobster, and almost ate it. Then 
 I figured out it was his pet.

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:53.800
What happened to the blue one?

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:55.870
I really don't wanna talk about it.

00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:03.110
You know, we kinda of share something in common here, man.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.320
Wanna go play some Xbox?

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:08.350
Fuck yes!
