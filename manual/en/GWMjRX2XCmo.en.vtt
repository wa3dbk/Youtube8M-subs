Hi, this is Sonoko Sekine.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.900
 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.966
Today, I’m going to share the tips of Yuri Ebihara's makeup.

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:20.232
First of all, use BB cream of Etude House as the makeup base

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:20.866
 

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:30.499
Since Ebi-chan's skin looks bare and soft, use BB cream.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.133
 

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:34.833
One squeeze on your hand would be enough, like this.

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:35.699
 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.833
Since BB cream is likely to lead to an uneven skin tone, you should only apply a dot on your skin.

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:54.266
 

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:58.266
Then, spread it with your finger.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:07.399
 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:15.166
For around the eyes, avoid putting it thickly. Just spread a little bit of the rest in order to make it natural.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:20.932
 

00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.399
It’s like this.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.933
 

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:28.233
For the next, let’s draw eyebrows 
which is the key of the Ebi-chan’s 
makeup.

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:29.333
 

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:34.999
Well, draw with the eyebrow pencil of 
Kate.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.633
 

00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:42.366
Comparing with other models and actresses, 

00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:48.099
I think that the point of Ebi-chan’s eyebrow is to start drawing from the center of the face.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.533
Shade a few on the inner ends of the eyebrows to keep it natural.

00:01:52.533 --> 00:02:10.066
 

00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:17.232
Since Ebi-chan’s eyebrows have a 
naturally high arch, draw for raising 
the middle of eyebrows.

00:02:17.233 --> 00:02:34.066
 

00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:37.832
Make eyebrows soft by using powder.

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:48.699
 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.333
I think long and thick eyebrows is the 
characteristic of Ebi-chan.

00:02:53.333 --> 00:03:01.999
Since I have a light-colored hair, make eyebrows brown by the eyebrow mascara of Kate.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:16.700
 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.866
Use the eyebrow powder of Integrate and shade the eyebrows.

00:03:21.866 --> 00:03:24.899
Use the light brown in this case.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:35.066
 

00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:36.732
Like this.

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:39.799
Let’s proceed to the eye makeup.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.800
Cutie Channel is here.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.966
