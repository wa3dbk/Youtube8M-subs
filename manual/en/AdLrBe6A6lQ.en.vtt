J. MICHAEL MOORE: I kind of feel
that a small space, you

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.860
really have to make the space
work for you, as opposed to

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.660
letting the space work you.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.110
I'm J. Michael Moore.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.560
I'm an interior designer.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.610
This is my 225 square-foot
apartment in New York City.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.980
When I first came in, it was
this horrible hospital green

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.050
color and no detail, no
molding, and a very

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.790
predictable rental apartment.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.900
I thought, well what could I
do to make it really put my

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.790
name on it design-wise and also
wanting to be comfortable

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.640
living in the space.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.330
So I added the crown moldings
and also changed out all the

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.700
base moldings.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.020
The main thing really
is the paint color.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.365
As a designer, I really just got
so tired of seeing gray,

00:00:58.365 --> 00:01:02.230
and beige, and black, and
white, and this whole

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.850
monochromatic kind of feeling.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.170
And that's just not me.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.280
And so I knew I was ready to
just do something really bold

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.160
and really strong.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.930
I didn't want to
do any pattern.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.720
All of the fabrics are solids,
and they're also kind of in a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.770
color-blocking method, where
you have the floor being a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.680
neutral, the walls being one
color, the ceiling being

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.990
another color.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.690
And so everything is
blended, although

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.530
it's very strong color.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.690
Nothing particularly
pops out at you

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.480
because it's all strong.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.230
Everything is movable,
and that's really

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.940
key to a small space.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.460
And especially working and
living in a small space,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.020
that's very important to me.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.190
This space really is my living
area where people come in, sit

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.400
down, we can talk.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.640
And then I kind of defined the
back space as what is my

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.190
office area.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.490
But again, because everything
is movable, I could create

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.810
many different spaces.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.240
The island was a bookcase.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.780
And I kept thinking, how
can I get a working

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.400
surface in my kitchen.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.070
So I moved the island just to
the edge of the painted wood

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.670
floor, and there it is.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.030
I have a workspace.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.600
I didn't want to close anything
up, so it really

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.130
works as far as having
it open.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.290
It kind of creates a larger
space for the kitchen, and

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.320
plus it displays the things
that I like to look at.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.410
I added the sleeping loft
because I knew in a small

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.550
space, it just would not be
comfortable to have a large

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.020
bed to maneuver and
work around.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.710
I knew I had to work
with the kitchen.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.090
Being six foot four, I thought,
well I have to have

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.740
it set to a height that I
can clear underneath it.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.530
Well the bathroom I wanted to
be a completely different

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.650
contrast from the rest
of the apartment.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.885
It started with the shower
curtain, and from there I

00:03:01.885 --> 00:03:04.300
matched the paint and
painted the walls.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.710
And then the medicine
cabinet, I found

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.740
everything that matched.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.760
Keeping it a solid color, it
makes that small space feel

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.010
like it is bigger.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.580
I love small spaces, and I have
lived in small spaces

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.840
since I've lived in New York.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.440
The people that have been over
have been just really shocked

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.640
at how I've made this space
work, in that it is such a

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.130
small space.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.310
Putting your hands on
everything, knowing where

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.150
everything is, that leads to
less frustration in living in

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.180
a small space.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.864
And keeping it neat and
clean, it really makes

00:03:45.864 --> 00:03:47.440
you feel a lot better.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.590
I have no plans to leave, and I
really will probably always

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.150
want to live in a small space
if it's in New York City,

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.650
because it's just a very
cozy place for me.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.256
ANNOUNCER: Are you a social
media darling?

00:04:04.256 --> 00:04:08.980
