00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.259
If you want to change the course of history,
there's no better tool for the job than a

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.360
gun.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.680
Luckily, Wolfenstein: The New Order is full
of 'em.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.480
Let's get to the point: most of the arsenal
on offer relies on a steady feed of ammo - but

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.140
even if you're out of bullets, there's always
your trusty steel: when applied to the right

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.250
spot a blade's incisive attack will prove
very effective.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.730
You might think two knives overkill, but a
spare is often useful to extend your range

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.300
- a deft toss and you can make your point
silently across a room.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.619
Most of the time though, you'll be going loud
and tackling foes with your primary arm: and

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:53.830
the first you'll get your hands on is your
trusty SMG.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.400
The submachine gun is standard issue for the
Allies in 1946, and it bears a striking similarity

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.650
to the American Thompson SMG.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.060
While it lacks damage, it spews bullets at
a prodigious rate, making it quite effective

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.150
at a close range - as long as your ammo supply
holds out.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.790
There's no shortage of enemy weapons lying
about, however - and the Nazi equivalent is

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.650
the Model 1946 Assault Rifle, loosely based
on the Sturmgewehr 44.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.840
It packs more punch than the Allied option
and can reach out further, although recoil

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.560
is heavy and output slower.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.320
Find two, however, and there's nothing stopping
you from wielding both: doubling your firepower

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.950
and shredding all who stand before you.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.990
The updated post-war Model 1960 is a mite
more refined, but suits a similar role.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.580
Externally it resembles a G3 rifle, with the
familiar rotary rear diopter sight a trademark

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.280
of similar weapons manufactured by Heckler
&amp; Koch.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.070
It's the standard armament of most of the
enemies you'll face,

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.400
and, like its predecessor, two held in unison
can put on an impressive show.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.269
Speaking of power, few weapons are as potent
up close as a shotgun: and the double-barreled

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.990
is an iconic classic.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.040
Although you're limited to two rounds between
lengthy reloads, it's a potent choice in close

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.640
quarters that can quickly shut down a threat.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.490
A slightly more high-tech alternative is the
automatic shotgun: a heavy belt fed weapon

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.690
that draws from a 20-round magazine.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.310
In tighter corridors there's not much that
will stand up to such a barrage - and perhaps

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.510
even better is the fact that you can wield
two at once.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.780
Later on you'll discover the shrapnel shell
mod, firing rounds which ricochet off hard

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.080
surfaces - potentially finding soft targets
round corners and in cover.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.920
Every good primary weapon deserves a sidearm,
and you'll be able to find a pistol to call

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.580
your own from a fallen Nazi officer.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.890
The Model 1946 handgun appears to be an iteration
of the classic Pistole Parabellum 1908 - more

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.770
commonly known as the Luger.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.110
Although weak in a firefight, the pistol serves
an important role with the addition of the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.580
silencer.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.350
With the potential to take down foes with
a single well-placed headshot, you can cut

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:23.569
deep behind enemy lines without them having
the chance to raise an alarm.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.980
The updated version, the Model 1960, has a
slightly smoothed exterior and fires a three-round

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.750
burst by default.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.060
This, paired with reduced recoil, grants slightly
more effective stopping power - and, like

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.310
the older model this pistol can be silenced
for covert use.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.000
Single silenced headshots work wonders for
sneaking your way through a compound, whilst

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.330
keeping enemies in the dark.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.980
If white is more your colour, then there's
even a space-age variant with a non-removable

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.849
silencer.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.050
Similarly modern is the Marksman rifle - a
precision weapon whose flat-sided construction

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.310
bears resemblance to more modern rifles such
as the SCAR.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.650
Its primary mode comes equipped with a telescopic
sight, ideal for picking off enemies from

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.379
afar with well-placed headshots.

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.561
Its secondary mode, encountered later, is
more interesting: a laser beam module, with

00:04:18.561 --> 00:04:24.810
a generous battery capable of spewing blue
high-energy laser light towards your target.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.850
You'll need to find a recharger once depleted,
but two laser rifles together boast considerable

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.250
output in the meantime.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.250
The Marksman rifle isn't the only directed
energy tool you'll encounter, either - and

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.750
while barely a weapon, the Laser Cutter is
nonetheless essential to your survival - capable

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.770
of cutting through fences and chains that
otherwise halt your progress.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.120
It's not until you discover the upgraded model
that things become more interesting: the Laserkraftwerk

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.780
can be employed as a very effective weapon.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.371
It retains the ability to cut chain and thicker
metal panels, but in its combat mode it will

00:05:01.371 --> 00:05:06.270
kill opponents with just a couple of shots,
making them explode in a particularly satisfying

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.389
way.

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.970
It's also extensively modifiable - you'll
find a variety of mods in the field, from

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.080
one that makes the weapon fully-automatic,
another which lets your shots reflect off

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:24.470
surfaces - and the portable reactor, which
will slowly recharge the weapon.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.930
If you're after a means to flush out your
enemies - or just want to cause mayhem - then

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.229
the explosive options are a safe bet.

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.669
The hand grenades you'll find resemble the
Model 24 Stielhandgranate, with a long stick

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:42.070
for a handle and an explosive charge surrounded
by a fragmentation casing at the end.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.960
They work well against larger groups of infantry
in close proximity, and the threat of an imminent

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.690
explosion will dislodge stubborn foes from
cover.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:57.220
The post-war replacement is the Tesla Grenade
- similarly explosive, but with an electric

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.280
twist that shuts down any electronics briefly
within the blast radius.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.180
This makes it particularly effective against
heavily armoured opponents, opening up a window

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.520
of opportunity while they're stunned.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.180
You can get more bang for your buck with a
mod for the Model 1960 Assault Rifle: the

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.009
underslung rocket launcher affixes underbarrel,
with explosive interdiction enough to tackle

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.190
all but the mightiest of opponent with a single
round.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:31.900
Top of the tree in firepower are the mounted
machine guns: The MG46 is a rotary-barrel

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.560
minigun normally fired from an emplaced position,
although you can detach the weapon if you

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.430
don't mind being lumbered with a huge hunk
of steel.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.449
Ammunition is limited, but while it lasts
you'll shred the opposition - if you're looking

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:51.900
for sustained firepower, the MG delivers it
in spades.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:58.699
The updated version, the MG60, has a barrel
shroud reminiscent of the MG42 - but the rotating

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:01.810
energy disc reveals that this is no ordinary
machine gun.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:07.500
Instead of firing regular bullets, the MG60
is a sustained-fire energy weapon, with a

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.350
stream of red bolts painting a swathe through
any defensive line.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.100
This also means that you can recharge the
weapon - look for the same chargers that power

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:23.770
your laser cutter, and you can top up this
portable turret for repeated use.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.039
That's about all of the infantry weapons you'll
find - but sometimes, you'll encounter emplaced

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:33.889
weapons on a larger scale - although these
remain firmly rooted to the ground, as they're

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:35.210
much too large to be man-portable.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:41.669
Still, make use of them when you can - you'll
need all the help you can get under the heel

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:43.280
of an iron regime.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.250
No doubt, there's one heck of an arsenal at
your disposal - but it's up to you to make

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.960
it count.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.520
Thanks for watching - and until next time,
farewell!
