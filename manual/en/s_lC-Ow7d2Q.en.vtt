00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:12.933
&gt;&gt; AT THIS POINT WE'RE AT AN
EVERY-SIX-MONTHS APPOINTMENT

00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:15.667
JUST FOR BASIC CHECKUP AND--

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:22.067
&gt;&gt; IT'S THE STANDARD EKG,
VITAL SIGNS, OXYGEN LEVELS,

00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:24.067
RELATIVELY BRIEF CHECKUPS.

00:00:24.067 --> 00:00:27.733
THEY SPEND MORE TIME TALKING TO
EACH OTHER AND CATCHING UP.

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.267
&gt;&gt; MOST BABIES WITH
HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART

00:00:29.267 --> 00:00:31.900
SYNDROME BORN BEFORE THE
1980S HAD NO CHANCE

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.900
OF SURVIVAL.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.900
&gt;&gt; AND MANY CHILDREN ARE NOW
IN THEIR EARLY TEENS WITH

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.300
THIS KIND OF
HEART CONDITION,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.633
AND THEY'RE
DOING QUITE WELL.

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:40.267
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE BASICALLY
ON A MEDICAL FRONTIER.

00:00:40.267 --> 00:00:42.233
THEY'RE ON THE CUTTING
EDGE OF MEDICINE RIGHT NOW.

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:43.767
&gt;&gt; THE SURGERY FOR
HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:46.500
SYNDROME HAS EVOLVED
SINCE THE EARLY 1980S

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.033
AND CONTINUES TO EVOLVE.

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:50.933
&gt;&gt; SO REALLY, A CHILD WHO
SURVIVED ALL THIS IN THE

00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.767
LATE '80S IS VERY DIFFERENT
FROM A CHILD HAVING

00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:55.067
SURGERY TODAY.

00:00:55.067 --> 00:00:57.200
SO WE HAVE A MOVING TARGET
BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING BETTER

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.200
AT WHAT WE DO.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.967
&gt;&gt; ONLY TIME WILL TELL WHAT
THE LONG-TERM OUTCOME

00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:01.833
REALLY IS.

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:04.400
&gt;&gt; SHE IS SO FULL OF ENERGY.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.567
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
SHE HAS A HEART DEFECT.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:08.767
AND PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S BEEN THROUGH LOOK

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:11.267
AT HER IN AWE OF
WHAT SHE'S CAPABLE OF.

00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:13.500
&gt;&gt; FROM A HEART STANDPOINT,
MOST OF THESE CHILDREN

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.300
ARE VERY GOOD AT ADAPTING
TO THEIR LIMITATIONS.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.667
AND SO IF THEY'RE
ON THE PLAYGROUND,

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:22.333
PLAYING WITH OTHER CHILDREN,
THEY WILL PLAY WITH THEM

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.400
AND GET AROUND WITH THEM
AND LIMIT THEMSELVES

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.733
AS THEY NEED TO.

00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:29.533
IN ADDITION, WE'RE FINDING
OUT THAT THERE ARE ALSO

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.867
NEUROLOGIC ABNORMALITIES
THAT MANY OF THESE CHILDREN

00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:34.233
HAVE AND WILL HAVE
AS THEY GROW OLDER,

00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:36.200
SOME OF THEM WITH
LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.200
SOME OF THEM
WITH ADHD ISSUES,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.933
AND SOME OF THEM EVEN
MORE COMPLEX THAN THIS.

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.533
&gt;&gt; WE'VE REALLY
PUSHED THE FIELD IN,

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:46.633
YOU KNOW, MAKING THIS A
HEART DISEASE THAT IS NOT

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:49.300
ONLY NOT FATAL BUT IS
ACTUALLY VERY SURVIVABLE

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.767
WITH GOOD OUTCOMES.

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:54.100
AND SHOULDERED ON THAT IS
THE TRANSITION TO TRYING

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.500
TO OPTIMIZE
NEURODEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.600
PARTICULARLY FOR BABIES
WITH HYPOPLASTIC

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.900
LEFT HEART SYNDROME.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.833
AND A LOT OF THAT
INFORMATION HAS COME

00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:04.667
FROM THIS PROGRAM.

00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:06.900
&gt;&gt; A NUMBER OF THESE
KIDS ARE GROWN UP NOW

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.533
AND ARE DOING WELL--
THEY VISIT--HAVING RELATIVELY

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:11.567
NORMAL LIVES.

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:13.267
&gt;&gt; IN TERMS OF
INTRAMURAL SPORTS,

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:16.067
IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, BEING
ABLE TO DO WHAT OTHER KIDS

00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:19.167
DO IN GENERAL, MOST OF THESE
CHILDREN HAVE DONE QUITE

00:02:19.167 --> 00:02:21.367
WELL AND KEEP UP
WITH THEIR PEERS.

00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:23.233
MANY OF THESE CHILDREN
WILL HAVE ISSUES

00:02:23.233 --> 00:02:24.500
WHEN THEY GET OLDER.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.567
SOME WILL REQUIRE
ADDITIONAL SURGERY.

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:29.533
SOME WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL
PROCEDURES OF VARIOUS TYPES.

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:31.733
SOME MAY HAVE RHYTHM
PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE

00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:32.933
ADDRESSED.

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:34.800
AND SOME WILL PROBABLY
EVENTUALLY NEED A HEART

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.533
TRANSPLANT.

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:39.267
BUT WHAT I TELL FAMILIES IS
THAT THERE ARE MORE ADULTS

00:02:39.267 --> 00:02:42.067
NOW THAN THERE ARE CHILDREN
LIVING WITH CONGENITAL HEART

00:02:42.067 --> 00:02:45.633
DISEASE WHICH, FRANKLY, IS A
TESTIMONY TO THE FACT WE'VE

00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:47.500
BEEN PRETTY SUCCESSFUL
AT DEALING WITH THESE

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.333
CONDITIONS.

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:52.200
&gt;&gt; OUR MISSION ULTIMATELY IS
TO HELP CHILDREN WITH HEART

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.567
DISEASE AND TO HELP THEIR
FAMILIES GET THROUGH THIS

00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:57.967
DIFFICULT PROBLEM, TO DO
WHATEVER WE CAN TO MAKE

00:02:57.967 --> 00:02:59.167
THEIR LIVES BETTER.

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:03.000
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU, AGAIN, GO FROM
BEING TOLD A DIAGNOSIS LIKE

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.033
HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART AND
FEELING A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:13.133
AND ANXIETY, YOU VISIT HERE,
AND YOU REALIZE THERE'S

00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:18.000
KNOWLEDGE AND COMPASSION
AND COMFORT AT CHOP.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.233
&gt;&gt; YOU WALK IN HERE,
AND YOU JUST FEEL,

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:22.767
YOU KNOW, THAT MORGAN'S BEST
INTEREST IS IN THEIR BEST

00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:24.067
HANDS, SO-- 

00:03:24.067 --> 00:03:25.867
&gt;&gt; THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
WHY WE CHOSE HER MIDDLE NAME

00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:29.667
TO BE HOPE, BECAUSE IT WAS
SUCH A STRONG FEELING

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:33.167
AND SENSE THAT WE GOT EVERY
TIME WE CAME AND LEFT.

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:35.900
&gt;&gt; WHAT MOVES ME IS TO WORK
WITH THE FAMILIES AND TO WORK

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.367
WITH THE CHILDREN AND
TO GIVE THEM THE BEST

00:03:38.367 --> 00:03:40.800
POSSIBLE CARE
THAT WE CAN PROVIDE.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.267
THAT'S FIRST AND FOREMOST.

00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:44.633
&gt;&gt; AND TO SEE THEM GROW AND
TO SEE THEM INTEGRATED INTO

00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:48.433
THE FAMILY AND TO SEE THEM
INTERFACE WITH THEIR PARENTS

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:51.500
AND THEIR SIBLINGS JUST AS
YOU WOULD ANY OTHER ROUTINE

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.300
AND NORMAL CHILD.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.733
&gt;&gt; TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE
HEART OF A CHILD AND FIX IT

00:03:56.733 --> 00:03:59.400
SO THAT THE PHYSIOLOGY
IS BETTER AND THE CHILD

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.700
HAS A CHANCE AT A LONG LIFE,
THAT'S VERY GRATIFYING.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.533
&gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING BETTER
THAN SEEING THE KIDS COME

00:04:04.533 --> 00:04:06.000
BACK WHEN THEY'RE
FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OLD.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.267
&gt;&gt; AND REALLY SEE THAT THEY'RE
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER KID.

00:04:09.267 --> 00:04:11.067
&gt;&gt; A CHILD WHO HAD HAD
HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART

00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:14.633
SYNDROME WHO--I WALKED IN
THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT ONE

00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:16.233
DAY, HE WAS SIX YEARS
OLD, AND HE WAS THERE

00:04:16.233 --> 00:04:17.533
WITH A BROKEN LEG.

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:19.233
I SAID, "WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?"

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:21.900
WELL, HE WAS OUT MOUNTAIN
BOARDING WITH HIS COUSINS.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.333
I'M REALLY SORRY
HE BROKE HIS LEG,

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:27.467
BUT I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT
HERE'S A CHILD WHO 20 YEARS

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:29.267
AGO WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD,
AND HE'S ALIVE TO BE OUT

00:04:29.267 --> 00:04:32.667
MOUNTAIN BOARDING
WITH HIS COUSINS.

00:04:32.667 --> 00:04:34.933
THAT'S WHY TO DO IT.

00:04:34.933 --> 00:04:36.533
&gt;&gt; THROUGH THE
FETAL HEART PROGRAM,

00:04:36.533 --> 00:04:39.467
WE'RE NOW ABLE TO OFFER HOPE
AND PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE

00:04:39.467 --> 00:04:42.300
FOR THESE CHILDREN TO
GO ON TO LEAD HAPPY

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.333
AND HEALTHY LIVES.

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:45.533
AND THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT.
