00:00:10.993 --> 00:00:12.109
That was bad.

00:00:12.376 --> 00:00:13.981
Are we rolling?

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.882
Clown.

00:00:27.758 --> 00:00:29.615
-Carnival Umbrella. -Confetti rain.

00:00:30.093 --> 00:00:31.716
Do you like confetti?

00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:34.101
-Silly, I prefer M&amp;M's.

00:00:34.547 --> 00:00:37.724
This is a carnival party... no. -Yes, it could be a party.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.219
We will tell you all that happens during carnival...

00:00:43.513 --> 00:00:45.666
-Europe also has carnival.

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:47.641
Not only Brazil.

00:00:47.872 --> 00:00:49.754
It's just a little bit colder.

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:53.700
We will talk about Cologne. Do you wear cologne?

00:00:53.947 --> 00:00:54.916
From Paris.

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.369
'I love my Parisian cologne.'

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.426
But this Cologne is German.

00:00:59.688 --> 00:01:03.402
It starts on the 11/11, at 11am.

00:01:03.694 --> 00:01:05.128
It only happened in 2011?

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:07.311
It happened last year as well.

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:11.686
It's a three month warm up, in the cold

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:15.767
and then in February it actually begins.

00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:18.104
They're on the piss for three months?

00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:20.273
Yes, mostly in people's houses.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.060
The longest warm-up I've heard of.

00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:30.945
And there's also Carnival in Venice.

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:33.915
It's very lively, crazy.

00:01:35.267 --> 00:01:37.459
I think they take Ecstasy there man.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:38.544
Look.

00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:53.004
-Very lively. - Yes, amazing.

00:01:53.327 --> 00:01:56.435
-How they do it? -I would be sweating.

00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:58.206
Do you like Carnival?

00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:03.370
Not anymore. I try to avoid it actually.

00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:05.959
I like that it's a holiday.

00:02:07.423 --> 00:02:10.646
Buy you've been naughty at Carnival in the past.

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:13.417
Your past condemns you.

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.145
What do you mean?

00:02:15.407 --> 00:02:18.133
We found this video on the internet.

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:21.122
On this fairly unknown website.

00:02:21.353 --> 00:02:22.846
Underground website.

00:02:23.123 --> 00:02:27.861
YouTube.  We found a video of you.

00:02:28.193 --> 00:02:32.894
-Just me? -No, me too. Look.

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.376
Did your mum see this?

00:02:46.603 --> 00:02:47.546
No.

00:02:47.762 --> 00:02:49.038
Exploding stuff...

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.694
She will now. She follows E-Dublin.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.084
Give us a 'like'.

00:02:52.285 --> 00:02:54.973
Actually, too bad we have no Carnival here.

00:02:55.206 --> 00:02:59.779
Imagine Carnival here, with all the craziness?

00:03:00.257 --> 00:03:01.835
It would be cool.

00:03:02.097 --> 00:03:05.570
What could we name the samba schools?

00:03:05.858 --> 00:03:07.128
Academics of Dundrum.

00:03:07.435 --> 00:03:09.213
Temple Bar United.

00:03:09.513 --> 00:03:10.814
Dublinese D9.

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:13.501
I see what you did there.

00:03:13.863 --> 00:03:18.707
-Summer Hill United. - With people wearing Adidas sweatpants.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.674
-Connolly First Station. -Good one!

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:26.357
Then we need to score them.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.593
-Yes. -Grading them.

00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:31.050
Like in Brazil:

00:03:31.327 --> 00:03:33.434
Harmony: Ten.

00:03:33.665 --> 00:03:36.377
Attendance: Nine.

00:03:36.643 --> 00:03:38.642
Structure: Seven

00:03:38.904 --> 00:03:40.405
Number of Brazilians:

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:43.606
Eleven.

00:03:47.098 --> 00:03:49.350
Can we renew our visas with Carnival schools?

00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:51.302
Yes, but you have to be good.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.588
The schools would parade through Temple Bar.

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:58.060
The floats could not be big, it's too windy.

00:03:58.353 --> 00:04:04.107
Would our traditional  'confraternization' happen here?

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.980
'Security is trying to capture this man.'

00:04:09.242 --> 00:04:12.429
'He has the envelopes with the results'

00:04:12.797 --> 00:04:14.040
'and tears them.'

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:16.576
You must be wondering where is our...

00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:19.031
Leprechaun.

00:04:20.078 --> 00:04:21.891
'TATTOOED LEPRECHAUN'

00:04:24.484 --> 00:04:27.377
He is in Brazil for Carnival.

00:04:27.662 --> 00:04:29.691
But he sent us something.

00:04:29.994 --> 00:04:33.724
A PowerPoint presentation with pictures...

00:04:33.986 --> 00:04:35.301
Those animated presentations.

00:04:35.594 --> 00:04:37.485
I love them. They are great.

00:04:37.824 --> 00:04:39.239
Let's look.

00:04:39.532 --> 00:04:41.832
Let's watch the Leprachaun's PowerPoint.

00:04:43.388 --> 00:04:46.356
(Traditional Brazilian Carnival song)

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.104
LAST CALL

00:05:11.715 --> 00:05:15.969
'Last Call' time! Whats is today's tip?

00:05:17.307 --> 00:05:18.456
Dan?

00:05:19.771 --> 00:05:22.085
If you want to enjoy Carnival

00:05:22.485 --> 00:05:26.174
go to the Woolshed in Cork on the 9th of February.

00:05:26.528 --> 00:05:29.008
Organized by the guys at Brazilan Roots.

00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:31.518
But it's the Woolshed in Cork.

00:05:31.826 --> 00:05:36.125
If you are in Dublin and want to enjoy the party

00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:41.889
go to D2 on the 10th. Organized by Hell Events.

00:05:42.549 --> 00:05:46.060
If you want to get away from it

00:05:46.337 --> 00:05:49.066
we have tips for you and for people with a hangover.

00:05:49.452 --> 00:05:50.565
It's Justin Bieber.

00:05:51.674 --> 00:05:54.646
He will be at the O2 on the 17th.

00:05:58.454 --> 00:06:00.533

No Justin Beiber.

00:06:21.064 --> 00:06:22.541
-What then?

00:06:23.873 --> 00:06:26.541
-The Master! -Silvio Santos, of course!

00:06:26.862 --> 00:06:29.511
♪Grandpa can't get it up anymore♪

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:32.714
♪Grandpa can't get it up anymore♪

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:36.057

00:06:36.427 --> 00:06:39.737

Carnival's moto is to flirt.

00:07:00.863 --> 00:07:02.910
-Have you hooked up yet? -No.

00:07:03.872 --> 00:07:05.788
Holly crap!

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:11.294
There you go!
