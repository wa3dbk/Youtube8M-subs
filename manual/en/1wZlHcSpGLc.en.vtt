If you're like me, you carry everything, and
I mean everything in your iphone. If you really

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:10.790
think about it, I've got contacts of everybody
I know, passwords directly into my network,

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:17.070
I have some of my favorite movies, televisions
shows, almost all of my music, I have programs,

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.310
I have custom made videos, I have custom made
ring tones, to lose the iphone would be a

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.030
terrible thing. Or, if it got, if it falls
into the wrong hands, then you pretty much

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.870
have the key to my life. So, how do I protect
myself? Well, one is with the new 3G, there's

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.620
the auto-wipe feature, which means if somebody
steals it, we can touch a button and poof,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.930
basically bricks it, until it comes back to
daddy. But, there's another way, because sometimes

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.380
you've got to place your phone down, and you
know, somebody might say hey, you know, not

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.290
intending to steal it, but hey, let me take
a look at the iphone, turn it on and start

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.350
take a looking through your stuff. Un-huh,
no go, I'm going to show you how to unlock

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.460
that iphone, if you get it nice and secure
for yourself. Iphone in it's locks mode, will

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.140
be blank, this is also a great power saving
mode. So, to turn it back on, I'm just going

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.930
to simply hit the button, then it's going
to go to slide to unlock, and this is a neat

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.890
feature, because it stops what they call pocket
dialing. Meaning you throw it in your pocket,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.070
and things touch against it and it starts
calling people and they can hear your conversations

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.141
through your pants, very embarrassing. All
I'm going to do is slide to unlock it, and

00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:25.200
now there's my pass code. If somebody doesn't
know it or tries to mess around with it, my

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.479
pass code comes up. So, I'm going to put it
in here, and in this case, now this is a fake

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:37.759
one, don't give me ideas. It's one, two, three,
four, pop, and now we're in business. Alright,

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.920
to get it back to the lock mode, or putting
it in my pocket, so nothing gets hit. I simply

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.620
top, tap rather, the button at top of it,
boom and there we go again. Pop it on, slide

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.840
to unlock it. One, two, three, four, boom,
she's unlocked and there you go. Touch the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.480
home button, slide it open, put in your pass
code, and now your iphone is unlocked. And,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.630
