00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.780
Nestled in the heart of southwest Michigan
sits South Haven Sunnybrook RV Resort – a

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.080
special place that combines the best of nature
with the best of resort living.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.130
Sunnybrook RV Resort is a sixty-five acre
oasis that's a million miles away from your

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.930
nearest care - yet so close to home.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.670
Pass through out gates to experience it for
yourself.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.890
Our special RV resort features 266 sites including
RV sites and Class A sites…and we welcome

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.239
all types of visitors throughout the season.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:47.760
I like to say that we are a day, a week or
a lifetime - so, we pretty much cover everything

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.089
for RVers.

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:56.269
Tour the grounds at Sunnybrook RV Resort and
you’ll find pretty views and gorgeous landscaping.

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:02.269
All RV sites include full hook-ups with wi-fi
internet service, water, irrigation and 50

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:03.639
amp electric.

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:08.450
We have large comfortable sites well situated
on the grounds offering maximum levels of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.810
comfort for short or extended stays.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.580
Our lake and ravine sites are for Class A
and Luxury Motor Coaches and offer guests

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.890
stunning views right out their front door.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.930
And there are plenty of lake sites available
for future guests.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.370
Throughout the park you’ll find well-kept,
well-maintained sites – and that’s just

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.690
how our owners like it.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.160
Our coach houses and our park models offer
guests all of the comforts of home.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.920
Jill &amp; Keith Chapman On-Camera 1:
“This is the finest park here in the midwest

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.980
- there’s people from all over that are
coming here - Indianapolis, Detroit, Grand

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.700
Rapids, Chicago - they’re coming from all
over, even though we’re close.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.150
The amenities here are just unmatched.”

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.940
Life at Sunnybrook is a perfect mix of daily
fun and peaceful relaxation.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.870
Our six-thousand square foot clubhouse has
a fun beach theme and is a hub for activity

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.300
at the resort.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.000
With large spaces for parties and comfortable
lounges to relax it is a great place to unwind

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.270
or celebrate with friends.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.140
Our heated swimming pool offers fun all season
long.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.120
Our five-and-a-half-acre private lake is the
centerpiece of our park and perfect for fun

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.080
on and off the water.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.930
Our guests love fishing and spending time
on our man-made beach…

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.730
…they love fishing from shore….
…and some just love the peaceful views it

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.930
offers…

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.220
One of the things we absolutely love is the
lake - the lakefront here with the fountains

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.480
and the beach on the one end - and the fishing
in it is absolutely wonderful.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.090
Visitors to our park love to head off property
and explore South Haven, the city’s bustling

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.230
downtown and Riverfront areas, and its gorgeous
marinas and waterfronts.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.380
In the summer months The North Beach is a
popular stop for locals and visitors alike.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.880
And all times of year people love to take
to the water from South Haven’s many marinas.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.740
If you’re starting to get the idea that
life at our RV resort is filled with fun and

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.700
relaxation in one of the most perfect locations
in the country – you’d be right.
