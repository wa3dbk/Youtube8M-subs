00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.030
Would you like to give a rank to each league

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.910
considering top 4 teams?

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.580
It is different with considering only top 1 team

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.700
What do you mean about 'each league'?

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.320
Top 4 teams in LCS

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.720
For example, all top 4 teams are invited at MSI

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.730
Which region will be a winner?

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.360
We will be "what" rank in such tournament

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.999
What rank..

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.999
We will win US teams

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.379
We can beat US teams

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.160
However

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.520
Do you know Unicorns of Love (UOL)? That team is a dark horse

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.260
Every team should fight with UOL

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.600
We should focus on UOL in this world championship. I will cheer UOL

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.260
UOL will be a shock to all teams in world championship

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.160
I'm sure about it

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.720
World championship will be soooo intersting if UOL joins it

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.600
Normally we do not avoid favorable fight in pro-games

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.000
Unicorn gave a favorable position to opposite team

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.080
But we lose at fight when we opened team fight

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.110
It is really hard to distinguish that

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.340
"Is it really favorable position for us?"

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.860
We made so many fights at a game with UOL, but actually we really refrained

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.320
There were so many good chances to fight, but we did not

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.520
Let's wait, wait better chance

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.060
It's really...

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.280
Even Korean team may fight a lot with UOL despite of their passive style

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.480
we should fight continously in a game with UOL

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.360
Eventually we will lose if we follow their pace

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.740
You said that you didn't expect be a winner

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.920
I've heard that

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.100
Fnatic will go semi-final at least in world championship

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.880
However, if UOL is a winner rather than Fnatic

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.130
we cannot expect the result of world championship with UOL, UOL could be a winner or a last

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.920
cause game with UOL will be new experiences for other teams

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.299
Fnatic already experienced it

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.469
and you considered that UOL will win a game

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:10.309
with teams in other regions

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:11.529
I think so

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.000
We are upgrade version of UOL

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.920
Is it compliment?

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.520
Then did you learn something from UOL? Something you can use it

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.680
I learnt a lot

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.989
They overcome everything by fights

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.969
If the game is difficult,

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:41.539
the noraml way to cope with it is standing and waiting. And sudden attack with a favorable position

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.019
Unicorn creates a favorable position by self

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.900
Creation meta! Unicorn continuously fights, but take something from all fights

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.740
And next snow ball is also fight

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.420
I really surprised in ban-pick

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.160
Gnar is definitely top laner, but UOL used it as jungle

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.760
Sometimes we thought that AD is good for Kassadin

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.700
UOL really used Varus

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.720
Fnatic lost the game

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.920
Yah...

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:20.039
Do you think UOL will be good at next season??

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:21.879
We can say that it was a fluke

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.779
No, never

00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:28.231
Awesome

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.770
This is not end of UOL

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.329
We cannot expect UOL's ban-pick

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.089
cannot expect? then cannot prepare it

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:41.549
We should make new draft in ban-pick phase

00:03:44.018 --> 00:03:45.298
Pre-planned ban-picks are useless?

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.680
We made 30 scenarios, but all failed

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.420
No number of cases

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.370
It's really difficult to cope with it

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.870
That's very strong point of UOL

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.700
Yah, it's really interesting to show a game with that team

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.710
Anyway, you can will US teams

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.099
Now we talked about only US and Europe

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.240
How do you think about other regions?

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:05.839
I think it could be very close games

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.500
It is hard to say certain results but

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.720
games with UOL and Korean teams will be very interesting

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.509
Korean teams are very passive in a game

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.710
Passive team vs

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.280
UOL, very aggressive team. How do Korean team deal with it?

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.370
I really wonder it. Korean team can do well with UOL

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:38.410
But otherwise, UOL can fight very well

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.260
Then eventually UOL may win a game

00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:43.059
It's really hard to predict

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:45.969
UOL's statistics are very funny

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:55.429
UOL got less global gold in all games, even a winning game. Their glod is less until 20 minutes

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.200
But after 20 minutes, they got more gold

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.830
They are

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.219
skillful to turn a game around and

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:07.669
to bait enemies

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.609
But I'm not sure that it's intentional or just happens

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:21.959
Their mental is also very strong cause they do their best until the end of game

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.140
It's really hard to win

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.609
Our mentals are really tired after game with UOL

00:05:29.609 --> 00:05:31.860
I can understand it even though I just watch a game, not play
