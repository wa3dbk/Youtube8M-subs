00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.200
I would just cry at home

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.650
because I was mad.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.900
I was upset

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.990 position:63%
but I called the Austin Tenants' Council

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and I told her,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.500
this is what happened that day,

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.200
this is what I was told

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.900 position:59%
and she said, "OK, I'll deal with it."

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.350
The Austin Tenants' Council is a

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.500
private non-profit

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.990
and we deal with housing rights

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.100 position:59%
both landlord-tenant and fair housing.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.300
Our main goal is

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.100
to make sure that everyone has

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.000 position:66%
safe, affordable, decent and fair housing.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.750
The Federal Fair Housing Act

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.600
protects against race, color,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.200
national origin, sex, disability,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.000 position:69%
religion and familial status discrimination.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.350 position:66%
The City of Austin has their own ordinance

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.900
which goes even further than

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.050
The Federal Fair Housing Act

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.900
and protects against

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.750
marital status, student status,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.000 position:69%
sexual orientation, age and gender identity.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.750
They opened the doors for me,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.500 position:77%
they contacted the people they needed to contact,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.000
they wrote the letters and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.650
put everything in motion.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.800 position:70%
I was having problems with my service animal.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.850
When I moved into the apartments

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.800 position:56%
I was told that I couldn't have one.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.250
I've had seizures before.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.800
Right before I had it, Mumu,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.900
this little black and white dog,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.600
started acting real funny.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.600 position:56%
I'd never seen that behavior in him.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.800
I look back now and I realize

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.100 position:58%
he really trying to make me lay down.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.100
If a person needs help

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.600
the fair housing program

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.500
will help them anywhere in Texas

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.000
where there is not another

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.800 position:61%
private non-profit fair housing agency.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.500
We have telephone counselling,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.330 position:66%
we have a rental repair assistance program

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.900 position:67%
and we have an emergency mediation program.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.900
And with our fair housing program

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.800 position:58%
we assist people in filing complaints

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.650 position:64%
writing reasonable accommodation requests

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.800
and we also have a testing program.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.450 position:73%
He said that it wasn't true that I wasn't sick.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.050 position:58%
That there was nothing wrong with me.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.400 position:72%
They didn't want to give me a handicapped sign

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.800
because they didn't have to

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.500
they didn't want to.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.650
So I was real depressed.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.500
I got real, real upset

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.750 position:63%
and once I got into the Tenantsâ€™ Council

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.500
all that stopped.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.500
All the harassing stopped

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.100 position:66%
because they knew that I had a case worker

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.300
that was going to help me out

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.800
and they couldn't harass me the way

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.990
they were harassing me.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.400
I don't want to be over dramatic

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.650 position:59%
but they actually helped save my life.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.850
They deny your help

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.800
or they look down at you

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.300
like they're better than you

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.300
but the Austin Tenants' Council

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.500
didn't do that.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.800
They stood up for me,

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.660
they showed them that I had rights

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.400
and now I'm very, very happy.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.010
ATC got it goin' on.
