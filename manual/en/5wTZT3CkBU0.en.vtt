In this episode, I will show you how to add
two terabytes of storage to your Xbox One, or

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.950
Xbox 360 with the Seagate Game Drive. Stay
tuned!

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:20.489
Hey guys! Welcome to Bleeding Edge TV. I’m
Andru Edwards, editor-in-chief of GearLive.com

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.109
I’m going to tell you all about the Seagate
Game Drive for Xbox. It’s actually right

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.619
here, it came out last August 10, and it allows
you to add two terabytes of storage to a two

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:30.439
terabyte hard drive.

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.440
The Game Drive works flawlessly with Xbox
One and the Xbox 360. As you can see, it’s

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.610
pretty small, you can put it in your pocket,
in your bag and take it with you when you’re

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.980
going somewhere else, it allows you to bring
your games with you.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.480
So I’m going to open this up and I’m going
to show you what it looks like. Let me actually

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.070
tell you what two terabytes get because some
people might not know yet. The Xbox One shifts

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.670
with 500 GB of storage space. Two terabytes
is four times that much, so when you plug

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.530
this in you end up with 2.5 terabytes of storage
space, giving you five times the storage that

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.899
you had when you first bought the console.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:11.999
Look at the size, very small, very compact
as you can see on the front it’s green,

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:16.729
it says “Xbox” and it says “Seagate”,
the rest of it is black with information on

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.759
the bottom rear, and there’s a USB 3.0 port
on the top and it has a USB 3 drive, a USB

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:24.689
3 speeds.

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.499
To give you an idea on what you can do with
two terabyte of storage space when you plug

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:33.399
this in, your Xbox One will end up five times
the amount of space you started with, you

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.299
go from 500GB to 2.5 terabyte or 2500 GB.

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:43.119
For the Xbox 360 it’s even more dramatic
because when they started they shipped with

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.600
a 20GB hardrive, one of them came up with
the 4GB hardrive. So two terabytes is many,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.630
many, many times more than what your Xbox
360 ship with.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.939
Now, I know I’m throwing a lot of numbers
at you so let’s give you some real world

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.420
application. If you plug this into an Xbox
one, it can store up to 50 games, that’s

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.130
a lot.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.920
I found out that I ran out of Xbox One storage
space very quickly, so I bought myself a five

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.380
terabytes Seagate External Hard drive, but
that one actually need to be plugged in to

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.910
the wall. With this two terabyte version,
there’s no external power source needed,

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.050
just plug in USB 3.0 and you’re good to
go.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.840
It really is that easy, just plug and play,
you plug it here, you plug it there and you’re

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.310
done. So in the box, it does have the Seagate
Game Drive for Xbox, as well as the USB 3.0

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.060
cable to connect the drive to your Xbox console.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.180
