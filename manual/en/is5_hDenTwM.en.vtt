00:00:02.698 --> 00:00:05.398
Dude, it’s time to go home.

00:00:05.398 --> 00:00:09.717
Is it that time already?

00:00:09.717 --> 00:00:11.078
Yeah.

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:12.318
Your wife called again.

00:00:12.318 --> 00:00:13.318
Okay…

00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:16.908
But can I just stay for another five minutes,
please?

00:00:16.908 --> 00:00:18.287
(laughs) Fine.

00:00:18.287 --> 00:00:20.588
But why don’t you want to go home?

00:00:20.588 --> 00:00:22.858
Is everything alright with the missus?

00:00:22.858 --> 00:00:24.918
Yes, yes, everything’s great.

00:00:24.918 --> 00:00:29.878
It’s just that, I just love your kegerator
so much, and I can’t bear the thought of

00:00:29.878 --> 00:00:32.518
going home and leaving it here all alone.

00:00:32.518 --> 00:00:33.518
Hmmm.

00:00:33.518 --> 00:00:36.748
You do realize that it’s just an appliance,
right?

00:00:36.748 --> 00:00:39.698
And that it will still be here the next time
you come.

00:00:39.698 --> 00:00:40.698
I know.

00:00:40.698 --> 00:00:42.228
But you don’t understand, man.

00:00:42.228 --> 00:00:45.138
We, it and I, we have a special connection.

00:00:45.138 --> 00:00:50.998
If I put my hands on its sides, I can almost
feel it humming back sweet nothings.

00:00:50.998 --> 00:00:55.438
Setting aside the obvious fact that you are
drunk, why don’t you get a kegerator of

00:00:55.438 --> 00:01:00.018
your own and develop a romantic relationship
with it in the comfort of your own home?

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:02.598
No way dude, we can’t afford it.

00:01:02.598 --> 00:01:04.328
My wife would freak out.

00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:06.828
Okay, why don’t you build one then?

00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:12.387
It’ll be significantly cheaper, and you
get to manhandle it in any weird way you want.

00:01:12.387 --> 00:01:13.778
Can we really do that?

00:01:13.778 --> 00:01:15.628
Don’t play with me, man.

00:01:15.628 --> 00:01:17.278
Of course you can.

00:01:17.278 --> 00:01:20.198
You know the kegerator you’re groping right
now?

00:01:20.198 --> 00:01:23.537
It was built from an old fridge I got at a
garage sale.

00:01:23.537 --> 00:01:27.908
The key is finding the best refrigerator to
convert to a kegerator.

00:01:27.908 --> 00:01:31.238
Could you please teach me how to build one?

00:01:31.238 --> 00:01:35.298
Yes, just as soon as you stop fondling the
damn thing.

00:01:35.298 --> 00:01:38.427
Seriously dude, you’re creeping me out.

00:01:38.427 --> 00:01:40.558
Okay, okay.

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:42.208
What do I need to do first?

00:01:42.208 --> 00:01:46.867
Well, as I’ve mentioned, the key is the
choice of refrigerators.

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:48.397
Everything else is secondary.

00:01:48.397 --> 00:01:54.048
Heck, you can even buy kegerator installation
kits online for under fifty bucks.

00:01:54.048 --> 00:01:57.198
Okay, so how do we find the best fridge?

00:01:57.198 --> 00:02:01.278
First off, you need to determine what size
of keg you’re going to get.

00:02:01.278 --> 00:02:08.128
A half barrel keg, the 15 gallons variety,
or the slim quarter keg, usually between seven

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:11.478
and eight gallons, will require an upright
refrigerator.

00:02:11.478 --> 00:02:17.328
A short quarter barrel, meanwhile, will fit
perfectly inside a compact fridge.

00:02:17.328 --> 00:02:23.528
Or, you could go wild and get a freezer, and
fit in two or even three half barrel k–

00:02:23.528 --> 00:02:27.408
for the last time, stop groping my damn kegerator!

00:02:27.408 --> 00:02:28.418
Sorry dude.

00:02:28.418 --> 00:02:31.638
I didn’t realize my hands were reaching
out again.

00:02:31.638 --> 00:02:32.638
Please continue…

00:02:32.638 --> 00:02:37.018
(glaring) Next, you have to decide how many
taps you want on the keg.

00:02:37.018 --> 00:02:40.958
Anything more than one, and the compact fridge
is out of the equation.

00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:45.938
If you intend to keep an ice maker or extra
glasses inside the fridge, that would rule

00:02:45.938 --> 00:02:48.598
out a medium-sized upright fridge.

00:02:48.598 --> 00:02:51.608
You would have to go for the deluxe-sized
ones.

00:02:51.608 --> 00:02:57.388
Remember, you must also take into account
the space taken by the CO2 cylinder and regulator.

00:02:57.388 --> 00:03:00.648
Why would I need more than one tap?

00:03:00.648 --> 00:03:04.118
In case you are hosting a party, or have company
over.

00:03:04.118 --> 00:03:06.758
A single tap could create long refill lines.

00:03:06.758 --> 00:03:11.408
Why would I let anyone touch, never mind share,
my kegerator?

00:03:11.408 --> 00:03:13.028
My bad.

00:03:13.028 --> 00:03:14.838
One last thing.

00:03:14.838 --> 00:03:20.088
Before buying a used or refurbished fridge,
put your head inside it and take a good whiff.

00:03:20.088 --> 00:03:23.828
If there’s presence of any weird smells,
move along.

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:28.138
The fridge has faced problems before and the
food inside went bad.

00:03:28.138 --> 00:03:31.078
You want a fresh-smelling, clean looking fridge.

00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:32.858
That’s about it, man.

00:03:32.858 --> 00:03:34.208
You’re good to go.

00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:36.538
Dude, I think I’m gonna cry.

00:03:36.538 --> 00:03:38.508
Thank you so much.

00:03:38.508 --> 00:03:39.548
You’re welcome.

00:03:39.548 --> 00:03:41.658
Could you like, go home now please?

00:03:41.658 --> 00:03:43.248
Give me a hug first.

00:03:43.248 --> 00:03:46.248
I love you man, you know that right?

00:03:46.248 --> 00:03:47.248
I love you too.

00:03:47.248 --> 00:03:47.518
Goodnight.
