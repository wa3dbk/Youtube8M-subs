Hi my name is Tristan at the Austin Martial
Arts Academy. We’re online at http://www.austinmartialarts.com.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:13.600
Okay we’re on to our next kick here in the
kickboxing series, this is the side kick.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.480
We’re going to continue with the focus mitts,
I’m the coach, I hold the mitts against

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.210
my body and then I pop them up for my partner.
But in learning the kick I’m just going

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.170
to hold it out, stand off to the side here;
now remember there are four parts to the kick.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.890
The first is the chamber, so she brings the
knee up, now there’s the extension, recoil

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.470
and then you place the foot back down. Okay
that’s a sidekick. In order to get a good

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:46.190
side kick she’s got to rotate the hips,
so you’ll see she drew the leg up like a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.530
front kick at first, then recoils. Let’s
look at that one more time, notice how she

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.820
twists the hips, it looks like she’s going
to do a front kick right at you but in fact

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.489
it goes out to the side. And I’m going to
hold her here, notice how the toes are below

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.770
the heal, a lot of times we’ll see this
on side kicks, with the foot turned up like

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.409
that a lot of torque on your knee. That’s
a no-no and it doesn’t have any power. Twist

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:17.549
your hips over, that’s a side kick. Okay.
And recoil. She might slide up a little bit

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:30.490
to get some momentum that you can add to your
kick. Okay, now you can through in a spinning

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.711
side kick real quick, she’ll kick with her
rear leg. Just like on the shin kick and the

00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:39.799
round kick you must turn your front foot out;
this is a big no-no we see. People are hurting

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.359
their knees because they’re not turning
their foot out. Girls if you’re in those

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:49.009
kick boxing classes and you’re throwing
out a million reps as fast as can be, slow

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.579
down and learn to kick right. Here it is,
watch closely. She’s going to spin the foot,

00:01:52.579 --> 00:02:11.530
watch the side kick. I’m going to put her
on the heavy bag real quick. Okay, there’s

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.150
your side kick.
