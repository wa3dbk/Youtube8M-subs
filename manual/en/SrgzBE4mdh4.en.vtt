00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.970
Hi! My name is Adria and I’m one of the
professional jugglers here at expertvillage.com.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.530
This is the knife juggling video and I’m
teaching knife patterns. We’re going to

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.540
learn three knife splits, as a gentle reminder
very gentle we’re going to the bean bags

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:26.090
it’s a variation of the one up, two up combination
two are next to each other, one is separate

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.730
this would be a three ball split leading with
the right, this would be a three ball split

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.160
leading with the left. Now we’re going to
do the same thing with knife, now how does

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.200
one get started on this you ask, there’s
a slight lag time in the pattern because your

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.230
left hand is only juggling one that’s going
up, the right hand is doing two so you start

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.230
with the cascade then use the lag time, your
left hand the holds the object for a beat

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.910
while the first throw goes and then it nearly
joins the right hand throw for the outside

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.610
throw or the inside ball. We’re going to
do the same thing with knives, we’re going

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:16.820
to start with a cascade, hold the left and
there you have, that was right hand three

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:29.130
knives split, one more time starting with
the cascade, hold, three knives split and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:44.680
now a drop and now we’ll do with the left
hand and again one more time and one more

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:52.821
time without missing up, here we go, there
three knives split.
