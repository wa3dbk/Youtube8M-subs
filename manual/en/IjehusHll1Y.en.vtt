00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.310
Alright, check it out,
it's the G9x.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.430
The big brother 
to the G9.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.120
And, this brings a new engine.
The G9 was a very cool mouse.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.630
I still use it to this day,
this kind of a tough mouse to use,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.760
but once you get used to it
it is one of the best.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.600
It's probably one of the fastest
that I have ever gotten.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.730
Unfortunately now that I am crippled
I can't play as much as I used to,

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.760
or at least as fast,
and the mouse doesn't really matter,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.060
but before, when I was 
incredibly sharp and quick,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.440
the G9x was awesome, because it
 gives you that little bit of advantage.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.920
This is a new censor, goes anywhere from
200 dpi to 5,000 dpi.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.650
Which, is extremely impressive,
but not a lot of people are going

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.310
to be going above 
3,000 to 4,000 dpi.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.010
So, you might not be using as much,
but everything else is about the same,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.360
Everything, my favorite thing
about the G9x, or the G9,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.150
is that it is very customizable.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.090
You can change literally 
every aspect of it.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.730
Now, you guys already know,
that pretty much you can change your shells.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.760
So here's what it looks like
with nothing on.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.740
And, this is the regular shell.
It's called the Precision Shell, right there.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.640
And, if you want, you have
the Wide-Load Shell, right there.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.840
So you can see, there is definitely
 a difference between the two.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.380
One is thinner, 
this one has a big thumb rest,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.800
right there, where you can 
pretty much rest your thumb.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.610
Very nice. And this is Precision,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.180
so I actually use the fat grip,
but lately I've been using the thin grip,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.850
because of my injury,
so it's cool.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.090
Now, it's a very non-ambidextrous mouse.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.130
So, if you are a lefty,
don't even think about it.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.430
You will not like it.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.370
But, if you are a righty,
everything else is really cool,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.760
because it's very customizable.
So let's start with giving a brief tour

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.370
of what we've got on here.
Now, right here, you're going to see,

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.370
this is actually your indicator
of your dpi, your current dpi,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.410
so you can on-the-fly change it
from 200 to 5,000, right there.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.910
Also, this right here, is a bunch of
different colors it can light up it.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.840
It's always red factory, 
hbut it can do green, blue, orange.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.920
And, that's for switching 
through your game profiles.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.810
There's a game profile button
right there.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.520
What's cool about this mouse is that
it stores all of your game profiles,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.160
up to five of them,
on memory that is on the mouse.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.190
If you go to another computer 
you don't loose your settings.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.960
You don't have to go into Logitech
and download a program and reprogram it.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.070
It's all right there, so you just
push the button, you hold it,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.230
and you switch through 
your profiles here,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.440
and through each profile you'll 
get a different color display.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.410
So you can use blue for general gaming,
you can use green for photoshop,

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.570
you can use red for World of War Craft,
you can use orange for Counter Strike,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.620
or TF2 or whatever you want to do.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.710
It's very easy to change through those.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.750
You also have your forward and back keys
for surfing the web.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.350
You can turn those into macro buttons.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.080
Obviously they are completely programable,

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.690
you can do as many things 
as you want with these.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.390
Left and right click,
a lot of people say that

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.120
the right click on this mouse
is very sensitive,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.790
and it is.  You're going to have
to learn to keep your middle finger

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.900
a little bit above your bottom finger
so you don't touch it by accident.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.070
When your gaming you 
can push down on here,

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.370
great for crisis, to select between
your stealth modes and stuff like that.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.070
You can scroll up and down, and you have
horizontal scrolling left and right.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.780
What's really cool about this is that this 
is, let's see if you can hear regular scroll,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.320
you know, regular scroll, right?

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.620
Now say you don't like that,
and you want the really fast one.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.030
Push a button, and now it is just rolling
away, still rolling, still rolling,

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.330
still rolling, it will roll forever.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.400
So it's fully customizable, alright?

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.000
You can change the grips, alright?
You can change the scroll style.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.800
You can change the resolution,
you can change the game profiles,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.000
you can even change the weight.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.310
Like the G9 you do have a bunch of weights
between 4 and 7 grams.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.910
You can back-weight it,
front-weight it,

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.540
you can evenly weight it.
Very simple to change.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.640
Your gaming set up for very fast,
first person shooters,

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.120
I like to put about 14 grams
all the way in the front,

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.750
for everything else I like to 
keep it even across the back.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.530
So, it's really easy and it's really not hard
 to figure out what's best for you.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.800
So, experiment a little bit 
and you'll realize right away,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.730
"Hey, this is a little bit better for me."
And, if you want to know where that goes,

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.000
well it's right in here,
I'll show you.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.900
Pop that puppy off,
and then right in here,

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.970
just push down,
and it pops out,

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.710
and there's your cradle.
For four weights.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.610
So the maximum that you 
can put is 28 grams on there.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.980
So, that is plenty of weight,
going to add a lot of heft to your mouse

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.420
let's just say. And, that changes it 
from really fast to lots of precision.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.160
Now, let's talk a little bit 
about the sensor on here.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.890
It's brand new, right there, 
200 - 5,000 dpi.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.050
It does 9 megapixels/second,
which is a lot.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.710
And, it does 30G of max acceleration.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.370
Now, as far as the USB goes,
on this end,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.540
1000 MHz pulling, or reporting
depending on how you want say it.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.040
But, what that means is that
1000 times per second

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.200
the computer is sending a message
to the USB controler,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.140
and going to the mouse 
and coming back, and saying,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.180
"Hey, did something change on the mouse?
Did it move?"

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.380
So 1,000 times a second.
very very fast.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.620
Now, let's talk about life and durability.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.320
One of the specs that was listed
from Logitech that I kind of liked

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.730
was how many clicks.  This will survive
8 million clicks, which is a lot,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.590
unless you play World of War Craft,
then it's like a week.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.960
Also, the feet, which are these two big
teflon feet at the bottom,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.780
instead of having four small 
ones at each corner,

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.790
they have these two really 
wide ones on both sides.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.800
These are going to go
250 kilometers before they wear down.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.470
So that's going to last
you for quite a while.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.480
And that's pretty much it. 
But, finally I have one last thing

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.120
I want to tell you about.
If you go to the Logitech website,

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.520
they actually have a
$20 customizable grip.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.090
You can send them a picture,
you can send them a design,

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.230
and it will actually make an entire grip
with a custom surface.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.240
You can actually match it 
to a G5 grip, or whatever.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.970
Fully customizable, and you can 
put whatever you want right here.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.100
Computer TV, you can put a design,
you can put a picture of your mom,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.530
it doesn't matter.
It's up to you.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.040
So, that's a very cool way to customize it.
And, that's pretty much the last thing,

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.470
because what else are
you going to customize?

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.110
You know, weight, dpi,
gaming profiles, macro keys,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.710
resolution, scroll wheel style,
weights, I mean come on.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.780
Changing the grip. The most 
customizable mouse on the market right now,

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.460
the Logitech G9x.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.220
If you have any questions email me,
and I'll see you guys next time.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.160

Logitech G9x gaming mouse,

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.630
into the search engine of
any of these major retailers.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.630
For Computer TV,
I'm Albert.
