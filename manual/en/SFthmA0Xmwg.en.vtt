00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.160
Are you happy now?

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.820
Kang Ho Gyeong.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.310
So are you happy now that you've seen my true face?

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.410
Kang Ho Gyeong!

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.710
Why did you fix your face?

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.870
Why did you change it all?

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.840
You made my heart into a mess.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.950
And you appear in front of me in six years, looking like another person.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.160
And why did you remove that beggar-like mask and hat?

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.130
Then you...

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.770
At that time, you thought I was a man then?

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.750
If you were going to like me, you shouldn't have had plastic surgery.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.330
You should have appeared in front of me like a beggar.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.040
What?

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.320
I... I thought I was gay.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.050
Because of you, my life almost fell to ruins.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.760
And what? You can't show me your true face?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.540
Trying to hide that lame true face, you make me into a fool?

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.300
What? That lame true face?

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.920
Hey. Do you know how many hours it takes for me to get ready to meet you?

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.160
From the moment you ignored me at the bus stop that time, my pride as a woman hit rock-bottom.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.910
To hear you tell me that I'm pretty, just once, I carved and ripped my face for six years.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.660
And lived hiding my face under a disguise of makeup.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.130
But even now, even in this situation, your hurt feelings still come first, Byun Kang Chul.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.710
I didn't expect comfort from you.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.450
But I also didn't expect to get hurt again, at least.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.750
N... No, I mean...

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.840
You're pretty.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.630
Since you had plastic surgery, of course, there is improvement.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.790
Since that time, 10 times?

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.060
No, you are 15 times prettier, at least.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.670
Really, you became very pretty. At that time, I thought you were a boy.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.880
I couldn't even consider you a girl. Your face was a complete mess.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.380
So, are you a bit mollified now? Kang Ho Gyeong?

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.770
Get out.
