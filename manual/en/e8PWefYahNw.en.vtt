00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.820
Functional and stylish.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.891
Feminine and laid back.

00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:05.391
Comfortable.

00:00:05.391 --> 00:00:06.510
Cut and warm.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.540
Comfortable.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.440
Warm.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.939
Comfy.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.110
Hey guys, it's Ray from ItsMyRayeRaye.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.702
This is Pantene's "Want That Hair
USA," and we're in beautiful Colorado

00:00:19.702 --> 00:00:20.868
checking out some ski style.

00:00:25.788 --> 00:00:27.635
So are you a snowboarder or a skier?

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:28.660
I'm a snowboarder.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.610
I'm a skier.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.715
I'm a snowboarder.

00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:31.880
I'm a skier.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.950
I'm a skier.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.050
Oh, I'm a skier.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.449
I'm a snow shoer.

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.240
So how would you describe
your slope style?

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.109
I would definitely say
I like to stay warm,

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:40.900
but I like to have like
little cute things.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.983
But I try to make sure
everything kind of matches.

00:00:42.983 --> 00:00:45.502
Probably something a little
more weather resistant.

00:00:45.502 --> 00:00:46.085
Keep you warm?

00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:47.015
Yeah, definitely.

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:49.630
So I try to wear things that
are kind of feminine in colors,

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.489
but I like to be a
little masculine and fit.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.780
I don't want to wear anything too tight,
or restrictive, or anything like that.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.780
Stylish, but kind of baggy.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.740
I'm already like a tall,
slender girl as it is.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.606
So I don't like to look like Big
Bird out there on the slopes.

00:01:05.057 --> 00:01:07.120
So we know it's really
cold here and really dry.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.860
So what do you use to protect your hair?

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.660
I do some leave-in
conditioner sometimes,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.520
and I just try to avoid the blow dryer.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.524
Sometimes I'll put coconut oil in it
or use a little bit of like a serum.

00:01:16.524 --> 00:01:18.440
What I usually do is put
it in a braid so it's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.939
kind of protected from the elements.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.640
I use more oils, like argon oils.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.930
Conditioner on my ends, and
put it up in a bun when I can.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.842
But I'm kind of controlled today.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.060
So how do you handle hat hair?

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.900
Ah.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.040
Just more hats.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.040
Usually keep the hat on.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.160
Since it's Colorado you
can get away with it.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.510
Definitely have to carry a hair brush.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.360
Usually a deep conditioner
or a good hairbrush.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.420
Combs don't work that well I noticed.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.550
Usually I try to put it like in a side
braid, so that even when you take off

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.384
your hat or your helmet
it's a little messy.

00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:56.050
But you can just kind of be like,
oh, I just got off the slopes.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.440
You know, it's supposed
to look like this.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.730
So what are some of your
winter rescue beauty tips?

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.439
I like to use kind of a
bomb to put on cracked lips

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.230
or around my face when I know I'm
going to be in the wind for sure.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.980
Lotion.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.597
Just anything to keep your
skin from getting too dry.

00:02:09.597 --> 00:02:12.680
Sunscreen for your face, because you
don't know you're going to get burnt,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.670
but you usually do.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.820
I use a lot of coconut
oil, and a lot of lip bomb,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.410
and put it basically all over.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.560
It's really dry out here.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.440
All over?

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.685
Pretty much.

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:24.560
So when you've been out
on the slope all day,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.370
how do you transition your
lip from day to night?

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.120
I usually wash my face to wake
myself up with some cold water,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.270
and then put on some mascara, maybe
some lip gloss, or a stain, or something

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.770
like that.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.068
I make sure that I put on make-up,
and some actually girly clothes,

00:02:37.068 --> 00:02:39.020
so I don't look like a boy all day.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.834
I'll curl it, or I'll put a
little bit more effort into it,

00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:44.500
like some hairspray to make sure
it's not going all over my face

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.350
like it is today.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.620
Sometimes I'll curl my hair a little
bit, put on different clothes,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.160
take a shower.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.975
In that order?

00:02:52.975 --> 00:02:53.800
In that order.

00:02:58.142 --> 00:03:00.100
So what's the best part
of being in a ski town?

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.730
Well, it's so beautiful here.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.560
The mountains are like hanging over us.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.160
It's gorgeous.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.368
And there are a lot of really
cute snowboarding guys.

00:03:06.368 --> 00:03:07.120
Oh.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.510
Definitely just all the people.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.220
We have the coolest community here.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.720
The people.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.180
Everybody's super nice.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.390
Everybody's super chill.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.675
It's just a great atmosphere.

00:03:14.675 --> 00:03:16.180
It's a great lifestyle.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.679
It's really quiet, but it's also nice
because you can go out, and kind of get

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.970
your own space, and do your
own thing, but be athletic.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.779
You're never too far from the slopes.

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.570
You always get up to
the mountains quickly.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.760
Here I can go up, and I can exercise,
and have a great time with my friends,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.425
and even go out on the town after
a great day on the mountain.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.210
Thank you for joining me and Pantene
for "Want That Hair USA Colorado."

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.140
I met some awesome people today.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.950
I think I'm ready to hit the slopes.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.540
