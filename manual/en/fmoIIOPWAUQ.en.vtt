Libby: I'm Libby Klingsmith,
the coordinator of

00:00:02.037 --> 00:00:03.409
First Year Experience and Transitions

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:05.704
at the Community College of Aurora.

00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:07.496
The Community College
is a great place to get

00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:10.667
started on your road
to a bachelor's degree.

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:12.955
This past Spring the
Community College of Aurora

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:15.954
took students to three 4-year institutions

00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:18.006
in the state of Colorado.

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:19.371
Colorado State University,

00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:20.871
University of Northern Colorado

00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:23.093
and University of Denver.

00:00:23.093 --> 00:00:25.888
CCA had not done that
before and we thought

00:00:25.888 --> 00:00:28.371
it would be a great way
to get students onto

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:30.685
campus and really experience what it would

00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:33.980
be like to transfer to
a 4 year institution.

00:00:38.575 --> 00:00:40.775
Girl: The main thing that
I want to take away from

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:42.736
this trip is just want
college maybe I fit into

00:00:42.736 --> 00:00:46.694
and maybe more about the financial aspect

00:00:46.694 --> 00:00:49.027
and what I can afford and everything.

00:00:49.027 --> 00:00:51.245
So I'm excited for sure.

00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:53.777
Boy: I would like to
transfer to CSU to earn

00:00:53.777 --> 00:00:55.331
my bachelor's degree in business

00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:59.194
just to get better information,
get a better feel for it

00:00:59.194 --> 00:01:02.380
and basically get a general
understanding of what

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.694
I'm getting myself into
before I get there.

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:07.194
Girl: CCA has been preparing me a lot.

00:01:07.194 --> 00:01:09.694
I go in there all the time
with tons of questions

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:12.695
you know, when is the right
time to turn in my application?

00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:14.310
When do I need to do this?

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.060
When do I need to do that?

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.730
and they're always there and willing to

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.443
give me some paperwork or

00:01:20.443 --> 00:01:22.316
give me a site or give
me some phone numbers

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:27.489
just to take me to the
next step and send me off.

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:34.828
(music)

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:37.611
Libby: This was the first
time that CCA took students

00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:40.193
to other college campuses to get a feel

00:01:40.193 --> 00:01:43.610
for being at a 4 year University.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.508
We're really working to
extend our offerings to

00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:49.720
students around transfer programming

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.931
and help students really
understand what it means

00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:55.850
to transfer and what it
looks like to get onto

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.360
a college campus and
so visiting the 4 year

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.028
institutions was our
way of helping students

00:02:02.028 --> 00:02:03.982
begin to see what kinds of options

00:02:03.982 --> 00:02:06.944
exist out there for them as they consider

00:02:06.944 --> 00:02:09.862
completing their bachelor's degree.
