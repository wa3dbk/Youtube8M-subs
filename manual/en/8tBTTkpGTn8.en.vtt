00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:16.230
i'm aaron bragman for pickup trucks .
com heavy-duty pickup trucks used to be

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.850
brutish that used to be uncomfortable
these days not the same story

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.850
everyone has their favorite things about
pickup trucks but here are the five

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.470
things that we love the most about these
big trucks the cargo box camera in the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.050
ram 3500 one of our favorite features is
the cargo box camera in the ram 3500

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.489
it's activated using the touchscreen
here and it makes hooking up a trailer

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.890
like a fifth wheel or gooseneck
absolutely simple the adjustable exhaust

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.300
brake on the ram 3500 one of our
favorite features is the adjustable

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.679
exhaust brake on the ram 3500 diesel
most diesel trucks have something like

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.280
this which enables you to coast down
while towing something using the engine

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.550
to break the vehicle instead of the
actual breaks it can save your breaks

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.190
over a long steep descent the ram has a
two-position adjustable exhaust brake

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.230
off is the normal off position but you
can also press it once for full-on it's

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.560
the most aggressive exhaust brake it'll
happen whenever you let off the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.940
accelerator but it also has another
position which is automatic and

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.090
automatic kind of senses when you need
it and when you don't

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.870
it's not as aggressive it's easier to
drive with a little bit smoother either

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.460
way it's really one of our favorite
features the power folding extending

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.500
mirrors in the ford f250 yes these are
work trucks but you know what we are in

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.020
favor of anything that makes us do less
work and the power folding adjustable

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.580
extending mirrors and the ford f250 are
really one of our favorite features for

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.660
the touch of a button

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.650
you're ready to trailer the quietness of
the GMC sierra 3500 one of the things

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.320
that's really struck us in this test is
how quiet the GMC sierra 3500 is doesn't

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.890
matter if you're under full acceleration
if you're cruising on the highway towing

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.150
a heavy load if you're coasting down
with the exhaust brake going it's really

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.209
serene it's really calm it's really
impressive

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.890
they've done a really good job making
this a really pleasant environment for

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.870
everyone in the cab

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.200
the remote ram box and tailgate lock on
the ram 2500 pickup truck owners often

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.370
have a lot of expensive gear and
equipment and the ability to keep it all

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.890
safe and secure is extremely important

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.430
that's why one of our favorite features
is the remote locking feature for both

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.950
the ram box and the tailgate on the ram
2500 using the remote key fob 1-click

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.950
locks everything

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.180
