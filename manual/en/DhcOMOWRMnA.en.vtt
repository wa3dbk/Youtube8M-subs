00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.290
My name is Palmer Luckey and I’m a virtual
reality enthusiast and the designer of the

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.400
Rift.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.590
Games are something I’m really passionate
about and even more than playing games I’m

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.099
passionate about bringing games to the next
level.

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.579
What we’re doing at Oculus is trying to
create the world’s best virtual reality

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.989
headset designed very specifically for gaming.

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.969
Where this all started was in my parent’s
garage in Long Beach, California.

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.160
And I was interested stereoscopic displays,
I was interested in head mounts, and the problem

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.969
was there was nothing that gave me the experience
I wanted, the Matrix, where I could plugin

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.329
and actually be in the game.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.390
And I was sure that somewhere out there was
something I could buy, and the reality is

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.499
there’s nothing.

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:56.390
I set out to change that with the Oculus Rift.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.499
The magic that sets the Rift apart is immersive
stereoscopic 3d rendering, a massive field

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.769
of view, and ultra-low latency head tracking.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.010
John Carmack is one of the best developers
in the world.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.130
DOOM, Quake, Commander Keen...

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:26.090
Carmack saw some of my work, that’s originally
when he reached out 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.090
to me.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.790
We’re getting involved in Oculus now because
we see an incredible opportunity for game

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.790
developers to experience something new.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.760
The Rift is taking years of virtual reality
research and putting it into a package that

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.680
everyone can use.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.180
So I recently had a chance in person to check
out the Oculus headset and needless to say,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.730
I’m a believer.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.780
Even as a prototype, what I saw was extremely
promising we’re extremely excited here at

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.450
Epic Games to get the Unreal Engine integrated
with Oculus and I think the possibilities

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.750
for the games are extremely exciting and I’m
thrilled for the whole project.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.730
Well I gotta say I just tried the Oculus prototype
and it was such an immersive, amazing experience,

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.430
that we pretty quickly, like within an hour,
decided to get behind this project.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.060
I got to meet Palmer Luckey and try out the
Oculus and I have to say it was a very exciting

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.060
moment.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.000
Could be the beginning of a whole new industry
that leads us eventually to having true augmentation,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.940
all the time, every place.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.329
I’m really looking forward to having a chance
to program with it and to see what we can

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.329
do.

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:23.530
It looks incredibly exciting.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.450
If anyone is going to tackle these set hard
problems, we think that Palmer is going to

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.510
do it.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.359
We’d strongly encourage you to support this
Kickstarter.

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.890
In the past I’ve looked at these headsets
and head mounted displays, and this was the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.620
first one that I was truly impressed with.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.270
There’s a lot of great head mounted displays
out there, but they’re all really, really

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.999
expensive, up to over $100,000.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:50.959
What the Rift does, is that it makes a high
end virtual reality experience available to

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.880
the average gamer.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.140
So most consumer head mounted displays have
a field of view of about 30 to 40 degrees.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.239
You see a really small image way off in the
distance and it doesn’t make you feel like

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.390
you’re there.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.130
With the Oculus Rift, you get a diagonal field
of view of 110 degrees.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.519
That means you’re not looking at a screen
anymore, you actually feel like you’re inside

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.519
of the world.

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.200
You don’t see the screen when you put it
on your eyes, and that just changes the whole

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.639
ball game.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.959
One of the biggest problems with virtual reality
up to this point is latency.

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.010
The benefit of the Rift is that it’s designed
to really, really low latency.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.519
So rather than looking like this, and you
turn your head and then it follows; it actually

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.180
follows with your view no matter what you
do.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.400
There are two reasons why this is possible
now with Oculus is that the displays are very

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.060
high density and very lightweight and are
very small and the sensors that sense your

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.010
head position and your turning in your virtual
environment are also very low cost.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.730
The reason we’re using Kickstarter is so
that we can get these dev kits into the hands

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.659
of developers as fast as possible.

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.599
That way they can try it for themselves, and
start integrating support into their games

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:00.810
and engines.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.819
We really need developer feedback so we can
make the consumer version even more incredible

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.389
than it already is

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:14.809
A great SDK is about a great developer experience
where they get a really functional piece of

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:18.070
software which is efficient and scales with
their needs.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.980
So for indie developers, doing this Kickstarter,
really getting it out there early not waiting

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.060
until we have a consumer version, allows them
to get started as well.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.790
If you want to be one of the first to try
the Rift, grab a dev kit.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.669
We’ll provide access to our SDK, Unreal
and Unity engine integrations and DOOM 3 BFG

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.340
Edition, the first Oculus-ready game.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.379
So join the revolution, make a pledge, and
help us change gaming forever.
