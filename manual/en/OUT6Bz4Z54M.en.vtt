00:00:02.373 --> 00:00:07.922
Here everything is very slow...
Except the speed, everything else is slow

00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:16.277
For example, you can't refuel on the track,
and the car consumption is very high

00:00:16.277 --> 00:00:30.488
So you put 100 lt, come to the track, drive 8 laps,
go back there, 
 put more fuel, drive 8 laps, go back,
and you lose the patience

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:37.245
Because every time you go out, you lose
2 laps to warm up, the 
 third is not fast,
when you're fast on the 4th lap, yellow flag!

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:40.123
A bird shit on the track

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:43.098
Some paper was flying, somebody farted...

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.625
And there goes your 8 laps, so you go 
 back
to refuel, warm-up...that's at least half hour

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:59.449
You go back, does it all again, and when you're
going for 
 a good lap, yellow flag! And it's the whole day!

00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:04.469
It's hard to get a good lap here!
But that's part of the game

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:08.917
And I think what I'm learning the 
most here is to have patience!

00:01:08.917 --> 00:01:15.165
So, let's see. I guess things will go 
better on Saturday.

00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:19.041
I think on the race things I will do better

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:04.490
Down, and all movements up with no problem

00:02:04.492 --> 00:02:12.610
The right leg, I had a lot of fractures,
but all 
 in large bones, in easy to recover places

00:02:12.614 --> 00:02:22.250
There were a lot of surgeries, but I had no 
 problem,
well, I lost the end of a toe

00:02:22.247 --> 00:02:26.630
"You won't miss it..."
No, it's one nail less to clip

00:02:26.626 --> 00:02:29.600
Not much of a trouble

00:02:30.704 --> 00:02:36.560
The left foot is another story...
I had dozens of fractures

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:44.240
In all the foot bones, except the toes.
Before the toes, everything is broken

00:02:44.235 --> 00:02:49.860
That was all recovered, all full of screws

00:02:49.862 --> 00:02:53.010
And there's the possibility of having all 
movements back

00:02:53.846 --> 00:03:01.370
"What about those bigger marks? "
Well, that's skin, the guys 
 take from here 
to put where is needed

00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:05.710
"Take this square and put it..."

00:03:05.713 --> 00:03:07.490
"Do you still feel pain?"

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:18.320
Well... the pain is... it's calculated here
by the amount of drugs I take

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.040
Each time I goes through longer periods,
take less drugs, and the pain grows

00:03:25.045 --> 00:03:33.470
And that's progressive. If I stop now, I 
will die of 
 pain. I have to take them for at least
2 months

00:03:33.468 --> 00:03:36.010
"And the mind, is OK?"

00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:48.280
Well, besides the other day, when
 I woke up upset, 
 I never gave up, 
I always had will power

00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:53.600
What happened, happened after 20 years... 
13 years of 
 F1. I knew it could happen one day

00:03:59.955 --> 00:04:05.440
The computer says I took the foot out,
and then 1,5 sec later I corrected

00:04:05.435 --> 00:04:11.760
I probabily took the foot out, entered into the corner, 
 
and then lost it, and then corrected the steering

00:04:11.758 --> 00:04:14.460
"Do you believe in signs? "

00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:18.410
Before I came here, I was very afraid
 of suffering an accident

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:26.270
And... everybody that ... that thinks can read the future

00:04:26.271 --> 00:04:30.280
I talked to a lot of people, and 
 everybody was like:
"No, no, nothing will happen"

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.370
And actually, before coming here,
I got a good accident 
 insurance, because I was very afraid
of something happening

00:04:37.368 --> 00:04:41.320
I was expecting something to happen...
It did

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:44.460
"But it was a challenge you wanted?"

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:53.380
Well, that's... A lot of F1 races I had a 
 feeling
that something would happen, but never stopped racing

00:04:53.385 --> 00:05:02.320
I never stopped risking. Because... it's my life,
my work, 
 and you've got to do your best

00:05:02.984 --> 00:05:04.890
"When and how do you think in God? "

00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:14.490
That's a hard question, I think...
I think we all 
 think about God when things are bad

00:05:14.488 --> 00:05:17.900
When all goes well, nobody thinks about God

00:05:34.283 --> 00:05:37.790
After racing so much, Nelson Piquet 
had to go back to school

00:05:37.792 --> 00:05:42.880
Within a year, he reached his 20 points 
 quota
(20 points of  infractions)
in his license

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:51.500
With a lot of infractions due to
speed excess and parking 
 in forbiden places,
the former F1 driver lost his license

00:05:51.536 --> 00:05:57.890
To recover it, and be able to drive again,
he must 
 go through 30 hours of class in 8 days

00:05:57.893 --> 00:06:02.570
And also do a test, as the Law says

00:06:02.573 --> 00:06:07.750
The notorious student sat on first row,
and tried to justify himself

00:06:07.754 --> 00:06:12.300
There's a lot of variation of speed limits,
it's 80km/h 
 in a place, 60 in another, 50

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:19.340
So, you're distracted, you just goes through and...
and your 20 points go pretty fast

00:06:19.344 --> 00:06:23.240
Nelson's wife, Vivianne, was there 
for the same reason

00:06:24.238 --> 00:06:26.210
And learned a lesson on the first day

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:37.650
Brasilia has this thing of large streets,
but we have to view it as a 
 way to a better traffic,
and not that thing of going too fast

00:06:37.648 --> 00:06:41.790
The champion also promised to be
a good student

00:06:41.793 --> 00:06:50.220
I have almost 40 years of driving,
so, I drove across the 
 world, but...
that which Brazil is doing I think is right
