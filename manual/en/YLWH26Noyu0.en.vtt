[music]

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.780
-[Curtis Smith] We're back, and Sid Gillson is showing us how he builds his

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.660
innovative underground irrigation system. Sid is this how you do it? Only a few inches deep?

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.529
-[Sid Gillson] Yes, about five inches deep, and it's a simple matter of digging this trench.

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.730
Then we lay the pipe, and attach it at
both ends with these anchors that we've designed.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.970
In order to hold the pipe nice
and straight, and get a straight line.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.180
-[Curtis] Okay. Anything else you do here to make sure everything is adjusted right?

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.680
-[Sid] Well what we need to do is take this and tighten it up good.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.000
Be sure that the holes in the pipe, which are located every six inches and about sixteenth inch in diameter,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.600
attach it here so
it's good and tight.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.100
Then we pull this block down and anchor this with the rebar.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.780
Of course if we have a much longer line, up to thirty-three feet long, you can use this system.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.280
This is very important because the hose tends to snake, so we get it anchored in real good.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.960
Then we take our water, and run our water through the hose, and test to see if any of the holes are clogged.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.190
Now the
water usually comes up about six inches.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.600
I'm sure as soon as the air is out
of our hose here, we'll see the water coming up.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.480
Then we take a deck screw.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.860
If any of these holes are plugged up, which they might be with debris,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.120
we take and put it in, and clean out that little hole with our deck screw and unclog it.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.940
After everything is going
and the water's running fine,

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.380
then we cover it very gently while the water is running, so that we again we don't clog it up.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.880
-[Curtis] If you were to try and push the
soil back when it's not running, you could fill the holes.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.320
-[Sid] That's right. And we cover that up and leave the water running.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.660
Then as soon as we have it all covered, we go ahead and turn the water off, dig our trench,

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.820
and plant our seeds so they fertile.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.340
-[Curtis] Well that's pretty fancy. I notice this fancy manifold system here. This looks pretty complicated.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.500
-[Sid] It's really not. Anybody that
can attach a hose to a house faucet can

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.240
run one of these systems, and it's very
inexpensive.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.520
-[Curtis] Can you show us how to do that?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.660
-[Sid] I'd be glad to do that.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.180
-[Curtis] Let's go take a look.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.020
Sid this looks like a very interesting
workbench you've got here.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.380
-[Sid] Yes these are all the elements we need to set up our
system, and it's relatively simple.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.160
First, we start with a 3/4 by 1/2 inch flip
joint, with a half inch exit on one end.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.560
And then we screw in this short plastic
nipple.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.940
Then we take a PC valve, half inch PC valve, and attach that on.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.500
-[Curtis] That's a ball valve.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.460
So that's better than some of the gate valves which tend to get stuck on us.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.000
-[Sid] Right, and this doesn't corrode. And then to that we take an adapter that we can hook to our hose.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.660
Half-inch again. Whoops that jumped out of my hand.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.819
And then we can screw that in.

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.640
-[Curtis] Nothing hard yet.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.800
-[Sid] Nothing hard to that.
Anybody can do that.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.500
Then what we need to do is hook this up to our mainline.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.200
To do that, we take out the gasket, we take our 3/4 inch PVC pipe.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.320
-[Curtis] It may be a lot longer than that.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.720
-[Sid] Put that in, screw that on,
and tighten that up with our hands.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.640
We've got a real tight connection with a
low pressure that we use.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.840
Then of course we do the other end. And this has got a plug on the end if you want to use a plug.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.180
But if not, we can just go ahead and add a longer piece of pipe that would hook on other places.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.680
Now when we come off here, we want to hook up to our rows, underground rows.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.220
So we take a piece of black hose, scrimp that all up real tight up there agains that.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.480
And then we
may want to run a tee off it.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.900
So we could take a tee, and also insert that and go off into four or five rows.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.420
However, we can also take a half inch diameter green hose and slide that in.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.380
The exterior of that is half inch. So these are all the different kinds of combinations we can use.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.129
Of course, this is a corner piece that we could put on here

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.400
to line up our our corners and all kinds
of combinations.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.960
It takes a little push, but it goes in quite easily.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.640
-[Curtis] Those barbs hold it pretty well then.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:22.020
-[Sid] Sometimes it's hard to pull off by hand. But if you take your pliers a firm grasp and pull it off,

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.660
it comes off quite easily

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.000
-[Curtis] So you
can fix mistakes.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.980
-[Sid] You can adapt it each year to different hoses that you might need.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.680
-[Curtis] Okay. So then how hard is it to cut this tubing?

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.080
-[Sid] It's not hard at all.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.540
This is your standard cutter. And for an example, we can you cut the PVC very easily with that.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.200
It's sure a lot better than using a
saw.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.160
And see how easily that snips off?

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.300
-[Curtis] Good straight cut.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.620
-[Sid] And then of course, we
can do it with our black hose the same way

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.300
and the same way with our green hose. And it cuts very easily to any dimensions that we would need.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.020
-[Curtis] Anyone
could do this then.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.200
-[Sid] Yes.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.340
-[Curtis] Sid, thank you for showing this. It's a simple system, but it's also very innovative.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.860
And you can do it too.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.100
-[Sid] Very good. You're welcome.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.259
