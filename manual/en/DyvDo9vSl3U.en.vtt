00:00:00.415 --> 00:00:04.223
- [Elsa] What a beautiful
day for a walk in the park.

00:00:04.223 --> 00:00:07.997
Maybe I'll see bunny rabbits and birds.

00:00:07.997 --> 00:00:11.380
- [Jack] Hey Olaf, let's
play a prank on Elsa.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.283
- [Olaf] Yeah I like pranks.

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:15.845
What kind of prank are we
going to play Mr. Jack Frost?

00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:17.409
- [Jack] I'm gonna climb
to the top of the tree

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:20.282
and drop slime on Elsa when she walks by.

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:23.453
- [Olaf] That's kinda mean
Jack, you know to slime

00:00:23.453 --> 00:00:26.659
Elsa when she's not knowing
it's gonna come or anything.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:27.492
- [Jack] I know.

00:00:27.492 --> 00:00:28.754
It's gonna be great.

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:31.295
We're gonna use a special gold slime.

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:32.764
It's gonna be great.

00:00:32.764 --> 00:00:37.635
- [Elsa] There's beautiful
trees I'm walking under.

00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:39.235
Who slimed me?

00:00:39.235 --> 00:00:40.345
Yuck!

00:00:40.345 --> 00:00:43.100
- [Jack] Haha Elsa, we
got you really good!

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.970
I slimed you from the top of the tree.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.245
(laughing)

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:48.908
- [Elsa] Oh Jack, if you slime me again

00:00:48.908 --> 00:00:52.033
I'll slime you a hundred times.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:54.118
- [Jack] Ha Elsa, I got you really good.

00:00:54.118 --> 00:00:57.118
Just face it, I slimed you ha ha ha.

00:00:58.317 --> 00:00:59.984
I slimed Elsa ha ha.

00:01:01.724 --> 00:01:03.653
You won't ever get me back.

00:01:03.653 --> 00:01:05.047
- [Elsa] I need to take a bath,

00:01:05.047 --> 00:01:07.297
so I can get this slime off me.

00:01:07.297 --> 00:01:09.135
My tub is almost ready.

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:11.134
- [Jack] Olaf look at
this, we're gonna replace

00:01:11.134 --> 00:01:14.051
Elsa's water with this green slime.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.661
She won't even know the difference.

00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:19.923
(evil laughing)

00:01:19.923 --> 00:01:21.673
- [Olaf] Remember Jack,
she said if you slimed her

00:01:21.673 --> 00:01:24.649
again, she was gonna slime
you like a hundred times.

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.307
Do you think this is a good idea?

00:01:26.307 --> 00:01:28.584
- [Jack] Oh Elsa will never slime me.

00:01:28.584 --> 00:01:30.342
(evil laughing)

00:01:30.342 --> 00:01:34.509
I'm gonna pour this green
slime in the tub right now.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.052
(evil laughing)

00:01:37.052 --> 00:01:39.738
- [Elsa] Time for my tub.

00:01:39.738 --> 00:01:43.905
Hey wait a minute, hey I'm
taking a bath in slime.

00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:47.253
I'm gonna get that Jack Frost.

00:01:47.253 --> 00:01:48.776
This means war.

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:50.798
- [Olaf] Jack, you really got Elsa.

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:52.424
- [Jack] Oh I know I did.

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:56.175
Ha, we gotta think of the next
joke we're gonna do on Elsa.

00:01:56.175 --> 00:01:58.351
- [Olaf] Uh Jack, I really
think that you probably should

00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:01.714
stop teasing Elsa because she's
gonna get like really mad.

00:02:01.714 --> 00:02:05.161
- [Jack] Let her, because
I will always get her back.

00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:08.075
- [Elsa] Oh that Jack,
I got a plan for him.

00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:10.743
I'm gonna make Jack a special pie.

00:02:10.743 --> 00:02:13.396
Just wait until he tries to eat it.

00:02:13.396 --> 00:02:14.941
(laughing)

00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:16.253
Hi Jack.

00:02:16.253 --> 00:02:17.792
- [Jack] Hey Elsa, how are you doing?

00:02:17.792 --> 00:02:19.610
- [Elsa] I'm doing great.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.081
You know what?

00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:25.857
I had no hard feelings because
I made you a cherry pie.

00:02:25.857 --> 00:02:26.800
- [Jack] Really Elsa?

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.075
I thought you'd be mad after all

00:02:28.075 --> 00:02:30.074
these pranks I played on you.

00:02:30.074 --> 00:02:32.004
- [Elsa] Oh no, not me.

00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:33.076
(chuckling)

00:02:33.076 --> 00:02:34.455
So there you go.

00:02:34.455 --> 00:02:37.706
- [Jack] Hey Elsa, do you
wanna stay and eat it with us?

00:02:37.706 --> 00:02:40.094
- [Elsa] Oh no, I got work to do.

00:02:40.094 --> 00:02:41.498
- [Olaf] Jack, do you really think

00:02:41.498 --> 00:02:42.934
it's a good idea to eat that pie?

00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:45.075
- [Jack] Of course Olaf.

00:02:45.075 --> 00:02:48.256
She wants to give us a peace offering,

00:02:48.256 --> 00:02:50.347
so that we don't prank her anymore.

00:02:50.347 --> 00:02:52.872
But it's not gonna work because
I'm gonna keep pranking her.

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:53.924
(evil laughing)

00:02:53.924 --> 00:02:58.201
- [Elsa] Wait 'til Jack
eats that exploding pie.

00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:00.734
(chuckling)

00:03:00.734 --> 00:03:02.195
- [Jack] Well I don't know about you Olaf,

00:03:02.195 --> 00:03:05.319
but I'm gonna eat it right now.

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.036
- [Olaf] Okay Jack, but
you think it's a good idea?

00:03:08.036 --> 00:03:10.525
- [Jack] Boy do I ever
think it's a good idea.

00:03:10.525 --> 00:03:11.358
Yummy!

00:03:12.503 --> 00:03:13.420
Oh no Olaf!

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:17.711
It was an exploding, goo pie!

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.507
Oh yuck, I've been goo-ed.

00:03:23.608 --> 00:03:25.025
Elsa got me back.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.733
- [Olaf] And I was just
an innocent bystander.

00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:33.290
No more pranks Jack Frost.

00:03:34.676 --> 00:03:38.117
- [Elsa] I've only just
begun to get you back.

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:39.450
