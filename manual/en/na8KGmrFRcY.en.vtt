Hi, I'm Tricia, a California organic gardener.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.640
Starting my day with homemade bread from homegrown grains with homemade preserves

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.839
gives me the
energy I need to garden all day long!

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.799
Growing your own grains is not as hard
as you may think, I'll show you how!

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.620
Most people associate growing grains with big huge farms like you see in the Midwest and tall silos,

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.560
but actually you can
grow grains right in your own backyard!

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.990
If you're gonna grow grains you have to be
committed.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.540
You can start small. I'm just going to use a ten by ten plot,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.020
but you'll have to be available for the harvesting, the winnowing, the hulling and the threshing of your crop.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.010
Do yourself a favor and get this book
"Homegrown Whole Grains" by Sara Pitzer,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.550
it'll tell you everything you need to
know to successfully grow grains.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.940
Some varieties of barley and oats have hulls that are hard to remove.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.949
To make your harvest easier, choose loose-hulled or hulless varieties

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.789
like the ones that are available at Peaceful Valley.

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:07.600
You want to start with the soil test.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.540
You want a balanced fertility in your soil, unless you're growing corn, and then you want some high nitrogen.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.880
Dig in necessary amendments while loosening the soil using a rototiller or a broadfork.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.120
Just rake the soil smooth and then you're ready to plant.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:29.920
For fall planted grains like barley, oats, and wheat, you want to plant about 8-12 weeks before the first frost.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:38.080
For some grains, like wheat, you can plant in a big block, other grains you might want to plant in a row.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:51.190
For block planting I just hand broadcast or use a rotary spreader to get even coverage over the whole 10x10 area I've prepared.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.740
You just want to rake the seed in - it's really important for seed-to-soil contact

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.130
that you rake it in about a half an inch to an inch deep.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.860
Now you want to stamp down on the soil with either a lawn roller or a board.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.489
Be sure and water your grains about one
inch every week,

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.940
that's about one to two hours of
overhead watering per week,

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.180
until the rains come.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.600
There is a word of warning,
however, about growing your own grains.

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:24.459
Ergot is a fungus of cereals that is
toxic to humans and animals.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.309
If you see dark purple black things,
about the size of a grain,

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:33.749
do not need eat the grain and do not allow
any livestock to eat it either.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.740
You can turn your home grown grains into flour by using this grain mill.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.860
A 10x10 plot will yield about up to ninety cups of flour,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.640
which is as much as you'd need for half a year's worth of bread.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.700
So grow your grains, and Grow Organic for Life!
