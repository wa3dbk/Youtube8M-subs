00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:07.919
What's going on YouTube? I'm Scott from Scotthermanfitness.com now

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.619
I want to show you guys an easier way if you're doing overhead tricep extensions, and you need to get a bigger way up

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.809
But you don't want to waste energy first

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.868
let's start with a small weight now overhead tricep extension is

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.069
You take the dumbbell now most people will do is they'll pick up the dumbbells

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.750
put it on their knee they'll sit down and they'll either rock it up like this

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.769
Or they'll pick it up like that put it on their shoulder

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.680
Readjust your hands and then pick it up and then start from the exercise like this

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.680
now if you're going to do heavier weight

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.690
It's not that easy to bring it up from here to here and like I said you don't want to waste the energy

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.590
So what you're going to do

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.390
is

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.070
Get your bigger weight

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.070
Put it on the floor

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.799
put your feet off to the side bend your knees

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.620
You're gonna grab it like this okay? So both hands you're going to swing it up on your shoulder

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.609
Just like that now hold it tight come over to your seat sit down put your feet up

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.429
Adjust your hands, and you can actually push up with your shoulder and hand at the same time

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.840
Now you have a bigger weight up keep it facing forward and then do your set

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.119
Then when you want to bring it down me

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.470
boom

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.130
For more information keep watching my videos at Scotthermanfitness.com be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.149
More stuff coming soon later guys, so after I replayed the clip that I just made for you guys I realized that

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.969
that's the way I do it but some of you might smash yourself in a not so fun place if you tried that way, so

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.250
When you bring the weight down like this

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.029
You don't have to swing through your legs you can actually just kind of throw it off to the side

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.689
It might make a little bit of noise. It's a bigger weight who cares but try it that way. Later guys
