This is Vicki Walker for Expert Village. We
are assembling a backpack, we have assemble

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.759
a backpack for today for a little girl and
we are sewing the front to the back now. I

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.250
have pinned the front pieces, the front piece
to the back piece. We are ready to sew the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:24.420
side seam. 5/8 of a inch from the side. Actually
we have to start at the very top because of

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:39.039
the way of the casing was made. Tapering off
to the 5/8 seam all the way to the outside

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:45.960
edge. When I get near the bottom I'm going
to be very careful cause the D ring has been

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.890
based into the seam that we have assemble
in our former clip. I wan to make sure that

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.249
I don't run over my D ring and break my needle.
I'm cautious in that area. I'm also going

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:00.940
to reinforce it because that is where a lot
to the wear and tears are going to be once

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.751
the drawstring is applied. I don't want the
draw string breaking on this little sweet

00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:11.050
little girl that would be using this backpack.
At the corner I just lift the pressure foot

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:26.610
and turn and reinforce that corner to. Continue
all the way around the 5/8 seam. I'm just

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.670
about to reach the D ring so I would slow
down a little bit. Move it out of the way

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:55.850
underneath. Reinforce that corner. We are
just about finish, let's finish out this side.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:09.450
Tapering up to the very top edge near the
casing.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:19.530
That completes sewing the outside edge on
the front to the back of our backpack.
