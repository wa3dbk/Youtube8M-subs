00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.380
&lt;For Ye Sheng&gt;

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.660
&lt;Nichkhun is on the move!&gt;

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.980
&lt;Nichkhun sees Ye Sheng who just finished practice&gt;

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.380
Ye Sheng!

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.900
&lt;Nichkhun suddenly appears, Ye Sheng is baffled&gt;

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.140
Where are you going?

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.075
I'm walking

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.160
&lt;Takes Ye Sheng along with him&gt;

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.920
&lt;Where are they going?&gt;

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.649
Sit, sit

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.620
&lt;Ye Sheng is very curious about Khun's actions&gt;

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.040
Where are we going?

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.295
We are going to eat

00:00:50.295 --> 00:00:51.940
Something that you can eat

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.574
You can eat it

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:55.494
&lt;The start of the plan to increase Ye Sheng's weight&gt;

00:00:55.494 --> 00:00:57.054
&lt;For Ye Sheng who usually starve during meal time&gt; (due to religious matter, he can't consume particular food)

00:00:57.054 --> 00:00:57.875
There's a lot of food to eat

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.340
&lt;The dinner that Nichkhun prepared for Ye Sheng&gt;

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:03.625
Headache!

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.480
What's wrong?

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.360
My Chinese is not good. Headache

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.340
I feel, I feel, I feel.... headache &lt;aegyo&gt;

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.934
&lt;You should be laughing now right?&gt;

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.060
&lt;No response at all&gt;

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.860
&lt;So awkward, what should I do....&gt;

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.440
&lt;I should do something!&gt;

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.400
Do you know who I am?

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.300
Of course I know

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.869
You know who I am?

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:32.940
Tell me

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.560
&lt;Simply awkward&gt;

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.620
I am...

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.595
 You sing

00:01:37.595 --> 00:01:39.320
Sing? You do know

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.020
&lt;The question has been asked, and the answer received....&gt;

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.800
&lt;Back to silence once again&gt;

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.820
&lt;Need to find another topic&gt;

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.640
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.920
Not as of now

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.020
When was your last girlfriend?

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.680
&lt;They are not that close, yet Nichkhun asked such a sensitive question...&gt;

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.360
&lt;The atmosphere is a bit awkward, let's show some aegyo first&gt;

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.080
&lt;A relieve it wasn't too awkward&gt;

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.994
I don't know

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.240
When did it finish? (break up)

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.640
&lt;Taking the chance to ask again&gt;

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.020
&lt;Could only laugh...&gt;

00:02:11.955 --> 00:02:13.955
&lt;A questions that gone to waste....&gt;

00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:15.528
&lt;Even more awkward now...&gt;

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.220
&lt;How much longer till we get there?&gt;

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.360
&lt;It's so awkward, what should I do...&gt;

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.320
You know how to speak this? (Kazakhstan language)

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.540
&lt;Ye Sheng is suddenly interested&gt;

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.520
My ethic is Kazakhstan, I do know the language

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.580
How do you say "I Love You"?

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.300
&lt;Ye Sheng is very satisfied&gt;

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.160
&lt;The exchange in language cause the both of them to become closer&gt;

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.793
You're really smart

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:41.465
No it's too hard

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.500
Do you want to get married?

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.716
&lt;Doesn't avoid anything now and starts asking about personal matters&gt;

00:02:47.716 --> 00:02:48.913
You don't want to?

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.580
&lt;Not sure when, Nichkhun's fans spotted him&gt;

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.640
&lt;The atmosphere becomes awkward&gt;

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.820
&lt;Fans that are rushing up like a swarm of bees&gt;

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.600
&lt;Immediately, the two of them are surrounded by fans&gt;

00:03:04.714 --> 00:03:06.714
&lt;It's really Nichkhun!&gt;

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.300
&lt;Fan meeting&gt;

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.580
Is he handsome?

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.955
&lt;Why are you asking this?&gt;

00:03:19.955 --> 00:03:21.613
Handsome~~~

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.993
&lt;embarassed&gt;

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.300
&lt;Nichkhun who is introducing Ye Sheng to his fans&gt;

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.135
He is very good

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.760
Very amazing too

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.300

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.100
