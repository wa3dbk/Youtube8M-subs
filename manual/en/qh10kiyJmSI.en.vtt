00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:29.332
France is one of those teams that
doesn't have all these big stars

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:32.172
when you look at it on paper,
but a team that is always good

00:00:32.207 --> 00:00:34.249
in championships
and I respect them a lot.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.372
They manage to really get the best out
of the team that they have.

00:00:37.373 --> 00:00:41.335
So, I had the feeling that it was
going to be a really close game.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.440
I was tense before the game,
and very focused.

00:02:46.655 --> 00:02:52.330
She is like most other keepers,
a bit crazy in the head.

00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:57.258
Yes. She's quite funny to watch.

00:02:58.426 --> 00:03:03.460
She's very good, of course,
has played many internationals for France,

00:03:05.783 --> 00:03:11.063
and is... how should I say...
very French.

00:03:11.064 --> 00:03:16.274
When France is in attack, for example, she
has her own little show at the other end.

00:03:17.313 --> 00:03:22.180
A bit of dancing and singing and
flirting with the audience.

00:03:22.415 --> 00:03:23.872
She's quite a character.

00:03:23.873 --> 00:03:28.131
Now I play together with her at Ikast,
so I've gotten to know her better than

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.887
I did then (at the EC).
And she's one of those keepers

00:03:30.922 --> 00:03:34.490
who are often good when it matters,
she is very charismatic

00:03:34.525 --> 00:03:39.239
and she is a person who creates...
how should I say...

00:03:39.474 --> 00:03:44.433
she provokes a bit and she can stand
and well... not quite give the finger

00:03:44.468 --> 00:03:47.396
to the audience,
but she's a bit different.

00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:51.881
A typical keeper, really, there are
quite a lot of goalkeepers who stand out.

00:03:53.116 --> 00:03:57.326
I have the impression that she loves
the situation when there is a lot at stake

00:03:57.361 --> 00:03:59.871
and a big audience
and she likes that.

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:04.530
So, I obviously respect her a lot.
At the same time, I have played many

00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:09.649
good games against her in the past
and luckily I wasn't that nervous

00:04:09.684 --> 00:04:12.496
about playing against her.

00:05:49.044 --> 00:05:52.402
I knew it immediately.
Unfortunately.

00:05:52.703 --> 00:05:56.478
We were in a critical situation,
because she had been so good in the

00:05:56.513 --> 00:05:59.421
championship and she has
a lot of responsibility for us.

00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:04.136
There and then, you didn't know
that she wouldn't return.

00:06:04.137 --> 00:06:07.529
We didn't think that it was bad enough
to keep her from playing again.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.629
At the same time, when you are in
that "bubble", as you could call it,

00:06:10.664 --> 00:06:13.967
when you are in a championship,
you are willing to sacrifice quite a lot.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.062
So, I had put reason aside.

00:06:19.403 --> 00:06:21.862
This is a terrible picture.

00:06:22.362 --> 00:06:26.981
We are, and have made ourselves,
so dependent on our captain.

00:06:27.082 --> 00:06:30.949
We have talked about that afterwards,
how we could have handled that better

00:06:30.984 --> 00:06:35.218
and perhaps we could have done that
if I had been even more clear

00:06:35.253 --> 00:06:37.822
about how I was feeling.

00:06:37.823 --> 00:06:41.899
In that situation, both they and I
did what we felt was right,

00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:47.432
but afterwards I can see that perhaps
I shouldn't have played so much

00:06:47.467 --> 00:06:49.714
in the last two games.

00:06:50.387 --> 00:06:55.149
Well, it's obviously sad and that injury
plagued her for quite some time.

00:06:57.157 --> 00:07:03.140
What to say...
You don't want anyone to get injured,

00:07:05.052 --> 00:07:09.341
but fortunately for the team
it happened in the last game.

00:07:11.248 --> 00:07:15.690
But that injury stayed with her
for a long time, so it's worst for Gro.

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:18.432
But, she's back now.
