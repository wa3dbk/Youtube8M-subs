00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.549
What do you do if you’re biking and a pedestrian
comes into your pathway and you knock them

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:08.549
down and injure them?

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.940
Well, if you’re in New York, naturally you
sue them don’t you?

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.280
Well that’s exactly what happened in today’s
New York Post article that I want to share

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.280
with you.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.280
Come join me.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.570
I’m Gerry Oginski, a New York medical malpractice
and personal injury trial attorney.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.570
And in today’s New York Post, they talk
about this exact scenario: “Cyclist hits

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.590
pedestrian and sues her.”

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.380
November 27th, 2011.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.370
It’s a fascinating look at what happened
in Central Park when a triathlete was on the

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.480
bike path, a pedestrian happened to be walking,
and walked into the path of the bicyclist.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.140
The bicyclist knocked over the pedestrian,
shattered her entire elbow, and the bicyclist

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.920
also claims to have suffered significant injury.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.910
So what did the bicyclist do?

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.190
Of course, she sued her!

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.010
Is that what everybody is supposed to do?

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.670
Well, not exactly.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.870
Why not?

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.160
Because in order to prove a case here in New
York, we have to show -number one- that there’s

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.160
wrongdoing.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.110
And we have to show that the wrongdoing was
caused by carelessness or negligence.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.469
So what does that mean?

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:10.120
It means that each person – the pedestrian
and the bicyclist – have an obligation.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.900
What’s the obligation?

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.310
To see what’s there to be seen.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.880
They have an obligation to be careful.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.220
Now the bicyclist is on a designated path
in Central Park.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.950
But, they have to also recognize that there
are a lot of pedestrians – people walking

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.150
around.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.900
The pedestrian has an obligation to recognize
that there is a bike path there and to know

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.939
that people are going to biking through there,
and what do you expect?

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.280
There are going to be people on the bike path,
riding their bicycles.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.570
So each one of them has an obligation.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.940
Now let me ask you a question.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.500
Do you think that the bicyclist is totally
responsible for what happened?

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.460
Or do you think that they both share some
responsibility?

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.460
In my view, they both share some responsibility.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.500
And I wouldn’t be surprised if the pedestrian
turns around and countersues the bicyclist

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.729
for causing the accident that shattered her
elbow.

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.890
Now the bottom line that you have to look
at, when evaluating this type of case is who’s

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.890
actually responsible?

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.259
And if turns out that both of them are actually
responsible then neither one of them will

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.860
be able to recover full compensation for their
injuries.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.879
So why do I tell you this?

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.940
I tell you this because you probably have
questions especially if you’re involved

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.540
in a similar situation as either a bicyclist
or a pedestrian.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.970
And what I want you to do is pick up the phone
and call me.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.380
I can answer your legal questions; this is
what I do every single day.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.319

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.690

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.180
Thanks for watching.
