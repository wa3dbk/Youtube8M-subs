This is Jeff Wilkins for Expert Village. So
now we have a completed body, the next step

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.710
is the saddle hackle. We're going to wrap
this. That's called palmering, any time a

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.130
material is wrapped over the hook shank and
even when a space turns, that's what it's

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:25.520
called. We're going to take the saddle hackle
and prepare it by stripping the marabou back

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:32.590
at the base so that what we have is a clean
hackle. I'll trim that bottom off so we have

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:41.170
a bare stem and I'm going to tie it in so
that the tip of the hackle angles just like

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:53.399
a crescent and points back toward the tip
of the tail. Now the reason for tying it in

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.550
that way is that the hackle when I wrap it,
the fibers will naturally curve or slant toward

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.190
the rear, which is exactly what we want them
to do. Make sure the thread is secure, the

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.070
material is tied in. I'll clamp the hackle
plier on the tip of the hackle. I'll start

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:23.680
right next to the just back of the hook eye
and I'll start wrapping it back just like

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.730
the chenile orestez. I like to stroke the
fibers backward as I start backward. It kind

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:40.020
of helps them or encourages them to go that
direction. I'm going to continue wrapping

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.420
all the way back to the rear to the point
where I make contact with that wire that we

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.970
tied in the first couple steps. The wire is
what we'll use to tie it off. So I'm going

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.520
to use the wire, I'll come over that tip,
the hackle, pass it underneath the hook shank

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.990
around the hook point. With wire wrapping
around the hackle, you can do this with an

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.610
Elk wing cactus or other flies where you have
wire and hackle that you're trying to work

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:19.240
together is to move the wire in see saw fashion
back and forth. Going through the fiber, you'll

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.840
find the fibers still stand up and this will
reinforce that stem so if the fly gets a lot

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.110
of chewing and hopefully it will, it will
be a lot more durable. I'm going to release

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.920
this hackle plier, we don't need that anymore
and I'm just going to continue to wrap forward

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:44.130
evenly spacing the wire, wiggling it back
and forth, right to just back of the hook

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.780
eye and ahead of all the hackle that we wrapped.
