00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.900 position:98%
Computer Vision System Toolbox provides algorithms and tools for the design and simulation of

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.470 position:70%
computer vision and video processing systems.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.770 position:67%
You can detect objects in images and video,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.530 position:61%
track detected objects in video frames,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.100
calibrate cameras,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.130
and perform stereo vision.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.930 position:63%
Computer vision uses images and video to

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.170
detect,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.670
classify,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.670 position:97%
and track objects or events in order to understand a real-world scene.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.330 position:97%
Object detection is the process of finding instances of real objects such as

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.700
faces,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.330
people,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.030
road signs,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.930
or license plates.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.530 position:67%
You can use pre-trained object detectors to

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.670
detect people,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.900
faces,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.400
and facial features.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:02.100 position:97%
You can also create object detectors to locate any object of interest by selecting and assigning regions of interest in training images.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.830 position:94%
The system toolbox also includes over fifty Simulink blocks.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.630 position:98%
As shown in this example where example where motion information is used to detect objects in video.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.900 position:98%
Object tracking is the association of detected objects in adjacent frames of video.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.100 position:98%
In this example you can see how a face is tracked using feature point tracking.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.130 position:98%
The system toolbox also provides a framework that you can use to track multiple objects using Kalman filters.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.630
Feature detection,

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.130
extraction,

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.500
and matching,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.770 position:97%
is a useful workflow for computer vision, and can be used for applications such as

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.930 position:61%
detecting objects in a cluttered scene,

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.100 position:91%
and stitching multiple images together to form a panorama.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.630 position:97%
Camera calibration is often used to find characteristics internal to a camera.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.430 position:97%
You can use this information to correct for optical distortions,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.930 position:78%
or establish the actual size of objects in images.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.570 position:97%
Camera calibration also estimates a cameraâ€™s location in space; this is a precursor to stereo and 3D vision.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:22.170 position:97%
With stereo images you can calculate the depth of points in the scene , and reconstruct a 3D model of the scene.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.030 position:97%
Computer vision system toolbox is for use with MATLAB and Simulink. For more information on the Computer Vision System toolbox return to
