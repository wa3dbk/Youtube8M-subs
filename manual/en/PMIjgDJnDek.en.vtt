00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.279
If you find yourself with a flat tyre, it's really important

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.180
that you find a safe place to stop the vehicle initially, then secure the

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.840
vehicle by applying the hand brake

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.250
putting the vehicle in park or in first gear if its a manual, remove the keys from the ignition

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.539
and exit the vehicle. Generally speaking
your spare tyre and the toolkit are placed

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.480
boot of the vehicle. It

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.660
does vary from car to car so check
your owner's manual and that'll identify

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.380
exactly where in your particular car those items are kept

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.449
What you'll need is a wheel brace to enable you to undo the wheel nuts

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.750
you'll also need a jack to raise the vehicle to allow you to get the flat tyre off

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.110
You start by removing the hub cap or the wheel nut covers

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.680
whatever's fitted to your vehicle, then using
the wheel brace you want to loosen

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.820
each of the wheel nuts half to approximately one turn before jacking up the vehicle

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.420
Next, we're going to raise the vehicle to allow us to remove the flat tyre

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.660
the jacking point and the type of jack used does vary from car to car so again its worth

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.550
checking your owners manual.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.320
Once the jack's in place you then commence jacking the vehicle to release the weight of

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.019
the vehicle from the flat tyre. Now that we've got the wheel off the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:04.460
ground

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.780
We can remove each of the wheel nuts until

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.030
all 5 or 6 or 4, depending on whatever your car's fitted with are off

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.760
and now we can remove the flat tyre. A good idea is to place the flat

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.620
wheel under the vehicle just for a safety feature in case the jack were to give way

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.770
you've then got something to support the vehicle

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.340
so lift the spare wheel up onto the
hub and make sure it's sitting nice and flat

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.650
and square to the vehicle

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.080
then start each of the wheel nuts by hand
then remove the flat tyre from under the

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.580
vehicle and

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.050
lower the jack. Lower the vehicle down
until the weight to the vehicle is on the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.700
spare tyre that's just been fitted

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.710
We'll then use the wheel brace to
tighten each of the wheel nuts

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.330
in sequence. If you can't get to a tyre
repairer

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.640
in the short term it's worth checking those wheel nuts again

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.760
after a couple hundred kilometres of driving, just to make sure they are still tight

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.060
I guess the main thing is to know your vehicle, so you should be checking that your

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.799
spare tyre

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.570
is fitted to the vehicle and inflated and
also that all of your tools

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.700
are in a serviceable condition. With some
vehicles it can vary, you've got

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.289
emergency spares or space savers as they are commonly called and they're only for

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.560
literally emergency purposes to get you to a place of repair as quickly as possible

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.249
when in doubt ring RACQ and we're happy
to come and assist.
