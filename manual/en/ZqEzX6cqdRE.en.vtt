00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.900
Well hello!  Thank you for joining us.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.130
Today we're going to show you how to
make

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.360
everyone's favorites Scandinavian treat

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.559
which is? Lefse. Lefse, yes!

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.530
And we're going to use and old family
recipe.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.140
Now you might have your own favorite
recipe or you could even use a lefse

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.750
mix.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.280
That'll work great! Okay then, let's get
started.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.110
First, we’re going to talk about the ingredients.  You need, for lefse,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.570
good russet potatoes.  And then of course in any Scandinavian recipe,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.650
you're going to want real cream and

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.710
real butter. And then you need flour,

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.979
sugar and a pinch of salt. And a pinch of
Norwegian love!

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.020
Oh, Rollie!  You get me flustered!

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.500
Now, let’s talk about the equipment we’re going to need.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.600
You need really good equipment for making lefse.  The tools we need

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.020
include a potato ricer, a pastry board

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.110
and pastry cloth, a corrugated rolling pin and cover,

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.110
and lefse turning sticks. And, don't forget
the grill.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.670
As I said before, we’re going to be using russets to make our lefse today,

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.000
because russets are high in starch and low in moisture,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.869
and that gives us the nice tender quality we like to have.

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.004
Today I’m gonna need about four
pounds

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.940
of potatoes for this recipe.  For those of you keeping score,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.250
that’s about 10 to 12 medium-sized spuds.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.420
And you try to cut them about the same size so that they get done cooking

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.900
at the same time and that makes it a lot easier to rice them.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.360
Now, after about 15 minutes, you’ll need to check them for doneness,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.710
and they should be about fork tender.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.890
But don’t let them cook too long cuz you don’t want them to get mushy.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.570
Now, these look about right so I think it’s time to drain them.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.940
Okee doke.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.350
It’s a good idea to let the potatoes sit for a few minutes

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.970
to let off the excess moisture.  Excess moisture is the death of good lefse,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:41.570
don’t ya know?

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.270
That’s for sure.  Now it’s time to begin ricing your potatoes.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.960
It’s very important to have a good quality ricer

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.640
because ricing makes the potatoes so much smoother than mashing.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.370
And it doesn’t shred them to smithereens like a food processor can.  That's right!

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.480
Now, you just fill your ricer about two-thirds full

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.710
and then you rice your potatoes

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.160
into a large mixing bowl.  Aunt Lena riced her potatoes twice

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.090
for lefse as smooth as butter. Aunt Lena was an

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.069
overachiever.  That's for sure.

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.980
Now we’re ready to start mixing up our lefse dough.   Now I have got

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.180
eight cups of warm, riced potatoes,

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.530
and to that I'm going to add half a cup
of butter

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.200
and half a cup of cream.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.459
You have to have real butter and real cream for Scandinavian treats!

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.969
And now, to that we add

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:48.040
a tablespoon of sugar and

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.150
a tablespoon of salt.  Oh, this is going to
be good!

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.239
And then you mix it all together

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.840
really well.  And there I like to always

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.829
leave it to stand on the counter for
a while to cool down

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:11.359
before I put it in the fridge to chill.  So now it's time to roll the dough?

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.449
Oh, no, no, first you have to get your equipment ready.

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.889
You can’t make good lefse without good equipment.

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.880
So, you start with a lefse board that’s covered with a pastry cloth.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.830
And this is really important -

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.860
we have to take a lot of flour and spread
it all

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.780
out to the edges of the whole pastry cloth because

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.889
if we don’t, and we start rolling that lefse dough on here it’s going

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.409
stick and break up and be a terrible mess.

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.830
You bet.  We can’t have that.  So, we’ve got a good,

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.280
floured pastry cloth here and you need a good

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.150
corrugated rolling pin that you cover with a lefse cloth.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.680
And now that our dough is

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.050
thoroughly chilled, we're going to go
ahead and add

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.380
two and a half cups of flour.  And

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.050
Rollie, why don't you go ahead and give
this a good working over.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.690
Now that our dough is set, we’re ready to start making lefse.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.890
We’ve taken out as much dough as we’ll use right away

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.020
and the rest of it is still chilling in the fridge.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.860
And now, I’m going to have a cup of coffee while Rollie

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.070
works his magic. Great! Let's get

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.740
rollling!  I like to start with a glob of dough about the size of a small tennis ball.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.140
You pat the dough into the shape of a

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.920
hockey puck, then you get your rollin’ pin; put some flour on there so it

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.170
doesn't stick.  And then you start to roll
the dough out into

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.750
a nice circle.  You've done this a few times before, haven't you Rollie?

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.950
Let’s just say I know my way around a pastry board.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.320
Now, you want the dough pretty thin. In
fact, you should actually be able to see

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.760
the lettering on your pastry board
through the dough

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.720
when you get ready to move it over to
the grill. And the grill is good and hot,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.910
because we've preheat it to 500 degrees.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.720
Great!  Now, you take your lefse stick, push it right

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.500
on through the middle under the dough.  Then you take it over to the grill,

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.540
lay one side down on the grill and then roll

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.180
your stick over and lay the other side right down on the grill.  You know Rollie,

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.120
that’s pretty good for somebody who’s not a pure Norwegian.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.690
In about a minute, the lefse should be ready to flip,

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.010
and you’ll know when you see bubbles start to rise on the top.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.460
You flip it, and let it cook for about another 45 seconds, or until the brown

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.330
spots look just the way you like ‘em.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:57.880
Yeah, that’s the sign of a good one!Olga, now comes my favorite part of the

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.260
lefse making process.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.490
And what’s that, Rollie? Quality control, of course.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.820
I like my lefse hot off the grill with lots of butter.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.790
Oh yeah, that’s good but I have this sweet tooth so I have to have a little sugar

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:12.780
on mine.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.600
Brown sugar works too.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.120
Mmm, Uff-da!  This is good lefse!
