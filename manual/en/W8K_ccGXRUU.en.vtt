00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.800
Once upon a time there was a King who was very popular.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.660
However there seemed to be a problem,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.860
the King had two personalities.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.840
One day he would wake up in good spirits.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.300
Then he would receive his guests and would meet the wishes of his people without any hesitation.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.660
But there were some other days,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.600
when he would be very moody,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.900
he did not see anybody,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.920
and would have no one around him.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.980
He would deny everybody's wishes and he would speak bitterly to people.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.560
The King himself was quite aware of his changing moods.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.120
He was shocked to see himself behave so bitterly on some days.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.940
He would try hard to make up for his bad behaviour whenever he was back to his good spirits.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.140
But he was wise enough to know that he could not go on like this,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.920
so he called the wisest men of the   country to find a solution.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.080
The wise men put themselves to work in order to find the cure for the King.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.360
But weeks later the king gave up,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.860
because no herbs nor magic potion cured him of his problem.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.260
The king wept on his throne,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.040
when a small delicate man came and claimed that he could help the King.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.020
You highness, I am from a distant country,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.640
and I heard from your subjects about the problem you have with your changing moods.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.940
I think I can help you.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.820
What can you do for me ?

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.720
This is a magic ring, however, it works
only if it's wound on the finger,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.820
and every morning, you have to read the inscription, written on the band.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.060
The King was curious to read the engraving which said,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.080
This too shall pass.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.000
Remember.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.420
Always smile and be happy.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.700
Everything will come to pass,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.840
including our gloomy moods.
