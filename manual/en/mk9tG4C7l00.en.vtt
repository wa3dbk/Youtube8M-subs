00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We see a very sad thing 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in this week’s Parsha, Vayeira.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
A boy, Ishmael, is placed under a shrub,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
perhaps to die, because his mother and he

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
had run out of water 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
as they wandered the desert. His mother,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Hagar, cannot stand to see him suffer 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
any longer, 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but then an amazing thing happens.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
An angel speaks out to her, says, 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
“Come! Lift up the boy 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and hold him by the hand

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 for I will make a great nation of him”.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Sure enough, there was nothing to be afraid of.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
God opens her eyes 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and she sees a wellspring of water.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Perhaps it had been there all along.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What’s interesting about this act of redemption

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
is that the angel feels the need to ask

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the crying Hagar what’s troubling her?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If the angel had half a brain, 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
he would have known she was afraid

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
for Ishmael’s life.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Perhaps the angel is suggesting 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Hagar is overlooking something. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
For one, yes, there’s that spring of water,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but even if the spring hadn’t been there 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
all along, Hagar has something working for her:

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
A promise! Last week in Lech Lecha, an angel,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
maybe the very same angel, promised Hagar

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that she would have children.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Countless children. Clearly then, this is not 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
the end of Hagar's story nor Ishmael’s.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It’s the beginning of the story

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
of how he goes on to become the father

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
of a great nation. Why did Hagar get

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
such an excellent deal? Hagar had been

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
running away from her mistress Sarah.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You know Sarah, the mother of all Israel.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Apparently, Sarah, who hadn’t yet had a child

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
of her own, didn’t like the fact that Hagar, 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
her servant, was carrying her husband, 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Abraham’s, baby even though she’d

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
suggested this arrangement in the first place. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
She made Hagar’s life miserable. Finally, 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Hagar fled Sarah’s harassment, 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and then this angel came along and said,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
“Hagar, slave of Sarah,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
where have you come from

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and where are you going?” and she said,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
“I am running away from my mistress Sarah.”

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And the angel said to her, 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
“Go back to your mistress 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and submit to her harsh treatment.” 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
In doing so, Hagar experienced three things, 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
more servitude, more affliction,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and more "strangerness." Hagar is a servant.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
She’s afflicted by Sarah. And not only is she,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
herself, an Egyptian, a stranger in these parts,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
her name, Hagar, literally means in Hebrew 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
“the stranger”. What she didn’t know

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 is that these three things are ingredients

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
in the Torah’s recipe for nationhood. Earlier,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
God promised Abraham that he would have 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
a child who would become a great nation.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
God brought Abraham into

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
this trippy dream-state. He said, 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
“I know you’re an old man 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and you have no children, but you will.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
That’s the good news. The bad news is

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
that these children will go on 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
to experience exile, strangerness in a land

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
not theirs. They’ll be afflicted in slavery.”

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And lo and behold, Abraham’s children

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
through Sarah become a great nation.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So just as Israel went from becoming a family

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
to becoming a great nation in Egyptian slavery,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Hagar and her children 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
are also bound for greatness.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Under the blazing desert sun,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Hagar is too panicky to see this, but we can.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
You want to do everything you can to protect 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
your children from suffering, but this is, in fact,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
part of the growing up process, both for nations

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and for each of us. Could you have become 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the independent, compassionate, thoughtful

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
person you are without the challenges

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
you have weathered, without the journeys

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
you’ve survived?
