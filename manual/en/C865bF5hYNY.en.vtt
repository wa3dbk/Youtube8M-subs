On behalf of expertvillage.com my name is
Neal Jones and I’m with A Perfect Fit Alterations,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:18.600
102 Main Street in historic old town Burleson,
Texas we’re at 817-447-3522. Continuing

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.810
with our tour of a serger we’re now going
to cover threading the machine. Threading

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.759
the machine is very critical on this machine
because we have pointed out a lot of the guides

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.909
that we use throughout the machine to stop
the thread from tangling, there are guides

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:47.149
at the top, there are guides going through
the tension controls, there are actually slots

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.829
cut in the machine here in order to make sure
that the thread stays where it’s suppose

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:59.480
to go. Now this machine is extremely versatile
and it does take some time to be able to familiarize

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.780
yourself with and this is not as simple to
operate as a regular sewing machine, so it

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:12.800
does take patience and time to be able to
do it. Now the normal serger thread comes

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.700
in a cone like this one right here, now the
normal serger thread is actually just a very

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.060
tiny bit thinner than normal thread and this
is a yellow thread that is very difficult

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.009
to see you may be see it under a microscope
but the normal sewing thread it’s just a

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.770
little tiny bit heavier thicker than this.
But there are you can use ordinary thread,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.350
now when you have an ordinary thread that
you would use on a sewing machine would be

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.420
in a spool like this one or a smaller spool
like this one, now we would be able to use

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.770
these on this machine if wanted to but we
would have to make a couple of changes. The

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.909
first thing we would do would be remove the
device that holds the cone thread in place

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:07.319
which will be this little device right here,
that fits inside the cone and holds in place,

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:14.159
in place of that we would then put a guide
put the thread on here and we would put a

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:19.730
guide on the top. Now of course the whole
idea of putting that guide on there would

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:27.700
be as the thread unwinds from the spool it
would not become tangled on anything, so our

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.500
emphasis again is on the thread not being
tangled.
