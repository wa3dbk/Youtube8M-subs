00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.499
Hello. Today we are going to make some delicious homemade chocolate ice cream

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:11.959
Now for this you will need cocoa powder

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.460
Milk

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.150
thickened cream

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.720
and some sugar

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.720
Start off by pouring two cups of thickened cream into a sauce pan on low to medium heat 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.150
then one cup of milk

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.150
next two hundred grams of broken off
dark chocolate

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.000
and sift in a quarter cup of cocoa 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and last but not least one cup sugar

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.310
and stir over a low heat until it is completely dissolved 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.130
Once dissolved we are going to let it stand for twenty minutes then place it into the fridge

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.130
for about an hour until it completely cools

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.300
Now to make this I'm going to use an ice cream maker now i highly recommend that you buy one

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.000
they cost about 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.230
30 40 dollars 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.590
and you can also use it to make sorbet and yogurt 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.630
Now this is how simply it is, all you have to do is turn it on, pour in the mix

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.630
let is mix for twenty minutes and your ice cream is ready

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.949
Now this has been mixing for twenty minutes and it has come out perfect

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:24.879
Now you can choose to have it right now as a soft serve or place it in a air tight container in the freezer for a few hours

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:31.879
for a more traditional ice cream

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.459
Now this has been sitting in the freezer for a couple of hours, i just scooped it out

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.759
into a bowl

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:39.699
and it looks fantastic

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.039
it taste great it really does

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.709
