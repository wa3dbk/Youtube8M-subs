00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.280
How’s it going all, it’s Than from Tidal
Gardens.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:09.270
We have done a few videos in the past on Acanthastrea
which is one of the most popular large polyp

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.340
stony corals.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.130
Those videos highlighted one species of Acanthastrea,
namely, the Acanthastrea lordhowensis which

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.550
is the most commonly seen Acan in local fish
stores, and probably what comes to mind when

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.359
people think about Acans in general.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.500
There are other varieties out there, and that’s
what we are going to talk about today.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.150
It turns out there are many species of Acanthastrea
found throughout the world.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.100
In addition to the lordhowensis, you might
run into Acanthastrea echinata.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.449
It is flatter in appearance compared to the
lordhowensis and its coloration is typically

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.100
limited to orange, purple, and green.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.530
Having said that, there are some rare rainbow
morphs out there.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.250
The other distinguishing feature is the texture
of the polyp.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.960
There are small round bumps on its face sort
of similar to what you would see on a Ricordea

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.320
yuma where other Acans tend to have smoother
skin.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.110
I get asked often which corals can be kept
in close proximity with one another and of

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.530
course that is a loaded question with a million
possible answers.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.210
I can however say that setting Acans of different
species close to one another is a mistake.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.509
An Acan lord for example will fight with an
Acan echinata very aggressively.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.530
If one happens to fall off its rock and land
face down on the other, one or both of those

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.039
corals may die as a result, so it is important
to consider placement when you have both varieties

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.420
in the aquarium.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.549
Lately I came across what was described as
an Acanthastrea rotundaflora.

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.210
I will be the first to admit it that I have
a difficult time telling these apart from

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.990
an Acan echinata.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.490
To confuse matters, their morphology varies
substantially depending on where they are

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.490
found.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.480
In some geographies, such as Japan and the
Philippines these Acans look much more similar

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.069
to a chalice coral where their polyps are
widely spaced and their corallites have a

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.069
toothed appearance.

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.159
I don’t know why but there are some corals
like the echinata and rotundaflora that I

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:39.290
can’t tell apart while there are others
like an Acan lord and say a Micromussa which

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:47.180
look practically identical but I can tell
apart from a mile away.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.670
The next two Acans, the Bowerbanki and the
Hillae look very similar.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.330
Both of these Acanthastrea have large irregular-shaped
polyps.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.780
One differentiator I’ve heard described
is that Acanthastrea bowerbanki tend to be

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:12.030
flatter and more sucked in while Acanthastrea
hillae are a bit more puffed up.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.040
The problem with this is these are descriptions
of wild colonies.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.950
When you’ve had a coral in an aquarium for
a while, they change to fit their surroundings.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.480
We feed our corals a lot, so it’s common
for Acans to plump up.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.159
Our bowerbanki’s that we have had for an
extended period of time are much fatter than

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:37.650
the day they arrived so that line between
the bowerbanki and hillae gets really blurry

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.200
after a while.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.819
There are a few other types of Acanthastrea
in the wild that are almost never seen such

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.810
as an Acan maxima that resembles a Scolymia.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.439
We don’t see these corals because they are
from regions where there aren’t any type

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.269
of export of coral such as Oman in the case
of the maxima.

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.200
So, if you want one of those, good luck smuggling
one out of the middle east… nothing could

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.500
possibly go wrong.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.769
Aside from their appearance, and their incompatibility
with one another their care requirements for

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.440
these different types of Acans are pretty
much the same.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.870
All of them can be kept in medium flow and
medium light.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.090
The devil of course is in the details.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:33.200
Acans in general tend to change color drastically
depending on the type of light.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.280
Here you can see two Acan bowerbankis that
were grown under two types of light, one under

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.440
T5 fluorescents, and one under LED.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.720
You can see the specimen on the left took
on a rusty orange color while the one on the

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.360
right took on a more blood red appearance.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.300
As for feeding, Acanthastrea are some of the
easiest corals to feed.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.200
They extend feeding tentacles relatively quickly
and can snatch up both pellet food as well

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.800
as frozen sea food.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.330
I’ve noticed major benefits from feeding
these corals, so I recommend making some effort

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.890
to target feed them.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.610
Alright guys, that’s pretty much it on the
types of Acans that are common in the hobby.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.250
Hope you enjoyed the video, and until next
time happy reefing.
