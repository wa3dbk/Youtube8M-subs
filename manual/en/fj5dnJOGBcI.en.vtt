00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.849
From down in the deep of the ocean floor we
look at the worst in the Jaws franchise and

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:11.280
evaluate whether or not it is as bad as its
reputation has lead us to believe.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.940
The basics
• Jaws: The Revenge is the fourth film in

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.500
the killer shark series and would ultimately
be the last.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.490
It followed on from the previous ‘Jaws 3-D’
which had been a big success at the box office

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.010
but panned by critics for the formula getting
old.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.450
• And boy was getting old by now.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.650
‘Jaws 3-D’ had shifted away from the original
setting to SeaWorld where Dennis Quaid had

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.320
to fight the shark in all the glory of 1980’s
3D technology but other than that was basically

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.840
the same old story.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.180
• So what did that mean for ‘Jaws: The
Revenge’?

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.950
Well due to this call for something new, Producer
Sid Sheinberg decided to take the story into

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.640
a more mystical and even possibly supernatural
area.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.640
• This meant bringing the story back to
the Brody family from ‘Jaws’ and ‘Jaws

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.640
2’.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.990
But Roy Scheider had good enough sense to
stay away from the project so the story follows

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.000
his wife Ellen Brody being flat out convinced
that the shark is hunting her and her family

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.560
down for revenge.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.670
• This the ridiculous element that was brought
in to make things interesting.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.399
After killing one of her adult children the
shark then follows Ellen from Martha’s Vineyard

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.859
to the Bahamas in order to get its revenge.

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:12.249
• Now that in itself, sure doesn’t sound
TOO bad, stupid but so is a shark pulling

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:15.840
a helicopter into the water, the Jaws series
can be pretty stupid.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.719
So does Jaws: The Revenge get all its criticism
from its stupid premise?

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.700
The Bad Stuff
• Obviously the story should be the first

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.700
thing we get out of the way.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.639
So spoilers for 30 year old movie.

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:31.329
• The premise is really really stupid but
it could work if the characters were interesting

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.389
or engaging or y’know anything worth watching.

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:38.859
Ellen is dull to watch and so is her son Michael,
the only interesting character is Michael

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.949
Caine’s Hoagie but we’ll get to him later.

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:45.139
• Because of this we don’t really care
about anyone in the film so when the great

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:48.770
white does come for revenge it all feels a
bit meh.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.139
The stakes are never high emotionally for
the audience

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:56.279
• Also this barely classifies as a feature,
its 89 minutes which means the pacing is very

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:57.279
quick.

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:59.930
Things happen without proper explanation and
key shots are missing.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.130
At least 30 minutes of the film is Ellen looking
fearful out over the sea because she knows

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.020
somewhere out there that shark is plotting
to kill her.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.119
• I mean who is this shark?

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.209
Is I the cousin of the original Jaws?

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.209
Son?

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.209
Godfather?

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.650
This is the fourth time this has happened,
how many sharks are out there getting angry

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.870
over the other deaths?

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.900
• Anyway another 30 minutes is Michael doing
some boring underwater tests and that leaves

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.489
with the last third is the ridiculous shark
vengeance climax.

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:34.010
• This end fight between man and shark…or
woman and shark is absolutely insane.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.519
Jaws grabs Michael Caine’s plane and sinks
it.

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.090
His damn airplane!

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.680
This isn’t a shark it’s the aquatic equivenlent
to Godzilla

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.560
• So they use this sonar science thing to
drive Jaws-zilla crazy before impaling him

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.579
with a boat which causes the beast to explode.

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.250
It’s crazy and not the good kind of crazy,
it’s the kind of over the top that thinks

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.930
it’s being dramatic and fails on every level.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.849
• Oh and did you know sharks roar when they
are in pain.

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.010
100% scientific fact.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.129
• Okay so the story sucks, the performances
are bad …..what about the effects?

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.700
• No they are pretty bad too.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.319
The Jaws animatronic looks terrible throughout
most of the film and the director didn’t

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.200
have the sense to do what the original did
and try and hide the awful looking thing.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.980
It’s serviceable, there are worst sharks
in worse shark movies but it is pretty comical

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.260
to see when it’s attacking people and planes.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.170
The film did win the Golden Raspberry that
year for special effects…so no they are

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.170
not good.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.209
The Good Stuff
• Well this is going to be difficult…it’s

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.260
short?

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.319
• No there are actually a few slight good
things in the film which is surprising

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.469
• One of them is Hoagie.

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:42.549
Michael Caine is really enjoying his vacation
in the Bahamas because that’s the only reason

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.420
we can assume he decided to do the movie about
vengeance Jaws-zilla.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.900
Because he is clearly having fun his performance
while not good does make some of the movie

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.900
bearable.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.939
• It’s almost like he has just wandered
onto the set and couldn’t give a damn and

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.310
his presence is just great.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.180
This really should have been titled ‘Michael
Caine’s summer holiday’

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.770
• Oh and Jaws sinks a goddamn plane!

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.170
Yes this is one that is on both sides really
depending on how you feel about super powered

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.540
sharks…I’m indifferent so both it goes.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.019
• Seriously though the best part of the
film is probably the underwater cinematography,

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.380
while there’s not a heck of a lot the POV
sequence at the start of the film with us

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.669
seeing through the deadly super powered shark’s
revenge filled eyes is well done and provides

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.400
maybe the only piece of tension in the film.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.560
Juxtaposition the shark attack with Christmas
carols is okay too.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.070
Not great but it kinda works.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.400
• Let’s see is there anything else…Oh
the score works but that’s just because

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.200
it’s still the iconic ‘dun dun dun dun
dadun’ from the original.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.910
Speaking of things from the original the film
does this weird flashback stuff to events

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.419
in the first film and it’s made like it’s
Ellen seeing this…but all the flashbacks

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.889
are to things she wasn’t there for so…..

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.300
The Re-evaluation
• Yeah this is a bad film.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.600
• No doubt about that, it’s lazy and boring
and stupid and hits any stride that could

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.360
be considered good or entertaining.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.590
• The performances are dull and we don’t
care about anyone except Michael Caine and

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.169
his plane...Rest in pieces.

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.730
• This film killed finally did what the
others couldn’t and put a final end to the

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.919
shark frenzy that had happened after the huge
success of the first Jaws.

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.650
• Sometimes people forget how popular the
series was until this point, hell even this

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.020
film made a decent box office return, though
smaller than the intake of Jaws 3D.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.569
• It was believable when Back to the Future
II came out that Jaws could keep on going

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:24.889
till the 19th entry would be released in the
mystical future year 2015.

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.510
But that much like flying cars was bound to
not happen.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.150
• Can some fun be had here?

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.780
Sure depending on your love for the franchise
there are some guilty pleasure moments especially

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.780
to the end of the film.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.660
The film isn’t poorly made on the basics,
the cinematography is serviceable and Caine

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.550
gives the film more of go then he should.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.349
• It’s short and fairly inoffensive, it’s
not like they outrightly say that Jaws is

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:47.490
some magic spirit demon plotting revenge on
human beings so you can assume it’s all

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.300
in Ellen’s head that the shark is following
them.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.149
Y’know maybe they are just really unlucky
with sharks?

00:05:52.149 --> 00:06:01.770
• We’d give this one four exploding sharks
out of ten.
