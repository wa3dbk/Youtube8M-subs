Last time on Out of the Darkroom I was
chatting to Laura Pannack about her work

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.089
and today she's going to fill us in on what
motivates her and how she got her start in photography.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.540
AdoramaTV presents, Out of the Darkroom with Ruth Medjber.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.860
You mentioned your education,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.160
what is your educational background did you study photography?

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.480
Yes so I did Fine Art, well I did a

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.890
foundation Fine Art and then I specialized
in graphics

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.900
and then from there I did a short photography course
and just

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.080
got entirely hooked, and then I did a

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.850
foundation in photography
and then did a degree

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.430
in photography. Wow ok, so you've kind of
done it all and always come back to photography.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.830
My liver is like dead! I just drank a lot!

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.089
You just liked staying in college, you just did it for a
while, there is no harm in doing that as well.

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.049
Was there any other projects that you have
coming up that you are really excited about? Yeah, I'm

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:03.220
working on a project,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.799
two projects at the moment, well I'm
continuing the

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.100
Jewish series which was in the Taylor Wessing.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.229
Of course, because you won a prize that in the Taylor Wessing, could you maybe tell us a little bit about that

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.229
how did that get set up? Yeah I mean it's a
project I've been doing for a long time now

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.110
Stamford Hill is in a community
very densely populated with

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.380
Orthodox Jews and from various
different steps

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.689
so I thought to be quite interesting
to work with the women

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.770
because I found that the women who weren't photographed

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.759
and I was just quite interested in their
lives because I am actually Jewish

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.210
and I've grown up in the most
opposite

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.200
kind of you know, cultural kind of
background like I was the only Jewish girl

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.929
in my school and you know,

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.119
and then I've moved to this area and it's
just been really nice to kind of

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.950
you know reach out to these women who I
don't know anything about, I really

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.079
want to learn from them,

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.289
I really kind of want to gain an understanding
of their lifestyle

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.909
and you know it's just been a
wonderful insight into my neighborhood

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.340
because that's where I live

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.270
and I felt that actually like one of the
most challenging things

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.350
that personally that I can do is do something
close to me, I think I find it quite

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.120
difficult to go to another country

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.660
and see something exotic or to focus
myself on a project that's kind of like

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.000
you know its there, and I know that I can
execute it. Whereas with this it was kind

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.280
of a lot more mysterious

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.790
I knew that the access was going to be
incredibly challenging and I knew that it

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.640
was close to home,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.810
so I had to kind of make the banal
interesting. So is it people that

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.910
really that you love or? People fascinate me,
and people are unpredictable.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.840
I mean landscapes are beautiful but I kind of
find that there's only so many factors

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.780
within a 60th of a second

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.230
that will alter that landscape,
whereas I feel like a person can just

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.270
do anything

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.170
and I kind of, I like that exchange, and I
come from you know I've always had an

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.810
interest in social science and
psychology and

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.050
so I think like I think that kinda comes
into it quite a bit

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.450
you know I'd really like to pursue more
projects that touch on those things as well.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.690
There's a lot of people who've come through
kind of a similar

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.269
degree that you have, and maybe want
to create work like yours and get to the

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.610
level that you're at and

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.959
is there anything that you could advise
them or recommend for them to do? I mean

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.640
what would say to people? I don't
know I think there's like,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.140
there's so many...

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.860
I think I'm really lucky though, because I
think, this is going to sound like such a cliche,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.230
but as soon as I picked up a camera like I
totally knew, I was just like I want to

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.799
die doing this I was like I just, I totally fell

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.200
head over heels for it and I was
really lucky, like not many people

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.989
will kind of just

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.579
know what they want to do, so I guess the advice

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.019
that I can only give would just be to

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.440
to not isolate yourself, like I think
that actually like

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.810
the majority of ways in which my photography is developed and how I've grown up as a

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.590
person

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.610
have been down to my influences, my
inspiration,

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.620
and I think that photography although it
seems like quite an isolating thing,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.400
that you go off with your camera and you go
roaming and you have fun, actually

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.709
you know the community of photography is
incredibly embracing

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.090
and it's having that critique and that mentorship
and that you know, that kind of

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.100
collaboration

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.890
with your peers that really forms kind of
like the way that you express yourself, and I

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.840
think challenges the way you express
yourself.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.140
So almost seek out other photographers
and advice. I think

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.470
seek criticism, I think the worst thing

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.010
people can do is become complacent

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.570
and I think if you have passion you're
probably not complacent

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.450
but I think that you know when
you're stuck on something or

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.730
if you don't show your imagery to people,
as much as you may hate doing and I do,

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.380
you know in order to grow you need to be
criticized.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.530
Even if you want to challenge that
criticism and say no

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.270
you know I truly believe that the way that
I'm making these images is the right way,

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.730
I think its important to have that
conversation and I think also like

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.270
there needs to be a balance so there needs to
be concept,

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.340
there needs to be content, its wonderful looking
at beautiful images but if there's no

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.350
intellect behind it

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.040
I can't engage with it, and forgive me,
but a lot of the time I look at a lot of

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.380
very conceptual work and I totally
don't get it and it doesn't draw me in

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.020
incessantly

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.330
so I think there needs to be a balance, personally,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.560
for a successful image. Yeah, absolutely can I just bring you back then and we're going to talk about

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.910
just your camera, because we love hearing
about cameras here on this show and we

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:25.540
love knowing

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.710
you know what people use and so

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.430
I don't know whether you want to favor the digital or
the analog here.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.410
Definitely analog, so my favorite for
the moment is a Hasselblad 66

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.010
its 500cm, but I'm really looking to learn
more about large format I've been practicing

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.240
with it, so I really want to shoot some more 5x4.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.820
I mean large format is fun and it's you
know, it's technically challenging but

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.960
it's expensive!

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.380
It is expensive yeah but it's
so beautiful

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.930
and then I also use a Polaroid 180

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.340
so I've been learning using that, but yeah I think
the Hasselblad

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.450
that would be my desert island you know.
I hope someone gives you a large format

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.060
camera now after this interview

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.380
and goes, I can't wait to see what you do
with it. That would be amazing, do I need to do a

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.260
puppy dog face

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.040
at the camera or something? 'Please give me a large format I'll be oh so good with it',

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.740
and I'll be your assistant!

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.480
Well listen thanks so much for joining us
today, yeah I've learned a lot

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.110

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.880
