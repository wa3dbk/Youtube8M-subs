Hi all today's video was all about the
library folder

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:06.951
very often you need to get to the
library folder to delete a preference

00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:11.670
or to simply fix an application it's
not working unfortunately the library

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.661
folders is hidden 

00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:16.141
and a lot of people are not quite sure where it's located well

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:20.151
first the library folder is usually
located in a couple of different areas

00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:24.311
one is at the root up the hard right so
here is my hard drive 

00:00:24.311 --> 00:00:28.381
called yosemite and here is the library
folder you could see the path

00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:31.681
right here and this little icon if you
want to get

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:35.491
an icon like this on you were window
simply

00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:39.191
right click or control-click got this
gray bar here

00:00:39.191 --> 00:00:43.361
customize toolbar and look for the path

00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:46.931
just drag it and drop it and then you'll
have

00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:51.591
that ability when you click on a folder
or file to see

00:00:51.591 --> 00:00:55.111
exactly where it's located on your
machine so its a helpful tip

00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:59.591
anyway at the library folders hidden so
in order to see if there's a couple

00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:02.310
different ways to get a different
library folders

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.461
most of the time which are really going
to need is to get to the library folder

00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:07.841
that's in the User folder

00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:12.031
where the user account a real easy ways
to hold down option key

00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:16.520
on your keyboard go up to the go menu and suddenly you're going to see the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.240
library appear

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.071
if you click on it that is Library
folder so even if it's hidden it's a quick

00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:23.001
way to get to it

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:27.770
just to show you how that works again
I'm holding the Option key up and down

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.621
and you can see how it suddenly appears

00:01:29.621 --> 00:01:34.490
pretty cool feature but it does bring
to a different Library folder than the one 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.950
I showed you earlier this one is
actually in my

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.880
user folder which is normally the one
that we need to get you because those

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.861
are the ones that have

00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:46.361
the preference files here you can see
your cache is

00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:50.601
if you want to delete the manually
that's always a good thing that if you

00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:51.941
have a

00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:55.060
at system that's not working properly
you want to get rid of some of the cache files

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.490
you can

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.031
just drag them that out of here and delete them also the preference files are here

00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:05.241
and so you can also delete a preference
and it usually those files will get 

00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:06.510
re-created on reboot

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.391
and also the preference change but
sometimes you want to get rid of

00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:13.691
Control Panel a lot of times
you'll find them here

00:02:13.691 --> 00:02:17.290
that might be in the root folder as
you can see I have none on the User

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.751
folder

00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:22.511
here. there is another way to get to
the library folder I'm going to show you that

00:02:22.511 --> 00:02:23.261
right now

00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:27.231
I let's go into our user

00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:30.881
accounts I just gonna go to libraries
so it's just gonna bring me to the

00:02:30.881 --> 00:02:34.501
 library folder and let's get to
the

00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:38.281
user admin and now I'm in the admin

00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:42.391
user account which is usually the name
that you walk into on your computer

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:46.021
I am now going to you go to

00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:49.911
few and showed you options

00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:53.451
and as you can see show Library folder

00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:57.951
is now showing up that will permanently
charted on my user folder

00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:01.831
so I won't have to really search for it
in the future I like to keep it on

00:03:01.831 --> 00:03:05.930
some people down to touch you on you
will not see this

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.911
option to show Library folder unless
you're actually

00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:13.531
air the user account folder so that's
the only way that it will work

00:03:13.531 --> 00:03:16.961
so keep that in mind when you're working
I thats

00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:19.981
I you have the user careful to open

00:03:19.981 --> 00:03:24.421
I'm going to zoom in on that a little
bit and there you could see

00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:28.841
show Library folder it'll be a default
after he do that

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:32.201
you wondering how I just don't turn out
I'm using my

00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:36.721
action commands and Mike plus and minus
sign it acts the same time

00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:40.741
so it's always a good thing to know how
to do that alright hope you enjoyed

00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:44.641
livor folders are important to fix
applications that don't work properly

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:48.111
and they're really great actively
cashers but

00:03:48.111 --> 00:03:51.540
there's lots of reasons why you might
need to get to where I just be careful

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.771
I because you really don't want to
delete things that you need thanks for

00:03:54.771 --> 00:03:55.421
