00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.120
Hi I'm Tricia an organic gardener I grow
organically for a healthy and safe food

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.360
supply,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.849
for a clean and sustainable environment,

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.069
for an enjoyable and rewarding
experience.

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:18.689
If you've gardened long enough you know there's a
quandary of how to keep track of all

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.529
your garden seeds.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.590
When it comes to organizing my seed I
divide it into three groups based on

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.869
planting time.

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.730
This is my six to eight weeks box.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.480
Inside this box I have seeds like

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.200
tomatoes and peppers

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.170
that needs to be started indoor in trays about six to eight weeks before

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.180
the last frost.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.510
I also have

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.890
seeds that can be direct seeded in the
ground

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.709
six to eight weeks before the last frost,

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:51.480
like peas.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.790
In my three to four week box

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.120
I have plants like cucumber and other cucurbits

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.570
that can be started inside in trays three to four weeks before the last

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.670
frost.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.930
As well as a little section

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.740
for seeds that can be started directly
in the ground

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.820
three to four weeks before the last
frost.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.979
This is my direct seed after frost box,

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.049
this backs contains vegetables such as
corn, beans and okra.

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.240
For seeds that you are going to use this season or that you are going to use within the next year

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.190
you can just store them in a cool dark spot.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.820
The seeds that I'll be using

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.450
over the next few years can be stored
in a moisture proof box like this.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.409
If you seed packs have torn apart

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.420
or if your saving your own seeds

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.210
store them in these little tins.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.130
If you have some silica gel packs from a
box of shoes

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.260
you can drop those in the box just to
further reduce the humidity.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.170
Seeds stored longer than a year should
have a moisture content of less than a

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.610
8 percent.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.530
Seeds will reach a moisture equilibrium with
their environment.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.399
A good rule of thumb for getting an
appropriate moisture content is to make

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.250
sure that the sum of the temperature
in Fahrenheit and the relative humidity

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.939
does not exceed one hundred.

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.720
The whole box can go in the
refrigerator where there's a temperature

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.469
below forty and a relative humidity of
less than sixty.

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.920
Different plant varieties keep longer than others, for example

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.109
onions will keep only about a year but
cucumbers will keep to about five

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:21.699
years.

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:25.059
Seed packs will have a packed for date
printed on them

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:26.029
so you know what

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.959
year to count the longevity from.

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.569
If you are planting seeds that are a little bit old plant

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.160
more than you normally would,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.639
because germination rates may go down
just a little bit.

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.290
An easy way to keep track of what seeds you have, their longevity

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.059
and the last date you planted is by
using a spreadsheet.

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:48.790
This way you don't end up buying seeds you
already have or not replacing seed that is old

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.150
you can download this spreadsheet from
groworganic.com

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.399
which will auto fill the longevity of
the vegetable seed and the planting time.

00:02:56.399 --> 00:03:00.599
There's a wealth of information about
seeds in our seed catalog as well as many

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.639
planting tips in our calendar.

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.659
So organize your seed cupboard and grow
organic for life!
