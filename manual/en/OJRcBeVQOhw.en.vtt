This DNews episode is brought to you by Domain
Dot Com!

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:09.810
What if you could live on Mars and not wear
a spacesuit. Welcome to the world of terraforming!

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.719
Hey spacefarers, it's Trace! Thanks for watching
DNews. Terraforming is the combination of

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.520
the latin terra -- or earth, and forming.
Which… you probably know what forming means.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.070
It describes the process of converting an
alien planet to be more Earth-like. The idea

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.629
would be to make a planet able to support
human life without a spacesuit. To actually

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.210
PERFORM the process could take decades or
even centuries, assuming it would even be

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.870
possible.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.640
Mars is the golden boy for terraformation.
It's a good size, not too far from the sun,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.069
and has a minor atmosphere, if a thin one.
If you were to stand on Mars as you're dressed

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:55.460
now, at the equator, at midday, in the Martian
summer -- it would be a warm 80 degrees (27

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.899
C), but that's about it for the win. In the
winter, it can get to almost minus 200 (-128C)

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.559
at night. Not to mention, Mars has no atmospheric
pressure to speak of, so your blood would

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.250
boil, your organs would rupture, and there's
no oxygen so you wouldn't be able to breathe.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.250
No bueno. Its near-vacuum atmosphere is mostly
CO2 with a tiny bit of nitrogen. By contrast,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.840
Earth is mainly nitrogen, a tiny bit of of
CO2 and 20 percent oxygen. But all that aside,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.000
let's assume terraforming is possible.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.719
Getting down to brass tacks, what exactly
do we need to do to terraform the Red Planet?

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.840
We need to cut UV, raise the temperature and
pressure, introduce water and fix the atmosphere

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.939
to make it Earth-like.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.850
There are three major theories on how to do
this. Theory One: use orbiting mirrors the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.140
size of Lake Michigan to reflect sunlight
and heat the surface. Point these impossibly

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.380
large mirrors at the polar ice caps to melt
them, releasing CO2 trapped in the ice. Thicker

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.899
atmosphere will hold in more heat from the
sun. Then we just have to find some oxygen

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.310
and nitrogen, maybe by breaking up the H2O?
Theory Two: use greenhouse-gas producing factories

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.530
to build an atmosphere. (Kid Trace thought
of this too) We're already accidentally doing

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.180
it to Earth, so we know the technology exists!
More greenhouse gas equals warmer planet,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.370
polar ice caps melt, from there it's the same
as One. Theory Three: smash icy comets into

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.010
Mars.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.370
The last one is my favorite for two reasons,
Theory One requires 200,000 pound mirrors

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.980
to be built in space. Nope. Theory Two requires
us to build factories on Mars, which is ludicrously

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.340
expensive and WILL contaminate the Martian
environment with human bacteria. It is ALL

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.150
OVER US ALL THE TIME. Once infected the bacteria
could mutate and really screw up our planet

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.349
baby.

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.220
If you saw my recent video called, "Why Is
There Air," you might remember that Earth

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.580
was hit by a bunch of icy comets, distributing
water and minerals on our infant planet. The

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.290
impacts thickened the atmosphere and heated
us up. If we can do this for Mars too, then

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.590
we can create a terraformed Mars without introducing
potentially invasive bacteria onto the surface.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.510
I love that. According to HowStuffWorks, one
fantastically large asteroid impact could

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.530
raise the temperature on Mars by 3 Celsius.
This would melt a trillion gallons of water,

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.720
thicken the atmosphere and have the added
bonus of introducing oxygen too.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.530
Of course, any atmospheric modifications we
made to Mars would slowly spin off into space

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.290
thanks to the solar wind's erosion and low
gravity. If done properly, metallic asteroids

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.750
could be mixed with our thrown comets… A
2008 study from University of Toronto theorizes

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.819
that's how the Martian core got a magnetosphere
in the first place, it might be we just need

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:36.549
to restart it.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.629
So, let's say we're able to travel to the
asteroid belt, grab some giant space rocks,

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.709
fix little nuclear engines on them which propel
them on a collision course with Mars. Then

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.360
what?

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.640
Then we introduce genetically engineered soil
bacteria, algae, plants and other oxygen and

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.920
carbon dioxide cycle generating life to try
to make the biosphere habitable, and eventually…

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.099
like centuries or millennia later -- we'd
have a blue Mars. Assume we didn't screw it

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.079
up somehow, because there are no second chances.

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.319
In the end, if it worked, humans on Mars could
stand outside and breathe the air, they'd

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.870
have less gravity to content with, so they'd
have to figure that one out -- human bodies

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.989
don't do well with low gravity, and hopefully
they'd have figured out how to avoid the GLOBAL

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.810
STORMS that come up sometimes during the Martian
year. But hey, shrug, this is the future we're

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.720
talking about, maybe they'll be able to do
anything?

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.050
Do you want to know more about terraforming?
I know this was a big episode, so let me know

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.509
if you've still got questions and I'll do
a follow up.
