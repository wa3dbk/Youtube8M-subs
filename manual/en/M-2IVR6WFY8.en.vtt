This mini tutorial shows you how to Review,
and Accept or Decline Your Financial Aid online

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.940
on Banner Self Service.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.630
First go to www.mcneese.edu
If you are a current student, sign onto your

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:23.070
portal by clicking on the My McNeese tab,
putting in your user name and password, and

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.980
clicking on Self Service Banner.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.290
If you are not yet registered, click on the
current student tab, then under Registration,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:48.140
click on Banner Self-Service, then Enter Secure

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.090
'login'.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.400
Once in Self Service you will click on the
Financial Aid tab

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.080
Among the links on the left hand side, click
on Awards, then Award Display/Accept

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:09.000
Select the Aid Year and then click submit
At this point it is very important to read

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.620
all of the instructions on the General Information
tab and follow each step in the order in which

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.720
it is listed to gain access to the Accept
Award Offer tab.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.230
First view your awards on the Award Overview
tab.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.159
This tab shows information about your estimated
need, estimated cost of attendance, housing

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.580
status and expected enrollment status.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.820
At the bottom you will see your awards.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.200
Did you know that if you click on each fund
it gives you more detailed information and

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.230
requirements for this particular type of aid?

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.060
Notice the awards are showing for each semester
of the academic year.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.659
Once you have looked over your awards, click
on Resources/Additional Information tab and

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.740
answer the question if you plan to or did
you graduate in the Fall of the current academic

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.140
year.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.890
If you are graduating or graduated in the
fall, answer yes.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.530
If you answer yes, as explained on the General
Information tab, we will have to revise your

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.840
awards according to federal regulations.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.730
You will not be able to accept your awards
at this time.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.090
You will receive a new email letting you know
that your awards have been revised and at

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.140
that time you will be able to return to BSS
and accept your awards.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.230
If you are not graduating in the fall, answer
no and continue.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.459
Now you should have access to the Terms and
Conditions Tab

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:53.490
It is very important for you to read and understand
the requirements for receiving financial aid.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.520
Remember that accepting the terms and conditions
does not mean you are accepting a loan.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.520
You will be able to make that decision on
the next tab.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.010
Once you review ALL of the information and
fund requirements, click "Accept" to verify

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.430
that you understand.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.770
Now you should have access to the Accept Award
Offer tab.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.580
- Awards that require your acceptance are
loans and jobs only.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:29.110
- If you are awarded a grant, it will already
be accepted.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.590
- If you want to accept the full amount of
all awards as shown simply click on the "Accept

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.030
Full Amount All Awards" button.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:47.909
- If your decision varies, select your decision
under the Accept Award column.

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:53.959
- If you have a loan award and wish to reduce
the total, enter the yearly amount that you

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.790
want under Accept Partial Amount.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.599
Remember that if you are awarded for Fall
and Spring, the amount that you enter will

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.599
be split between the semesters.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:25.670
- Once you have made a decision on all awards,
click submit decision.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.889
When finished, make sure to view and respond
to any 'Unsatisfied Disbursement Requirements'

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.620
that may show up now that you have accepted
your awards.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.690
Notice here after you've made your decision
how the amount we entered for the subsidized

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:36.690
loan is split between Fall and Spring.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.020
Keep in mind this process must be done every
academic year.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.539
In conclusion, remember to go back to the
General Information tab for information on

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:47.470
what to do next!
