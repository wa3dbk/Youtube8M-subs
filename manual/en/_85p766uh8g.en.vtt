The Easy Way To Design &amp; Price
Your Car Vinyl Lettering Online

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.850
Our SignMagic Online Design Tool isn’t just
for signs anymore – You can now use it to

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.320
accurately design &amp; price the lettering you
want to display on your car.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.000
But there’s a trick to using SignMagic for
car vinyl lettering. Once you know this simple

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.070
“trick” it’ll save you a lot of time
and frustration.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.050
The very first step to design &amp; price your
car vinyl lettering is to measure the key

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.280
areas where you want your advertising message
to appear. For example, on this particular

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.790
car, a 19” by 3 1/2 ‘ box fits comfortably
on the front door. And along the side of the

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.250
trunk, we have room for a 5” by 3’ box.
There is also space above and below this area

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.170
for text or graphics, but we would measure
and design those seperatly. And don’t forget

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.600
the most important spot of all when you’re
sitting in traffic – the back of the car.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.040
For safety, the drivers behind you have to
keep an eye out for your brake lights. So

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.971
their eyes will be automatically drawn to
your advertising message.

00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:13.971
Since there are raised elements along this
part of the vehicle, we are going to place

00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:17.549
graphics on the back window. In this particular
case, I have room for a 17” by 4’ box.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.119
So where do you start?

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.790
Let’s start with the front door in SignMagic.
We have room for a 19” by 3 1/2 ‘ box.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.580
First, we’ll select the product we want
from this drop down list – if you want a

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.100
printed Decal that basically looks like a
big bumper sticker, you could select Decal.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.909
However, I’m going to click on “Vinyl
Letters”. Since there’s no background,

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.189
your letters and graphics will look as if
they have been professionally painted right

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.790
on your car.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.869
The great thing about vinyl letters though
is that you can remove them later. That way,

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.100
when you eventually sell your car, you’ll
preserve the resell value. Once you click

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.939
on Vinyl Letters, select the closest size
to your measurements. In this case, the closest

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.720
size is 18’ by 3’.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:13.920
Now that you have selected the size, this
box in SignMagic represents the 19” by 3

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.340
1/2' area you have to work with. Since there’s
some extra space on the door outside of this

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.579
area, you can actually fill this entire rectangle
with anything you want – text, graphics,

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.739
logos and even a full-color photo.

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.470
In other videos, I’ll show you exactly how
to create a design like this, step by step.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.069
Once you have your first design ideas put
together, you can SAVE your design &amp; instantly

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.590
see your pricing options. For example, if
you need lettering for only one side, just

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.409
choose a quantity of 1. If you want both sides
lettered, you can choose a quantity of 2.

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.709
Or if you have two cars you want to get lettered,
you can select a quantity of four. The more

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.239
sets you buy at once, the more you’ll save.

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.909
The Standard 3 Year rated vinyl is the lowest
in price. If you plan on keeping your truck

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:10.469
more than 3 years, we recommend the Premium
5-7 Year Rated Vinyl. And this third option

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:16.049
is for reflective vinyl. When the headlights
shine on reflective vinyl at night, the vinyl

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.249
lights up!

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:22.230
When you’re ready to continue, select the
pricing option you prefer and Add to Cart.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.230
You can always change your selection later
if you want to.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.499
To continue designing, just click on this
button that says Continue Designing. You can

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:34.482
make additional changes to your existing design
and SAVE it under a different name (like Front

00:03:34.482 --> 00:03:38.219
Door 2) to compare different designs – or
you can start a brand new design to letter

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.439
other areas of your car.
