00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.960
Hey guys! I'm going to be doing Disney Villain
impressions.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.440
With that said, let's get started!

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.240
Magic mirror on the wall whose the fairest
of them all.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.240
Reveal her name.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.900
And there my faithful huntsman, you will kill her.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.140
All alone my pet?

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.960
The little men aren't here?

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.400
Go on, go on have a bite.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.100
Girls please!

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.800
Girls, girls that's quite enough.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.160
Cinderella!

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.540
Why you little thief!

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.920
Look, that's my sash, she's wearing my sash!

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.520
But mother!

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.560
(singing badly) Sing sweet nightingale ah ah ah ah ahhh!

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.640
Whose been painting my roses red?

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.900
WHOSE BEEN PAINTING MY ROSES RED?!

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.440
Off with their heads!

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.880
Oh dear, what an awkward situation.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.160
I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.560
Marvelous, simply marvelous.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.740
No spots, no spots at all, where are they?

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.660
Oh, well in that case I'll take them all the
whole liter.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.220
Thank you my boy.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.220
But that's nothing, nothing for me.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.920
Because I'm the magnificent marvelous Mad Madam Mim.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.200
Madame Medusa pawn shop boutique.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.360
Can't you control that little girl?!

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.360
Oh, Penny!

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.400
And do you know whose bowl your eating?

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:56.229
(singing) Perfect isn't easy,
but it's me.

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.549
Girl we've got work to do.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.880
Pass me the paint and glue.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.060
My dear sweet child, that's what I do.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.460
It's what I live for.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.420
The body language. Ha!

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.400
(singing) Come on you poor unfortunate souls, go ahead make your choice.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.750
I'm a very busy woman and I haven't got all
day. It won't cost much just your voice.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.750
(evil laughter)

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.400
Simba!

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.040
(singing) The sound of Simba's dying gasp.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.920
His daughter squealing in my grasp.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.720
His lionesses' mournful cry. That's my lullaby.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.080
Scar is gone, but Zira's still around to love this little lad

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.960
'til he learns to be a killer
with a lust for being bad.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.720
(singing) One day when you're big and strong.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.900
No, mother!

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.440
Where's your pretty daughter Nala?

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.400
Pull the lever Kronk.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.300
Wrong lever!

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.220
Who does that ungrateful little worm think he is?

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.100
Does he have any idea who he's dealing with?

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.660
Tell me Kuzco's dead, I have to hear these words.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.940
Oh boys!

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.400
Rapunzel stop with the mumbling, you know
I hate the mumbling.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.700
I see a young, beautiful, confident young woman...

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.280
Oh you're here too.
Ha ha ha!

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.060
I tease, I tease. I love you so much.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.400
(singing) Mother knows best take it
from your mumsy, you know you won't survive.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.020
Well that wraps it up!

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.520

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.420
I can't do it.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.440
- I almost just lost it.

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.639
