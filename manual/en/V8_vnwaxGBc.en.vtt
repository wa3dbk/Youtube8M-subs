00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.840
Okay, so what I did, I just walked around
through the plants and I just took, I just

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.150
cut tips off of things so we could propagate
some of these. Here again, this is a vinca,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.010
before we looked at that yucky vinca. But
this is nice and green and would make a nice

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.560
cutting. It should root very well. It's a
lot thicker. It's a lot greener. We did the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.000
coleus before. And this is a good size for
a cutting. I might take some of these bigger

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.309
leaves off so that it's about four sets of
nicely, I mean, two sets of leaves. This is

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.429
an English ivy. You can tell it was cut before;
there's a cut point right there. And so, maybe

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:48.890
I might just cut it a little above that and
take a leaf off. That's a good size. You know,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.340
they just need to be a couple of inches. Some
people ask me "how many nodes? How many nodes

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.809
need to be below the ground?" And it doesn't
really matter. Just a couple of inches, you

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:08.479
know. Here's another one, lantana. If you
are worried that these leaves are too big,

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.960
because some leaves are big, you can cut some
of it off. You don't have to. But if you think

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.670
that it's going to wilt too much, it will
be fine. And see, this one's starting to go

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:25.030
into flower and we could pluck these flowers
off. So that's one type of lantana. And I

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.850
have another one which is a different color.
This is a yellow. And it's not flowering,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:39.020
so, oh, it does have a bud. So we'll take
that off. And then we have plitrampus. Same

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.270
thing, like the colias, I'll probably take
some of these off. And I'll take these off.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.790
So, and it will surprise you. So we are going
to stick this in the soil and then it could

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.119
root from the base of the plant or it could
root from the leaves. So, having a certain

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.159
number of nodes below the ground you really
have to know exactly the plant and where it's

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:07.789
going to root and I really don't think it
matters. Here's some bridal veil that we cut

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.980
before. This one's a little too long and it's
kind of wispy. So I might stick more than

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.260
one together to get them to root. But this
stuff roots pretty easily. So, this one's

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.981
in flower, so I know this plant, and I know
that it roots fairly easy, but if I saw all

00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:29.820
these flowers on a plant I didn't know, I'd
probably avoid this shoot and I'd go for something

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.260
else. So this, I might just throw away and
pick up another one.
