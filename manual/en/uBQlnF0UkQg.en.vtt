00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700
Add a new floor

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.060
Change the number of columns

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.480
Change the length of the floor

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:18.340
Change the length of the boards

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.480
Change the width of the boards

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.340
Add some randomness to the width

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.500
Change the seed distribution 

00:00:30.954 --> 00:00:33.594
Add a gap between the columns

00:00:33.594 --> 00:00:37.054
Add a gap between the rows

00:00:41.476 --> 00:00:45.576
Shift the columns

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:48.636
Add some randomness to the shift

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:53.929
Here, the columns are shift 1 by 1

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.869
Change the number of columns

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.420
You can fill the gap between the rows

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.980
by adding a transversal

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.405
Here, the transversal matches each column

00:01:10.405 --> 00:01:18.145
Changing the number of columns to be shift, will modify the length of the transversal

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:38.820
Coordinate the 'Gap Y' and the length of the boards will allow to create a 'Squares' pattern

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:49.290
You still can change the other parameters, the floor will evolve accordingly

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.100
Sometimes, the length of the floor will not match the length of the boards

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.540
Turn on the 'Switch' button and the length of the floor will be change accordingly

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.620
'Unlock' allow to change manually the length of the transversal

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:32.080
You can tilt the boards to create a 'Chevron' pattern

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:47.000
and you can still change the other parameters 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.520
The 'Herringbone' button allow you to create an Herringbone pattern

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.714
You can create UV and vertex groups in edit mode

00:03:27.714 --> 00:03:33.294
The color parameters (Phase or Random) will create as many groups as colors

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:38.443
The 'Phase' will add new colors arranged by boards

00:03:38.443 --> 00:03:42.783
Each color will be link to a group

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.640
This will help to distribute a wood texture for each group of board

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.420
All the UV are grouped together at the origin

00:03:54.936 --> 00:04:00.456
Scale them accordingly to your texture

00:04:00.456 --> 00:04:05.636
Then, select them by using the vertex group

00:04:05.636 --> 00:04:16.036
you can now easily select and distribute each UV group on the texture

00:04:17.397 --> 00:04:21.237
the color distribution can also be used in the node editor 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.680
Each color group matches a wood texture 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.060
You can change the seed distribution

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.740
Or add a random distribution 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.760
Thanks for watching
