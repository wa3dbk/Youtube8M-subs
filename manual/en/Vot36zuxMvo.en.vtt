00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.220
Scot: Alright, whether you're looking to just
get fit or just cruise around the town, you're

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.030
going to want to grab a pair of these Cardiff
Skates. We're back with Brian Green, the inventor

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.259
who's from right here in Connecticut. These
are fantastic.

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.830
Brian: Thank You.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.910
Kara: Brian, you're from Enfield and we can
get these everywhere -- they're at Target...

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.340
Brian: They're at Target stores nationwide,
Brookstone nationwide, we're doing some Costco

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.429
Roadshows around the country, so if you go
out to Costco look for Roadshows, Cardiff

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:27.089
Skate, you'll see us there doing live demos.
Online at Dick's, online at Sports Authority,

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.089
and online at Cardiff Skate and other online
retailers.

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.130
Scot: Now Kara has two different models on,
what does she got going on here?

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.200
Brian: Kara has, we have basically three different
models. We have our Youth model -- which comes

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.610
in Strawberry and Lime...

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.000
Scot: We got the Lime right here.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.940
Brian: So it comes in Strawberry and Lime.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.160
Kara: And the cool thing about these is -- well,
pink for the girls, green for the boys -- but

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.790
these little black discs on the wheels are
to help slow down, so if kids are just learning

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.640
they don't go as fast. This definitely, I
can feel that difference.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.470
Brian: Yeah. This doesn't have them, so these
roll really good. When you put those discs

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.770
on it slows them down for kids -- and adults
-- to learn. But the cool thing about these

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.110
is they automatically adjust -- they all work
the same way. As soon as you step in, they

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.289
adjust to your shoe size. So our Youth model
goes from size Youth 12 to Mens 5/Womens 6.

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.890
Our Adult Small model goes from size Boys
2/Girls 2 to Mens 8/Womens 9. And our Adult

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.609
Large goes from size Boys 4/Girls 5.5 to Mens
13/Womens 14. So you saw Scott cruising around

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:21.850
on these earlier. You just put your foot in
-- it automatically adjusts.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.039
Kara: So easy.

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.770
Brian: Yeah, very quick. And they're more
stable than any other skate because you have

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.979
-- this back wheel is actually a brake wheel.
So it's not on the ground when you're skating,

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.109
only when you're braking. So you're on three
wheels when you're braking, three wheels when

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.229
you're skating. And they're a little different
-- if you're an inline skater, you want to

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:45.130
get on edge. But on these it's more like skiing
or roller skating. To turn, you just pick

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.810
up that front wheel.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.799
Scot: Oh, you just pick up that front wheel.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.249
Brian: And then to brake, you slide one foot
forward -- like that -- and you're braking

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.799
on three wheels.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.630
Scot: Now, Brian, where did you get this idea
-- because I keep looking at roller skates,

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.119
they're not in, roller blades, they're not
in, and I'm like waiting for the next thing.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.770
This is the next thing. How did you come up
with this idea?

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.609
Brian: Well, it's been a long, long road.
This particular model took me 8 years of development,

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:13.280
testing, trips to Germany, trips to China.
Then I met my business partner a couple years

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.840
ago in San Diego and he's got 30 years of
retail experience. We did 19 Brookstone stores

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.980
for Christmas 2013 as a test and 52 Sport
Chalet -- which is a chain out in California

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.470
-- we did really well so went nationwide 2014
at Brookstone.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.630
Scot: And the price point is very good.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.080
Kara: These are great, I'm just going to twirl
around a little.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.760
Brian: $119.99 for the Cruisers -- Adults Large
and Small -- and then the Youth models are $79.99

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.960
Kara: Yeah, the Youth models -- one of them
is going faster than the other.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.880
Brian: This is the first time Kara's been
on them. And she's got the speed control discs

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.200
on the Strawberry skate.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.200
Kara: This one's going slower!

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.400
Brian: It just slows down the wheels, makes
it more stable for people to learn.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.630
Scot: But they can come off.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.620
Brian: They come off -- they come in the box,
they're actually not on. They come in the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.970
box and you put them on, you install them.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.240
Kara: That's what I love about this, because
you don't need -- you just wear your own shoes

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.010
and then just strap these on. So you don't
have to worry about -- with roller skates

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.510
or roller blades, you need...

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.960
Brian: One of the other things -- we've thought
it through -- we've tried to make it convenient,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.810
so if you're a commuter we have a carrying
case. And Scot, if you wouldn't mind grabbing

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.870
that one. We're getting a lot of college kids
that are really digging this. This is our

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.340
book bag. The skates go in the side pouch
and you carry your transportation, cruise

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.540
around campus, throw them on.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.420
Kara: Oh, so if you've got kids going to college
this fall, this would be a great thing to get them!

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.070
Brian: Yeah! So we have between the three
models -- the Youth skates go from size

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.960
Youth 12 to Boys 5/Girls 6, the Adult Small skates
go from size Boys 2/Girls 2 to Mens 8/Womens 9,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.190
and the Adult Large skates go from size
Boys 4/Girls 5.5 to Mens 13/Womens 14.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.750
So between them, we fit from a Youth 12 to an
Adult 13.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.990
Kara: So I should just save money and buy
the kid ones.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.870
Brian: I'll leave you a pair!

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.760
Kara: No, I'm just kidding!

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.380
Scot: Thank you Brian, we appreciate it. Good
luck to you.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.950
Brian: Another thing I was telling Scot earlier
is when you wear these, they make you taller!

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.970
Scot: They do make you taller absolutely.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.150
Kara: Yeah, I like that! Alright!

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.880
Scot: Thanks so much for watching Better Connecticut
today, thank you studio audience, we appreciate

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.170
it. Have a great day everybody!
