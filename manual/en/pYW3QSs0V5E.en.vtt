00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.340
Sunshine Village ski resort is a short drive
south west of Banff and boasts "the best snow

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.320
in Canada" - and that's no exaggeration. The
tree lined highway through Banff National

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.540
Park leads to the resort which covers Mount
Standish, Lookout Mountain, and Goat's Eye

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:37.300
Mountain. The ski area covers more than 3000
acres and there are over 100 uncrowded ski

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:45.520
trails serviced by 9 chair lifts - with almost
no waiting. The incredible high speed gondola

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.680
is a ride worth taking even if you don't plan
to ski, but skiing is what Sunshine Village

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.719
is all about! There are many wide uncrowded
slopes and steep tree-lined runs.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.239
The dry cold weather produces buckets of "powder
snow", and with almost 30 feet each season

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:13.130
there are slopes for everyone from beginner
to expert.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.400
The friendly instructors at the Kid's Kampus
will make skiing fun for even the youngest

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.500
skiers and boarders.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:29.010
The Sunshine Village Mountain Lodge offers
luxury accommodation right on the slopes.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.330
The well appointed lodge has ski-in ski-out
facilities and there's nothing better than

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:45.240
warming up beside a fire, or maybe relaxing
in the heated outdoor spa overlooking 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.240
the slopes.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.880
There is a comprehensive hire shop on the
mountain as well as a Day Lodge and several

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.670
bars and restaurants. With great snow, great
facilities and spectacular scenery only fifteen

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.969
minutes from Banff, Sunshine Village is THE
place to ski in Alberta.
