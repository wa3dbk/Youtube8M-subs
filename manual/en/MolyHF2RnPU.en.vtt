00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.840
Diamonds are awesome! :D

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.160
Best thing in Minecraft :D

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.700
There's nothing better than diamonds

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.280
What's this noise.. (dramatic music starts)

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.200
I hope it's not what I think it is...

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.400
I think I know where it's coming from...

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.840
DIRT IS AWESOME!

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.840
BEST THING IN MINECRAFT! :D

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.940
DIRT WOOHOO

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.620
DIRT IS AMAZING!!!!!!

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.920
wow...

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.760
I hate those people...

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.900
Why do they like dirt so much??

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.180
It doesn't make sense...

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.080
i no it does not but some day it will

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.680
So they can't constantly cherish it

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.620
*Ding*

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.700
If Dirt was Rare

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.460
If Dirt was Rare - Made By Orepros

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:40.960
If Dirt was Rare - Made By Orepros - Remember to leave a 'like :D'

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.640
So... I heard dirt is rare now.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.220
 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.560
This is a silly idea...

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.780
It only makes the environment* uglier

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.700
Who would even look for dirt?

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.080
 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.520
No!!! Dirt is rare!!!

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.680
We'll have to search all day!

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.680
We've gotta find it

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.800
A few minutes later...

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.120
So dirt is rare now...

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.660
I need to find some since it's rare, so I can be cool..

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.540
Actually...

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.560
 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.980
But how do I find dirt?

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.760
I can help you with that:)

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.040
How about you give me a stack of diamond blocks?

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.220
...for a guide to find dirt.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.400
Without it, you'll never find dirt!

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.700
What do you say?

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.900
I guess you're right...

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.040
Since dirt is now rare

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.580
I'll need a guide to find some

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.140
Here.....

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.660
Take the diamond blocks

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.380
HEY!

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.120
GET BACK HERE!

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.160
Meanwhile..

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.580
Time to do the impossible!

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.640
I'll find dirt!

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.880
wow... this sounded so silly

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.060
Dirt isn't supposed to be rare

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.220
oh well

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.100
Time to find dirt!
