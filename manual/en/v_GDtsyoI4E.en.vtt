00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:41.780
&gt;&gt;The 2013 Honda CR-V is longer, sleeker and
more sophisticated than the earlier generation

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.489
CR-V. However, in passing there is some semblance
of Volvo's design language looking at the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.829
rear tail-lamps and tapering window-lie.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.040
The front is typically Honda, with angular
twin-beam headlamps, with HID projectors.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.079
The side looks quite aerodynamic and the CR-V
looks a bit low slung -- in fact, ground clearance

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.929
is only a passable 170 mm, not quite enough
for off-road use.

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:11.570
The Honda CR-V is loaded with features.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.050
The layout of the dashboard is all new -- it
has twin LCD screens, one with the infotainment

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.450
system and one further ahead.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.560
The speedometer is flanked by the warning
lamps and has another LCD screen.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:37.299
Beside it are two white bars that turn green
if you 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:54.930
drive 
in 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.070
a fuel efficient manner.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.130

The host of features in the CR-V include the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.700
electric sun-roof and touchscreen GPS navigation
system with Bluetooth phone controls.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.610
All variants now come with a reverse camera
as well.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.640
The beige leather upholstery also gives the
SUV an airy feel.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.720
The driver's seat is power adjustable, while
there's good legroom in the rear seats as

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.720
well.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.310
Other standard features include power-folding
mirrors with turn indicators, foot-operated

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.970
parking brake, six airbags and dual-zone automatic
climate control.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.720
An interesting feature of the CR-V is this
large green Econ button.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.120
Press it and a leaf symbol lights up in the
dash -- what this does is it tweaks the engine

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.620
management system to drive in an eco-friendly
manner with lower pollution and better fuel

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.830
economy.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.970
Another very unique feature is this single
lever operated flip-fold rear seats.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.930
Pull the lever and the seats tumble forward,
while the seat base also lifts up, creating

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.519
a fully flat loading area.

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:07.510
The Honda CR-V is powered by a 2.4 litre petrol
engine that puts out 187 bhp of power at 7,000

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.240
rpm and 226 Nm of torque at 4,400 rpm.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.400
This is mated to a five-speed automatic transmission
that features a sports mode as well.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.560
And if you want to manually shift gears you
can use the paddles behind the steering wheel.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.739
The CR-V is equipped with traction control,
motion adaptive power steering and all-round

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.310
disc brakes with ABS.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.960
During quick lane changes, these help in keeping
things under control.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.010
For relaxed cruising, cruise control works
well and helps a bit with fuel economy.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.560
However, overall fuel economy with some hard
driving is a bit low at just under eight kilometres

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.800
to the litre, while Honda claims 12 kmpl under
test conditions.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.900
While the Honda CR-V handles really well on-road
and can cruise at a relaxed 100 kmph at 1900

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.750
rpm all day long, it can also handle some
of the rough stuff.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.010
The CR-V has a torque on demand all-wheel
drive system, which detects wheel spin and

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.080
transfers power to the rear wheels as needed,
especially in slushy conditions.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.979
For mild off-road use, this system works well,
and makes the CR-V decently capable on rough

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:25.090
terrain -- just don't go all-out mud plugging
with it.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.900
Fuel-efficiency aside, the Honda CR-V is excellent
value for money for the kind of features and

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.759
refinement it offers.

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.969
Rather than comparing it with another SUV,
the CR-V will actually give some luxury sedans

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:40.759
a run for their money.

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:46.009
If you don't travel much, but want sedan-like
ride quality with the versatility of an SUV,

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.360
the CR-V is a good choice.
