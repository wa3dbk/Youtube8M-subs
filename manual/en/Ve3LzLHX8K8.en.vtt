Hi, I'm Patrick and this is a PICAXE Computer
I made, it runs the operating system I programmed

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.750
PLOS (which stands for Patrick Leiser Operating
System). As you can see the battery's low,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.750
anyway it has a text editor, where you can
type and the save it, in this case as youtube.txt

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:32.060
save it to an SD card and it also has a calculator where it can do math like 567 divided by 5

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.220
which is 113 it also has a timer where, say,
you can set it to count for 5 seconds, and

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.130
then it will count down it can do that in
the background even when other applications

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.050
are running [alarm sounds] and I'm not sure
if you can hear it, but it's sounding an alarm

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:06.050
sound now
so now the battery's dead so I'm going to

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:14.869
give you and inside look.
and 
now you can see the inside, this is the CPU

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.130
which is a PICAXE 28X2 microcontroller this
is the keyboard monitor, which is also a 28X2

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.759
microcontroller both of which I programmed
and this is the SD card reader. it originally

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:44.759
had a cable going outside the case so you
could access the SD card from outside the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.590
case, but then that broke and here's the power
supply: 3 AA batteries one of which is dead

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:02.209
so I'm swapping that out and here we have
an Ethernet cable, not used for ethernet,

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:13.079
but to get 8 wires to the top half of the
case where it has speakers, and the display:

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.950
a serial 20 by 4 character OLED display, the
battery is now good anyway these are the programming

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.080
cables and this is the cable that goes to
the keyboard, a PS/2 cable and now I have

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.930
to put it back together.
now that I replaced the batteries I'll show

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:56.079
you the SD card, here is a file I wrote earlier.
Also here is what I typed earlier in the video.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.950
The main program for this was 1367 lines,
the keyboard program 155 lines, the display

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.930
program was 166 lines, and the work in progress
program that allows you to write a program

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.010
and run that program on here (not needing
a computer), anyway that program is 435 lines.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.010
the total program length for all the programs
combined is 2123 lines of PICAXE BASIC.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.790
You might be wondering how it all works, well
basicaly this is the CPU microcontroller,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.840
a PICAXE 28X2, it's prorammed through here,
it is normally programmed with a USB-headphones

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.840
cable but you can see here that it has a headphone
extension cable that allows you to program

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:34.479
it from outside the case the keyboard monitor
works the same way and communicates with the

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.340
CPU through i2c which is a communication protocol
that allows multiple devices on the same two

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.780
wires to communicate with each other and notice
multiple devices, so I also used this SD card

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.780
reader which als uses i2c to communicate with
the CPU and it uses a single wire with the

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:08.889
serial (UART) protocol to communicate through
this way and then to the display here.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.650
With this computer I won 1st in the Sacramento
Regional Science Fair and 4th place in the

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.000
California State Science Fair!
