00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:08.700
up what's going on what the market from
phoneDog dot com it's the 13 on the LG

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.870
floods challenged

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.210
now events are going on are currently
during the LGG what charges

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.580
in tandem so a lot of our coverage will
overlap in terms of what we cover in her

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.270
charges

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.439
for all the seats in different format
his left order form

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.609
and my lil B&amp; YouTube video for me in
this call several types %ah

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.050
style so this is the 32 the LTTE flex
charted its

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.130
all focused on but this play up the LGG

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.760
let me know GG plus hassle-free special
traits but a lot of other phone just

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.680
don't have a clue to the iPhone yes for
yes 5

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.270
all the HTC one's this phone is flexible

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.050
which means they can actually moved from
its original state

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.039
become flat reconstruction more it's
just really weird down street unless you

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.539
kind of just pushing down on a hard flat
surface

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.030
but this can take solace in terms of the
setting on accident

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.850
bring your back pocket he said known for
a while and just don't notice your phone

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.530
being smushed

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.060
under and this phone won't take but
abuse am we just fine a person ever

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.729
broken a bone by sitting on it but I've
heard people breaking their iPhones

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.110
and it's a I guess it's a common
occurrence for someone who has

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.780
iPhone in their back pocket not display
measures in at six inches and its only

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.659
at 1280 by 720 such or 720 P

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.409
around 245 pixels per inch a bit more
into into further part this challenge

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.430
I it's not the highs pixel density on
display and display such this big

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.460
six-inches' kinda looks a little fuzzy
we'll have to see how this affects the

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.090
LGG

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.530
what challenge NBA 13 all wrapped around
display

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.220
so why does work for Hannah and enjoy
the LGG fluxes you probably all know

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.200
says flexible sorta highly durable
device that can take being flattened

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.270
sat on her even being scratched on the
back cover its display measures in at

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.890
six inches at its current state

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.700
and it uses technology named PO let PO
lead is similar to be organic LED

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.770
technology found in phones like the
Samsung Galaxy devices

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.750
but it uses a RGB set up which means
that users were correct

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.320
red green and blue sup pixels in the
correct order it gives off

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.039
accurate in bright colors and also does
eliminate a lot of the glare in the

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.789
sunlight

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.260
there's been a lot of talk about the LGG
flex being very subpar

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.290
with their display only for any 720 P
display while other smaller felt that

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.849
the LG Nexus 5 can carry a fourth
nineteen twenty

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.379
by 1080 P resolution on a smaller
display

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.540
yes display isn't exactly a sharp as
you'd expect to be experience is just as

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.010
good

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.440
I think we should be passed the PPI
sensor eyes will truly not be able to

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.269
see pixels

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.220
after 300 pixels per inch but this
outside the pixel keepers PG flex comes

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.599
in at 245 pixels per inch

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.379
yes what's 55-plus from the retina
boundary that we all now know

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.599
but it's still a very detailed and crisp
display another great feature is the

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.099
curved display itself

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.160
watching any type video feels like
you're watching something on what are

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.920
those curves solar panel CCS CES

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.269
it's not only good when you watch videos
browsing the web of a lotta content

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.120
gives you to loosen up a display kinda
wrapping around you it's kinda small

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.209
but you gotta for a couple that were
created here it's a very

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.670
call experience so even with the claims
that this display not working this

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.659
Christmas others

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.420
the way it looks and more importantly
the way it feels does that leave a like

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.560
a pixel density

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.239
so there you have a Bigg flights it's
not the best display

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.010
its only at 245 pixels per inch it's not
super pixel thats but technically you

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.730
really still can't see the pixels I mean
I guess if you

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.040
look super super close to display
probably burn your retinas for one but

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.900
also you'll be seeing individual pixels

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.390
but since it has archie panel that's
similar to a TV

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.709
but colorful really papillion national
on the start so

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.480
I'm us into bat display after saying
it's not the best display currently

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.030
around

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.470
and even if we have 4k I'm talking about
having almost 4,000 pixels

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.019
in 2000 pixels it won't make a
difference because our eyes cannot

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.959
distinguish the actual pixels

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.370
the same thing that we talked about that
be right on the slow one the iPhone 4

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.000
came out

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.250
our brothers cannot see more than 300
pixels per inch

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.989
in normal output like were not as yet
many pixels of working this way

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.900
even the dollar home you really if you
want to have the best 24k

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.870
get a 55 inch TV at least to experience
for Kate it's true for glory so my name

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.739
is Martin have a phone I dot com let us
know what you think

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.990
up the LGG what if you wanna see more
things at Bigg

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.550
what child it for myself or Evan let us
know in the comments below or a photon

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.680
got homework to her up for like
underscore market for myself

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.000
at so not underscore Evan for events so
again my name is mark for her phone dot

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.520
dot com to see you guys

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.250
the next video
