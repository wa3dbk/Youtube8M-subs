00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.020
(Huskies howling) 
"Aroooooo!"

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.300
Shiloh!  I love you!
(bark)

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.980
Oh!  I love you too!

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.540
(growls)

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.340
I love you!  That's a good girl!

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.300
I love you!

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.660
I love you!
(barks)

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.140
Oh!  I love you too!

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.860
We get you a treat!

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.040
Look at you girls!
You've been so good...

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.320
They been so good...

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.980
That we shown you guys,
the girls had been trapped in this room...

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.860
Or in the hallway.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.040
They will be here for a little while,
while we're working the floor.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.640
(Jessica) Say hi Jamie!
(Jamie) Hi Jamie!

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.720
We're working on the floor and the dogs
are kind of stuck in here.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.140
I think they're OK with it...

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.560
We had to move the water dish here...

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.600
This room kind of got full, so they don't
have as much space as they normally do.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.060
So...

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.040
I want to give them a treat.
What you think?  You girls want a treat?

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.580
Want peanut butter 'sammish?'

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.340
You want a peanut butter sandwich?
What you think Oakley?

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.020
I was told, you really like peanut butter sandwiches.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.140
So, we're taking them outside and
give them a 'peanut butter sammish.'

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.480
Yum! Yum!  Yum!

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.500
Here's the peanut butter sandwich I made for the dogs.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.500
They each get two pieces.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.500
I'm going to get them and
give them, their sandwich.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.140
Alright!  Whoa!
I almost knocked the gate down!

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.300
I changed plans... It was windy outside
and wanted you guys to hear this.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.880
We're gonna give it to them, inside.
What you think?

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.340
Peanut butter sandwich?

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.620
What you think?

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.340
Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh!

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.860
There goes!

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.300
Here Shi!

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.880
You get a piece too.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.060
(laughter)

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.580
I think, Oakley ate both your pieces...

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.340
I think, she did.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.780
That what I get for not paying
close attention to what I'm doing...

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.220
Look all the peanut butter on the floor.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.360
(laughter)

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.060
What you think?
Was that a good treat?

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.500
Did you liked that?
You just warped it right down.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.300
That's the fastest I think, I've ever seen
any of you eating anything we made.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.680
Oakley's going to clean the floor with her tongue.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.440
What?  Shiloh only got
one piece.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.780
Will have to give you another piece.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.560
I guess you got a piece of the
sandwich I ate, so technically you got
two (2) pieces.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.620
Is that good stuff?

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.200
Good stuff, huh?
Maybe will give them another one later.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.980
Alright!  Back to work on the floor.
