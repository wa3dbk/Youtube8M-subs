00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:01.950
Anthony: Hey.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.460
This is Anthony of RevZilla T.V., where you
can watch, decide, and ride.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.800
Welcome to our detailed breakdown of the new
Alpinestars Tech 7 off-road boot, available

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.969
at RevZilla.com.

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.160
So the Tech 7, new for 2013.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.920
This is a legacy product in the Alpinestars'
line.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.090
It's getting a complete overhaul, and we like
what they've done.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.000
New for this year, we saw a brand new Tech
7, brand new Tech 10.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.690
The theme is low profile, lighter weight.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.320
The new Tech 7 is going to be 15% lighter,
three and a half pounds.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.500
They're shaving a lot down, and it's now lower
profile.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.320
Before I get into any of the other changes,
look at from the buckles to the side profile

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.079
to the toe, even the profile coming straight
on.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.250
You're going to see it's just much more streamlined,
even the interior here on the medial side.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.170
Nothing is getting in the way of itself.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.350
Now remember the positioning here on the Tech
7.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.970
It's a lighter weight boot than something
like the Tech 8 Light or even the Tech 10.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.030
There's no inner bootie here.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.060
It has that really short and low profile toe.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.420
A lot of guys in the super cross side like
it, a lot of guys that don't want any kind

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.840
of mid inner bootie like you have with a Tech
8 Light or a full inner bootie with the dual

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.469
hinge like you'd see on a Tech 10, they like
that lineup of functionality.

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.030
Now I will say this is also one of the few
pro level boots.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.909
I will say it's a pro level boot because a
pro would choose this boot based on its mix

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.549
of features, sub $400.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.929
From here, you go into Tech 3, which in my
opinion is a rock solid midrange off-road

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:27.929
boot.

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.799
The Tech 7 has enough of the DNA of the Tech
10 and the Tech 8 Light, to where it really

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.780
steps up into that next stratosphere.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.100
So, let's talk about fitment before I get
into all the rest of the changes and walk

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.729
through it nuts and bolts.

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.109
Fitment, sizes, American size.

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:41.409
No questions here.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.310
The footbed is going to be comfortable.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.950
It's going to fit an American foot.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.950
It's a shoe.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.249
So, you shouldn't have any problems.

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:48.249
And remember, guys.

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:49.869
We do ship for free over $39.

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.450
It's going to ship for free, no restock fees,
and we're here to help you.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.109

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:01.890
But also, leave me your comments and your
questions as I roll through this.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.819
So you can get an idea, and I can answer your
questions about the different features of

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:05.819
the boot.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:06.819
So let's dive in.

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:07.819
Let's go from the outside in.

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.149
We're going to focus on changes.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.409
First thing you're going to notice, completely
redesigned buckle system for 2013.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.730
It's using cast buckles before.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.739
Now you'll see on the Tech 10 and the Tech
7.

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:17.739
These are newer style.

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.129
They're still set it and forget it, but the
way that they work does two things really

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.129
well.

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.430
I can see here, even on the instep, these
buckles on top so it doesn't get in the way

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.430
in a crash.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.769
But the way that these work is you have these
big, these almost arrowheads that slide through

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.430
a huge loop.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.159
What happens is they're self-adjusting.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.470
So there's room to wiggle, and they don't
have anywhere to go.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.510
They almost fit into a wedge, so you can't
screw them up.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.930
The nice part too is when they're caked with
mud, it's easy to get your finger in there

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.930
and work them.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.140
It's less small parts, like you saw with the
previous iteration on the buckles on the outside.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.930
Also, underneath these buckles, you have a
few other components pulling this boot together.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.100
You have a microfiber elasticated upper here
in different areas, but the main construction

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.709
of the boot outside of this sueded area that
has the embossed is going to be microfiber.

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.280
Remember, there's six colors here as well.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.920
So that's going to be a synthetic leather.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.569
It has limited imperfections, and that's how
you save that 15% in weight, going from leather

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.109
to the microfiber side of things.

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.141
Also for the first time in the Tech 7, we're
seeing that it's a single T.P.U. piece that

00:03:13.141 --> 00:03:15.459
wraps around the heel, wraps into the toe.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.719
The toe is completely redesigned and re-profiled.

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:21.109
Notice this T.P. that wraps around the front
of the toe into the shift panel here.

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.049
So again, one piece pulling everything together,
pulling upper of the boot into the dual compound

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.049
sole.

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.079
Alpinestars loves to talk about their soles
because their soles rock.

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.990
This inner area that's high-grip around your
pegs is fully replaceable, but then you have

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.109
your main sole, which is a different durometer
and hardest.

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.249
It gives you support.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.519
It's going to offer you protection as well.

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.349
Also, you can see as you move up the shin,
completely redesigned on the front of the

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:43.349
boot.

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.810
Big, beefy, and it's shin protection.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.579
Rolling around with some of those external
hard parts and T.P. in the back gives you

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.430
now the blade system, which we only saw on
the higher-end boots before, which guards

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.609
against hyperflexion.

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.440
So again, you have tongue-in-groove system
that allows for comfort and range of motion,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.709
not going to get in the way of anything.

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.359
But again, it's going to guard against impacts
and hyperflexion of your ankle joint if you

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:04.719
get yourself into trouble.

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:08.340
Now, staying within that same theme, let's
move to the medial side of the boot.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.609
Now we have a completely redesigned heat shield
that also has a grip panel to it throughout

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:13.720
its one piece.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.080
Notice the reset stool stitching, but now
it's also hinged, hinged there.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.220
So, it's going to move with you, allowing
you to get this massive panel to interface

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.220
with your ride that also now has a hinge for
articulation So, bravo, Alpinestars.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.100
It's a continuation on what you know really
works at the highest level, and that DNA of

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.330
the $600 boot is now making its way down to
that $360 boot or somewhere right in that

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.690
$300 to $400 price range.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.780
Other thing you're going to notice right out
of the gates, look at the top of this boot,

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.900
completely redesigned again, on the Tech 10
as well.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.100
It's now soft on the top.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.440
It used to have a big T.P.U. piece that was
really heavy duty.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.690
Honestly you're always going to put your pants
in there, but depending on how you where it

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.440
and how you're built, it might get in the
way at times.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.500
Now we're moving to a much softer interface
for your body.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.090
It's an ergonomic and comfort feature that
the top of this is just going to be set up

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.450
to be a little bit more friendly.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.380
Now when we think about, and I'm going to
pull my sole out here, using a new style sole

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.390
with different densities of material and shock
absorption in the heel.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.390
You can see that.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.680
Let's open this bad boy up.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.130
So, pulling my Tech 10 or my Tech 7 here apart,
pulling out all my poison dart frog, whatever

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.080
we're going to call these, whatever we're
going to call these buckles, this new style.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.950
Notice multiple points and free floating design,
even in my shin T.P.U.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.310
That's done for flexibility.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.210
If it was one solid piece, it makes it harder
for you to move with the boot, or really for

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.710
the boot to move with you.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.250
So, by doing that, you're adding flexibility.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.650
I moved to the inside.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.860
It's not a waterproof boot.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.560
They never are in the dirt world unless you're
going in venture.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.300
What it is is a gator to try to keep some
moisture and some of that incessant dirt out

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.320
when you're riding for longer periods of time.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.120
Moving to the inside, again, it's going to
be comfortable.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.190
The top has been refinished, Cambrelle lining.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.190
It's wicking.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.130
It's meant to pull the sweat away from your
foot out to the outer shell of the boot and

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.660
evaporate it off.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.370
So as I put it back together here, one more
thing to call out, you know.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.540
I've harped on a lot of the key changes here
that allow you to streamline this boot, allow

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.970
it to become lower profile.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.740
But one of the things that people don't realize
too is in the predecessor for this boot, it

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.130
actually had a multi-piece sole that was a
stitched sole.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.020
That would be interior of the T.P.U. outer
shell.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.190
By using a single piece bonded sole, that's
really one piece of T.P.U. that's molded with

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.130
no inner stitch panel connecting this top
to the bottom here.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:28.370
What they've been able to do is really completely
shave down the profile of this boot.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.780
This is probably the most technical low profile
boot in the A-stars off-road line, when you

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.862
compare it to something like a Tech 8 Light.

00:06:33.862 --> 00:06:35.940
It has that traditional sole.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.870
Even the beefier Tech 10, which is just a
little bit bigger, it's a little more MX inspired.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.570
So, I will say this, guys.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.940
The next step in your journey, put my sole
back in there.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:44.940
Keep it for later.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.150
The next step in your journey is to read other
rider reviews at RevZilla.com.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.260
I can tell you all day long why it's different,
why that's important, and what it's going

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.260
to mean to you.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.990
But what you need to do is stand on the shoulders
of my information and my knowledge and read

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.590

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.300
I'm Anthony.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.305
