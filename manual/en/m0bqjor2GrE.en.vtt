00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.250
I am SÃ¡ra Varsa, I am the director of operations for the

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.010
Animal Cruelty Rescue &amp; Response Team for the Humane Society of the United States

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.700
We're in Columbia, Mississippi today we were

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.200
called out to assist law enforcement
Marion County Sheriff's Department

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.700
there are over 100 animals on the property and they're all in different stages

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.200
of neglect

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.119
that one agency

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.320
could accomplish what we're
accomplishing here today and to do it

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.250
all in one day

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.870
on this property we have many horses

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.370
donkeys, mules, horses...

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.910
goats, sheep, cats, dogs...

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.390
the list is quite long

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.480
Oh my gosh look at his too

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.120
The scene is like a maze of enclosures tucked in this

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.880
wooded area

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.280
It's hard to see where one stops and another one starts

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.340
there are freshly decomposing bodies hidden underneath tarps

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.710
Can you imagine living your whole life out here and then

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.290
you die in this is the kind of dignity
that you get?

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.770
Oh for God's sake...

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.720
in one of the pens with the minis there was

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.250
a tarp covering up bodies of

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.760
other minis who had recently passed

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.320
Oh I think I just stepped on someone

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.680
I just can't even imagine just how a
couple feet away from where you're living

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.600
the bodies of your brothers and sisters I mean it's just

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.900
it's really appalling

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.540
Oh my God!

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:10.490
the most heinous part of the job

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.960
You always want to get there fast enough

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.600
and it's hard to see the ones that you
can't, that you just didn't get to in time

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.060
so that's always hard to see

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.739
We know that it's a reality when you're dealing with these

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.220
large-scale cases but

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.940
my heart breaks for them

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.660
The only

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.890
the only thing that we can console ourselves with is the fact that

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.660
they didn't die alone and they didn't die

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.620
never feeling a compassionate touch

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.930
from everything that we've seen on the
property so far

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.370
this is typical of what we've seen
in other hoarding cases

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.960
so it would be a good guess to say

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.740
this is what we are dealing with today

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.280
it was hard to see everything that we saw here

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.820
today

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.820
I'm so glad that the animals' leaving and are not going to have to suffer the same fate

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.820
as the others

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.960
Finally get some fresh air, huh?

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.490
This poor guy is just in the back of a rusted old

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.660
horse trailer

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.400
He's this big beautiful creature and he's trying to make himself into a tiny ball

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.340
it just breaks your heart

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.010
there's still a long road ahead for these animals They're all gonna need

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.050
very extensive medical treatment

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.760
to assess their conditions and try to rehabilitate them so they have

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.810
a long road ahead of them and we have a lot of
work to do but

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.800
you know we are committed to making sure that we give animals the best possible

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.849
care that we can

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:36.729
see them move on to happy homes

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.169
and forever homes

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.609
We do this job because we care

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.180
and there are going to be a lot of
animals that are better off after today

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:47.369
but it's also pretty heartbreaking

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.000
It still takes our breath away
