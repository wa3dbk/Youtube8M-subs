00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.920
Today we are going to be installing Curt hitch
part number 13336 on a 2004 Pontiac Montana.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.160
All right, we are underneath the vehicle,
and we are looking at the passengers side

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.010
frame rail.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.480
You can see here at the bottom we have got
three existing bolts in the frame.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.020
We are going to be removing those.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.060
And those weld nuts in the frame are going
to be providing our three attaching points

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.370
here at the bottom of the frame.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.230
And that will be the same on both sides of
the vehicle.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.370
You can see also on the side of the frame
we have got this hole just below this square

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.370
slot.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.240
We are also going to be putting a bolt and
block into the frame and pulling it out this

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.690
way, and that will provide an attaching point
on the side of the frame.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.980
And again, that will be the same on both sides
of the vehicle.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.070
Looking over here at the drivers side, again
we are using the same attaching points.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.360
But you can see the two middle weld nuts do
not have any bolts in them currently, and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.870
there is quite a bit of rust and corrosion
built up in them.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.110
So the first thing we want to do is to go
ahead and clean those out to ensure that the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.480
bolts go in easier.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.300
Once we have confirmed that, we can go ahead
and remove the bolts that are in the bottom

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:09.780
of the frame on both sides, and then we will
go ahead and put our hitch up into position.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:02:26.800
Note here that the fascia support arm that
we just removed 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:47.709
the bolt from, that is actually 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:03:12.610
going to stay on here.
