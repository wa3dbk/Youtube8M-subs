00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:03.730
this is a

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.950
walkthrough of my house

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.910
its a couple years later

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.260
since the last video

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.099
the floors are new

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.480
I replaced the beaten up wood floors

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.480
with the uh...

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.560
um

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.000
laminate in the kitchen which would be
more durable and its

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.630
actually linoleum and laminate
flooring

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.710
for the main living room area

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.960
it doesn't have quite the pop that the
old

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.530
wood floors did but I think it'll last a
lot longer

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.470
I also replaced all the cabinet doors
on the top

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.800
with uh.. Barker MDF after doors that I
ordered online

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.830
painted them myself so its

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.410
do a quit thing for the basement

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:24.369
not a big deal steps are

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.720
repainted...that is some extra linoleum

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.440
a little dusty down here .... sump pump

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.700
walls did have a mildew problem down
here but I treated it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.950
and no mildew has comeback

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.950
which means the treatment held pretty
well hard to see in here

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:03.260
this is where equipment furnace is

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:28.099
head upstairs

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.760
so

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.370
second floor here is the first

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.319
full bath... smaller of the two

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:52.319
second-floor bedrooms

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.570
is the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.630
other second floor bathroom

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.630
larger

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.960
largest room in-house

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.580
bedroom anyway

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.380
new vent put in

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.420
this is the neighborhood in baltimore

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.310
and we go upstairs.. this is where the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.310
worst part was  in the past

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.159
by

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:58.159
it has all been cleaned up

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.030
Its not too warm up here today

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.860
shot through to

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.860
the other side

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.120
um..

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:33.120
and another view of the neighborhood

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.580
so that's pretty much it

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.800
this isn't a super wide angle lens like my other one

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.520
but i think it gives a pretty good idea

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.520
what has changed about to put in some

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.330
new tenants and I'm sure they're

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.889
much more responsible
