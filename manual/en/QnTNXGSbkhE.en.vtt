00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:04.740
10 Reasons To Start Playing Destiny: The Taken
King

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.340
Destiny: The Taken King is a new expansion
to the base Destiny game set to release on

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.030
September 15th.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.769
If you've never played Destiny before but
want to get into it, The Taken King is a must-play

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.700
for fans of epic space odysseys and loot-based
shooters.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.020
And if you tried Destiny at launch, but haven't
touched the game since then, we have ten great

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.300
reasons to play The Taken King.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:34.890
10) All Previous Content Included

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.280
If the only thing stopping you from getting
into Destiny is the fact that you haven't

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.420
played the original, never fear!

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.900
The �Legendary� edition, priced at $59.99,
comes with the base game as well as the first

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.330
two expansions: The Dark Below and House of
Wolves.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.210
You won't miss out on a single epic moment
in Destiny when you start with The Taken King.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.830
If you're already a Destiny fan and own both
expansions as well as the base game, The Taken

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.610
King is available to you as a digital download
for only $39.99.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.979
The price increase from previous expansions
shouldn't worry you though; The Taken King

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.790
will have about twice as much content as either
of the previous expansions.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.060
As an added bonus, if you buy the last-gen
version of The Taken King and end up purchasing

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.770
the next-gen console, you can get the next-gen
version of Taken King for free.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.609
Bungie's site says that this deal is available
�for a limited time�, though they don't

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.250
mention a specific date.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.049
9) More Exotic Weapons

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.799
Completionists who have already blown through
Destiny's extensive content since its September

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:39.029
2014 release will be happy to see that The
Taken King will feature more armor and weapons

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:43.399
that can be found in the solar system through
completing missions or purchasing in-game

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.921
from one of the three faction vendors.

00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:51.960
The armor was showcased at E3, and it is more
colorful, creative, and unique than previous

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.630
Destiny armor we've seen so far.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.509
And people love playing Destiny to hunt for
those coveted weapons like the Gjallarhorn.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.509
For you new players, the gally is the king
of all rocket launchers in any game.

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:00.509
New screenshots show off a Suros brand rocket
launcher that has the potential to top the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.509
gally.

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.569
Some have speculated that armor and weapons
exclusive to Taken King will show up in game

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.780
prior to the September 15th, 2015 release
as a teaser.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.600
Bungie did the same thing with the House of
Wolves release, and since The Taken King is

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.120
slated to be twice the size of HoW, early
releases are likely.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.440
8) All New Enemies

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.000
Oryx, The Taken King, is corrupted by Darkness.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.650
He has brought his army of The Fallen to take
revenge for the death of his son, Crota, in

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.840
The Dark Below expansion.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.819
The Fallen are made up of several new types
of enemies that present new challenges for

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.909
players of every class.

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:36.430
Paired with the new environments, The Fallen
will likely add a new dimension to gameplay

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.750
that Destiny players have been craving since
the release of the last expansions.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.830
The Fallen King Oryx himself looks formidable
as well.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.719
Unlike previous bosses who were merely larger
versions of existing enemies, Oryx has his

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.219
own unique, terrifying character design.

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:54.440
7) Progress Tracking

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.610
Among changes made to the actual functionality
of the game, there will be a new progress

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.269
bar that shows character reputation with different
factions, active bounties, and game completion

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.430
percentage.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.769
You can also pin your active quests and bounties
to the HUD for easy reference.

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.500
This may seem like a little thing, but it's
going to improve the flow of Destiny's gameplay

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.980
immensely by removing the need to constantly
reference the pause screen to view active

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.980
quests.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.319
6) New Strikes and Crucible maps

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.239
Multi-player games are only as good as their
maps, and The Taken King contains at least

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.530
four new multi-player maps for players to
enjoy: Sector 618, Bannerfall, Frontier, and

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.530
Crossroads.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.319
Bungie has announced that Sector 618 will
be exclusive to PlayStation gamers only until

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.269
fall of 2016, but after that, they will become
available to gamers on Xbox platforms.

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.650
5) New Game Modes

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.549
Two new multi-player modes will allow players
to take advantage of these new maps.

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.049
The first mode, �Rift�, will be similar
to capture the flag.

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.900
The second mode is called �Mayhem Clash�
and features significantly reduced cooldown

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.470
time for powers, promising a fun and hectic
battle.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.749
Those who download a special code available
with the purchase of certain Red Bull products

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:11.360
will gain access to a special mission that
promises to be quite the speed and strategy

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.360
challenge.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.329
4) Class-Specific Weapons

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.190
The original Destiny game didn't feel very
different based on which class the player

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.910
chose, but The Taken King promises to change
that.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.290
Taken King will have weapons only useable
by certain classes, as well as unique weapons

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.730
that can only be found on special missions.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.470
Bungie really wanted to add variety of weapons
with Taken King and boasted it has �the

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.500
largest armory any Guardian has ever seen�,
so don't be surprised if your loadout completely

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.380
changes with the new expansion.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.650
3) New Guardian Subclasses

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.340
Each guardian class will now have a subclass
that gives them enhanced powers.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.940
Titans will get a fiery hammer that can be
used for destructive melee attacks or ranged

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.470
flame attacks.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.690
Hunters wield a wicked bow made of gravitational
void energy to snare enemies and prevent them

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.720
from attacking.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.440
Warlocks can fight with an electrical storm
to annihilate chains of enemies.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.600
Each new ability looks pretty sick and it
will be fun to play each class going through

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.940
the campaign.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.470
These subclasses are also tied into the plot,
not merely added as a new selection on the

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.570
main screen, which adds to the depth and complexity
of the lore in Destiny.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.120
2) New Locations

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.600
One of the most incredible features of Destiny
are the locations.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.940
The Taken King promises multiple new exciting
and breathtakingly beautiful zones that add

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.620
depth and immersion to the Destiny universe.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.320
To be clear, these will be their own, independent
areas, unlike previous DLC that merely expanded

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.100
on existing locations.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.040
There are still many planets and moons left
in the solar system left to visit, and a whole

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.580
new planet is not out of the question.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.580
1) New story

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.420
The plot of The Taken King is going to be
twice as epic as either of the previous two

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.420
expansions.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.300
As mentioned previously, Oryx is The Fallen
King, tainted by Darkness and using his army

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.050
of The Fallen to seek revenge for the death
of his son, Crota.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.990
It seems like the trilogy of DLC releases
have been leading up to this final conclusion,

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.400
and hopefully the players can get some answers
to questions raised in the previous installments.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.550
Most notably: What is the Darkness?

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.220
Is it tied to the Traveler?

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.830
The Taken King will delve straight into the
more mythic aspects of the world of Destiny,

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.080
and it promises to be an exhilarating ride.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.020
Are you returning to Destiny, jumping into
it for the first time, or religiously grinding

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.490
since Day 1?

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.970
