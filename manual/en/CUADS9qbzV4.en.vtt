00:00:00.098 --> 00:00:02.142
- Oh, minecraft.

00:00:02.142 --> 00:00:04.057
- I thought it was mind craft,

00:00:04.057 --> 00:00:07.151
like your mind, oh my gosh.

00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:11.446
- I'm a mother of two children.

00:00:11.446 --> 00:00:12.418
- My neice plays it.

00:00:12.418 --> 00:00:14.094
- And I'm also an
elementary school teacher.

00:00:14.094 --> 00:00:17.115
- It's a computer game and you
might get to build something.

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:19.991
- I know that some of
the animals have hearts

00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:21.927
that come out of their butts.

00:00:21.927 --> 00:00:24.089
- I'm excited to see
what world I can create.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.157
- Move forward, move forward.

00:00:26.157 --> 00:00:27.284
Mom, move forward.

00:00:27.284 --> 00:00:28.235
- I am moving forward.

00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:30.079
- It looks less realistic
than other video games

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:30.912
that I've seen.

00:00:30.912 --> 00:00:32.402
- I like the little steps.

00:00:32.402 --> 00:00:34.965
- It doesn't look like a hand,
it looks like a giant eraser.

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:36.543
- Am I the watermelon?

00:00:36.543 --> 00:00:37.469
- No, you're holding it.

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.244
- I'm holding it.

00:00:38.244 --> 00:00:40.804
- Does it shoot anything out of it? Oh!

00:00:40.804 --> 00:00:41.989
- I don't know what the object is.

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.877
Is it to advance further?

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:46.296
- It's really difficult.

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:47.348
- I think it's kind of artistic.

00:00:47.348 --> 00:00:49.339
- Right-click on them.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.562
- I love this part of the game.

00:00:54.562 --> 00:00:56.513
- I can't even get him to move.

00:00:56.513 --> 00:00:57.699
- This is a big tree.

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:58.878
- That's a big tree.

00:00:58.878 --> 00:01:01.790
- Oh look, look,
achievement, getting wood.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.746
- Right now, I'm building a huge wall

00:01:04.746 --> 00:01:06.290
to keep people out.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.554
- What the heck is, oh
my God, what is that?

00:01:08.554 --> 00:01:09.276
- It's a zombie.

00:01:09.276 --> 00:01:10.470
- Is that water?

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.377
- It's kind of dark.

00:01:11.377 --> 00:01:12.548
- No, you're not hitting it.

00:01:12.548 --> 00:01:13.535
- Yes I am.

00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:14.921
- No you're not.

00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:16.123
- I fell in.

00:01:16.123 --> 00:01:17.911
- Oh yeah!

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.264
(screams)

00:01:20.264 --> 00:01:23.263
- There's something green.

00:01:23.263 --> 00:01:25.247
It says we died.

00:01:25.247 --> 00:01:26.324
- I died.

00:01:26.324 --> 00:01:28.480
- We scored zero.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.582
- I want to build,
actually, a little house,

00:01:30.582 --> 00:01:32.711
like bungalow, maybe Spanish style.

00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:35.081
- Blocks, oh, gold.

00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:38.075
- Magenta is a really hot fall color.

00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:39.467
I love Pinterest.

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:41.758
- I'm walling myself in.

00:01:41.758 --> 00:01:45.207
- This is a lot of work
for just a few blocks.

00:01:45.207 --> 00:01:47.780
- It's exciting at the same
time because I get to --

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.794
I just accidentally crushed my house.

00:01:51.794 --> 00:01:53.920
- Oh my gosh.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.535
This is really intense.

00:01:55.535 --> 00:01:56.896
- You know what, that's a hard game.

00:01:56.896 --> 00:01:58.022
That's really hard.

00:01:58.022 --> 00:01:59.356
- I like the artistic element.

00:01:59.356 --> 00:02:00.536
It was a little Cubis.

00:02:00.536 --> 00:02:01.632
- It's kind of scary.

00:02:01.632 --> 00:02:03.496
There was a zombie and a spider.

00:02:03.496 --> 00:02:04.971
- Different than what I expected.

00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:06.524
I had no idea it had to do with bricks

00:02:06.524 --> 00:02:08.606
and building and walls and creativity.

00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:10.492
- It doesn't seem like there's an end

00:02:10.492 --> 00:02:13.415
so you could play this for
hours and hours and hours

00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:16.891
and as a mom, that would frustrate me

00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:18.944
if my child was doing that.

00:02:18.944 --> 00:02:21.971
- Can we get out of here, let me do this.
