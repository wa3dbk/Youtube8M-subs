00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.360
Simon: Here's a bet that I'm going to set
up for you and you're going to love it.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.620
I'm just going to ask my camera guys here
for one favor.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.869
Can you get me a pint glass from behind the
bar?

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.330
It's not that we need it for the bet.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.999
It's just I like to have a pint glass handy.

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:28.509
Thank you, sir.

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.660
There's the 4 ball.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.739
Woman: OK.

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:39.609
Simon: I'm going to put the 12 ball right
there, and then I'm going to put the cue ball

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:42.170
right there.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.060
Now here's your bet.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.620
Do this on your boy, because he'll hate you
for it, but you'll win a lot of money.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:58.039
All you've got to do is pocket the 4 ball,
without touching the 12 ball.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:04.129
That cue ball can't touch the 12 ball, and
you've got to pocket the 4 ball.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.129
Woman: OK.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.430
Simon: Do you think you can do it?

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.430
Woman: Maybe.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.840
Simon: I doubt it.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.000
It's an impossible shot.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.250
Nobody in history has ever made this shot
except for me.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.480
No, you have to hit the cue ball.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.382
Woman: You didn't say that.

00:01:20.382 --> 00:01:23.290
Simon: Yeah, I did.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.400
Give me the other little puppy right there,
my darling.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.400
All rightey.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.080
Woman: You've talked me too much about wordplay.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.320
Simon: I'm trying and that's what I love about
you.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.340
So now you've got to pocket it without being
twitchy or frisky here.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.310
You've got to hit the cue ball and you've
got to pocket the red ball without hitting

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.510
the 12 ball.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.600
Trust me, there's no way it can be done.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.600
Woman: Yeah.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.600
Man: Yeah.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.600
It can't be done, right?

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.600
Woman: No.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.480
Simon: I'll teach you how to make Peter lose
money, here.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.710
I can tell you how to pocket that red ball
without touching the 12 ball.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.900
That little purplish stripy ball.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.440
Woman: Tell me.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.440
Simon: Pint glass.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.780
Woman: Oh, that's why you asked for it.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.780
Simon: Yeah.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.430
I put it over the ball.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:27.090
And now all you do, the cue ball never hit
the purple striped, and I think that's worth

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.210
a hug, don't you?

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.340
Woman: I guess so.
