00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.330
- ADDING AND SUBTRACTING
COMPLEX NUMBERS

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.480
IS VERY SIMILAR TO ADDING
AND SUBTRACTING BINOMIALS.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.720
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS WHEN
ADDING OR SUBTRACTING BINOMIALS,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.840
WE CAN ONLY ADD
OR SUBTRACT LIKE TERMS.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.450
AND WHEN ADDING
AND SUBTRACTING COMPLEX NUMBERS,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.240
WE CAN ONLY ADD
THE REAL PARTS TOGETHER

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.210
AND THE IMAGINARY
PARTS TOGETHER.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.270
LOOKING AT THE FIRST EXAMPLE,
WE HAVE 18 - 6I + - 9 - 3I.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.030
I THINK WHEN DOING
THESE TYPES OF PROBLEMS.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.000
IT'S HELPFUL
TO CLEAR THE PARENTHESIS.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:43.120
SO WE HAVE 18 - 6I + -9 + -3I.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.870
ONCE WE HAVE IT IN THIS FORM,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.630
WE JUST NEED TO COMBINE THE REAL
PARTS OF THE COMPLEX NUMBERS

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.270
AND THEN COMBINE THE IMAGINARY
PARTS OF THE COMPLEX NUMBERS.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.240
AND SINCE 18 + -9 IS 9,

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.870
THE REAL PART IS EQUAL TO 9

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.510
AND THEN FOR THE IMAGINARY PARTS
WE HAVE -6I + - 3I WHICH = -9I.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.060
SO WE COULD WRITE + -9I

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.570
BUT IT'S MORE COMMON
TO WRITE MINUS 9I.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.690
WE DO WANT TO PUT
THE REAL PART FIRST

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.360
AND THE IMAGINARY PART SECOND

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.030
SO THE COMPLEX NUMBER
IS IN THE CORRECT FORM.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.150
WE CAN GET OUR SECOND EXAMPLE,

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.210
AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO CLEAR
THE PARENTHESIS

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.150
SO IN SUBTRACTING
IF IT'S HELPFUL

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.420
WE CAN THINK OF THIS
AS DISTRIBUTING A -1.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.570
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 18 - 6I

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.090
AND THEN
BECAUSE WE'RE SUBTRACTING,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.660
THIS IS GOING TO BE + 9

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.390
AND AGAIN
BECAUSE THEY'RE SUBTRACTING,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.870
THIS IS GOING TO BE + 3I.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.360
REMEMBER SUBTRACTING IS THE SAME
AS ADDING THE OPPOSITE.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.570
AND AGAIN NOW WE'LL COMBINE
THE REAL PARTS

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.360
OF THE COMPLEX NUMBERS
AND THEN WE'LL COMBINE

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.300
THE IMAGINARY PARTS
OF THE COMPLEX NUMBERS.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:07.240
SO 18 + 9 = 27
AND -6I + 3I WOULD BE = -31,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.090
SO WE HAVE -31.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.870
SO AS YOU CAN SEE AS LONG AS YOU
FOLLOW THE SAME RULES

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.420
THAT YOU USE FOR ADDING
AND SUBTRACTING BINOMIALS,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.360
THE PROCESS IS ALMOST THE SAME.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.690
I HOPE YOU FOUND THIS HELPFUL.
