00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.387
Hi guys!

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:26.826
Today we're going to talk about the open handed playing technique...

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:33.633
This technique it's based on opening the hand after the stroke.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:37.504
In the previous episode we showed you the full stroke technique

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:41.908
that's based on hitting the snare with your hand closed and your fingers close to the stick.

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:50.417
Today I'll show you how to open your hand. In this case the starting point of the stick changes...

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:55.522
We have to focus on the stick new starting point, our movement has to finish in the same position.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.963
One of the most common problems you may run into

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:07.734
it's the swerve of the stick when returning at its starting point.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:16.242
That's caused by the lack of confidence of your fingers, but practice will easily solve it.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:21.381
Don't get discouraged, the open-handed technique it's basically very easy.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:25.819
You can start with t he same series of exercises we showed you for the full stroke technique

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.288
pay attention to the regularity of your strokes and to the quality too.

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:33.393
Try to avoid the snare to tremble

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:38.832
because that's not the way you want to hit it.

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:44.137
You can practice your left hand with the same series of exercises

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:47.507
and then try to switch and alternate your right and your left hand.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.154
Let's try to analyze a little the open-handed movement

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:10.096
when I make this movement with my hand it's almost like a salute to someone...

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.531
Once again...

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:23.510
If you can it's better to hit the snare in the same point

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.414
trying not to change it with every stroke because that may change your position.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:33.219
As I told you in the first episode, imagine to carry a tray, that's the correct position...

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:40.426
the movement it's based on your wrist and your hand. Always remember that!

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:52.338
Another important technique it's the closed-stroke technique.

00:02:52.338 --> 00:03:01.714
The first part of the movement of the closed stroke it's similar to the open-handed technique.

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:06.586
It's called closed stroke because after the stroke we'll close the fingersÃ‰

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:09.322
Just like that.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.260
Let me show you.

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:29.175
Even in this case, we don't want the snare to tremble

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:34.214
the stick stops a few inches above the skin.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:46.426
Let's practice our usual series of exercise. And try to play every stroke with the same intensity.

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.928
Always practice with both hands

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:54.000
but remember that for many of us the left it's the weak hand, and we need to practice a little more.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.739
After that, as usual, try to alternate the right and the left hand...

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.211
For the closed-stroke technique

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:12.852
when you alternate left and right hand, I suggest to let the two sticks meet halfway

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:20.460
If you look carefully you see that the sticks meet precisely halfway.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:29.235
After that you can start with some strokes sequences, downloadable on MusicOff.com

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:36.376
The sequences are: 3 strokes for hand, then 4, 6 and 8 in the end.

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:43.583
The last technique I want to show you today it's the Tap Stroke Technique.

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:47.687
the tap stroke it's played very close to the skin and very gently.

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:51.124
The tap-stroke it's obviously a low volume stroke.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:58.564
You just need to lower your wrist and hit the skin very gently.

00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:03.169
We'll need the tap-stroke technique when we'll talk about the ghost-notes technique.

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.939
Don't worry, the name sounds scarier that what actually is!

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:18.384
In the next episode we'll talk about a technique that involves the movement of the whole arm

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:29.896
it's a very important technique that will accelerate a lot the way you play...

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:38.471
Don't get discouraged if these first exercises are a little bit boring

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:42.308
I can assure you they are essential for a good and correct playing.
