00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:06.740
Cannot eat cannot drink

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.700
Also, must abstain from a lot of other things

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.200
Can swallow saliva?

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.480
It's a legit question!

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.400
It's like different from the Catholic fast

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.964
Which is where you can drink water I think

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.060
During the fast, it's a test of patience

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.932
And refraining from evil actions and evil thoughts

00:00:22.932 --> 00:00:24.367
And you cannot say bad words

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.820
Oh Chris

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.080
What's happening?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.040
I got a question

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.540
Yes Chris?

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.480
If I accidentally swear right

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.300
Does it mean that I've broken my fast?

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.560
You're supposed to be like just

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.960
Very conscious about your language

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.700
So I just accidentally swear first

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.920
Then I eat then I apologise?

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.880
You see my concern right now?

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.440
These people are obviously...

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.200
No leh not these people you ask Chris

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.220
I said these people, these people

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.600
It's Amanda and Chris

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.340
I didn't do anything

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.120
I'll feel terrible

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.240
I'll feel hungry

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.960
Eh you guys

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.040
Haven't even start and then you already like give up

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.600
It's about 4.50 in the morning now

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.920
No human should be awake at this unholy hour

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.720
Hi guys, good morning

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.280
It's about 5 o'clock in the morning and I just woke up

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.080
Hi everyone, good morning

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.880
I'm gonna be having last night's leftovers

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.220
Going to get up and eat breakfast

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.060
You know, Ramadan

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.120
Spirit of forgiveness and everything

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.640
To Keiji

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.420
For making me wake up this early

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.420
I forgive you

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.680
Honestly the hardest part of today is waking up

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.420
So it's like 5.15 now

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.220
And uh, just woke up

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.840
Haven't been up this early since I've been schooling

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.300
Got some croissants and toast with some cheese

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.040
Alright, five minutes left and I'm kinda done

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.140
So now I'm just gonna drink a lot of water

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.420
But then if I drink a lot of water, then I'll pee

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:06.209
So then, I don't know what to do

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.800
Hi, it's about 11.30am in the morning

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.600
And, well...

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.520
Still surviving!

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.319
Yes exactly

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.140
Definitely takes a lot of discipline la, I think

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.420
You know, like just

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.200
Cause we are so used to just grabbing things, you know

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.220
And eating them whenever we want to

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.360
Especially in this office right

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.120
And it takes-

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.220
It's a conscious effort

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.560
Cause I subconsciously asked for a packet of M&amp;M's just now

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.240
Imagine if I didn't think

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.800
Then go inside, then I die, then how?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.827
Break fast eh

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.200
I guess the worst part was when people were having lunch

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.210
And we couldn't eat

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.800
We could smell it all

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.180
But there's one thing I learned as well

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.020
When you fast, you have an hour of lunch break right

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.400
You can run errands

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.060
It is now like 5.26

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.620
Uh, we spent a minute laughing at Chris's awful joke

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.180
I'm actually not hungry anymore, not really

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.940
But to do it for a purpose is good

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.700
Like how we're doing it for the video

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.800
There's a bigger purpose okay, Chris

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:15.586
We need to learn about other people who actually fast

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.441
And about understanding their culture

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.960
Oh that too, I forgot about it

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.880
Actually are you more thirsty or hungry?

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.600
Thirsty

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.824
My lips are parched

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.020
Like they're cracking

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.914
I feel like my whole body is like a desert

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.620
I love learning about their culture by being hungry

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.780
No!

00:03:33.435 --> 00:03:34.715
Respect, respect!

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.680
I think it's good that we got to experience it

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.180
Yes

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.900
Yeah, 'cause if not, I would not have done this at all

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.820
Yeah, definitely

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.880
I would never do this

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.320
And I wouldn't know how it feels like

00:03:45.037 --> 00:03:46.097
It's horrible

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.920
Oh my god

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.940
How do you ever live without water and food, you know?

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.240
I guess it's very good to appreciate

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.580
All the things around you

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.600
And things you take for granted

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.120
Like food, water, you know

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.360
We're going for pizza after this

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.800
It's the best way to break fast

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.580
Yeah, so that's all I can think about right now

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.913
You know, the cheesy crust

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.640
Yeah

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.300
No, no

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.140
No, no

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.780
We're going to have dinner

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.520
Uh, Eudea's currently dead

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.880
I'm absolutely alive

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.020
Chris has never smiled so much

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.940
Food

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.920
Food

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.100
We're gonna start eating soon

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.980
The prayer's time on 7.12

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.174
Means you can eat now

00:04:32.174 --> 00:04:33.633
Yes, we're eating everything

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.320
So I'm very grateful that we get to eat

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.660
Uh, and drink

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.820
Cheers

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.540
It's alright, it's alright

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.400
I'm not happy, I'm very angry

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.555
We're not eating yet

00:05:09.293 --> 00:05:10.933
I'm not agitated, I am very happy

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.420
I'm getting this, I really am getting this

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.860
Selamat bulam puasa

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.260
Have a happy feast

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.420
And puasa
