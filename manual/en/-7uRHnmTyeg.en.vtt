00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.850
 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.060
 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.950
 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.890
 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.000
 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.420
 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.930
 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.490
 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.410
Hi my name is Dave I'm with Fraserway RV

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.610
and I will be introducing our special
wheelchair accessible

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.690
vehicle today. Fraserway is the only

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.219
RV rental company in Canada with this
type of

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:46.219
motorhome

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.980
 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.730
 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.860
 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.850
 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.949
this motorhome basically comes with all
the features like any other motorhome

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.770
We'll start at the entrance it has
these automatic steps.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.250
So whenever you open the entrance door the steps come out automatically.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.149
And it has a separate mosquito screen as well. And a handle that makes it easier for people to get into the vehicle.

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.369
And handle that makes it easier for
people to

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.750
enter the vehicle. Another great feature

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.369
of this RV is the electric awning.

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.640
It can be easily deployed just by the
push of a button.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.110
 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.680
 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.900
 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.970
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.320
okay now we get to the very unique
feature of this Motorhome,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.320
which is the wheelchair ramp.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.460
It's fully automatic and all it takes

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.979
is the remote control

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.250
to deploy the ramp.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.990
 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.090
and then there is only a second bottom.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.070
you get it all the way to the ground and
then we can get the wheelchair right

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.210
onto the ramp easily

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.530
So all we have to do now is get our
guest onto the wheelchair ramp

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.520
 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.560
 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.780
and make sure the breaks of the
wheelchair

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.840
are secured. It also has a safety feature

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.980
and the ramp will not work unless this belt

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.730
is fastened.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.030
Its very easy as you can see, it just takes a few seconds to get the wheelchair right

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.980
into the vehicle.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.760
As you can see it is really easy for our clients

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.890
to handle the ramp by themselves
And it is just as easy

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.019
to get the wheelchair back out. It only takes a few seconds.

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.170
It also comes with a nice

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.130
outside shower. Which is very handy after swimming in the ocean or also if you

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.250
have dogs that you need to clean outside.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.120
And like any other RV you have

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.290
your power cord. You have your

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.769
grey and black water tanks that are easy to drain

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.900
down here. You have a sewer flusher here

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.060
that helps you clean out the tanks once in awhile.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.040
Here's the gasoline take which holds about 140 liters

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.269
gasoline which will get you between five
and six hundred kilometers on one tank.

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.489
Another great feature of this RV

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.840
is the dinette slide out. And it can also be easily controled from

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.000
inside the rv

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.110
with just the push of a button.
Our wheelchair accessible motorhomes also

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.470
come with a generator

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.500
which is great to have while parked on the campground. You can still

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.590
use all

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.760
the appliances and stuff inside and you don't have
to worry about

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.400
the batteries draining. As you can see, the slide out

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.069
creates a lot more space ones you're on
the campground. It's especially great

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.840
when you travel with a wheelchair. Since
the slide out is a little bit

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.240
elevated, the table is slightly too high
for a person in a wheelchair

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.930
and because of that we have this table
insert

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.259
which is very easy to install

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:24.090
Just a couple of moment.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.759
 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:29.520
 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.150
In the interior

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.780
of the motorhome you have a lot of storage space up here

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.800
and elsewhere also for your cups and
plates and glasses

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.379
as well your pots and pans down here

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:49.659
you have all the controls here for the
hot water heater

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:53.289
for the water pump and also the monitor
panel

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.009
which shows the level of fresh water,
waste water tanks as well as the

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:57.919
battery charge

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.009
Like our other vehicles this one comes with a

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.759
propane oven, a three burner propane stove  As well as a microwave

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.650
which can we be used at any time that  the vehicle is hooked up to electricity

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.270
or when the generator is on. Here is your control panel

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.069
for the furnace and air conditioning.

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.580
Another great thing is this large fridge together with

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.430
a separate freezer compartment.
And here is your wheelchair accessible

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.110
washroom

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.800
complete with toilet and a sink. Very
strong handle bars to grab onto

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.220
as well as a very strong but quiet fan.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.010
 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.560
And of course one of the most important things is that you can secure the

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.670
wheelchair to the floor while driving. For that we have these special brackets

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.860
that come with the vehicle and it's just like a seat belt.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.220
install it you

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.860
tie it to the chair and it cannot move once it is installed.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.030
You have one bracket on each side.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.920
 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.960
 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.190
And once it is locked as you can see it is very stable and the wheelchair will not

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.740
be moving while you are driving.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.260
In this particular motorhome you can sleep a total of

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.490
4 adults and 1-2 children

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.510
in the dinette that folds into a bed.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.430
.  The rear bed sleeps 2 adults the nice thing about is you can

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.410
access the shower

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.430
compartment directly from the bed or

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.260
you can also fold up the bed against the wall

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.810
which will create enough space for the wheelchair

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.280
to go right through.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.420
Inside the shower compartment you have a folding bench

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.540
and you have

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.919
this powerful but quiet ceiling fan.

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:57.849
 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:02.639
To convert the dinette into a bed it only takes about

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.649
20 seconds all you have to do is

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:11.189
is remove the cushions for a moment.

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:15.060
Push the table plate down

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:21.170
down and move the cushions together

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.390
 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.270
Put the bed sheets on and your good to go. The drivers cab

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.020
of this vehicle comes with the same features of any other motorhome but in

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.900
addition

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.380
you have this hand control which allows you to control the gas pedal and the

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.660
brakes by hand.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.970
Another great feature of this motorhome

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:46.720
is the rear view cameras. Anytime you shift the transmission  into reverse

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.590
the camera will come on automatically.Thank you very much for watching this video

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.340
 

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:08.590
