Hi, my name is Dave Andrews and today I'm
going to explain to you where cache files

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:17.599
are stored. Let's go to our computer and if
I open up Microsoft Internet Explorer, it

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:24.579
downloads and displays for me a web page inside
of here. Now when it downloads this page,

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.201
it saves it to my local hard drive in what's
called a cache. I'm going to explain to you

00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:35.620
how we can find where those cache files are
stored. Close this, let's open up My Computer.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.720
Now there's one thing we have to do before
we can navigate to the cache. We have to turn

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.440
on the capability of seeing hidden files.
To do that, hold down the ALT key on your

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.630
keyboard and press T. That brings up the tools
options. From here, we're going to go to Folder

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:04.390
Options, let's select the View Tab and find
that down here if you scroll down where it

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.270
says Hidden Files and Folders, you can either
do not show them or you can show hidden files

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.179
and folders. We want to turn that on where
we show hidden files and folders. Now, let's

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:22.909
find our cache files. Just go to your C drive
and we're going to want to go down to the

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:31.770
Users folder. Now find the user who's cache
we'd like to see. I'm just going to use Dave.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.119
From here we want to go into this AppData
folder. Now see how it's kind of grayed out

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.170
here a little bit? That's because that AppData
folder is hidden and we wouldn't be able to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:48.950
see it if we hadn't turned that on. I'm just
going to go into this Local folder here and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.829
as you can see, there's a folder called Microsoft
and then here's our last folder called Internet

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.200
Explorer. Now here's where all of your cache
files and data are going to be stored is within

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:12.090
this LocalMicrosoftInternet Explorer folder.
My name is Dave Andrews and I've just explained

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.689
to you where the cache files are stored.
