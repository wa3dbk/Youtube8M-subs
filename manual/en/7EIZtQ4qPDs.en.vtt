00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:26.840
I’m not going to tell you this mission went
off without a hitch.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.870
There were a few times when poorly explained
objectives and mediocre presentation really

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.360
held up my hold up, but through it all, this
game had me at the edge of my seat.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.890
It had me believing I was a criminal, and
the crazy part is...it actually had me thinking

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.890
like one.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.989
It’s even better than peanuts and caramel.

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:56.960
It’s Payday: The Heist.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.910
Released last month to the PlayStation Network,
Payday: The Heist is a first-person shooter

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.860
similar to games like Left 4 Dead.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.190
This is a game designed specifically for the
multiplayer setting, and although it does

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.381
have a few issues, they vanish like thieves
in the black of night when you play it with

00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:16.100
friends.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.380
You play as your choice of four villains,
and spoiler alert, they’re planning a heist.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.090
In each of the game’s six missions, you
get to lead and coordinate the team during

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.670
their illicit activities.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.620
As a villain myself, I was totally immersed
by the game’s atmosphere.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.781
Whether you’re piecing together a bank robbery
or breaking someone out of the slammer, the

00:01:37.781 --> 00:01:41.660
game feels genuinely frantic, especially in
multiplayer.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.310
Of course, that’s also a problem of sorts.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.750
If you’re playing alone, you lose a bit
of the dangerous, big-time caper feel.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.229
You get three bots on your team instead, and
although the AI is fine, shouting at friends

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.119
and coordinating the heist is half the fun.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.479
Payday is a great multiplayer game, but aside
from studying maps, it’s kind of worthless

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.860
if you’re playing alone.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:25.920
But that’s more a problem inherent to this
specific kind of shooter than an issue with

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.920
Payday exclusively.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.440
When you play this game the way it’s meant
to be played, it’s really hard to not have

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.440
fun with it.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.410
If you don’t have any friends, uh...your
life is probably miserable, anyway.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.900
It’s not like Payday could even change that.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.130
The cool thing about Payday is how the game
evolves as you go.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.580
Even though the objectives never change, your
character levels up based on how you’ve

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.580
been playing.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.340
So every member of your team can evolve into
highly specialized masters of specific roles.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.690
It’s a dynamic system with more than 140
levels, which really plays into the game’s

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.560
multiplayer focus.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.349
But despite all of its positives, Payday still
has some problems.

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.209
The presentation is really disappointing,
for one.

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.750
Its graphics are kind of bland, and there
are also some technical problems that make

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.870
your heists feel less impressive than they
should.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.530
The game also drops the ball in terms of direction
from time to time, so you might be confused

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.060
about a few objectives the first time you
play.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.020
Otherwise, though, this is a solid multiplayer
shooter.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.560
It has a theme you can’t help getting caught
up in, it has awesome tension and it lends

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.970
itself to seriously frantic multiplayer.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.330
If you’re a fan of games like Left 4 Dead
and perhaps are interested in turning heel,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:53.159
Payday: The Heist is a caper worth the possible
jail time.
