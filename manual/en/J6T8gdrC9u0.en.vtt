00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:06.774
Hey

00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:21.769
Listen, if you guys wanna move around 
and shift your asses a little it's ok
it's okey for us

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.311
You can take over your clothes if you like it too
Don't matter

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.270
Fuck off

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.257
This is called Killer Queen

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.678
She keeps MÃ¶et et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet

00:00:42.678 --> 00:00:46.498
'Let them eat cake' she says
Just like Marie Antoinette

00:00:46.498 --> 00:00:50.355
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy

00:00:50.355 --> 00:00:55.087
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline

00:00:55.087 --> 00:00:59.442
Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:03.418
Extraordinarily nice
She's a Killer Queen

00:01:03.418 --> 00:01:07.256
Gunpowder, Gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam

00:01:07.256 --> 00:01:11.249
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:15.158
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:19.194
Wanna try?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.490
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.016
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness

00:01:33.016 --> 00:01:36.870
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.150
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.252
Perfume came naturally from Paris
for cars she couldn't care less

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.978
Fastidious and precise
She's a Killer Queen

00:01:49.978 --> 00:01:54.000
Gunpowder, Gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.719
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:05.828
Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.304
The machine of a dream

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:55.458
Such a clean machine

00:02:57.067 --> 00:03:00.474
With the pistons a pumpin'

00:03:00.474 --> 00:03:03.697
And the hub caps all gleam

00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:08.917
When I'm holdin' your wheel

00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:12.954
All I hear is your gear

00:03:15.205 --> 00:03:17.834
When my hand's on your grease gun

00:03:19.656 --> 00:03:22.041
Oh it's like a disease son

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.379
I'm in love with my car

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.951
Gotta feel for my automobile

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.521
Get a grip on my boy racer rollbar

00:03:38.353 --> 00:03:41.135
Such a thrill when your radials squeal

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.640
Told my girl I'll have to forget her

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.810
Rather buy me a new carburetor

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.155
So she made tracks sayin'
This is the end now

00:03:57.155 --> 00:04:01.720
Cars don't talk back
They're just four wheeled friends now
