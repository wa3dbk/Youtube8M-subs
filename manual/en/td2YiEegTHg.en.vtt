Hello everyone! I hope your day's going well and welcome to this episode of Cranbersher's Guide!

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.253
Last episode we went over the steps to create the armature of the puppet,

00:00:10.253 --> 00:00:14.980
and this episode we're going to finish off the puppet with all the nice felt and make it look all fancy and cute.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.640
Let's GO!

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.380
Once again, I'm not a professional, this is just stuff I've learned from experience and book-learning, so

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.340
feel free to change anything up if you want.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.600
So for this part, you're going to need your armature, of course,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.864
Felt or plush fabric in all the colors you're going to use, including skin tone, clothing, and any other accessories you plan on making,

00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:33.120
cotton or polyester stuffing, spools of thread that match your felt colors,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.400
a sewing needle and sewing pins, scissors, yarn for the hair, and your hot-glue gun once again!

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.480
Oh... I should mention...

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.460
This tutorial needs you to know how to sew,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.640
and I don't really know how to go about teaching that..... so....

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.660
y....Google's pretty good!

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:59.380
If you need some specifics, we're gonna be using the running stitch, the overcast stitch, and the invisible stitch.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.900
I learned these names like two days ago so they might be wrong but hopefully they're not.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.660
All right, first using your original drawing for your armature, draw out patterns for your puppet's torso and legs.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.868
It may take some experimenting to get them to fit around the puppet nicely and snugly,

00:01:10.868 --> 00:01:12.502
but eventually you'll get something that works.

00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:16.110
We'll be using the skin tone felt for the torso since we'll need to have the little nubby hands and neck

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.400
poking out from under the shirt, or other Top Type aTtire,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.380
but the legs can just be the color of the pants since we won't be seeing anything under them.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.200
Unless...

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.360
Unless...y..you want to for some reas...son...

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.214
So cut out the torso pattern and pin it to the skin tone fabric so it stays in place while you're cutting out

00:01:31.214 --> 00:01:34.660
the necessary pieces. You're gonna need two pieces: One for the front and one for the back.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.060
Once you've got both pieces, you can sew them together with a running stitch on each side,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.722
starting at the hip and stopping at the side of the neck on each side.

00:01:40.722 --> 00:01:43.580
Once you're done, turn the pieces inside out to hide the seam better.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.262
Now, to get it on the armature, we'll actually need to cut open the back and slip it on like a teeny-tiny snuggie!

00:01:48.262 --> 00:01:50.500
Then sew the back using the overcast stitch.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.180
It doesn't really have to be very fancy, since this seam will be covered up with some kind of clothing,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.940
like the shirt, or in this case, and green hoodie.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.380
Now that you're done with the torso, you're gonna do a similar thing with the legs,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.100
cutting out the legs pattern, and using that to make the two pieces of pants.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.920
Then sewing the sides together with a running stitch and turning those inside out.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.620
But remember not to sew the crotch yet!

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.120
We're gonna...... we're gonna leave that for later!

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.338
Now this is where it gets kinda tricky, since we're gonna need to sew the pants directly onto the puppet's torso.

00:02:16.338 --> 00:02:20.831
So, use the overcast stitch to attach the pants to the torso and then....

00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:25.351
spread the puppet's legs... so you can get to the crotch easily.....

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.900
God dammit...

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.660
Anyway! Sew up the middle of the pants with an invisible stitch so the seam will be hidden as much as possible,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.120
and the pants are done!

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.080
But, we've still got some room on the feet, or shoes if you prefer, so we'll need to cut out

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.780
a fairly thin strip of black felt and wrap it around the feet to measure out the two pieces,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.540
then go ahead and sew them onto the pants and you're good to go! Legs are all done.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.140
But if you're worried about your puppet having a wardrobe malfunction such as this,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.275
you can use hot glue to stick the shoe felt directly to the epoxy underneath. Aaaand, then you're done!

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.780
Eh..

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.960
But he still doesn't have a shirt on so..we...we gotta do that.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.040
It's not polite..

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.022
But first, we need to do the head!

00:03:03.022 --> 00:03:07.836
Weirdly enough, this step actually doesn't involve any sewing, just gluing, lots of gluing.

00:03:07.836 --> 00:03:10.880
You can use some of the yarn you've got to measure out different widths of the armature's head

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.340
so you can make the two pieces of fabric fit correctly.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.580
Getting the right shape may take a few tries, but keep at it and eventually you'll get something that works.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.700
Once we've got the two pieces of the head figured out, glue the center of one piece to the center of the back of the head,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.360
and then tightly wrap the felt onto the head while gluing from bottom to top, then do the same with the front.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.900
Hopefully this will move all of the possible fabric wrinkles to the top of the head,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.480
which is okay, since you're gonna end up covering it with hair.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.976
Unless your character's bald... in which case you might need to figure something else out...

00:03:36.976 --> 00:03:40.200
Unless you're okay with head wrinkles, then... WOO!

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.280
Speaking of hair, that's what we're gonna do next!!

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.500
Now unfortunately the is probably the most tedious part of the process,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.340
since you need to glue each strand of hair individually to the scalp.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.200
But hey, I mean, it could be pretty relaxing if you did it while watching TV or Youtube videos!

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.340
That's what I do at least.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.756
So take your yarn and cut out copious amounts of small strands for each strand of hair,  and you can begin gluing them.

00:04:02.756 --> 00:04:05.780
I recommend starting at the hairline, and then slowly making your way up to the

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.438
swirly thing that people have at the back of their head,

00:04:08.438 --> 00:04:11.804
and giving your puppet a haircut to the proper length as you go

00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:16.857
Eventually you'll end up with what you anticipated, and you can finally give them a shirt!

00:04:17.348 --> 00:04:17.988
A SHIRT!!

00:04:17.988 --> 00:04:21.640
So to do this, if you're making a shirt, you can draw out a slightly larger version of the torso

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.680
with the arms cut off to use for sleeves instead of arms obviously,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.540
And use what you've just drawn to cut out the two pieces of the shirt and sew them onto the puppet

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.040
with the invisible stitch.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.480
If you want, you can sew in little designs and whatnot, like the Markiplier "M",

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.393
but if you do, remember to do it before actually sewing the shirt onto the puppet, otherwise it get really hard.

00:04:37.393 --> 00:04:40.240
And now you're actually finally done with your puppet! And now you can...

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.740
Wait...

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.620
oh no... hold on!!

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.640
EHHuhHhu..huhu.uhhuhh

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.360
DEEHHHHHH

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.600
huh..huhuhuhhr.huhhu.....hrh-

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.680
Okay there you go! Now you're finally done!

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.880
Now I know there's actually not really any facial features except for the eye base,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.620
but that's because those are removable for the purpose of animation.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.586
We'll get into that later down the line.

00:05:13.586 --> 00:05:17.536
But anyway that's it for this episode! I hope you enjoyed, and I will see you in the future!

00:05:17.536 --> 00:05:19.817
Thanks for watching and take care!
