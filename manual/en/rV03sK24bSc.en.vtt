Hi, my name is Nate McCullough on behalf of
Expert Village. In these clips we're going

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.070
to talk about the proper way to diagnose and
replace your vehicle's fog lights or accessory

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.150
lights. In this clip I'm going to talk about
the proper way to diagnose the wiring from

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.730
the vehicle's fog light relay to the lamp
assembly itself. This is my fog light here

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.090
and this is the factory electrical connector
from the back of it. I have my test light

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.790
hooked up to the positive side of my battery
and I'm going to take and insert it into the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.860
ground side of the circuit. As you can see
my test light lights up. That indicates that

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.190
the circuit has all of its intergrity and
you're going to want to take and repeat this

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:01.690
step for the other fog light connector which
is over here. As you can see that side of

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.679
the circuit is fine. What you're going to
want to do is switch your connector at the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:14.399
battery from the positive side to the ground
or negative side of the battery and check

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.090
the other wire in the connector. As you can
see there is two. You're going to want to

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.069
repeat the procedure. Just switch it from
the positive to the negative and select the

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:30.380
other terminal. That will check the continuity
of both sides. In some cases in order to test

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.219
the ground side of the circuit, if it happens
to have a ground side switch, you will need

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:40.600
to turn on the vehicle headlights and engage
the fog light switch. What I want you to pay

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.630
attention to is my test light here. I have
it hooked into the ground side of the circuit

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.969
and hooked up to the ground side of the battery.
What I'm going to do is step back to the passenger

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.759
compartment, turn on the fog light switch
and engage the headlights. You'll notice that

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:20.030
my test lights will light up.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.330
As you can see what I did was turn on the
headlights and engaged the fog light switch

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.849
and the test light lit up. I'm going to go
ahead and click the fog light switch on and

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.360
off a couple of times so you can see how the
circuit activates. That's off. My test light

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.360
should have gone out. I'm going to go ahead
and engage the switch again. As you can see

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:49.689
the test light lit up. In conclusion for the
diagnostic phase of our fog light job, if

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:55.410
you perform this last step; engaged the switch
and turned on your headlights and your test

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.290
light does not light up, it indicates that
there is a broken wire between your connector

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.510
and your switch. If your test light does light
up, that means that the problem is between

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.540
the connector and the lamp indicating that
your lamp has failed and needs replaced.
