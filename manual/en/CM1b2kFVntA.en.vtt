00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:04.609
My name is Paes164 and I'm a professional
artist.

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:07.910
I've been painting since a teenager, and I've
been doing it for 20 years now.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.080
Find me at Paes164.com (p-a-e-s-164.com) My
Facebook is facebook.com/paes_art.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:21.109
Off to the 
next letter in the alphabet, we're gonna move

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:22.179
up to the letter 'e'.

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.509
We're gonna work out a throw up so come feel
the energy.

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:26.810
Here we go.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.559
Nonstop, big bubble letter.

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:34.010
It doesn't have to be too crazy, again, you're
just trying to get it up on the streets so

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.070
people know what you're writing.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.190
Work our way around with the 3D, and continue
that throughout the whole name.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.370
Next we're gonna work on a blockbuster 'e'.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.559
Breaking it down in 2 shapes, the back half
of the 'e' and the front half.

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.539
You know the cool thing about blockbusters
you can make them appear to be a lot bigger

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.300
than what they are just by leaving the bottom
of your letter open and doing the same technique

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.170
of when you color it in and turn your can
to the side to create a fade and just fading

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.030
away the letter at the bottom.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.170
Okay, let's outline our 'e'.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.430
A little bit of inner outline.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.720
Blockbuster status.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:27.689
Okay let's get into a wild style 'e', breaking
it down just with a couple of shapes.

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.909
So being that the 'e' has more shape to it
itself allows me to do more creative things

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.530
too, making it a wildstyle.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.829
So I kind of leaned it out, almost creating
like a backwards 3.

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:47.000
It really helps too to kind of get your little
coloring pattern and your hand movements and

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.710
strokes down quickly so that you get the hang
of not overlapping the paint so much and creating

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.350
a lot of drips.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.280
So just real smooth, back and forth almost
like you're mowing a yard and working that

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.469
all the way down.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:10.410
Now that the film is done you can kind of
see more of the 'e' so I'm gonna add a couple

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.730
of little pieces to it and give it more of
a new shape.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.760
We'll do the 3D a little differently.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.300
Before we get into our black outline we're
gonna actually take the color and build our

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.120
3D up around, come back afterwards and outline
it in black.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.960
I'm doing a couple of little fades in the
piece, and I'm basically almost in the same

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.030
motion of leaning the can and kinda whipping
it down, so little whip, little whip will

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.580
give you that nice little cool fade at the
end of your line.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.250
of course having the right tips, skinny tips,
and not a stock spray paint tip is also gonna

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.430
make it look a lot cleaner.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.430
boom.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.940
A little purple, let's do some outline.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.170
So we're not gonna do any outline in black
that's gonna lead to the 3D so we're just

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.080
gonna divide it in half and then come back
around it.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:07.210
Move back up to the inner outline, the outer
outlines of the piece and if you are doing

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.401
the whole piece then this outer outline would
not go in between the letters but outer outline

00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:16.730
around the whole piece itself.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.940
There's a graffiti wildstyle letter 'e'.
