00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:04.770
Time Management - how do we manage our time?

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.940
You are going to have some unanswered questions,
it's very likely.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:39.440
Now if you are doing the hour per column method,
it's very hard to leave some unanswered and

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.040
stop and then move to the next column and
flip your example.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.430
You got to picture this now.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.930
Remember, be visual and rehearse it.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.720
That little timer goes off, you reset it,
and you figure out: "Question 31.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.079
I got to turn to question 31 in the booklet
and start that second hour."

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.210
Not that you're going to get graded on each
column, but it will again give you that momentum

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.801
that really push it.

00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:02.360
It's optional if you want to do it this way.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.360
That's what I recommend.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.000
You're going to have time to come back and
try to answer those ones that are unanswered

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.221
because it is 5 hours and 40 minutes, so if
you're doing one hour per column, you still

00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:14.610
have 40 minutes left over.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.299
You might find in another column you'll go
so quick, you have time left over.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.890
You actually got them all done within the
hour and go back to the ones in the other

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.040
columns you didn't finish.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.420
The purpose of it is to get your speed up
because you want to be able to read all the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.299
questions.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.400
Now, because you're going to get 45 wrongs,
this is what I recommend you do: Assess each

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.400
questions.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.030
You go to answer it.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.369
If it's an easy one, answer it right away.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.299
If it's one that you know for you, you particularly
have problems with or just scares you, rate

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.409
it real quick - one dot, two dots.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.310
One is medium, two dots is really hard.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.960
Move on, just skip it.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:03.450
You're doing this in your exam grid next to
the numbers 1 to 30, 31 to 60.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.780
Just a light dot, you can erase stray marks
at the end of the exam.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.229
Don't put it near the bubbles; put it to the
left of the number.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.229
That's your map.

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:12.569
That scan form is your map.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.620
You don't want to put it in the booklet because
then you have to flip through it.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.620
It's a comfort level thing.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.680
You have to trust yourself that you can do
this and that's why you practice ahead, and

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.600
then move on to the next one.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.550
What that will do is all the easy ones will
be answered, because remember, each question

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.319
has the same value.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:38.450
A quickie medical terminology question carries
as much weight as a cardiac cath, longish

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.290
report one.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.800
Don't over think or read into a question - how
many here are over thinkers?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.770
Probably all of you if you're really being
honest.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.050
Coders, they think, "They're tricking me.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.120
They're trying to trick me."

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.540
"Oh I know this procedure.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.370
We do it in my office all the time."

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.370
Oh!

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.760
Now you're depending to reimbursement knowledge.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.760
Okay?

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.000
Deal with the facts that are right in front
of you and that's it.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.910
Remember, it's a scenario where I call a blip
or a blurp, it's not a full note oftentimes.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.290
Sometimes, you get an OP report that's a full
OP report, but normally it's a scenario.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.250
"Mrs. Smith came to see Dr. Jones.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.040
She has been here two years ago..."

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.990
That's not how a real note reads, right?

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.569
Whatever they tell you, if they tell you it
was a complicated yadayada and you go, "That

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:32.920
doesn't sound complicated to me.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.920
They're trying to trick me.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.920
That's really limited.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.130
That's not complicated."

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.700
You are over thinking it.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.160
If they tell you the word, the buzz word in
the blip, take it.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.800
That's a gift.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.390
Take what they give you, don't overthink it.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.940
That will come through when you're doing your
practice test.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.620
If you're an over thinker and you go, "But
I thought...

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.810
I was over thinking it."

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.980
You'll start training yourself to not overthink.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.489
When you go to sit for the real exam, you'll
catch yourself doing that.

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:09.239
Remember, your job is to pick the best of
the possible answers.

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.010
You aren't taking a scenario, ignoring the
answers, trying to code it and see if your

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.340
code that you got matches one of the answers.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.229
You don't have that kind of time.

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.039
You need to look up the answers and then go
read the scenario.

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.690
I mean, except for maybe some medical terminology
questions or whatever.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.620
Once you know what the differences are between
the answers you know what to abstract for

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.389
in the scenario, right?

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.889
Because you're nervous and you're taking the
test and you're reading everything and everything

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.369
seems important, and you'll be circling and
underlining and highlighting everything.

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:43.069
Then you go look at the answers and then "Oh!

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:46.960
They're really testing me on the difference
between A and B. And you go look at, "Oh!

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.369
It's A. It is right here."

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:53.669
If you keep that in mind that your job is
to pick the best of the four possible answers,

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:54.669
the answers are key.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:55.960
It's really what you want to start with.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.059
That's going to help you know what guideline
they're testing you on.

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:06.669
Coding Certificate Exam Method 1 - Here's
a method, the Multiple Passes method.

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:13.909
We talked about the one hour per column, so
if you cycle through the whole exam, forget

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:16.089
about the one hour per column thing.

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:19.199
Just go through the whole exam and answer
all the easy ones.

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.349
Use the one dot, two dots for the ones that
you're going to leave behind.

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:28.669
Then, on the second pass, what do you think
you're going to focus on?

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:29.669
The one dot.

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.740
You're going to go for the medium hard ones,
and you're going to answer as many of those

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.740
as you can.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:40.110
Then, on the third pass, you're going to do
those two dot ones until you run out of time.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:47.759
That way, you are increasing your chances
of success and you're leaving those 45 wrong

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.119
ones for the really hard ones.

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:56.509
A lot of people do have time left over and
you can go back and check some work, but as

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:03.309
you've probably heard, your first gut reaction
of what the answer is, is probably right.

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:07.180
If you're just going back because if you have
extra time and you check in -- don't do that.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.379
But if you had one that you really want to
go back and check, put a check mark on your

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:16.300
answer grid next to that question number,
so you don't waste time and start changing

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.460
things that were already right.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.780
Once you're like, "I'm just truly not sure
and I've got it narrowed down to answer A

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.069
and C. But I got to come back and work a little
bit, but I want to move on.

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:27.520
I want to keep my speed going."

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.210
Which by the way, if you've narrowed it down
to two which you probably will, what I do

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.219
on the answer grid is I just do a light pencil
mark to the two that I think are the possible

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:39.279
correct answers.

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.869
So, when I'm at the very end and I've got
five minutes left and you want to fill in

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.240
any empty ones.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.069
You never want to leave any blanks because
you have 25% chance of getting it right.

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:51.509
If you've narrowed it down to two, well, pick
one of the two and erase the stray mark on

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:52.789
the other bubble.

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:56.619
Now you have 50-50 chance of getting it right
because you've already thrown out two wrong

00:06:56.619 --> 00:07:09.589
answers.
