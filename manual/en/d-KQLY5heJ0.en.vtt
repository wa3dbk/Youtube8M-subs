00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.030
To begin our install, we need to access the
rear storage compartment.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.000
So Ill open up the back hatch and disassembling
the panels to reach the wiring plugs behind

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.350
the taillights.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.300
With our hatch open, well start by removing
this interior compartment here.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.390
Theres one pushpin to remove on either side.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.789
Next well remove this panel here behind the
driver side taillight and repeat this on the

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.309
passenger side.

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.149
Now we can remove the threshold tube which
also has pushpins on either side.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.149
We move forward in the vehicle to remove this
panel here to aid in removing the rear compartment

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:53.280

as we to remove and then we can get it out

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.899
