00:00:00.254 --> 00:00:02.334
Hey, guys! So I don't know if it's
just me, but I feel like lately

00:00:02.334 --> 00:00:05.084
a lot of people have been a lot 
ruder to other people than they

00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:06.044
have been in the past.

00:00:06.044 --> 00:00:07.124
Ruder. Ruder.

00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:08.894
I'm ruder, but he's ruder.

00:00:09.084 --> 00:00:10.714
Ruder--What? Why does 
that sound so weird?

00:00:10.714 --> 00:00:12.884
Quick little spell check...ruder...nope!

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:14.654
No squiggly red lines, 
so it must be a real word!

00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:15.854
Don't act like you guys don't do that.

00:00:15.854 --> 00:00:17.594
But anyway, I've kind of noticed
that people in general

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:20.794
seem to be getting ruder.
More rude...er.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.840
I feel like, growing up, 
I didn't witness nearly

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.208
as many rude people as I do now.

00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:26.648
Then again, I did grow up in Hawaii, 
and if you're rude there,

00:00:26.648 --> 00:00:28.098
most of the time you just get beat up.

00:00:28.098 --> 00:00:30.608
I mean, I guess beating up people
is a little rude too, but I mean..

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:31.208
Off topic!

00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:33.458
Anyway, I feel like the world is 
becoming a more and more hateful

00:00:33.458 --> 00:00:34.538
and negative place lately.

00:00:34.538 --> 00:00:36.738
For example, I was at the coffee shop 
the other day and I witnessed

00:00:36.738 --> 00:00:39.558
a guy who slipped and kinda spilled 
some coffee on another guy,

00:00:39.558 --> 00:00:41.548
who reacted pretty rudefully.

00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:45.501
Oh! I'm so sorry.

00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:47.691
What the f*ck's your problem, bro?!

00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:49.751
Yes, if someone spills anything 
on you it's pretty upsetting,

00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:51.321
but you don't have to go 
and curse them out.

00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:54.262
And then, another day, I was at the gym--
it was actually a while back

00:00:54.282 --> 00:00:57.862
'cause I was at the gym--
clearly, you know, I don't even lift, bro.

00:00:58.212 --> 00:01:00.622
I was walking by these
two fairly attractive girls

00:01:00.622 --> 00:01:03.042
and being the nosy person that I am, 
I was kind of ease-dropping

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:04.002
on their conversation.

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.692
And basically they were talking 
about another girl that they were

00:01:05.692 --> 00:01:07.092
looking at that was on a treadmill.

00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:10.804
Do you see what she's wearing?!

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.704
- You do not come in the gym like that.
- Mmm-mmm.

00:01:12.704 --> 00:01:14.498
Hasn't she ever heard of shaving?

00:01:18.205 --> 00:01:20.645
And then most recently, 
which pretty much inspired me

00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:22.705
to make this video, I had to go 
to a place where there's nothing but

00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:26.105
built up anger, frustration, and just
all around rudeness and hate

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:27.435
throughout the entire facility.

00:01:27.435 --> 00:01:28.435
Next.

00:01:29.083 --> 00:01:30.223
I said next!

00:01:30.534 --> 00:01:32.774
If you're a driver, you know 
exactly what I'm talking about.

00:01:32.774 --> 00:01:33.434
But you get the point.

00:01:33.434 --> 00:01:35.654
I mean, I get it. Everyone has 
bad days, including myself.

00:01:35.654 --> 00:01:37.664
I mean, I'm not gonna lie, 
sometimes I do feel like pushing

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.934
back the guy who bumped 
into me on a crowded street,

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:42.074
or yelling at a waitress who 
brought me the wrong order

00:01:42.074 --> 00:01:43.944
after making me wait an hour, 
or even flipping off a guy

00:01:43.964 --> 00:01:44.944
who cut me off in traffic.

00:01:44.944 --> 00:01:47.844
But then I think of a model that I
kind of made up and it's helped me

00:01:47.844 --> 00:01:49.764
be a much more friendly
and positive person.

00:01:49.764 --> 00:01:51.854
And we all know all the generic 
things we heard growing up:

00:01:51.854 --> 00:01:54.264
Be nicer to others or treat people 
how you want to be treated.

00:01:54.264 --> 00:01:56.654
But those sayings are so vague 
and overused that the moment

00:01:56.654 --> 00:01:58.604
something bad happens, 
or if we're having a bad day,

00:01:58.604 --> 00:01:59.824
we just completely forget about it.

00:01:59.824 --> 00:02:01.854
Which is why I created 
a new campaign that is even more

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:04.004
straight-forward and hopefully 
a little less forgettable.

00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:05.654
The "Treat People Like 
They're Dyeing" campaign.

00:02:05.674 --> 00:02:08.234
I know it might sound a little negative, 
but it's the complete opposite.

00:02:08.234 --> 00:02:10.424
If everybody treated each other
as if they were &lt;i&gt;dyeing&lt;/i&gt;,

00:02:10.424 --> 00:02:12.374
people would be friendlier 
and more forgiving.

00:02:12.374 --> 00:02:14.564
For example, if you knew a guy
was &lt;i&gt;dyeing&lt;/i&gt; and he accidentally

00:02:14.564 --> 00:02:17.164
spilled coffee on you, I guarantee 
that you would not yell at him

00:02:17.164 --> 00:02:18.334
and you would not curse him out.

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:20.524
Seriously, don't worry about it.
It's just a shirt.

00:02:20.524 --> 00:02:22.444
Most people would not yell 
at a guy who's &lt;i&gt;dyeing&lt;/i&gt;.

00:02:22.444 --> 00:02:24.534
The world would have less 
mean girls because no one talks

00:02:24.534 --> 00:02:26.144
crap behind a &lt;i&gt;dyeing&lt;/i&gt; person's back.

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.669
She's so inspirational!

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:30.339
Seriously, she's so brave.

00:02:30.468 --> 00:02:32.378
In general, people would 
just be nicer to each other.

00:02:32.488 --> 00:02:35.458
Hi! So sorry to keep you waiting.
What can I do for you?

00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:37.118
But not only will people 
be nicer to each other,

00:02:37.118 --> 00:02:38.528
but when people realize 
that they're &lt;i&gt;dyeing&lt;/i&gt;,

00:02:38.528 --> 00:02:40.908
a lot of times that's when 
people live life to its fullest.

00:02:40.908 --> 00:02:42.878
No longer will people have 
to put off all the things

00:02:42.878 --> 00:02:43.908
they wanted to do in life.

00:02:43.908 --> 00:02:46.288
No longer will people have to wait 
until their father's death bed

00:02:46.288 --> 00:02:48.668
to hear the words, "I've always
been proud of you, my son."

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:51.458
No longer will people wait to chase 
after their real dreams.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.770
Some people may know their 
expiration date and some don't,

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.420
but in reality we're all &lt;i&gt;dyeing&lt;/i&gt; right now

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.740
because none of us live forever.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.075
Every second of every day 
we're one step closer to death.

00:02:59.075 --> 00:03:01.485
And I think it's about time we 
started treating each other like it.

00:03:01.517 --> 00:03:03.907
So the next time someone does 
something bad or upsetting to you

00:03:03.907 --> 00:03:06.437
and you feel like responding 
negatively, just remember:

00:03:06.605 --> 00:03:09.535
If you want to make this world 
a better place, spread the positivity.

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:11.178
Treat people like they're &lt;i&gt;dyeing&lt;/i&gt;.

00:03:11.756 --> 00:03:15.464
(inspirational music)

00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:33.381
Let's make the world 
a more positive place...

00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:35.331
Treat people like they're dyeing...

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:37.999
The hell?! That was so bad.
That was so cheesy.

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:40.139
- This entire video was so--
- I'm dyeing.

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.359
Inspirational! I wish I had 
that kind of courage.

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:43.179
Teehee!
