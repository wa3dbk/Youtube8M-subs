Hey guys.

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:10.900
Michael here with The Daily Note.Net.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.360
Welcome to the first ever Tips &amp; Tricks video
for the Samsung Galaxy Note 4.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.150
So when you receive the Galaxy Note 4 out
of the box, I think this is going to be the

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.259
number 1 tip I can suggest.

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:31.019
And as much as I like Flipboard, I don't think
it needs to be a part of our launcher.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.760
And I had the hardest time trying to find
out how to get rid of that thing.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.239
And it's actually more simple than you think.

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.720
So what I want is that I want to endlessly
just flip through and you can do that.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.500
Just find some empty space, long tap on it
on the bottom right hand corner there is home

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.150
screen settings.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.470
And just disable Flipboard briefing.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.280
You can also see here that you have different
ways you can do a transition effect.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.140
Actually, there's only one other option.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.070
And this is a very Galaxy Note 2 or maybe
even Note 3 style transition effect.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.430
But I really like the card stack so let's
keep it there.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.250
And now when you go back.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.569
You can see that there is no more Flipboard.

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:17.219
And you can continuously endlessly flip through
you launcher.

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.289
OK, so that's it for today.

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.719
This is my number 1 tip I can give you guys.

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:27.389
Is to disable the Flipboard because you do
gain a lot more functionality just by being

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:31.780
able to scroll through freely and it also
frees up some memory.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.329
And it doesn't add any of the jerkiness to
your homescreen.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.369
So anyways, I plan on doing a lot more of
these tips &amp;tricks videos as you saw I did

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.219
almost a hundred for the Galaxy Note 2 and
more than 50 for the Galaxy Note 3.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.459
And I hope to do as much on the Galaxy Note
4.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.810
So anyway, make sure you like, share, and
subscribe.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.499
And as always, thank you for watching.
