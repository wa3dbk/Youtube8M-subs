00:00:01.331 --> 00:00:05.862
Aquarium based on garden soil

00:00:02.331 --> 00:00:08.862
Aquarium based on garden soil

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.250
Tank 100liters, 25 gallon
      
        80x35X35

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:14.005
ground from molehills

00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:18.872
of the earth have been removed all the dirt, roots, stick

00:00:21.668 --> 00:00:24.668
spill ground on the bottom of the tank

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:37.569
shredded all

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:05.875
in the front of the aquarium put a layer of about 2-3 cm

00:01:10.817 --> 00:01:12.817
throw away all the dirt that have been overlooked

00:01:16.395 --> 00:01:19.395
it is important to move down ground from the walls 
 of the aquarium, so sunlight does not reach it

00:01:21.636 --> 00:01:23.636
otherwise can grow algae

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:37.849
to avoid problems with the entry of the earth into 
 the water column, put such a grid construction

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:42.350
grid available in every construction store 

00:02:10.988 --> 00:02:12.990
put gravel on the grid

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:17.150
that best pre-rinse

00:02:47.852 --> 00:02:49.850
at front of the tank  put 3-4 cm of gravel

00:02:55.827 --> 00:02:57.830
at the back 7-8 cm

00:03:03.843 --> 00:03:06.840
it will create the effect of depth, aquarium will seem larger

00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:20.950
befoor flooding, we need to put some vessel into aquarium

00:03:32.917 --> 00:03:36.920
after pouring the right amount of water, we can 
 pull the vessel out and begin planting

00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:40.920
I like to plant plants when there isn't too much water

00:03:58.845 --> 00:04:00.840
Spread the seedlings so it will be easy to reach them

00:04:05.216 --> 00:04:07.220
I cut the roots so that the plant will release new

00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:27.880
plant plants using large tweezers

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:34.720
foreground plants quickly grow

00:04:40.912 --> 00:04:42.910
preferably plant them at intervals of 2-4 cm

00:05:15.021 --> 00:05:17.020
I invite you to watch part 2
