00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:21.477
- [Blake] Ugh, these pizzas are rancid.

00:00:21.477 --> 00:00:24.174
- I know, it's literally greasier
than Chet Roller's backne.

00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:25.007
I'm not eating this.

00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:27.026
- Oh, me either, and I'm so hungry.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:28.652
- I know, I'm like, starving,

00:00:28.652 --> 00:00:30.071
but like not in that good way.

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:31.382
- Hi Blake, hi Kensi.

00:00:31.382 --> 00:00:32.669
Um, I wasn't listening to you guys

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.013
but I heard you say you were hungry

00:00:34.013 --> 00:00:37.173
and um, you guys should
totally have my sandwich.

00:00:37.173 --> 00:00:39.360
I made it myself.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.885
- We're not gonna take your
food from you Rachel Dratch.

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:42.811
- That's really weird.

00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:43.713
- No, you should take this cause like

00:00:43.713 --> 00:00:45.453
I'm not even hungry and
I don't even want it.

00:00:45.453 --> 00:00:47.069
Well, I mean, I do want it and I am hungry

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:48.056
but you guys should have it.

00:00:48.056 --> 00:00:49.697
Just take it, take it.

00:00:49.697 --> 00:00:51.205
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:00:51.205 --> 00:00:52.180
- I've always wondered what it's like

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.362
to sit here at this table.

00:00:53.362 --> 00:00:54.450
It's so nice.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.033
Great view, sturdy
construction, I knew it.

00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:03.591
- You need to relax, Rachel Dratch.

00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:05.699
- Yeah, are you like on
bath salts or something?

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:07.991
- Oh my god, you guys, those
bath salts are so crazy, right?

00:01:07.991 --> 00:01:09.894
Did you hear about that
guy who was on them

00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:11.255
and he chewed the other guys face off?

00:01:11.255 --> 00:01:12.737
- Duh, of course.

00:01:12.737 --> 00:01:14.922
- Yeah, that was kind of
shocking like two months ago.

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:17.143
- Two months ago, so over it.
- Exactly, I know.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:18.098
So over it.

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:20.653
It was two months ago, exactly, yeah.

00:01:20.653 --> 00:01:21.630
You know what would be really sad?

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.061
If anyone chewed your faces
off, cause you're so pretty.

00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:26.164
- Aw.
- Yeah.

00:01:26.164 --> 00:01:27.946
I bet you guys are
pretty even in the rain.

00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:29.727
I love how you do your hair, Blake.

00:01:29.727 --> 00:01:32.853
It's like a princess, or like
the lady on the cocoa package

00:01:32.853 --> 00:01:33.875
or something.
- Thanks.

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:35.746
Contemporary damsel.

00:01:35.746 --> 00:01:37.856
- Cool.
- It's my thing.

00:01:37.856 --> 00:01:40.078
- Did you guys hear that
congress was thinking

00:01:40.078 --> 00:01:41.673
of banning bath salts?

00:01:41.673 --> 00:01:42.816
- Yeah, well they totally should,

00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:44.269
because you can buy them anywhere.

00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:45.701
- Yeah, you know I heard you can buy them

00:01:45.701 --> 00:01:47.322
at that super skeevy place downtown.

00:01:47.322 --> 00:01:48.993
You know, with like The
Big Lebowski t-shirts

00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:49.826
and like those bongs

00:01:49.826 --> 00:01:50.731
in the window.
- Oh yeah.

00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:51.564
- The Mad Hatter.

00:01:51.564 --> 00:01:53.693
- Yeah, The Mad Hatter.
- The Mad Hatter, yeah.

00:01:53.693 --> 00:01:56.093
- So, Jenna P. said that
Emory Walsh got like

00:01:56.093 --> 00:01:57.280
a belly button piercing there,
- Stop.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.570
- and got full blown hepatitis.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.252
- Ew, or I bet he got pierced
by that really old guy

00:02:03.252 --> 00:02:04.803
who looks like the Burts Bees man.

00:02:04.803 --> 00:02:05.653
- Oh, that guy's so gross.

00:02:05.653 --> 00:02:06.650
- So creepy.
- He's gross.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.258
- Oh my god, you wanna know what I heard?

00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:10.745
I heard that he is Colin's second uncle.

00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:12.207
- No!
- No way.

00:02:12.207 --> 00:02:13.219
- No, not Colin, no not Colin.

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:14.451
He can't be related to Colin.
- Would I lie to you?

00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:15.284
- No way.

00:02:16.217 --> 00:02:17.681
- [Kensi] Oh my god, Colin's so hot.

00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:19.991
You could literally
grate cheese on his abs.

00:02:19.991 --> 00:02:21.709
- He's so beautiful.
- He's stunning.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.400
- Yeah, he's very attractive.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.677
Do you guys want me to go
get his number for you?

00:02:25.677 --> 00:02:27.044
- Don't do that.
- No.

00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:28.021
- No, cause I could go get his number

00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:29.739
and you guys could go on a
date with him or something.

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.156
I could even drive you, I have a car.

00:02:31.156 --> 00:02:32.442
- No, definitely not.
- Thank you, but no.

00:02:32.442 --> 00:02:33.787
- I could give you money
for the date if you want.

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:34.620
I could get you booze.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.453
Do you guys want drugs?

00:02:35.453 --> 00:02:36.286
I could get you whatever you want.

00:02:36.286 --> 00:02:37.139
- Um, Rachel Dratch, no.
- No.

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:37.972
- Do you guys like comedy?

00:02:37.972 --> 00:02:39.862
I mean what do I have to
do to make you like me?

00:02:39.862 --> 00:02:40.950
Do you like comedy?

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.336
Check this out, check this out.

00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:44.172
Oh look, it's my boyfriend, Pete Za.

00:02:44.172 --> 00:02:46.582
Oh, Pete Za, you're such a pizza face.

00:02:46.582 --> 00:02:47.594
Do you wanna make out?

00:02:47.594 --> 00:02:48.427
"Sure."

00:02:51.552 --> 00:02:52.385
- Oh my god we have to leave

00:02:52.385 --> 00:02:54.552
right now.
- We have to go.

00:02:57.996 --> 00:03:01.829
- Oh well, at least you
still like me Pete Za.

00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:07.968
(dubstep music)

00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:11.222
- Share this on Facebook
just like Jenna P.

00:03:11.222 --> 00:03:13.805
shared herpes with Harold P.

00:03:13.805 --> 00:03:16.149
- Oh my god that was a secret.

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:17.316
