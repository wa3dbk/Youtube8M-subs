Russ from Atomic is very kindly going to let
us take out these FIS Slalom skis what can

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.320
you tell us about these skis?

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.500
Well this is the world cup product.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.980
So this is the, the exact same ski that all
our top end athletes will use on the world

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.160
cup circuit through out the year.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.232
The ski at the moment is doing very very well,
we’ve changed the construction from what

00:00:28.232 --> 00:00:31.960
we had in the past so it’s a new ski here
with a new binding on it as well to get more

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.090
drive through the ski.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.180
OK and it’s a bit of a secret, secret model
I hear?

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.590
It is, I’d love to tell you exactly what
goes into the product and what it’s made

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.590
of...

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.590
But you’d have to kill me?

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.590
They won’t even tell me.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.590
OK

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.060
So, this is only known by the guys in the
race department.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.790
I think it’s the same with all the manufacturers,
we try and keep things a little bit secret

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.120
with these skis its your own recipe…

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.420
Just to stay one step ahead of the competition.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.590
Absolutely, yeah

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.260
Well I’ll give them a go, I’ll tell you
what I think.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Great stuff, go and enjoy them

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.260
Perfect

00:00:57.260 --> 00:02:03.869
Thank you

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:04.869
What an amazing ski.

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.420
A lot of fun to ski on and you can generate
a huge amount of power and energy through

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.420
the turn.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.379
If you get caught slightly in the back seat
you’re really going to know about it.

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:20.390
But such grip, such power, and really able
to hold the turn and create some amazing angles.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.499
I’m going to see if I can keep them.
