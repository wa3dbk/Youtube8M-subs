00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.380
Sony Xperia M.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.430
Expected Q3 2013.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.330
The Sony Xperia M is the sixth Xperia handset
announced this year, adding to what is now

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.670
a very large and somewhat confusing array
of Android smartphones being offered by this

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.890
Japanese manufacturer.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:37.190
In this case perhaps "M" stands for "midrange",
as the Xperia M comes with a 4" 480 x 854

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.610
pixel display, a 5 megapixel primary camera
with 720p video capture and 0.3 megapixel

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.320
front-facing one, a 1GHz dual-core processor
with 1GB of RAM, a pretty small 4GB of flash

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.160
storage plus a microSD slot, NFC support and
an FM radio. The Xperia M doesn't support

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.640
LTE data, but does support HSPA+ if your carrier
offers it.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:11.290
There are two versions available, the single-SIM
Sony Xperia M and the dual-SIM Xperia M dual.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.670
For some reason, the single-SIM version only
runs Android 4.1 out-of-the-box and the dual-SIM

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.090
version runs Android 4.2. Both handsets come
in Black, White and Purple colour schemes

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.229
with a rather jolly Yellow version for the
single-SIM variant only.

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.039
Inside is a 1750 mAh battery which is theoretically
capable of powering both versions for about

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:40.009
18 days standby time and 9 hours talktime
although real-world figures will be a lot

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:47.710
less. The Xperia M measures 124 x 62 x 9.3mm
and weighs 124 grams.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.439
Of course, the Xperia M also supports WiFi,
GPS and all the usual Android features, plus

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.700
the typical Sony extras are here too. Overall
the Xperia M is an attractive device which

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.509
is at least a bit different looking from a
Samsung or HTC.

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.560
People with long memories and an intimate
knowledge of Sony's product range might recognise

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.310
this as being a slightly upgraded version
of the Xperia J which currently retails for

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.660
about �210. We would expect the Xperia M
therefore to retail for no more than �250

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:30.189
when it comes to market sometime during Q3
2013.
