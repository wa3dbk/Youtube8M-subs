Hey this is trendblog.net and in this video
we will show you how to program an NFC tag

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.490
using an android device.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.789
What you need is an android device, which is
capable of reading NFC tags like the Google

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.340
Nexus 4 I got here, and, obviously, an NFC
tag like this one.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.050
To show you how to scan an NFC tag I will
tap my phone on the tag like this, and as

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.750
you might see it leads us to the trendblog.net website.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.750
So I'm going to overwrite this tag now.
I am going to use the NFC task launcher app,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.079
which you can download from the Play store
for free.

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.160
As you can see, the app offers you certain
location profiles, phone control, social options

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.170
and setting, which you can use to program
your NFC tag.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.170
But I am going to create a new setting from
the drop-down menu.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.250
All you have to do is add an action, like
this. Now you can choose what action you want

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.630
your NFC tag to trigger.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.630
I am going to choose the Wi-Fi On/Off action
and click Next.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.100
Now you can choose from the drop down what
you want the action to do: you can choose

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.520
from Enable, Disable or Toggle your Wi-Fi
connection. I will choose the Toggle option

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.100
and press OK.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.880
If you want to you can give your NFC tag a
name, but I am going to leave it like this

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.880
for now. And now I will press Save and Write.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.880
Now all you need to do is tap the NFC tag
with the back of your phone. So, that was

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.689
pretty easy.

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.729
Now the NFC tag should be programmed to Toggle
my Wi-Fi settings.

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.729
Let's see if it works.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.849
Yes it worked. As you can see the phone recognized
the NFC tag and my Wi-Fi is now turned off.

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.760
Since I've used the Toggle option, it should
turn my Wi-Fi back On if I tap the NFC tag

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.160
again.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.870
As you see, my Wi-Fi connection is back On.
You can tap the NFC tag again to switch your

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.890
Wi-Fi off.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.840
This is all you need to do to program an NFC
tag. You can download the app from the link

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.760
