00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.040
Food traceability it a national extension of our heritage,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.520
whether our customers are motivated by industry association initiatives such as PTI,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.340
the potential for governmental mandates, or pure operational efficiencies.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.460
Zebra and it's partners have a long history of helping our customers, and increase productivity

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.020
to the implementation of AI and TC solutions

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.280
that identify, trace, and track assets, transactions, and people.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.240
The primary benefit of implementing a traceability solution is replacing old methods of paper-based

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.260
record keeping with new electronic records and databases that can be accessed in real-time.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.700
This has enabled our customers to lower the potential recall expense,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.640
allow for easier and quicker trace-back of their products in the case of adverse event,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.700
make overall supply chain management more efficient.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.640
As an example, Zebra worked with one of our customers to implement an automated system with Zebra mobile printers.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:11.780
This help the customer reduce the number of errors that edged their system improving both efficiency and velocity of their operation.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.720
In this example, labels produced on a Zebra mobile printer, along with a handheld scanner,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.160
allow for this customer to check in his product at the receiving doc.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.740
As part of that he would identify the grower, and the number of flats and/or the cases of the product received.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.720
At that point, all of the data was sent over a wireless network to the company's ERP system.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.240
From that point forward, all of the data was available for real-time access throughout the supply chain.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.920
Food safety is becoming an even larger concern in today's world.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.800
Estimates from the CDC indicate that annually 76 million people get sick from food-born illnesses.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.040
Governments around the world, including the US government, have clearly taken notice.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.900
In the US there a number of legislations, both past and pending, that speak to the need for a national traceability system.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.080
While legislation continues to be discussed, industry associations have established initiatives

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.180
to address the issue of traceability.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.640
Zebra now quires building solutions that will help our customers comply with many of these initiatives.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.740
