Hi, I'm Bobby on behalf of Expert Village.
Everyone loves having a warm fireplace on

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.469
a cold winter day. The downside to that is
that you have to clean the fireplace. In this

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.339
series we are going to tell you how to clean
the inside of the fireplace, your chimney

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.710
and even repaint the inside of your fireplace
to make it look new. I've got my can opener

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.490
and I am going to open my can of paint here
and I want to emphasize and make sure that

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.490
you have your plastic down especially if you
have a fireplace like mine. This is white

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.890
and this is black paint. So if you got any
on your fireplace, you are in real trouble

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:43.981
then. So I am going to open this can of paint
up and I am going to need to stir this paint

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:48.710
because it is separated, it's an oil base
so some of the pigment is down at the bottom

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.430
so I need to get a stir stick and very carefully
stir this paint. You don't want to stir it

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.690
too fast because if you stir it too fast,
there is a chance that you are going to spill

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:07.131
some out the side. So just gently stir for
perhaps maybe 2 minutes. So now that out paint

00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:12.660
is stirred, we've got a brush and we are ready
to paint. I always like to start on the walls.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.020
I like to paint the walls first and that way
if any of the paint drips off the wall which

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.980
happens quite often when I am holding the
brush up there and a drip will fall down.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.070
If you painted the bottom first, you couldn't
blend those drips in. So if I paint the walls

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.890
and then I paint the bottom it kind of blends
all of the drips in. So dab a little bit on

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.180
there and just be very careful with this.
You don't want to get any black paint on anything

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:51.170
in your house. So let's start on the walls
here. More than likely you are going to have

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:00.190
to have two coats of this paint. And you will
let it set at perhaps an hour or 2 between

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:09.389
the coats. You just want to work it into all
the crevices, in between the bricks and try

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:14.770
to get everything covered with the paint.
So now I've painted the sides of the fireplace

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.739
and it is already starting to look a lot better.
Now I am ready to paint the bottom and as

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.670
you can see I had a few drips of paint so
that is why I always like to start on the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.709
sides and work on the bottom. So snow we've
finished painting the bottom of our fireplace

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.109
and as you can see it looks almost like new.
