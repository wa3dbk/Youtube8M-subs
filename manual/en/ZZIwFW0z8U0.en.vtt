"speaker 1: My name is Jason Elinoff.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.150
I'm a member of the critical care medicine
department here at the National Institutes

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.710
of Health.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.180
And right now we're in our 4D lab which is
our basic laboratory in the department.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.150
We are interested in investigating how the
blood vessels within the lung changed in patients

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.470
who have very high blood pressure in their
lung, what's referred to as pulmonary hyper

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:52.760
tension and so we're interested in what causes
these changes, and what are newer options

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.320
for treatment patients with this disease.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.250
Though I grew up I guess a relatively average
kid, I went to public school, I went to public

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.540
high school.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.400
My other was an elementary school teacher
so I think in some respects her work ethic

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.690
was what rubbed off on me the most.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.080
Maybe not the specific field, but the way
she approached her job, her students, had

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.400
a big influence on me.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:27.110
I guess I would say science became a prominent
part of my life when I was in college and

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.370
I enjoyed my initial pre-med courses and so
decided to major in chemistry.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:41.800
And so that's when I began doing laboratory
work experiments and found it very enjoyable.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.770
And I can always find something new, something
different that I did not know the day before

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:57.340
when delving into the lab and either doing
experiments or reviewing the literature.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.460
So I think the thing that I enjoy most is
that sort of variety.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.590
That chance to ask questions.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.920
When I get here in the morning I am doing
a combination of things in the lab.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.320
Some is cell culture work where we investigate
cells that are components of our blood vessels,

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.270
that make up our blood vessels.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.420
These are pulmonary artery endothelial cells.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.370
So these are the cells that we study that
line the blood vessels in the lung and play

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.340
a central role in producing disease in patients
with pulmonary artery hypertension.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.510
It's taking large databases, using some of
our own experimental data to investigate new

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.100
pathways that we are discovering in our experiments.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.390
And which cell proliferation assay is this?

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.520
So just to, tell me what you did for, the
time of the treatment was?

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.209
speaker 2: So I used the new drug that we
have and used low doses and treated for 12

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.438
hours only at this point because I wanted
to see the effect that it has early on.

00:02:58.438 --> 00:02:59.438
speaker 1: Nice.

00:02:59.438 --> 00:03:07.690
speaker 2: So I think it's not toxic at all.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:15.120
speaker 1: We have patients that come here
for their clinical care in addition to the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.040
research protocols that they're on.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.800
So we are the, our group offers specialty
care in the field of pulmonary hypertension

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.870
for these patients.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.920
Hi Barbara.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.550
This is Doctor Elinoff calling.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.660
Sorry to bother you.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.780
I just wanted to follow up on the test results
we did last week after we made some changes

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.780
to your medication.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.110
Right now the medications that treat patients
with pulmonary hypertension, predominantly

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:49.260
work to relax the blood vessels or try to
lower the pressure in the lungs.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.860
But we're beginning to learn that there are
many other new important mechanisms that are

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.720
likely causing disease in these patients.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.800
Things like targeting the inflammation or
immune cells.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.569
Hopefully that will lead to patients actually
seeing a cure of their disease as opposed

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.850
to simply maintaining their functional levels.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:21.689
Look for opportunities either as a high school
student or a college student to come to the

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:25.509
NIH or come to other places where you can
contribute in a lab.

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:30.650
We, there's a lot of programs that bring high
school and college students to give them an

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.360
upfront experience with what scientists do
every day and I think that just getting exposure

00:04:36.360 --> 00:05:10.969
to that with a scientist in a lab somewhere
is the best first step."
