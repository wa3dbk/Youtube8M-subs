Hi there, this is Gerph from RebusFarm

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.940
and we're gonna take a look at the 3dsmax job submission 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.640
Good, what we'll need is RebusDrop installed and a 3dsmax scene to export

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.570
access the farminizer through the
rendering menu

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.600
click on "Render with RebusFarm" over here

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.600
do a "Smartcheck" to check if you're
scene is ready for export

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.620
and it actually is not, there is an error detected over here

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.080
let's check out what it says: change some
preferences

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.260
let's go to the preferences.. files

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.680
enable this one, run the "Smartcheck" again

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.680
and check: no errors!

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.230
infos and warnings are OK, just remind you on stuff

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.390
so let's go and hit "Upload"

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.770
tooltip says "Upload started"

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.000
to see your upload progress you can either go to the menu here,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.960
check upload speed and stuff,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.600
but you can also open the ControlCenter in your browser

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.040
job uploads pretty quick

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.860
and here we go, job got queued directly

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.240
since it was set to auto start

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.710
just waiting to get some free nodes

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.480
here you go

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.700
please note that the progress bar can
sometimes stay at 0 percent at the beginning

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.870
because we're metering progress by nodes
completing render

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.760
well as you can see I fast forwarded to
render process a bit

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.750
job completed

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.550
download should be almost
done,

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.000
since it started downloading completed
frames during the active render process

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.560
okay as speaking of it, it finished

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.000
let's take a look at our downloaded output

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.040
by either choosing "Open download folder" from the render jobs menu

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.849
or left clicking the tasksymbol, if you
didn't change the default action for that

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.120
there's our downloaded output, let's have a
quick look at some of them

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.600
very good!

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.280
and that's basically it.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.740
thanks for watching this tutorial
