00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:06.380
How to Create a Phenakistoscope.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.190
The phenakistoscope is a predecessor of the
flip book, but don’t worry: it’s easier

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.150
to make than pronounce.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.909
You will need A piece of stiff paper 8-12&amp;quot;
on a side, such as a manila folder Drawing

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:28.939
paper A drawing compass A protractor A pencil
A thumbtack A ruler Scissors Rubber cement

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.189
and a wall mirror.

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.189
Step 1.

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:32.899
Plan out your animation with sketches.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.590
There should be 8 to 12 steps, each representing
a frame.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.191
The best animations for a phenakistoscope
are cyclical, like a horse galloping or a

00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:45.160
child jumping rope.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.160
Step 2.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.019
Anchor your compass point in the center of
the stiff paper and draw a circle that just

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.339
touches the edges.

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.780
Leave a small mark where the compass is anchored.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.629
If you’re using a manila folder, cut it
along the crease and use half of it as the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.670
stiff paper.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.899
Step 3.

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.120
Use the ruler to draw a faint line that bisects
the circle.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.260
Step 4.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.980
Use the protractor to divide the circle into
equally-sized “wedges,” with each wedge

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.280
representing a frame in your animation.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.730
To divide the circle into eight wedges, each
piece should be 45 degrees.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:28.950
For 9 wedges, 40 degrees; 10 wedges, 36 degrees;
11 wedges, 33 degrees; and 12 wedges, 30 degrees.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.950
Step 5.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.100
Cut out the whole circle.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.170
Step 6.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.660
Cut small rectangular slots about 1/8th inch
wide by 1 inch long along the separating lines

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.820
of each wedge.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.270
Start at the very outside of the circle and
cut inward.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.270
Step 7.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.720
Poke a small hole through the center of the
wheel, or slightly widen the one that is already

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.100
there.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.100
Step 8.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.880
Repeat Steps 2 through 5 on the drawing paper,
but make this circle 2 inches smaller in diameter.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.880
Step 9.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.460
On the drawing paper circle, create your animation
step-by-step, clockwise around the circle.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.930
This is your animation wheel.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.930
Step 10.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.630
With a small dabs of rubber cement on the
back, align the animation wheel so that it

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.580
is centered on the thick paper wheel.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.130
Allow 10 minutes for the rubber cement to
dry.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.530
The smaller wheel should come about to the
slots you cut in Step 7.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.530
Step 11.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.040
Poke the thumbtack through the animation wheel
and the hole you created in the heavy paper…

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.040
Step 12.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.140
Push the thumbtack into the side of the pencil
eraser.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.750
It should be in firmly enough to stick, but
still loose enough for you to be able to spin

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.750
the wheel freely.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.750
Step 13.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.940
Face the mirror, then hold your phenakistoscope
up with the animated side pointed away from

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.940
you.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.940
Step 14.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.080
Gently spin the phenakistoscope while looking
through the slits.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.370
The animation will appear in the mirror.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.219
Did you know The phenakistoscope was invented
in 1832 by the Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau.
