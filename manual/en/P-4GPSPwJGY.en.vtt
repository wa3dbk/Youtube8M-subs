00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:17.754
Isn't it amazing what
kind of stuff one can

00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:20.254
find in their garden? Like
for example a dino egg,

00:00:20.255 --> 00:00:22.754
who'd have expected that?
And it seems to contain an

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:26.999
adult Brachiosaur - well, at
least a tiny adult Brachiosaur.

00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:30.877
Pretty handy the dino who laid this egg
wrote on its shell what to expect inside.

00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:35.157
He even added tools to make
it easier to excavate his

00:00:35.788 --> 00:00:37.737
petrified spawn from the egg. Marvellous!

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.764
Guess who made it? Simba of course,
they really make a lot these days.

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:46.824
Well, let's excavate, shall we?
Where's my knife?

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.573
Here it is!

00:00:54.774 --> 00:00:59.092
Nifty as he was, the dino wrapped
the egg in plastic, amazing!

00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:04.247
How do I open this?

00:01:05.606 --> 00:01:07.038
Good Lord ...

00:01:11.016 --> 00:01:13.433
Maybe they should have added
tools for that as well ...

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.135
Oh boy ...

00:01:26.748 --> 00:01:30.716
Yeah, that was certainly harder
than expected but here we are.

00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:37.151
A brush.

00:01:39.038 --> 00:01:40.313
Some kind of chisel.

00:01:42.551 --> 00:01:43.636
And ...

00:01:44.265 --> 00:01:46.031
The grey matter ...

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:50.507
in which a dinosaur is supposed to
be hidden. It's also wrapped in plastic

00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:52.863
so its contents keep fresh.

00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:57.870
Looks like it's some kind of
rather crumbly cement, great.

00:01:58.574 --> 00:02:01.073
What does the dinosaur
who laid this egg want

00:02:01.074 --> 00:02:03.573
to tell us about it?

00:02:03.574 --> 00:02:07.288
A xeroxed sheet of paper saying "Art
&amp; Fun", and that's mostly it.

00:02:08.254 --> 00:02:12.007
"Danger of suffocation, small parts which
can be swallowed." Yeah, whatever.

00:02:15.226 --> 00:02:16.412
Right!

00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:20.397
Not really all that interesting.
Let's get to

00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:22.628
cracking this egg. Question
is, how will we do that?

00:02:25.256 --> 00:02:28.419
Well great, this could
take bloody ages.

00:02:32.802 --> 00:02:36.791
Eh ... this must be some kind of joke.
I guess we'll need

00:02:36.817 --> 00:02:40.741
bigger tools as this won't work at all.
One moment please!

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:42.866
Where did I put the
damn hammer again?

00:02:43.098 --> 00:02:45.899
Maybe children are less
impatient than me, but

00:02:46.548 --> 00:02:48.059
this hammer should fix it.

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:55.882
Oh great, this doesn't
help much either.

00:02:57.999 --> 00:02:59.404
What the hell is this made of?!

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.524
Aha!

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:07.147
Look, a dinosaur!

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.402
Let me zoom in a little ...

00:03:11.622 --> 00:03:13.325
so you can actually
see something.

00:03:17.683 --> 00:03:19.981
As any real
archeologist we'll use

00:03:21.236 --> 00:03:22.577
excessive force.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.573
Nothing else really does the job.
Now, let's use the

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.901
brush to get the last
bits of pulverized bone

00:03:28.927 --> 00:03:30.144
parts out of it.

00:03:31.998 --> 00:03:33.585
This is all very exciting!

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:35.887
I can hardly wait!

00:03:36.295 --> 00:03:37.813
Wonderful, there he is!

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.495
A rather skeletonized
Brachiosaur.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.416
And the entire table
is covered in dust!

00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:46.305
It's all crumbled cement.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.493
Marvellous. The dino itself
is made from rubber so you

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.970
can't really break it even
when hitting it with a hammer.

00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:53.616
At least this part
is well thought of.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.789
But it's all so dirty and
dusty it really isn't

00:03:56.815 --> 00:03:59.794
all that enjoyable, my
entire table is a mess now.

00:04:00.438 --> 00:04:03.952
But then of course, real
archeologists sometimes

00:04:04.295 --> 00:04:05.466
have to dig in the dirt too

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.845
to excavate their stuff.

00:04:08.445 --> 00:04:11.942
So I guess the kids should do
that too, and why not? All in all

00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:15.201
this is not really what I
expected it to be, but I don't

00:04:15.227 --> 00:04:18.249
really know what I should have expected.
After all it's made by

00:04:18.275 --> 00:04:21.271
Simba - about anything Simba
makes is disappointing to me.

00:04:21.304 --> 00:04:23.803
But at least now we know how
to excavate a dinosaur:

00:04:23.804 --> 00:04:26.184
using a hammer and
a screwdriver!

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.700
See you next time!
