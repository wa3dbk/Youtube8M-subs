Hi Guys - Welcome to GoKids video.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:11.030
Today we are looking at the Disney Pixar Cars London Race 7-car Gift Pack.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.580
This one is sold at Target, but you can also
sometimes find it on Amazon, 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.620
so we put a link there in the comments.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.100
This collection has 7 awesome characters.
Let’s open up the box and check them out.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:44.870
We have Nigel Gearsley, Francesco Bernoulli,
Lightning McQueen, Chauncy Fares, Ramone,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.600
Flo and Sarge.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.520
Let’s take a closer look.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.440
First, we have Nigel Gearsley. He’s an Aston
Martin who wins lots of races!

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.530
Next is Francesco Bernoulli. He’s a really
fast Formula One car!

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.380
And now Chauncy Fares, our favorite London
black cab.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.520
Then World Grand Prix Lightning McQueen! Ready
for the race!

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.800
In the back row, we have Race Team Sarge,
the bravest soldier around!

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.600
Then Flo, just back from her cafe.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.860
And finally, Union Jack Ramone. He loves a good paint job 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.820
and this one looks just like the British flag!

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.700
These cars are all ready for the London race of the World Grand Prix! 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.120
Who is your favorite? 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.640
