Good! for this effect tattoo need to know that much depends on the color, as it passes the video will explain in detail that, well the image of the tattoo can be a totally black color piece, or use an image of any type as well as in my example, we'll cut to the color range, if your image is very low in quality will look like with small pixel errors, I will use something more even than this plugin Cadre was not cast for this, serves to remove the white background.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:29.000
what follows! is to export the happy picture, but of course! magic will not only engaging but it will work a real tattoo, cloning, pressing Ctrl + J and changing the perspective view and Ctrl + T in a curve from the legs to a lower back, it will give more realism.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:08.000
with lasso tool, or eraser, remove the exes, or protruding, and mergers layer, which is the way we will see what else we have, in my case will be, darker color, it serves, in blacks, hiding in shadows and black objects.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:03:00.000
what comes next, this is very important, have to recognize that even that is tutorial, does not mean they explain everything, I just wanna teach them some shortcuts, and recommendations, not all have to like me, well, in a few words, what the video shows is, cropping an image, attach it somehow, capture range and skin tone, opacity, and it's all, but I want to take this into account, and that practice makes perfect.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:41.000
However, after creating our tattoo, go down the opacity if you think about it, that they had had the opportunity to see a real-Cadre tattoo, friend, or acquaintance, perhaps may have noticed, make them with some shade , well, blending options will qualify shadow, not too intense, and almost to the distance design partner, that will, of course! to give more realism, explain me clearly?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:10.000
the last thing left is to give if you want a different color, pressing Ctrl + U tone saturation will move the range that we like, remember it can be anything, just keep in mind that the higher quality, more care will, in detail, after all, it's your world, your space.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Shut up already! that nonsense you say, well, this was the whole video, I hope you have clarified your doubts tattoo color, see you in another video, greetings, samus sensei!
