&gt;&gt; Maj. Gen. Michael Tucker: You
have no idea what you can accomplish

00:00:23.316 --> 00:00:24.596
until you start going to college.

00:00:24.906 --> 00:00:27.956
It will open doors that you
don't even know exist.

00:00:27.956 --> 00:00:31.716
And you will have such a sense of pride
and such a sense of self accomplishment

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:34.946
that you'll be able to just
about do anything you want.

00:00:35.516 --> 00:00:42.666

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.706
That mantra stayed with me, be all you can be.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:49.106
And so I'd always ask myself,
are you all that you can be?

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:55.776
And a friend of mine was taking college classes
so I kind of thought, well maybe this isn't

00:00:55.776 --> 00:00:59.356
such a bad idea and I could
probably be all I can be.

00:01:00.516 --> 00:01:02.576

00:01:03.076 --> 00:01:05.476
They were very accommodating to my schedule.

00:01:06.016 --> 00:01:12.426
Gosh a month later I was taking English
101 and I just -- I thrived on it.

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:13.646
I enjoyed it so much.

00:01:13.996 --> 00:01:15.116
I went to UMUC.

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:17.976
I saw Mr. Milton and he took
care of me and I was happy.

00:01:18.516 --> 00:01:23.576

00:01:24.076 --> 00:01:26.286
My first sergeant would tell
me, hey Tucker get in the Jeep.

00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:31.476
When I take chow back to the Mess Hall, you ride
with me and I'll let you go to class tonight.

00:01:31.796 --> 00:01:37.846
I didn't ask him to do that but
he took away a hurdle for me.

00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:44.546
[Music]

00:01:45.046 --> 00:01:47.556
I'm with the education center in [inaudible]
and I said this is what I want to do.

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:50.796
I want to let soldiers go
to class two days a week.

00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:51.786
Can you work with me?

00:01:51.786 --> 00:01:54.976
And they said if you've got the
enrollment, yeah we'll work with.

00:01:55.546 --> 00:01:56.296
And so they did.

00:01:56.986 --> 00:01:58.796
And so we started Rogue [phonetic] University.

00:01:58.796 --> 00:02:03.466
We had over 250 soldiers going to college
in a battalion of 500 that was significant.

00:02:04.516 --> 00:02:08.546

00:02:09.046 --> 00:02:11.606
We're the ready first brigade
so we created Ready University.

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:15.716
Well now I had about 200 soldiers
going to college and we pushed it

00:02:15.716 --> 00:02:18.226
up to around 2,500 going to college.

00:02:19.096 --> 00:02:20.666
And it was terrific.

00:02:20.696 --> 00:02:25.466
It had an enormous effect on the morale of
the brigade and the discipline of the brigade.

00:02:26.516 --> 00:02:33.676
[ Music ]

00:02:34.176 --> 00:02:34.886
Now I had a lot more soldiers.

00:02:34.886 --> 00:02:36.426
So we created Moore University [phonetic].

00:02:36.426 --> 00:02:40.716
We had 8,000 soldiers at the peak
going to college in [inaudible].

00:02:41.696 --> 00:02:44.776
It was unbelievable and it
was a win-win for the Army

00:02:44.776 --> 00:02:46.386
because they gave me so much back to the Army.

00:02:47.206 --> 00:02:48.306
You know they were the best soldiers.

00:02:49.516 --> 00:02:53.596

00:02:54.096 --> 00:02:58.806
There's 26,000 people who work at the Pentagon
but almost every day somebody comes up and says,

00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:02.196
you know I was with you at Fort
Stewart or in Germany or in Korea

00:03:02.196 --> 00:03:04.326
and you allowed me to pursue my education goal.

00:03:05.076 --> 00:03:09.016
And I'm a Lieutenant Colonel today
or I'm a Master Sergeant today

00:03:09.196 --> 00:03:11.266
and thank you for giving me that opportunity.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.676
And I say well you gave it to yourself.

00:03:13.676 --> 00:03:15.436
You reached out and walked through the door.
