The back cross. Everybody's seen it. Everybody
thinks it looks cool. It's the throw behind

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.740
the back. Some people just call it a behind
the back throw. It's really called a back

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.920
cross, cause' it crosses your body. You throw
it from; I'm throwing it from my left hand,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.640
and I'm catching it in my right. It's no different
than doing this, except I'm throwing it behind

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.570
my body instead of in front of it. The key
to throwing in a back cross in three ball

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.360
juggling; like so many tricks, is not the
throw itself. It's not even the catch. It's

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:42.920
the throw before the trick, okay? Most people
are so worried about getting their arm behind

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.100
them that they neglect the throw beforehand.
And they might get a good throw from here,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.070
but the throw that they threw previous; that
they might have to bring this hand back from

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.090
around their body to catch, is usually thrown
so poorly that it ruins the whole trick. They

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:08.520
end up reaching for it. So the key is first,
learn with one ball just how to do that throw,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:18.619
which is quite simple. I'll show you. You
can look at it from behind. It doesn't require

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:25.780
any sort of contortion. It shouldn't hurt.
One way that kind of works for me is I trick

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.389
myself, is I I kind of look in your periphery
for where you want that ball to be in the

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:37.951
air to catch, and you kind of inevitably throw
the ball to that area. It's just kind of a

00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:45.189
reflex for most people. Just imagine where
it's going to be, and you'll see it. So, like

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:57.189
I said, you throw the, pay attention to the
preceding throw; up, just like that, up. Practice

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.420
it with the other hand. And as long as that
first throw that you've really paid attention

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.319
to comes down catchable, the rest of it kind
of falls together. That's a back cross.
