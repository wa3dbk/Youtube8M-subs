00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.750
Derek wrote to me and he said do you
think a real progressive will

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.510
ever get the presidency of the united
states or are we doomed to forever have

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.090
Obama and Clinton types as the furthest
left

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.449
examples a viable presidential
candidates I'm optimistic about this

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.850
I don't know that we'll ever get a huge
jump to the left which we would get

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.060
potentially if we had serious campaign
finance reform

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.230
and just drastic changes to the
electoral process even if we forget that

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.739
the country is liberalizing progressive
eisin call it what you want

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.899
if you look particularly its social
issues if you look at things like

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.510
research would stem cells if you look at
how much of a problem is in a quality

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.160
gay marriage and abortion the country is
moving to the left it's just that though

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.460
those who resist by definition resist

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.809
very fever in tlie to quote lewis's new
urban dictionary word

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.739
because they out they want things to
stay the same right conservatism is

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:58.270
about

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.539
not progressing or the slowest possible
progress out that that anyone can

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:03.379
imagine so

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.270
yeah I think the bar for what is the
mainstream democratic platform will

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.990
probably slowly moved to the left so
that's good

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.530
but I don't know that there will be a
really big jump to the left a must be

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.810
completely up and our

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.960
electoral system I agree I think you
know it

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.720
in general I don't think it's the
country I don't think it's the voters'

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.710
who a are kinda

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.040
the I don't know I don't think it's the
boaters who wouldn't allow

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.340
a guy who's really are or girl was
really far to the left

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.979
into office I think it's I think it's
money I think it's the corporation's I

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.500
think it's the special interest groups

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.530
are I think it's that all part of the
political

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.060
game that is preventing someone who is
more to the left then Obama

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.829
from being a real real candidate I guess
and let's be honest

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.899
Hillary Clinton I in my estimation is is
to the right of President Obama and we

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.030
don't even know that she is running in
2016 but if she is ultimately though the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.740
nominee

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.750
I think it will probably unless she
evolves on certain issues

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.250
be a move to the right for the
democratic party yeah I'd probably would

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.230
unfortunately but yeah I it she would
probably be better than the alternative

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.610
whoever that may be I think we can
probably safely assume that II don't

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.940
know all your thing on the republican
side right now

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.220
okay about that we we may have better
alternatives on the democratic side

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.020
certainly
