00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.087
I'm here at the Ricoh Arena for British Alpaca Futurity

00:00:03.087 --> 00:00:06.105
I've never been to an alpaca show before so I'm not really sure what to expect.

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:10.436
I'm hoping that my alpaca wins the Cutest Alpaca prize!

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:15.284
I'm wearing my Alpacalypse hoodie today, that you can get from my website cakeswithfaces.co.uk

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.453
So let's see what's going on!

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.030
Look this one's got panda eyes!

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.249
I see your alpacas have some rosettes - what did they win?

00:01:06.993 --> 00:01:09.153
Greg won Intermediate Grey Male

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:14.363
The championships are done by age group and colour

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:19.194
So you have all the junior whites, intermediate whites, and so on

00:01:19.194 --> 00:01:21.657
...through all the colours - there's 24 colours.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:31.997
[funny alpaca noise]

00:01:42.398 --> 00:01:42.958
So soft!

00:01:46.163 --> 00:01:47.843
It looks kind of crimped!

00:01:47.843 --> 00:01:50.746
They've had their hair done before they were shorn!!

00:02:06.557 --> 00:02:11.517
We've been told that these are the top alpacas in the UK - these are the best!

00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:18.224
They're almost as tall as me!

00:02:20.964 --> 00:02:23.924
Some of them look too fluffy to see very well!

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.720
Congratulations on your alpacas winning some prizes!

00:02:28.888 --> 00:02:31.048
You said it was the two grey ones?

00:02:31.105 --> 00:02:34.225
And they're not as common as the other colours?

00:02:34.225 --> 00:02:36.635
The greys are more difficult to breed

00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:38.220
So you don't get them as often.

00:02:38.448 --> 00:02:40.848
Why are there all these fans around?

00:02:40.932 --> 00:02:42.932
It's to keep the alpacas cool.

00:02:42.932 --> 00:02:44.557
Because they've got so much fleece on...

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:47.499
and it's quite warm in here with the lights

00:02:47.977 --> 00:02:51.977
They'd get very sweaty and their fleeces collapse and droop

00:02:51.977 --> 00:02:53.692
Because they get damp inside

00:02:54.234 --> 00:02:58.554
So the fans keep the air circulating and it cuts down the humidity

00:03:04.993 --> 00:03:09.553
This one definitely looks like he's going to start the Alpacalypse!

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.740
I think these ones are going to win Fluffiest Alpacas!

00:03:29.317 --> 00:03:32.277
I love your little alpacas, they're so cute!

00:03:32.277 --> 00:03:33.909
You said they're made in Peru?

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.865
They are, yes - we do a lot with the Peruvians to support them in their efforts with alpacas

00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:42.258
And we're of course doing as much as we can with the UK and our own alpacas

00:03:42.258 --> 00:03:46.096
...using their fleece: it's hypoallergenic, super soft, super-fine.

00:03:47.758 --> 00:03:52.078
I heard that alpacas were first tamed by the Incas 6000 years ago?

00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:54.306
They were actually developed by the Incas

00:03:54.407 --> 00:03:58.727
They developed the alpacas and llamas from wild strains of animal

00:03:59.347 --> 00:04:01.107
called guanaco and vicuna

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:02.849
in the camelid family

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.780
Thousands and thousands of years ago

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.020
They developed the llama for carrying things - very much bigger than alpacas

00:04:11.212 --> 00:04:13.532
And very broad backed, very strong

00:04:14.226 --> 00:04:16.066
And very short, wiry fleece

00:04:16.066 --> 00:04:19.526
They developed the alpaca for it's wonderful fleece

00:04:20.837 --> 00:04:27.637
And that fleece is temperature reactive, so it keeps the Incas warm in the winter and cool in the summer

00:04:28.174 --> 00:04:32.414
I heard that their fleece is flame retardant too, is that true?!

00:04:32.414 --> 00:04:35.419
I haven't personally put a match to any of my alpacas...

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.606
And I don't think I'll be doing that!

00:04:38.406 --> 00:04:41.366
But to be honest I have put flames to the toys.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.370
How can you do that?!

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.237
I wasn't just feeling vindictive one day...!

00:04:49.927 --> 00:04:52.007
We have to check for fire safety

00:04:52.007 --> 00:04:54.015
So they have had a flame put to them

00:04:54.015 --> 00:04:55.471
And yes, it is flame retardant

00:04:56.476 --> 00:04:59.196
So it won't ignite, it'll just fizzle out

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.000
Look, you can knit your own Albert the Alpaca from alpaca wool

00:05:07.003 --> 00:05:10.683
Doomsday Knits: Projects for the apocalypse and after

00:05:10.683 --> 00:05:12.264
Or: The ALPACALYPSE and after!

00:05:12.264 --> 00:05:16.193
These people at the Yarn Garden have clearly shorn my alpaca!

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:20.539
And this one matches me!

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.925
Look at these dragon scale gloves - they'd be really good for a Game of Thrones cosplay

00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:28.401
I love your sign: "Dress like no one's judging"

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.980
That's your motto?

00:05:30.077 --> 00:05:33.517
It is my motto, yes, I came up with it quite a while ago

00:05:33.517 --> 00:05:36.029
And just suddenly went - oh my god! - dress like nobody's judging.

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:42.448
Because that's totally where my designs are from, and where my heart and belief in what I'm doing is from

00:05:42.678 --> 00:05:44.598
As well as being sustainable

00:05:44.598 --> 00:05:51.218
Instead of conforming to high street fashion and "we've got to be wearing this at this particular season"

00:05:51.456 --> 00:05:53.136
And then throwing it away

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.580
That's terrible!

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.080
Yes, and having no freedom in how we actually really want to be.

00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:18.991
Well I have certainly never seen so many alpacas!

00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:22.476
If you want to come to this show next year, I'll put the link in the description

00:06:22.476 --> 00:06:24.506
It's called British Alpaca Futurity

00:06:24.506 --> 00:06:28.169
Remember to check out my other videos and subscribe if you like them

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:29.854
They're a bit different from this one!

00:06:29.854 --> 00:06:34.984
