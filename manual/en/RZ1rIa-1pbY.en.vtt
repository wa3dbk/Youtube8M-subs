00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.810
This is another fun way to use wooden spoons
to decorate your kitchen. I use the wooden

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.930
spoons that were natural, you could also use
the wooden spoons that are already white or

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:20.610
painted white or you could even use wooden
spoons that are different shapes and textures.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.360
Any one of these would be a fun way to do
this and I use the ones that are the natural

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:35.219
color. The first thing you want to do is to
find vegetable seed packets that are the colors

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.629
that you want for your kitchen or you can
go Online and Google vegetable seed packets

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.389
and you will come up with these pictures.
You're going to take your bowl of your spoon

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:54.949
and put it bowl side down on your seed packet,
or on your print from the Internet, and trace

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:02.670
around it. Then you're going to cut it out
and lay it on your bowl. It's going to be

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.530
a little bit too big for the bowl because
it's flat and the bowl, of course, is curved.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.840
Once you have it cut out and you put it on
your bowl, you can see that it's a little

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.230
bit too large but you want to cut it just
a little bit evenly all the way around, keeping

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:31.110
that shape, so it'll fit right in your bowl.
Then you're going to use a liquid glue like

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.030
tacky glue, Elmer's glue, or some other liquid
glue, and put a nice fat bead of glue down

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.480
the middle, put your seed packet, or paper,
on it and then spread it to the sides and

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.240
kind of hold it as you spread it so that it
adheres. They'll be a very little bit of wrinkling

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.480
but you won't see it. Once you have finished
that and your glue is dry, you'll want to

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.900
seal it with Mod Podge or some kind of varnish.
You want to seal your entire spoon because

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.790
it's going to hang in your kitchen where,
naturally, you'll have humidity. For this

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:16.879
one, I used the flat top spoon, as well as,
the round bowl spoon. Once I had my seed packets

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:24.459
on all of these, I took this Heather piece
of artificial flower, and wired it to the

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:33.599
back of the middle spoon. Then I took my asparagus
and tied some raffia around it and hot glued

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.930
it right down the center of the spoon and
took this big old carrot and this bean pod

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.849
and glued them on the other two spoons. You
want to glue your spoons together, at the

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.700
bottom, with hot glue and also where they
touch, you'll want to glue them together because

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.379
if you don't, when you hang them, the spoons
will slowly spread and fall. For your final

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.889
touch, once you have glued your spoons together
at the bottom and where they touch at the

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:08.499
top, you'll want to put a hanger on it. These
wonderful little screw eyes are great for

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:13.709
hanging things. They're small, they won't
split your spoon and you can screw them in

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:25.069
at an angle or you can take a piece of ribbon,
just make a loop, cut it off, and put a big

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.859
dab of hot glue and then turn it over into
the bowl of your spoon, and hold it down with

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:36.400
a point of a scissors or the point of a pencil
until the glue is cool, you'll also have something

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.959
that will hold it. When you have something
that is very light, the ribbon and the hot

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.599
glue work just fine but if it's a little bit
heavier, you'll want to use your screw eye.

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.260
You can just play with your raffia, move it
up and down, put it where you want it. Before

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.609
you glue it on you arrange your vegetables
how you'd like them and once they're glued

00:03:54.609 --> 00:04:01.599
on, there you have it, a nice vegetable wall
hanging for anybodies kitchen.
