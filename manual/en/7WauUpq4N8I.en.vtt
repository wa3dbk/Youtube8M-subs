00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.260
INTRO----
HEY GUYS I’M CATIE WAYNE AND THIS IS ANIMALIST

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.450
NEWS FUN FACTS!

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.300
THINK YOUR PARENTS WERE BAD?

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.030
WELL BE THANKFUL THEY WEREN’T ANY OF THESE
ANIMALS, THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL SEGUE.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.680
LIKE SEA HORSES, MALE PIPE FISH CARRY THE
EGGS BEFORE HATCHING.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.830
SCIENTISTS SOON NOTICED THAT BABIES WOULD
GO MISSING, AND DISCOVERED THAT THE FATHER

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.160
WAS ACTUALLY EATING THE EGGS!

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.450
NOW, IT’S ACTUALLY PRETTY COMMON FOR PARENTS
TO EAT THEIR YOUNG IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.660
BUT HERE’S WHERE THE PIPE FISH DAD GOES
FROM BEING A NORMAL, CANNIBALISTIC GUY TO

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.810
A FIRST CLASS JERK!

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.600
SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT DAD WILL EAT
THE EGGS IF HE THINKS THE MOTHER IS UGLY!

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.080
(YOUR UGLY I DONT WANT MY CHILDREN TO LOOK
LIKE YOU SO…

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.990
GOBBLE GOBBLE NOM NOM)
BUT WHAT DOES AN UGLY PIPE FISH LOOK LIKE?

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.750
WELL MALES FIND THE BIGGEST, FATTEST FEMALES
TO BE THE MOST ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.160
MORE EGGS WHICH HAVE A HIGHER SURVIVAL RATE.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.130
THE PANDA ALSO PLAYS FAVORITES!

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.670
FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TIME, PANDAS GIVE BIRTH
TO TWINS, HOWEVER, ONLY ONE WILL SURVIVE.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.670
WHY?

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.050
BECAUSE THE PANDA MOM WILL PICK THE STRONGEST,
HEALTHIEST LOOKING BABY TO CONTINUE NURTURING

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.850
AND LEAVE THE OTHER TO DIE.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.620
TO BE FAIR THOUGH, BAMBOO, WHICH MAKES UP
NINETY NINE PERCENT OF A PANDA’S DIET, IS

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.240
SCARCE AND LOW IN NUTRIENTS.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.360
AND SINCE MOTHER PANDAS DON’T STORE FAT
LIKE MOST OTHER ANIMALS DO, SHE CANNOT GENERATE

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.240
ENOUGH MILK FOR TWO HUNGRY CUBS.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.200
MANY TIMES, PANDAS CAN’T EVEN TAKE CARE
OF ONE CUB!

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.039
INFACT THE FIRST PAIR OF PANDAS IN THE UNITED
STATES, LING LING AND HSING HSING, GAVE BIRTH

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.030
TO FIVE CUBS OVER TIME, BUT NONE SURVIVED
INTO ADULTHOOD.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.080
THE PANDA’S POOR REPRODUCTION RATE MAY BE
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THEY ARE ENDANGERED.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.630
SURE THESE LAST TWO PARENTS ARE PRETTY BAD,
BUT THE CUCKOO BIRD DOESN’T TAKE CARE OF

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.790
ANY OF HER BABIES!

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.119
CUCKOOS DON’T BOTHER BUILDING THEIR OWN
NESTS, INSTEAD THEY LAY THEIR EGGS IN ANOTHER

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.530
BIRD’S AND HOPE THEY DON’T NOTICE!

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.450
THEY’RE EVEN ABLE TO MAKE THEIR EGGS MIMIC
ANOTHER BIRD’S.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.859
WITH THE LOVE AND CARE OF IT’S ADOPTIVE
PARENTS, THE CUCKOO WILL HATCH FIRST, GROW

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.939
FASTER, AND KILL THE OTHER CHICKS SO IT CAN
GET ALL OF THE ATTENTION.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.920
ALTHOUGH THIS GENERALLY ALLOWS CUCKOOS TO
GROW BIG AND STRONG, ITS STILL A TOTAL JERK

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.969
THING TO DO.

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.520
WHICH BEGS THE QUESTIONS - WHOS WORSE?

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.270
THE MOMS OR THE KIDS???

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.780
WHO DO YOU THINK IS THE MEANEST ANIMAL PARENT?

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.939
LET ME KNOW IN THE COMMENTS BELOW.
