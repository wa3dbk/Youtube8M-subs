00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.920
Once upon a time, very long ago,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.680
the birds of a forest, were ruled by The Hornbill.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.340
He had proclaimed himself,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.660
the king without anybody's consent

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.300
He was cruel and

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.540
unfair ruler.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.020
He was short-tempered and got angry very soon.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.660
Innocent birds would get scolding from him

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.220
without any reason.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.880
The birds did not like him.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.660
And wanted to choose a new king.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.940
One day they called a secret meeting of all the birds.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.960
The birds had chosen a tree,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.980
quite far from the forest,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.820
so that

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.200
The Hornbill would not know anything

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.460
about the meeting.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.680
The agenda of the meeting

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.060
was to choose a new ruler for them.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.380
Many names were suggested for the new King,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.580
and at last,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.000
Bulbul was chosen to be their King.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.480
All the birds agreed to make Bulbul their King,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.780
as she was kind and gentle.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.360
She humbly accepted the offer.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.840
However, there was one problem before them.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.660
How to tell the Hornbill that he was being dethroned?

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.080
Whoever went to him with the news would be killed.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.300
Don't worry about this problem.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.960
I have made a plan.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.060
To carry out my plan,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.020
I will need the help of our friend,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.020
The Woodpecker.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.040
If you all trust me, let me try out.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.740
All the birds accepted his offer.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.280
The Woodpecker agreed to help him.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.120
He took the woodpecker to a tree.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.800
Remain hidden.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.700
And cut the branch.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.280
Start pecking at it,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.720
just when one blow is needed for the branch to fall.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.320
After instructing The Woodpecker, flew to The Hornbill.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.180
The Hornbill was just wondering,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.360
where all the birds had gone.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.560
seeing The Owl he said,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.100
Where have all the birds gone today?

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.580
There is nobody to attend upon me.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.240
Your highness,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.100
all the birds feel that, you should prove your capabilities.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.600
We have decided to hold a branch pricking competition.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.280
if you succeed in breaking the branch,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.280
We will know your strength and power.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.460
However,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.000
if you do not succeed, and some of the bird succeeds,

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.200
he or she will be chosen our king.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.100
The Hornbill was proud of his potentials.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.900
He said,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.580
I am strong enough to break a branch .

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.760
Take me to the venue of the competition.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.040
And I shall break the strongest of the branch.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.880
Yes your Majesty.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.160
The Owl guided him to the tree where he had hidden the woodpecker.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.240
All the birds the forest were also present there.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.520
The Owl selected a strong branch of the tree,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.240
and said to The Hornbill.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.820
Your Highness,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.240
This is the branch you have to break.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.740
The horn Bill was so sure of his success.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.220
He at once started pecking at the Branch.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.260
He tried for a long time,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.300
but could not drink even a portion of the branch.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.180
Soon he grew tired.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.480
The Owl said,

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.920
your highness, the stipulated time is over.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.380
You could not break the branch.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.520
The next participant is the Bulbul.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.720
If she succeeds in breaking the branch ,she becomes our king.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.560
When I could not break the branch,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.260
how can such a delicate looking bird break it?

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.100
The Owl led Bulbul to the branch

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.480
that had already been cut by The Woodpecker.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.760
Only a last blow was needed to break it.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.280
The Bulbul had to peck at it only twice,

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.120
and the branch broke and fell to the ground.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.200
Everybody cried out with happiness,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.480
and cheered The Bulbul and proclaimed her their king.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.860
The Hornbill was so ashamed of himself,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.160
that he flew away from the forest and never showed his face again.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.440
The gentle and kind Bulbul,

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.660
thanked all the birds for making her their king.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.340
She specially thanked The Owl,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.540
and The Woodpecker.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.960
She justly ruled over the birds.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.200
The birds were happy to have such a kind and gentle King.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.700
Dear Children.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.300
Did you understand where the fault lies ?

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.520
Never be proud of yourself.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.860
If you be proud,

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.640
nobody will like you,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.800
and that certainly leads only to your downfall.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.800
So the moral of the story is,

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.240
Pride leads to downfall.
