00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.700
I really enjoy the job, it's a great
team environment.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.900
I really enjoy working for the NHS,
that's something I'd

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.910
particularly wanted to do when I was
looking for a job, I really wanted

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.950
the NHS. I love the work that
they do.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.900
It's something I really wanted to be part
of, to be helping people when they were sick.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.100
Staff across the directorate and many of them have come into working 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.820
in the oncology and haematology directorate because they're keen and enthusiastic to work with

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.210
patients who've got serious illnesses such
as cancer and they really want to do

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.870
something to try and help those patients
to

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.300
to get better and to cope with their illness. 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.700
I'm first port of call for the patients

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.050
and for the consultants, basically doing everything they need me to do

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.640
from booking appointments to 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.270
tracking down notes and answering any questions they need.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.760
No day is the same,  I like the job
satisfaction of

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.100
helping patients and feeling that I'm
benefiting and helping them. 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.100
Every day is different. There's never two days the same.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.550
You never know what challenges you're going to meet on a day to day basis

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.000
but that's part of the appeal for the job.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.159
Working with the NHS has given me lots of flexibility.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.270
Currently I'm doing a course
which is really good for me because

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.689
my manager has given me flexibility to work, in my working hours

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.020
so it's quite flexible enough and also
my bus pass.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.100
If I'm getting the bus pass within the normal red bus, I get it for fifty pounds, but within

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:26.710
the Trust there's

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.420
like a reduction so I'm getting my bus pass at the rate of 25 pounds which

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.040
is really really good for me and is saving me loads of money. 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.939
If you go home and you feel that you've
helped one person, one patient 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.360
then that gives you a sense of achievement but also it's,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.390
for me, working as part of a team

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.180
remembering that we are all here and we've all got an important job to do

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.040
and every part of that job is important and it's about making the people that do

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.659
those jobs feel important as well.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.130
There's a much better team environment
in this job

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.380
compared to retail when it's very
lone wolf so to speak

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.149
whereas the team here works as a team, a single unit, people very much part of 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.860
what we do. I'd like to end up at some
sort of management level

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.070
progressing from stepping stone to stepping stone.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.350
Seeing two or three go from where we are now to

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.850
MDT coordinators, medical
secretaries.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.370
People progress from where we
were to 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.470
like Elliott said MDT coordinators, secretaries, so it's seen as a pathway

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.900
which you kind of get your foot under the table.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.840
Some people come from retail

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.570
they have no admin experience at all,
that sometimes

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.520
puts people off. It doesn't have to, I
didn't have any admin experience at

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.030
all when I came into the Trust

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.350
but you can you can train, you can learn

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.030
you know, we can nurture. And I think
it's

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.750
as long as they're keen to learn and they're
willing to learn

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.200
then there's so many opportunities.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.680
I really needed a job

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.840
that was flexible and part-time. I've got young children 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.880
and I needed something that would work
with them so this is just absolutely

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.690
perfect. It's two days a week

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.330
which is exactly what I wanted. There's a 
Nursery available and childcare vouchers

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.770
and so there's help with childcare costs as
well associated with coming back to work

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.630
I've moved here because I'm higher up a band now which is more money for me

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.220
and as well I'm moving into a more
challenging role.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.550
I'm hoping to come to the top of my
career

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.080
which is going to be band 9.
I'm presently band 4

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.990
So with lots of training, motivation,
encouragement from my managers and

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.140
people I work with, I think I'll get there

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.410
The admin staff are part of the whole team and they are

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.760
an absolutely critical part of the whole team
because they're often the front

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.210
face, the people that the patients
will contact first of all

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.140
and we know that the admin team can make a really extra special experience for

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.400
the patients by the way that they deal
with our patients.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.860
I've had so many positive responses from
patients about how super the staff were

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.100
in dealing with their problems.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.490
We're helping so many people's lives and it doesn't matter how small a contribution,

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.920
you're affecting someone. I still have my life outside of work

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.160
it's just made me a better person outside of work.
