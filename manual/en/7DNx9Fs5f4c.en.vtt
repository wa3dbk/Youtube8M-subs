00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:20.449
Project by Noah Webster and Nathan Brase for
Biology.

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:31.289
All beats and lyrics are completely original
and done by us.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:41.760
Here are the lyrics to the rap: Let me give
you a little lesson in Biology

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.679
We can start with something small, like a
look at terminology

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:51.780
Transcription, it starts with RNA polymerase
opening up DNA just like my good friend helicase

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.359
Promoter, where it all begins for the enzymes.

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.120
A region on DNA like a runway.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.769
I'm tellin you buddy, it ain't that hard get
when I'm all done, you can use this knowledge

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.830
as an asset.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:14.560
Now that we've connected and opened our DNA,
It's time to synthesize some RNA 5' to 3'

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.170
That's how it works.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.400
Always the same direction, not matter what
quirks.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.930
There are two strands of DNA, a, umm, well....

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.330
A little lost for words?

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.330
That's okay.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.600
I'll help you out.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.700
And I think I know what transcription's all
about

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.540
Polymerase copies
The strand called anti- sense

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.690
A's turn to U's
C's turn to G's

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.740
Or opposite of that, whatever you please
This is our mRNA

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.390
A copy of the sense (the one with the genetic
code)

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.610
Now we're past that crossroad
Thanks to that transcription

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.310
Proteins are almost complete
