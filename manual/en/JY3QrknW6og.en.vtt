00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:14.839
about some advanced drum exercises. Paradiddle

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.560
drummer lets start with playing hands and
feet together and start slowly gradually speed

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.700
up to our max speed were we are just about
to loose it. The right limbs are hitting together

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:35.579
the left limbs hit together. Right left right
right left right left left play evenly the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:45.530
first hit in each paradiddle is accented then
we slow back down to the starting tempo now

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.659
with limbs crossed right hand and left foot
hit together left hand and right foot hit

00:00:51.659 --> 00:01:00.870
together remember we are increasing connections
in our brain and we can actually feel it happening

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:17.830
ok here's the paradiddle as a quad starting
with the left/right review clip 04 on single

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:31.480
strokes quads if this is confusing start slow
speed up a little slow back down the right/left

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:52.130
paradiddle quad each quad has a different
sound and feel

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:01.600
