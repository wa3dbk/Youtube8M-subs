00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.550
Alright, so you want
to buy a netbook, 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.270
but you're not really ready to deal with the
abhorrently slow performance of a atom?

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.240
You're going to love this 
Acer Aspire 1410.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.260
Stay tuned and I'll tell you why.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.190
Alright so here's the 1410,
absolutely love this thing,

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.890
took it home with me,
played with it for awhile.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.900
Basically what you're looking at, 
is a netbook on steroids.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.860
It's technically not a netbook,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.260
it's kind of blurring the line 
between netbook and notebook.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.170
And technically it's not a netbook.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.340
I'm going to call it 
a netbook for now, 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.660
even though it does not 
us an atom processor,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.140
and to me that's the
best part about it.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.390
If you're a little bit upset waiting
for things to happen on your atom,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.080
a little bit faster processor actually
quite a bit faster performing processor.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.380
It does a really good job 
and on top of that, 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.240
rather than having that 10.2
inch 1024x600 resolution screen,

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.150
much larger, 
11.6 inches diagonal on this, 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.270
so it's a much larger screen,
it's 1366x768,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.020
and that means you're going to get a 
little more workspace on your desktop,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.240
and on top of that you can 
do native 720p video

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.000
which is going to 
look really great. 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.310
Now, it's important to 
note that regularly,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.900
let's say on an Acer 
Aspire One Netbook, 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.460
it has the x3100 
integrated graphics chip set.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.600
That's not going to cut 
it for any HD footage,

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.360
even 720p H is not 
going to be enough.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.080
But luckily, they've used here,
the GMA 4500 MHD.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.810
And that has dedicated memory and it also
shares memory with the regular two GB of RAM

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.390
that are on here, and that actually
will do 720p video footage,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.480
which I will show you
in just a second.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.270
Before, let me finish the rest 
of the specs though.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.710
So, let's talk a little bit about 
the specifications on here.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.310
Two GB of memory,
250 GB hard drive,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.610
SATA, it's got a lot of
great features like HDMI.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.460
It's got an incredible keyboard.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.180
I don't know if you can
take a look at this keyboard.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.200
But it's absolutely ridiculous,
it's got a lot of space,

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.780
it's actually a completely 
full size keyboard.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.560
Now, let's talk a little 
bit about the processor.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.620
What's in here is an SU3500 which is
actually a Core 2 Solo, from the Intel line.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.950
That's clocked at 1.4 GHz, 
it's got an 800 MHz front side bus,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.690
and it's got 3 MB of L2 cache.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.400
So it's much more 
powerful than the atom.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.540
It's not as powerful as a 
Core 2 Duo Centrino, two line,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.100
but it is very power efficient,
it only pulls ten watts.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.320
And it works very, very well.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.650
That combined with 
the LED-backed LCD screen 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.840
and the really, really, really 
nice battery in here, it's a six cell,

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.380
combined you get about six hours
of battery if you're using it regularly,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.620
and you can actually get a little
bit more if you lower the brightness,

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.200
and you know
surf the web casually,

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.690
you know don't 
do a lot of stuff. 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.900
So, battery life is incredible,
big screen, nice processor,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.410
two GB of memory, it's running Vista 
Home Premium right out of the box,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.100
250 GB hard drive,
is a lot of space,

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.710
and you even get to 
choose from your colors, 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.940
you got blue over here you got
black, and then you also have the red.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.720
Which I am holding right here 
which is very, very, very nice.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.840
I liked it a lot.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.160
Now, on top of that there's
a lot of really good stuff,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.580
all around it.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.790
We're going to take 
a look real quick. 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.080
Let me show you
right over here, 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.950
starting off on 
this left side. 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.580
You do have VGA, which is very nice to have
in case you want to use  an external monitor,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.320
and this thing is fast enough that you might
want to use it as your regular computer.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.460
Power goes right here.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.470
And then here's the 
best part, HDMI port,

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.770
so you can output
to any IDP video footage,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.630
to a big television
if you have it.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.420
It can also transfer 
audio which is great. 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.670
Right next door it's got a 
USB 2.0 port over there.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.340
Up here in the front, 
on the bottom right there

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.080
there's a Bluetooth, 
that's Bluetooth right there.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.170
And right next to it,
there's your WiFi button,

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.520
so you can turn those on, turn those 
antennas on independently of each other.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.120
Coming on over here to the 
right side of the netbook,

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.770
 or laptop whatever 
you want to call it,

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.480
you have an SD card reader.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.900
Right there it's actually a 
five and one, so it does a lot more than SD,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.310
it'll do Sony Pro sticks, and pretty
much all the rest of them out,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.860
SD, XD, MMS, MS Pro,
Sony sticks, all that good stuff.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.670
You have your input and your output 
for your headset and your microphones.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.440
And the output for your
headphones is also an SPDIF.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.730
So that's good to know.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.250
Two more USB 2.0 ports,
a Kensington lock,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.350
and ten, one hundred, one 
thousand, Ethernet is right there,

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.690
so it's nice to have the Gigabit Ethernet
which complements the N Draft wireless

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.060
and the Bluetooth 2.0 with EDR.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.880
So that's all really, really good stuff.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.100
Now looking at the front of 
this thing like I mentioned,

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.470
you have a really nice
keyboard layout here.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.130
It's got a full size shift key,
full escape,

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.660
and it's literally full size buttons.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.530
It types, it's beautiful.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.140
It's a thing of beauty,
the way this thing types. 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.950
Also is important to know, 
it's a got a multi-touch track pad,

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.370
so if you want to, 
if you want to actually zoom in,

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.710
you can pinch to zoom,
you can also do the round scrolling,

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.170
and you can do a bunch of stuff,
multi-touch,

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.610
so very nice multi-gesture track pad.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.410
Kind of like what the Apples have,

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.190
you know PC's haven't had.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.640
Finally coming in to something
that's really affordable too.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.400
Like this little netbook, laptop, 
I can't seem to figure out 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.470
what I want to call it yet.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.500
Now on top of that the six cell battery,
like I said,

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.910
is really, really, really nice,
really long lasting battery,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.460
you get about six hours,
six to seven hours through here.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.970
Fully serviceable, you can add up to 
four GB of memory to this thing,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.730
it does have two slots,

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.950
you can also switch out 
the hard drive for an SSD,

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.080
you can load Windows 7 on it,

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.700
which is pretty much what 
needs to be done to this thing 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.510
because it's such a good performer already,
 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.590
I can only imagine with an SSD, and Windows 7
it's also important to note that even though 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.040
this comes with Vista 
Home Premium right now, 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.720
it will be eligible for the 
free upgrade to Windows 7,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.290
so you don't have to worry 
about buying it in the future.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.820
You can load RS v1 now, and upload,
the upgrade to Windows 7 for free,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.530
no charge, no problems, in the 
future as soon as it comes out on,

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.160
what is it October 22nd?

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.430
October 22nd, Windows 7 upgrade.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:20.740
Very, very nice.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.880
And finally,
really cool thing I liked about this,

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.980
is it has really nice speakers.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.600
Most netbooks have 
completely anemic speakers,

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.130
you can barely hear them.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.250
This one is pretty, pretty nice so
if you're listening to music,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.030
or you're chatting to somebody 
with the integrated webcam,

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.720
you can actually
hear what they're saying,

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.590
you can listen to music, 
you can share with your friends,

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.400
and that's really, really good stuff.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.700
So I can definitely say 
that this is probably,

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.130
my favorite netbook and or 
laptop that I have ever found.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.550
It's pretty good and 
ironically enough,

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.280
this could almost
replace my ASUS N10J.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.780
Sorry to say ASUS, 
but this thing is pretty, pretty bad.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.040
So 1410 by Acer,
if you have any questions email me,

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.550
and I will see you guys next time.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.540
For more information on the 
Acer Aspire 1410, 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.240
type in Aspire 1410 into the search 
engine of any of these major retailers.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.000
For ComputerTV,
I'm Albert.
