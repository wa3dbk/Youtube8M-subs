00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:12.020
Hey, what's up?

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.890
All right, here's another dance you've seen
before.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.430
You've seen it in a music video by The Rejects.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.430
It's called the Jerk.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.949
A lot of people confuse it with other dances
but now you're going to find out what it is

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:24.949
and how to do it.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.360
This is the jerk.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.580
You want to keep your knees low.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.050
You want to keep your body low and you're
going to bounce, like this.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.390
You go, hey.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.960
Other side, hey, hey, hey.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.989
Got it?

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:39.989
All right.

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:40.999
So I'm going to break that down a little bit.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:43.479
Basically you're going to be low to the floor.

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:45.800
Think of it like you're creeping, you're getting
low.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.850
I don't know.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:47.889
You're an umpire.

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:48.889
Yeah?

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:49.889
Something like that.

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:52.289
And then you're going to go to the side.

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.809
See how my knees go?

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:54.809
Bounce.

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:55.809
Yeah?

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.010
Do we got it?

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.010
All right.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.010
Let's do it again.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.959
So you're up, you're at a party, you feel
like you're getting ready to dance, you want

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:04.959
to, I want to try this.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.200
I want to try the jerk.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.960
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get
low.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.960
Yeah?

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.440
I'm going to lean to the side.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.050
And I'm going to bounce off my knees.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.050
Bounce.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.050
I'll hit the other side.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.490
I'm going to bounce off of it.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.570
Bounce.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.570
Got it?

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.570
Bounce off of it.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.020
So let's try it twice on the other side now.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:29.690
So I'm going to go bounce, bounce, bounce,
bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.690
Got it?

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.690
Bounce, bounce, hey, bounce, bounce.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.390
Do whatever you want with your hands.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.550
But it's all about getting low and using your
knees.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.820
So you got it?

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.820
You got it?

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.820
Let's try it again.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.950
As you see, one of my legs is longer than
the other and I'm just going to like pull

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.900
that one in, drag that one in and bounce.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.900
So let's try it.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.900
Yeah?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.400
We're going to do one time on each side.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.320
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.490
We're going hey.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.220
Got it?

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.700
We bounce, bounce, bounce.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.700
Got it?

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.790
You following us?

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.869
Yeah?

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.550
See how the hands change up?

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.099
Now we're going to do it twice on each side
because you have the choice to do it once,

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.099
twice.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.780
You could even do it five times in a row if
you're really feeling yourself and you're

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.480
out there and you're having a good time, knock
yourself out.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.590
Now we're going to do it twice so we're going
to go hey, hey, hey.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.859
My fellows got it behind me?

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:32.910
You see them?

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.109
So you can follow me or you can follow them.

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:37.109
But you got it.

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.920
Let's do it one more time really slow for
them.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.920
Okay?

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.310
So we're going to go hey, bounce, hey, bounce.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.310
Got it?

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.609
Hey, bounce, hey, bounce.

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.660
See how I'm dragging one leg?

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.209
But the whole time my knees are bouncing so
a lot of hip hop is in the knees and this

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.060
is one of those where you're going to have
to stay low in the knees.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.930
I know it kind of reminds you of those 80's
pictures back in the day.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.420
You know what I mean?

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.909
They don't know about that.

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.659
But it kind of reminds you of the 80's pictures
back in the day being low down.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.480
But hey, that's hip hop.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.480
Got it?

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.480
Want to try it?

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.940
Here we go.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.430
Hey.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.510
Two times, other side.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.620
Hey.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.829
One time.

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.639
You guys got it?

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:36.599
Simple enough, yeah?
