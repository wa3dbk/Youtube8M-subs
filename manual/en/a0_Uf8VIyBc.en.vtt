Hi There
No doubt you found this video because you

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.110
are looking into this product Auravie.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.440
I've been doing the same on behalf of my wife
actually.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.990
Basically she told me she was concerned about
some of her wrinkles and she was looking about

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.510
getting some Botox done.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.850
Now this was a bit of concern to me I must
say I did not want her to really go down the

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:34.530
route of needles and drugs and whatever so
I told her that I would look into some natural

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.179
options for her and when I started doing some
research I found that this product Auravie

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:47.639
is quite prominant, it is advertised on the
TV a bit and so I decided to check it out

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:53.109
and I have made this video just to share with
you what I discovered.

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.260
So what I am going to go through with you
now quickly is a little bit about the product

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.940
itself and then what I have also done I have
checked on the various online forums and shopping

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.619
sites to see the sort of comments that the
people who have tried out Auravie skin care

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.590
have left and from that I have been able to
get a list of the pros and cons that are being

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.450
reported so I will go through those with you
as well.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.960
So first of all regarding the actual product
itself and as you can see here Auravie is

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.409
a three stage process.

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:39.820
You have got step one which is the cleansing
toner gel, step two is the age defying serum

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.799
and then step three is the Replenish so it
is kind of three products in one that you

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.799
take as part of the system.

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.869
Now with regards to the Auravie reviews from
the people who have actually used it I guess

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.409
the question we all want to know is does Auravie
work?

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.409
And certainly there has been some positive
comments there has been enough people giving

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:12.590
reports back saying that it has worked for
them and going through the pros.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.769
First of all no needles no injections which
as I mentioned at the beginning this was important

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.420
for me because I wanted my wife to avoid going
down the actual Botox route.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.530
Obviously there is no pain associated like
you might have with the Botox I guess.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.120
The other thing is that going hand in glove
with that regarding Auravie ingredients it

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.000
is an all natural product and again I am personally
much more comfortable with my wife going down

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.959
the all natural route rather than as I say
drugs or the botox as I mentioned to you.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:54.170
There were no Auravie side effects reported
which was good and I guess this is going to

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.750
be more natural because it is a natural product.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.020
A few people mentioned that they had sensitive
skin and they were pretty happy with the results

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:15.019
which is encouraging and I found reviews from
three different ladies who were in their seventies

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:21.340
there was one of seventy one, one of seventy
two and one of seventy eight who all were

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.959
pretty pleased with the way Auravie wrinkle
reducer had worked for them so again that

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.019
was an encouraging sign.

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:37.560
Regarding the negatives there were a few negatives
that I found being reported.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.060
First of all more than one person actually
said that the serum has got quite a strong

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.560
smell to it now I do not know whether that
puts you off or not.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:55.049
It did say that when it is initially applied
there is a fairly strong smell but it only

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:02.920
lasts for a couple of minutes so I guess it
depends on your tolerence to that.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:11.340
The other thing is that it says on the website
that you would expect to get results within

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:20.910
ten days but most of the people who were reporting
good results were saying that it took more

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:28.300
like three weeks or even four weeks before
they saw results or the sorts of results that

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:35.580
were being reported so maybe some of the things
they say on the website is a little bit exaggerated

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:43.360
but I guess the good thing is that at least
the people who reported they did get the results

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.900
just by persevering if you like.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:54.710
The other negative is that people were saying
that Auravie is a bit on the expensive side

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.510
and I've found a website here where you can
actually get a free trial so maybe that helps

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.110
to mitigate some of that and I guess that
being realistic you've also got to compare

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:14.350
the options you have got to compare going
down the route of injections and that I am

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.450
sure it still works out favourably when it
comes to the cost.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:28.410
So Okay here is the website I was referring
to where you can get a free trial there is

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.060
a green button here all you need to do is
press or click on this green button and that

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.500
will take you over there and you can give
it a go.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.400
If the green button is not working for whatever
reason there is a link below this video but

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.130
that is it, as I say I wanted to share with
you what I found.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:55.850
Certainly I am encouraged that there is an
option that seems to be working well for other

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.800
ladies or other people in general but it is
mainly ladies who have been reporting back

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:10.280
on the forums etcetera and I have spoken to
my wife about it and she definitely is prepared

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:18.510
to give it a go on the all natural route rather
than going down the Botox route which was

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.690
the whole purpose of me doing this exercise.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.530
So anyway I hope you do not mind me sharing
this Auravie review with you and I hope you

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.020
have got some benefit and it has been of help
to you.
