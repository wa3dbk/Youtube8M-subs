00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.550
In this video we'll look at cold tire pressures 
and why they're so important for your bike.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.640
Firstly, you hopefully know what pressure you front and rear tire requires.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.000
And hopefully you know that the correct pressure is not listed on the tire.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.240
You can usually find the correct pressures on a swingarm sticker, on in your owners manual.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.040
The recommended tire pressure for our bike will be a cold inflation tire pressure - 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.940
that is the pressure of the tire before you ride and the tires warm up.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.100
This is because of science.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.940
You see, air is made of gases and gasses expand when heated.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.900
So once you start riding, the actual pressure in your tires will increase.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.440
The manufactures therefore base their recommendations on a cold tyre temperature – 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.120
ambient temperature has a much smaller effect on your tire pressure than the temperature generated from riding does.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.200
Let's demonstrate.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.180
I’ve inflated my tires to the manufacturers recommendation – 36psi at the back and 32 at the front.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.420
The temperature inside is 16.2 °C and so is the surface temperature of the tires.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.680
Now, I’m going to take a 30 minute ride and measure both temperature and pressure when I get back.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.040
Now, the surface temperature is showing at 47.2 °C

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.260
And my tire pressure is now 42 psi – that’s an increase of 16% in pressure.

00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:40.267
Now imagine if you went adjusted your tire pressures during a ride when the tires were hot. 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.040
If I reduce the current pressure down to 36 at the rear and 32 at the front,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.840
let’s see what happens after they cool down.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.720
Now that it’s cooled, the air in the tire as contracted.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.280
And because I adjusted my tires at a hot temperature, they’re cold or resting pressure is now 22 psi.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.640
That’s neither safe, nor is it good for tire wear.
