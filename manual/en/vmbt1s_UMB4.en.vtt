Alright so today I’m going to explain a
little bit about the cooling system, like

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.480
the radiator and thermostat on a Jeep Grand
Cherokee.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.710
This applies towards a lot of different vehicles
though.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.889
So first of all we have the radiator cap here.

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.380
What the radiator cap does is first of all,
it’s a lid for the radiator, but it’s

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.160
also made up of a few different parts.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.640
The spring inside of there is temperature
sensitive, so like when it gets really hot

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.040
the spring contracts and allows this part
of it, the lid of it, to shrink down inside

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.341
of it just like that, allowing more space
to pass through.

00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:44.470
The reason it does that is because you can
see here on the radiator there’s a little

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.740
hose right here.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.321
So when the cap is fully on and cool, this
is expanded all the way, but as soon as the

00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:56.079
radiator starts to heat up, this contracts
allowing the fluid to escape through this

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.670
line and go into the reservoir…the coolant
reservoir over there.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.530
Then we have the thermostat, which is kind
of the same concept, but this contracts to

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.409
allow coolant to enter into the engine itself.

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.890
So if you ever get to a point where your engine
or your radiator is just boiling over with

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.280
the radiator fluid, it’s one of these two
parts, either the radiator cap or the thermostat.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.289
So the thermostat usually goes, you know,
towards the top of the engine.

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.340
In this case it goes right here inside of
this little contraption.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.299
So the radiator fluid comes out through here
and goes down, but only when the engine is

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.299
hot enough.

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.490
And so you can get these at varying degrees.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.099
This one’s a 195, you can kind of see it
right there.

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:53.349
I replace mine with a lower one, a 180, just
so I can get the coolant in there quicker.

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:57.599
So that’s kind of how the cooling system
works on a jeep.

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.432
But yeah, like I said, it applies towards
lots of different vehicles.

00:01:59.432 --> 00:02:05.789
