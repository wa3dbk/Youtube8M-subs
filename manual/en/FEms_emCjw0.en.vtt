Hi I'm Marlene Spiegal founding team team
lead from Wildtree. I'm here on behalf of

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.660
Expert Village to show you how to make a Scrumptious
Corn Chowder. The First thing I'm going to

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:23.220
do is put two Table spoons of the butter grapeseed
oil in a pan, get warmed, add the celery,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:42.591
and carrots. By the way these receipts will
be on my website. And get them sauteed, then

00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:51.110
were going to add the milk, lots of milk four
cups. This I think is one percent I normally

00:00:51.110 --> 00:01:00.210
use skim milk so what ever you want, and stir
that around. Then I'm using Wildtree's Alfredo

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.430
sauce. Now see it doesn't just need to go
on pasta, you can also use it as a soup base.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:17.600
It's good on pasta though too. Then were going
to stir this in. Um does that look good. Smells

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.210
Delicious too bad you don't have smell. Smell
is half the taste when you eat it's not just

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:31.140
the taste, its the smell. If you like the
smell you?re going to love the taste. We're

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:40.960
going to stir this until smooth.
Takes a little bit of time. Alfredo sauce

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:49.240
is also good to make and brush on chicken
for chicken breast, brush on fish, use as

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:58.890
a dipping sauce for some bread, its real good
that way. I'm then going to add the um, I

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:14.140
use new potatoes they were canned, and some
cream corn, again canned, and stir it in.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.290
Now it's optional if you want to put the bacon
chips in now or if you just want to serve

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:28.100
in a garnish later, but let's just pour some
in now, and this is bacon that's precooked.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:38.120
So I just microwave it about four minutes
took it out just crumbled it and then were

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.560
going to simmer this for forty-five minutes
over a low heat and it'll smooth right out

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:56.780
and our finished product. Finished dish the
corn chowder dish garnished with the bacon

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:06.540
chips this time looks like this. Any appetizing
meal with a nice roasted Tuscan bread will

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.810
due.
