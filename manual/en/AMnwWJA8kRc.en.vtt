00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.200
Now if you're a gardener, you're an optimist and why well you're always looking

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.649
to the future you're always growing for
the next season I mean we've got

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.250
mid-january cold outside short days but
spring these come in so you've got a

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.430
plan for it now Aubretia to give that
purple-blue great big splashes of colour

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.390
in your garden it's really a rockery
front it's really an Alpine and it's

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.309
like certain things now the things it
like a drainage grit

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.899
don't leave the water standing
anywhere near it because it'll hate that

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.309
so in a pot like this and you can plant
them in a pot they're perfectly good in

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.370
a pot you can grow them out in your
rockery but in pots like this they're

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.149
very very good. Mix 50/50
multi-purpose compost and Alpine grits

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:58.739
now it's as easy as that I've got
the composting already it mixed it they

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.670
alpine grit in with that and we're
ready to go just give it a good mix up

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.659
you can hear it crunch beautiful now it
couldn't be any simpler than that

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.580
so you've put the big pebbles in the
bottom to allow for drainage so it

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.119
drains away we've got a drain the
waterway it likes moist it like stamp

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.939
but it doesn't like wet so let the
moisture drain away so we fill up the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:40.140
pot we're gonna need a little bit more
there it's quite a big pot. The bag was

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.630
to every to lift to start with so

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.880
50/50 now you're not making a cake
so near enough is good enough but this is

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.200
all it needs and then now they come in
collections or groups of 12 now I've got

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.780
12 which will go perfectly in this pot
now that's good that's a a good 50/50

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.960
mix there.
Now a while back in Cambridge I went to

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.000
a place called good ales and they grew
these six centimeter plugs they are

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.910
magnificent that Aubretia is
bursting to go even in January so get it

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.820
in you just plant it like that not too
firm not too tight just a nice use two

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:36.130
digits this time no there's no special
equipment just plan that up and I can

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.650
promise you that this pot, these Aubretias are going to cascade over this

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.890
and that will just be one mass of purple
blue it will be absolutely beautiful and

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.709
always looking to the future you see
that's what gardeners do and that's why

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:01.030
they're eternal optimists I could do two
pots with this twelve easily that's

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.110
beautiful
that's lovely and then all you need to

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.430
do no water I mean there's plenty of
moisture in the in the pebbles and the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.950
compost and then all you need to do is
just top dress it just top dress

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:23.320
it with the the grit now this stops the
water when it rains and the moisture

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.680
sitting around the neck of the plant
because that's where it absolutely hates

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.760
the water to be so you can see the
drainage is fierce and they'll strike

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.870
perfectly well those will grow year
after year now it couldn't be any more

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.070
difficult than that these will grow
quite happily year after year and will

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.900
give you endless amounts of pleasure
the only thing once it flowered and then

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.140
they have a lot of mass of flower when
they flowered they die back and they

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.620
that dead fall is need to cut him back
but other than that they look after

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.120
themselves now this is the purple one
but there's a beautiful one called red cascade

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.200
well worth looking out for and I might
and I get a selection of those and put

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.250
them in the pot so there you go it's as
simple as that don't think there's any

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.830
mythology attached to any of this it's
easy simple above all beautiful
