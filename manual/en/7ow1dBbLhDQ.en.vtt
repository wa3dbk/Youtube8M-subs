The first stop is right here, at Parque das Cachoeiras (Waterfalls Park).

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.840
Here, you'll find seven waterfalls along a trekking trail, which is about 1700 meters long.

00:00:38.553 --> 00:00:42.733
Besides, you can have lunch and get some rest in a hammock.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.140
You can get bath in several natural pools along the way, so don't forget your swimming suit.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.520
Flipflops are also allowed all the way during the trekking, since most of it is done on a wooded decks.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.940
This is Praia da Figueira.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.180
It's about 15 kilometers away from Bonito.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.580
Over here, you'll get the chance to do pedalling, kaykaing, stand up paddle, zipline and snorkling.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.760
Ideal for families with kids, Praia da Figueira is the perfect place to have a relaxing day in Bonito.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.120
Over there you can get some rest and, also, and enjoy a white sand beach

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.620
with a lagoon of crystal clear waters and full of fishes.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.980
We're over here, at Projeto Jibóia.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.840
We've just learned a bit about this reptile, so frowned upon society.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.440
And this is Henrique, a.k.a Jibóia.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.100
Most known as the Man of the Snake, here in Bonito.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.680
So, Projeto Jibóia has a simple mission: to make people aware of the importance of these animals,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.231
the danger of these animals in the wild, and that we can never ever kill one of them, despite the danger.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.880
Come over here and you'll understand everything.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.180
The snakes are of an extreme importance to human beings.

00:02:40.676 --> 00:02:42.676
Come here!

00:02:58.752 --> 00:03:03.712
In a stand-up comedy mood, Henrique leads a fun and interactive lecture about snakes.

00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:07.471
Who's afraid of snakes? Raise up your hands!

00:03:10.927 --> 00:03:17.307
The project shows, on a simple way, the importance of snakes in nature, targeting to demystify the animal.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.920
At the end of the talk, participants can have a picture with a real Jibóia.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.594
Waterfalls done, trekking done, grottos done...

00:03:45.594 --> 00:03:48.754
Nothing better than eat well and have some rest in the evening.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.320
Here, in Taboa Bar, you can try a cachaça that's made in a farm just next to here,

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.357
Let's see how it is.
