00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.100
Hi! Continuing the series "Plants of my house"

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.260
I'll show you now, the plants here at the corridor.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.040
On one side, I have cacti and succulents.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.419
Why I put them on this side? Because of the eaves of the house.

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.870
I think you can see here in the video, there is an overhang that protects the plants.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.899
So the light, the sun rises back there, and it comes up here and goes down ahead. 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:48.249
It does this movement here... So here gets sun almost all day 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:52.389
and is more protected of the rain. The rain does not fall directly on them.

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:56.269
So I water only when it is necessary.

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.269
The plants on this saide also receive a lot of light, but

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.460
they receive more rain, when it happens, right? And we hope 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.750
that St. Peter would be very generous with us here

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.890
in São Paulo, and to send a lot of rain now in the summer. To São Paulo,

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.440
to Minas Gerais, to Rio de Janeiro, to all the springs, to all rivers, hope 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.690
that all riparian forest will be maintained near the rivers and the springs.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.550
May we have water in abundancy!

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.060
Well, back to this, I will show here my little plants for you.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.000
The plants here, each one has a story, 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.460
I'll be telling a little bit for you.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.160
This one is a Tibouchina mutabilis "Nana".
This plant I put on a terrace of a client, 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.390
but it does not adapted well there.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.840
So I switched, I put another plant there and 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.460
brought it home and I'm taking care of it now. 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.140
In the spring it was beautiful, blooming, gorgeous!

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.790
Here is a Croton, Codiaenum variegatum, a plant that looks like a bush,

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.170
but it grows with time, it is not a fast growing plant

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.749
and it becomes a little tree. I think it is very beautiful, I love those

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:25.329
yellow and green leaves, I believe this 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.240
plant is an spectacle it self, super ornamental.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.740
Here is the Amarilis, that I have already shown to you in another video. 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.599
If you wish I will leave a link in the end so you 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.810
can see the Amarilis care. The leaves are still very beautiful, so 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.549
for now I will keep them here, as they are, only 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.779
when they start to look ugly I will prune, just before the winter 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:58.779
for they bloom again. Here is the desert rose, Lola passing...

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.909
Last week when we recorded the video it was prettier, now

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.469
it is not so, but soon it will bloom again.

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:14.169
This one here is a kind of grass, called Ophiopogon jaburan, I like it a lot

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.909
also, it was left from a client, so I brough here and put in a pot.

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.669
I think it is very cute.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.740
Here is a planter also, that was made with left overs of Portulaca grandiflora from a client,

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.940
I think It is very cute,

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.379
so I made a planter with it.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:36.290
These are experiences, I want to see how the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.950
plant works on planter, potted, finally, I love it!

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.919
Here are the kalanchoes that have already bloomed, 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:53.389
I cut the stems, now I have to wait for the next flowering.

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.649
Here I have Euonymus japonica, this is the only one that is not cacti or succulent!

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.860
It is here because I like its height here by the house.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.580
Here on the side there is a plant, it will 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.150
open two little flowers here, I'll put a photo, 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.340
I have taken of its before, when it opens.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.370
It is called Stapelia hirsuta. It is very interesting, looks like a starfish, it is red,

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.770
kind of red, kind of vine, and all hairy

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.940
And here's a small collection of cacti and succulents.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.440
That were acquired over the years,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.880
Some were from that first recording I made of cacti to

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.880
Gazeta, are from that time, others I bought,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.060
I got as gift...

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.880
Anyway, I love them!

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.160
