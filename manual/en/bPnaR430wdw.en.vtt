00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:04.560
I am Beau Timken, master sake sommelier and
we are speaking about the history of sake

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.870
in this segment. After the war, the great
World Wars, sake made kind of a quantum leap

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.820
as technology completely caught up. As we
think of sake today, a very premium clear

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.699
beverage, pre-war, sake had characteristics
of being very heavy, very fat, and very sweet.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:33.280
Almost thick, if you will, thick and sweet
and semi-boozy. About fifty years ago, sake,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.690
some brewers in Niigata started creating a
type of sake that was very light and very

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.239
dry. And, it started an entire sake boom,
if you will. Really changed the nature of

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.020
sake kind of going forward. Certain breweries
lay claim to the fact that they developed

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.290
the first Ginjo milling rate percentage-wise.
Where they took rice, more milled, more refined

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.160
than they had ever done before. But, the Ginjo
boom literally happened about forty-five to

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.340
fifty years ago, and that is the sakes that
we would consider premium brewers. So, for

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.920
the past fifty years, we have, we are drinking
today what they kind of crafted fifty years

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.610
ago using really superb brewing rice. Milling
it to levels they had never milled to before,

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.140
and crafting it using technology that was
essentially yeast-free environments. Natural

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.680
airborne yeast-free environments to create
really light, delicate, very aromatic, very

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.470
beautiful sakes essentially that we know today.
And, that all transpired about forty-five

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.280
to fifty years ago and it is called kind of
the Ginjo movement. These breweries were making

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.510
sakes specifically for a competition, for
the national competition in Japan which they

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.090
have. And, they were so in love with the product
they said you know what, let us not just have

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.720
this as a competition sake but let us sell
this. And again, this started the whole Ginjo

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.310
movement and we are drinking brews today basically
because of this big quantum leap from big,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:03.520
fat, boozy, coarse, sweet sakes to very light,
clean, ethereal, dry, and very floral and

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.950
fragrant sakes as we know it today.
