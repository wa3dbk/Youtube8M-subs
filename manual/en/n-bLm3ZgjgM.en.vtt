00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.759
We're going to be a proper professional team,
we're going to ride together as a team, not

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.319
individual riders.

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:20.110
I would say that IAM is a really Swiss team
and we want to show that.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:27.860
First of all we need to build some sort of
identity, of course its a Swiss team so we

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.960
would like to keep the Swiss mentality.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.940
It's a new project, we've started on a new
project that's certainly ambitious.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.600
We're completely new team but there's known
riders, we come with good looking kit.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.021
Actually it's really great you know you really
feel the passion of every single person on

00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:52.360
the team, everybody wants to do his best and
wants to build up this team, I mean we just

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.260
started like last December it's not even half
a year ago and it's a good feeling to be part

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.120
of it from the beginning.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.650
It's a new team, new motivation, new bikes,
new clothes, new team mates, every things

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.170
new so that's one of the big reasons I chose
to come to this team, already in the team

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.350
meeting in December that we had after 5 days
sitting in the car going back to the training

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.540
camp I thought yeah this was the best decision
I've ever made.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.479
It's a little bit I think it reflects Swiss
mentality, it's a little bit of stubbornness

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:40.700
it's a little bit emphatic, low profile but
very focused.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.360
Well the main difference is really just learning
the names!

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.570
It's not like a new team for me I have known
them a long time and it makes it like a family,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.540
it feels like we've spent more than 2,3 years
together.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.710
We're sociable, good humoured but also we
work hard which is really important.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.810
What people will perceive I think in the beginning
they will be a little bit curious, maybe some

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.899
could be intimidated.

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.730
I'm happily surprised in what state we're
in at this point, there's still races to come

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.739
and we'll see how things fall together but
so far I have a very good feeling for this.

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:30.939
I think we're on a good road so we'll see
how it goes after a couple of months.

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.230
We're going to be a proper professional team,
we're going to ride together as a team and

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.200
when you unite like that we will get a space
in the peloton and be seen as a team to count

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:52.310
on.
