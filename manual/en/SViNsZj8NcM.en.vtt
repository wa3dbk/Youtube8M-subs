00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.740
food ingredients

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.180
our food ingredients are here

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.140
remember the numbers, 2244

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
double-boiling the butter, you can use microwave as well

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.720
add two eggs and sugar into bowl

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.960
we can add much hot water, but be careful that bowl can't touch hot water!

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.540
we need to use the steam

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.860
and stir the eggs with sugar

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500
until like this, we can make a line on eggs

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
add flour separately for three times

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.320
after sifting, using fold-in to stir until you can't see the flour

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.840
last, put the butter in, stir them evenly

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.040
put the parchment paper or apply butter

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
put them in

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.400
drop them for few times, let the air inside can go out

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.740
use stick to put into the center

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.780
and see that there's batter on it or not, if the answer is no, that means it's ok
