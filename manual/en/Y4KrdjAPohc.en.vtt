00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.571
BUT JUST NO ONE KNOWS
WHAT THIS PLACE IS.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:05.839
- CORRECT.
- NO ONE--

00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:07.508
YOU DON'T HAVE A BRAND
THAT PEOPLE RECOGNIZE.

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:09.643
- ABSOLUTELY.
- BUT MAYBE THERE'S A SHORTCUT

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:12.246
TO ACTUALLY HAVING
BRAND RECOGNITION,

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.849
USING A LITTLE SOMETHING
CALLED PARODY LAW.

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:17.217
- PARODY LAW.

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:20.454
- OFTEN USED BY ARTISTS LIKE
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:22.155
AND SHOWS LIKE
<i>SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE,</i>

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.957
PARODY LAW ALLOWS YOU
TO USE TRADEMARKS

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:27.561
AND COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL AS LONG
AS YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF THEM.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:30.264
SO IF ELIAS COULD FIND A WAY
TO MAKE FUN OF STARBUCKS,

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:33.133
HE'D BE FREE AND CLEAR TO BORROW
THEIR VALUABLE CORPORATE NAME

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.035
AND IMAGE FOR HIS STORE.

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.704
THE PLAN:
TURN THE HELIO CAFE

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:40.974
INTO THE WORLD'S FIRST
PARODY STARBUCKS.

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:44.411
- SO HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT
A PARODY WITHOUT IT--

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:47.714
YOU JUST NOT MIMICKING
THEIR BRAND?

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:51.718
- LIKE, THE COFFEES COULD BE
"DUMB GRANDE," "DUMB VENTI"...

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:53.320
- YEAH, I GOT YOU.
- "DUMB FRAPPUCCINO."

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:54.588
- GOTCHA.
OKAY.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.557
- I MEAN, AS A WHOLE, THE STORE
COULD JUST BE CALLED

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.991
"DUMB STARBUCKS."
- RIGHT. THAT'S--

00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.459
OKAY, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
RIGHT.

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:01.562
- BUT THE "DUMB" COULD BE SMALL
SO PEOPLE COULD COME IN

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.630
THINKING IT'S
AN ACTUAL STARBUCKS.

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:05.399
- HUH.
IT'S SMART, I JUST DON'T KNOW

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.401
IF PEOPLE WOULD GET IT.
YOU KNOW.

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:10.204
I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE ARE,
YOU KNOW...

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:11.605
- WELL, DO PEOPLE GET
WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW?

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:13.607
YOU'RE NOT THAT POPULAR.
- RIGHT.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.943
- YOU HAVE NO MENU.
- THAT'S TRUE.

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:17.878
- I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO LOSE BY TRYING?

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.079
- I MEAN, WHAT DO I HAVE
TO LOSE?

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:23.383
I...I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:27.154
- ELIAS WAS ON BOARD, BUT
HE DID HAVE ONE MAJOR CONCERN.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:30.624
- I DEFINITELY COULD NOT AFFORD
A LAWSUIT FROM STARBUCKS.

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:31.859
DEFINITELY NOT.

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:33.427
- BASED OFF WHAT I READ ON
WIKIPEDIA,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.696
IT SEEMED LIKE MY APPROACH
WAS LEGAL.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.664
BUT JUST TO BE SURE,
I RETAINED THE SERVICES

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:41.168
OF ATTORNEY PETER J. MARX
TO GUARANTEE WE WERE PROTECTED.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.469
- "DUMB STARBUCKS"?

00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:45.205
- BUT THE "DUMB" WOULD BE
SMALLER SO PEOPLE

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:46.907
WOULD STILL THINK
IT'S A STARBUCKS.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.409
- IF PEOPLE THINK IT'S A
STARBUCKS, YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:51.245
IT'S NOT REALLY A PARODY THEN.

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:54.381
- APPARENTLY, MY LEGAL FOOTING
WASN'T AS SOLID AS I THOUGHT.

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:57.618
BUT THEN PETER BROUGHT UP ONE
WAY I COULD COVER MYSELF.

00:01:57.651 --> 00:02:01.255
- LET'S SAY YOU HAD A REPUTATION
AS BEING A--

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:02.256
- YEAH.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.724
- SOMEONE WHO DOES
LOTS OF PARODY.

00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:06.727
THEN THEY KNOW, OH, HE'S JUST
MAKING FUN OF STARBUCKS,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.095
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HE DOES.

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.863
- SO I HAVE TO BECOME
A PARODY ARTIST.

00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:11.164
- IT WOULDN'T HURT.

00:02:11.198 --> 00:02:12.900
- IT SEEMED LIKE I STILL HAD
SOME WORK AHEAD OF ME.

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:16.303
BUT BEFORE LEAVING, I NEEDED
TO BE SURE I WAS PROTECTED.

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:19.173
SO IF I DO ALL THIS,
THEN STARBUCKS CAN'T SUE ME?

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:20.374
- THIS IS AMERICA.

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:22.075
PEOPLE FILE LAWSUITS
AT THE DROP OF A HAT.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:25.145
- BUT IF THEY SUE,
YOU'RE LIABLE TOO, RIGHT?

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:26.613
- WHO'S LIABLE?
- YOU.

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:28.081
- ME PERSONALLY?
- YEAH.

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:30.317
- NOT UNLESS I'M INVOLVED
IN--IN VIOLA--

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.319
IN INFRINGING
THEIR TRADEMARK, NO.

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:35.522
- YEAH, THE APPEARANCE RELEASE
YOU SIGNED BEFORE HAD A CLAUSE

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:38.292
THAT YOU WOULD BE LIABLE TOO,
IF STARBUCKS SUED.

00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:42.696
- I DON'T AGREE TO THIS AT ALL.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.431
I DO NOT AGREE TO PAY
ALL LEGAL FEES AND DAMAGES FROM

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:45.933
LEGAL ACTION BECAUSE
I HAVE NO CONTROL

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:47.201
OVER WHAT'S BEING RELEASED.

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:48.635
- WELL, WHY DID YOU SIGN
THAT, THEN?

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.270
- YEAH, I SIGNED IT. AND I
SIGNED IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE

00:02:50.304 --> 00:02:51.605
A CHANCE TO READ IT
AND I THOUGHT--

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:52.806
- BUT YOU'RE A LAWYER.
DON'T YOU READ THINGS

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.241
BEFORE YOU SIGN THEM?
- I DO READ THINGS--

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:56.410
I TRY TO READ THINGS BUT YOU
WANTED ME TO SHOOT AND I GLANCED

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:59.246
AT IT AND THIS WAS MY MISTAKE.
I'LL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.648
- OKAY. WELL, YOU SIGNED IT SO I
GUESS YOU CAN GIVE THAT BACK.

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:03.750
- WELL, I-I'M NOT GONNA GIVE IT
BACK BECAUSE I'M GOING TO--

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:05.552
- WELL, I HANDED IT TO YOU JUST
TO LOOK OVER, BUT YOU ALREADY--

00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:07.054
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA
GIVE IT BACK TO YOU.

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:09.756
I'M PROTECTING MYSELF AND,
FRANKLY, YOU FROM A NIGHTMARE.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.958
- WELL, YOU SIGNED IT.

00:03:11.058 --> 00:03:11.959
WE HAVE YOU ON CAMERA
SIGNING IT.

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:13.193
SO IT STILL HOLDS UP IN COURT.

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:15.062
- YOU DON'T HAVE ME ON CAMERA
SIGNING IT.

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:16.496
- YES, WE DO.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.632
- WHAT KIND OF LAWYER AM I?
SIGNING [...] I HAVEN'T READ.

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:20.834
WELL, IF YOU DO, THAT'S FINE
THEN YOU--THEN YOU'LL KNOW

00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:23.136
HOW THE TERMS--I'M GONNA PUT IT
IN MY POCKET.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.338
- WELL, NO, WE DON'T WANT IT
IN YOUR POCKET.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.139
- I--WE DO WANT IT
IN MY POCKET.

00:03:26.173 --> 00:03:30.210
- PLEASE.
PLEASE, YOU'RE IN MY OFFICE.

00:03:30.244 --> 00:03:31.879
I'M VERY SERIOUS. AND I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU'RE REALLY TRYING

00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:33.847
TO DO THIS JUST FOR THE SHOW,
BUT I'D LIKE YOU

00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:36.483
TO GET OFF MY DESK AND I'M GONNA
ASK YOU TO LEAVE THE OFFICE.

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:38.619
- I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT PETER
WAS TRYING TO BACK OUT

00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:40.187
OF THE DEAL HE SIGNED.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.155
BUT OUR PRODUCERS WERE
EVENTUALLY ABLE TO CALM HIM DOWN

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:43.724
ENOUGH TO KEEP SHOOTING.

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:46.093
- THEY JUST SAID THEY NEED TO
GET A SHOT OF THE--AN INSERT

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:47.628
OF THE DOCUMENT.
LIKE A SHOT OF IT.

00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:49.730
- [laughs] IT'S STAYING--
IT'S STAYING IN MY POCKET.

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:51.331
IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
- WELL, WE JUST NEED TO GET

00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:54.568
A SHOT OF THE CLAUSE
FOR THE SCENE.

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:56.170
- I-I--
- IN THE DOCUMENT.

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:57.971
YOU CAN HOLD ON TO IT.

00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:02.609
JUST HOLD IT OUT
LIKE YOU'D HAD AND THEN--YEAH.

00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:03.944
THIS CAMERA NEEDS TO GET IT
OUT HERE.

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:05.245
- OKAY, THAT'S HOW I HAD IT.

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.782
- AND THEN YOU CAN--

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:12.786
JUST MAKE SURE YOU GET AN INSERT
OF THE ACTUAL--

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.621
- YOU KNOW, I'M ABOUT TO--I
DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE PROVOKING

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:18.425
ME OR NOT, BUT I'M--I'M NOT--
I'M GETTING TIRED OF THIS.

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:21.195
I'M NOT GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR CONDUCT, OKAY?

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:24.331
- MY PLAN TO HAVE PETER SHARE
LIABILITY DIDN'T WORK.

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:26.600
SO IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN EVER THAT ELIAS AND I

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.869
TAKE HIS GUIDANCE
TO PROTECT OURSELVES.

00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:30.938
IT WOULD JUST BE HELPFUL,
LEGALLY, IF WE HAD A HISTORY

00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:33.574
OF BEING PARODY ARTISTS.

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:34.741
- OKAY.
