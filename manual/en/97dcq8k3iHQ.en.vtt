00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:23.790
So I just finished railing on the miserable
pile of licenses that was Cross Edge, a game

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.410
saved only by the fact that I’ve played
Chaos Wars and know exactly the depths to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.359
which such a concept can sink.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.340
(Stalwart souls can go back and watch that
review if’n they so desire; earplugs are

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.340
advised.)

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.000
But that was 2008.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.740
In 2010, the tag-team of Nippon-Ichi and Gust
came back, sans Darkstalkers, sans Mana Khemia,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.120
sans Ar Tonelico, and sans Spectral Souls.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.200
Just a dash of Disgaea, a splash of Atelier
Violet, and an absurd dystopia orbited by...

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.320
let’s see.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.290
Libraries, traffic cones, tamago-nigiri, bowling
balls, a Prinny...

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.610
I totally feel like the King of All Cosmos
enumerating this nonsense.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.859
And in the middle of it all, you’ve got
a Demon Dog King and a Valkyrie.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:15.050
In a 
move straight out of Star Ocean: the Second

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.321
Story, you begin with the choice of which
character to follow through the course of

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:20.329
the game’s events.

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.210
Their paths converge and diverge, but to a
greater extent than Rena’s and Claude’s,

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.039
and the gameplay mechanics and difficulty
are rather different from one another.

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.070
Both use a turn-and-AP-based combat system,
though, with three types of basic attacks,

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.100
chain bonuses, special attacks by using the
right command chain, passing off the chain

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.680
to the next combatant in line, granting a
buff as you do so... it’s quite a lot to

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.000
take in.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.020
Did you see what they did there?

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.820
I’m not talking about anything in the text
itself, I’m talking about the animation

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.820
of the huge-character-portraits.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.899
Yes, ANIMATION.

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.119
It’s not quite Vanillaware-grade, but after
years and years of completely static images,

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.080
the occasional blink, lip flap, or evidence
of respiration is a breath of fresh air.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.220
Congratulations, JRPGs have finally caught
up to Mega Man circa 1987.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.350
One step at a time, folks.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.800
Fitting that it would come in what is, ostensibly,
a postmodern look at the genre as a whole.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.470
Some could qualify it as being “same old
same old,” but Trinity Universe has the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.710
self-awareness to bust out a lampshade every
now and then for the sake of decoration.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.970
I can respect that, even if it means some
folks less aware of the conventions are going

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.290
to be left scratching their heads.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:56.380
This game is what Cross Edge wasn’t: A play
to the base, rather than to the middle.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.610
But for all the improvement, Trinity Universe
is still far from a perfect creation.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.170
There’s still inordinate loads of yammering
on relative to the actual absurd-orbiting-object-dungeon

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.580
crawling, but to its credit, the sense of
humor endemic to the better Nippon-Ichi releases

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.920
shows through.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.580
This is the binding that could’ve made Cross
Edge a great game.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.130
Take these qualities, and combine them with
the innovative (but slow and poorly-documented)

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.160
battle system from its overstretched predecessor,
and you’d be able to make one hell of a

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.160
game.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:35.460
But of the bifurcated pair, Trinity Universe
is the one that de2erve2 your attentiion.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:46.560
Or 2hould that be “triifurcated?”
