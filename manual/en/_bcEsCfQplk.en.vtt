00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:11.280
Unfortunately, what we see kids receiving
to eat are very, very, high carbohydrate foods.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.180
Many of the foods contain high levels of gluten
or are gluten-free containing to start with

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.090
even at low levels in those kids that haven't
yet been identified in being gluten sensitive.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.820
But let's put the gluten sensitivity to the
side for just a minute to focus on the foods

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.970
our kids are eating.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.220
Foods like pizza, not being worried for a
moment as to whether it contains gluten or

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.710
not, contain a dough as does bread.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.129
And bread and dough and potatoes, French fries
are high carbohydrates and that is toxic to

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.129
the brain.

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.260
Now, there is no easy solution here cause
a lot of times you're going to pack a lunch

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.049
for your child and you're gonna find out a
couple years later once they come back home

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:56.239
or go to college that throughout their elementary
school years they traded their lunch away

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.909
with whoever was lucky enough to get the lunch
that you as parents tried to provide.

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:08.450
A little fruit at lunch time gives in to the
carbohydrate but, has an upside.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.780
If your child is going to eat lunch at school
it might be time that you visit with the school

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.229
and talk to them about what good food really
means.

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.579
The problem is that the school lunches in
public schools are dictated by what the USDA

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.020
indicates is good nutrition.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.130
And clearly, the nutrition recommendations
in "Grain Brain" run counter to what the US

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.820
Department of Agriculture has indicated our
children should be eating.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.270
We need to give our kids higher fat foods,
good fat foods.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.150
Foods like avocado, scrambled eggs, nuts,
seeds, fish, these are good foods, making

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.359
them apart of school lunch can be challenging
but it can be done.

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:54.990
The best things you can do is make sure your
kids eat like that at home and get used to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.409
eating those good foods.

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.691
And, beyond that, if you know you're up against
a pretty challenging lunch at school, give

00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:05.099
them a give breakfast, something that you
can control.
