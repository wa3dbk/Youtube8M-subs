00:00:00.856 --> 00:00:05.497
one of the cool advantages of Morph-O-Matic is its ability to extract all targets

00:00:05.587 --> 00:00:08.508
and to keep them connected inside of Morph-O-Matic.

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:13.519
this means is that you can easily modify your character’s targets

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.784
without keeping them in the scene at all times.

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:22.301
We have a scene set up here with a control rig created by Luis San Juan

00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:25.390
and a character courtesy of KeyToon studio.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.345
We invite you to check out Luis’s behind the scenes interview

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:34.181
on our website at www.Di-O-Matic.com

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:40.117
Let’s say we want to modify one of the characters morph targets.

00:00:40.408 --> 00:00:42.681
One of the features Morph-O-Matic brings you

00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:46.350
is the ability to extract all of the morph targets at once. 

00:00:46.372 --> 00:00:50.900
So if you go to the Morph-O-Matic modifier and select “extract to scene”,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.563
you can choose from an assortment of extracting options.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.052
One of these is “rebind to extracted targets”

00:00:58.052 --> 00:01:02.454
which will keep the modifier connected to the objects in the scene.

00:01:04.052 --> 00:01:08.073
 You can also choose how many rows these objects will be displayed in.

00:01:08.736 --> 00:01:12.956
When you have chosen your desired options click extract.

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:18.970
Once the extraction is completed, you can see all of the morph targets.

00:01:19.589 --> 00:01:23.292
As you will notice this character has an enormous amount of targets,

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:27.121
as it has a very complex rig with over 80 channels.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.990
All of the targets we can see now are connected to Morph-O-Matic

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.980
so even if we delete them from the scene the targets will remain connected.

00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:44.452
So click on “auto-load target” and you can easily pick one target and make some modification.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.562
Let’s convert it to mesh, and pick the vertices to change,

00:01:50.562 --> 00:01:53.488
and then make the necessary adjustments.

00:01:55.253 --> 00:01:58.468
If you then select the head object you will notice that the 

00:01:58.468 --> 00:02:02.382
modifications made to the target were automatically applied.

00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:06.853
When you need to work on a certain target,

00:02:06.853 --> 00:02:10.030
 you can simply extract the one you need to work on.

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:18.419
As I mentioned before, all of these morph targets are not necessary in the scene.

00:02:20.093 --> 00:02:21.978
This was the extract feature,

00:02:21.978 --> 00:02:25.691
which allows you to work very quickly with the morph targets in your scene,

00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:28.583
while making your scene as light as it can be.

00:02:29.342 --> 00:02:31.363
Thank you for watching this video on one of the

00:02:31.363 --> 00:02:35.531
numerous advantages of using Morph-O-Matic in your production pipeline.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.842
