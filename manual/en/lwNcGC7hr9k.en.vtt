00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.439
Alright, here's another

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.969
Lego review from Jaystepher.

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.349
This is the Lego City House.

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.240
This is the Lego City House.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.240
Set number 8403.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.220
I got this kit at Walmart for 30 dollars.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.610
Well 33 actually,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.070
and personally,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.700
it's not really worth it, but you do get some cool features.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.210
You get three mini-figures.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.890
You got a man, a woman, and a child.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.960
You got a man, a woman, and a child.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.180
I was really surprised I actually got the skateboard,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.640
I was really surprised I actually got the skateboard,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.680
a nice dog,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.940
and there's a lot of detail in here.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.020
I like the tree house.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.200
I like the telescope on there.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.290
The little flag, that's kind of cool.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.910
And I was really surprise that I actually got some greenery such as a tree

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.170
and flowers.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.930
Now I like the ... I don't even have a green garbage can, so I was really surprised I got that,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.320
and I like the little light fixture.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.640
The street lamp. That was a nice touch.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.080
I like the little chase lounge

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.140
I like the little chase lounge

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.000
on the porch. That's a nice idea.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.610
Now also I'd liked about it because I got a barbecue,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.840
and a hotdog or frank, or whatever they call them.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.290
I was really surprised this kit actually came with food.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.389
So it comes on a

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:47.779
So it comes on a

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:50.180
five by ten inch base plate,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.100
which I was really happy.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.070
Got some nice white railing.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.530
Nice mailbox with a letter inside. I was really surprised that ... I was hoping this would be white

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.590
Nice mailbox with a letter inside. I was really surprised that ... I was hoping this would be white

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.110
for my kitchen,

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.460
and I like the use of the

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.250
2 by 4 tiles for the sidewalk.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.829
2 by 4 tiles for the sidewalk.

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:14.749
That just adds a nice touch to this kit.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.299
So, there's the second story.

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:25.239
I got these 2 by 3 windows. Those are the same type of windows I used in my Amityville house except these are red.

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.790
So I was really surprised I got a hold of that.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.749
I like the awning, the blue awning. That turned out real good.

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:37.189
It give me an idea for some of my houses.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.209
And I like the roof.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.349
I don't have any of these dark grey tiles, which I was happy.

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.879
These are supposed to me solar panels, but I do not put the stickers on my Lego

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.419
only to the fact they come apart. The stickers do peal off.

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:54.879
So I didn't even put those on there.

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.369
Let's take a look inside of the house.

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:04.309
Now for the 33 dollars, where I don't think it's worth it.

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.599
Right off the back,

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.709
let's get this thing in some more light,

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.409
is these little wall elements.

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.099
This right here.

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.979
Now,

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:22.169
I've been a fan of Lego for a long time. I like to build my pieces like this.

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.739
I've been a fan of Lego for a long time. I like to build my pieces like this.

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.060
This is just ...

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.159
this is just cheap.

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.079
I are not a big fan of the hollow wall elements. I think to me, it's just a waste of time.

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.759
I are not a big fan of the hollow wall elements. I think to me, it's just a waste of time.

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:35.869
Now, there is some characteristics in this house that I like,

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:40.339
Now, there is some characteristics in this house that I like,

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:43.219
such as the little kitchen and living room.

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.199
That's a weird place for a TV or a computer,

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.169
but they put it there.

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.099
Nice kitchen with a cabinet. I don't even have a black one.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.119
So I can actually use that as a microwave or something.

00:03:56.119 --> 00:04:01.049
The sink is the same style sink that I use,

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.149
in my Lego creations.

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:06.209
So that guy right there, it's pretty much the same idea

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.079
that I use.

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.919
There's another on of these cheap wall elements. You can actually see the light coming through these wall elements here.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.019
There's another on of these cheap wall elements. You can actually see the light coming through these wall elements here.

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.239
[Taps] Really cheap.

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.069
I mean for the money I paid, I should have got some 1 by 6 pieces to stick in there.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:22.199
I mean for the money I paid, I should have got some 1 by 6 pieces to stick in there.

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.939
Here's the second story.

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.529
Got a nice computer with a keyboard.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.599
Turned out really good.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.110
Now this is a way to actually build a sofa.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.239
I mean it's a really clever idea.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:46.709
So I like the detail in that.

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:51.579
Forgive me, I'm using my iPhone. I've never done it with an iPhone before. I've used an HD cam for this.

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:53.489
This is a lot better.

00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:55.710
It's smaller to carry around.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.719
This is the bedroom.

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:06.490
You can actually see it's pretty decent. Just a basic bedroom all it is.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.600
Here's a separate room.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.219
I'm not sure what this would be used for

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:15.500
but I don't know.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.969
Of course there's a chimney

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:22.580
which I have no clue why because

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.590
there is no fireplace in this house,

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.069
whatsoever.

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.520
Not a fireplace, nothing.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.050
I like the arch.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.150
At least I got another arch piece.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.569
This is coming up.

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.030
I'm just making a quick video before I tear this thing down

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.520
because it's been sitting up for a month now.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.160
Here's the side of it. It's really just ....

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.999
I saw it in the book,

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:53.319
well shelf,

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.979
and I thought, this looks good.

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:02.979
It looks pretty beefy. It looks pretty big.

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:04.090
And this is what I got here

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.409
And this is what I got here

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:09.820
for 33 dollars. I would maybe go

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.919
maybe 25 on this.

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:17.960
That would be pushing it

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.669
And I'm not sure the piece count on this.

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.210
It didn't tell me

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.190
which is kind of unusual. I threw the box away.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:32.130
I think it has somewhere about 300 to 400 pieces.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.199
But it came out pretty good.

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:38.680
So I mean there's some pieces that I don't have which is good

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.289
for the upside, but the downside,

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:42.689
if you're going to buy this,

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:44.739
I'd wait for it to come on sale.

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:51.739
The regular price was 40 dollars, got it for 33. Maybe if it's 30 dollars, might be a steal. Maybe.

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:55.069
So, over all,

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:56.650
So, over all,

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.479
it's a fun kit.

00:06:58.479 --> 00:06:59.739
My nephew had fun playing with it.

00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:03.519
My nephew had fun playing with it.

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:05.500
So..., and he's only 5,

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.659
so it's pretty ..., it's pretty decent.

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:12.919
So that is the Lego City House.

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:14.329
So that is the Lego City House.

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:17.449
Set number 8403.

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:18.250
Set number 8403.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:18.520
Set number 8403.
