00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.140
welcome to Southwest yard and garden I'm
Curtis Smith frost is coming soon we've

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.880
got plants some house plants which we
have over summered outside so their

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.480
vacations about to end they need to come
in pretty soon we've got some others

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.230
which have become large they may be
growing in the ground or in pots we may

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.789
want to re propagate them to keep them so
we can have them again next year and we

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.800
have some which are just in need of
repotting we need to talk about that and

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.330
Master Gardener Judy Nickel from
Albuquerque is also doing some re potting

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.039
she's brought some things to show us as
well Judy I see you've got your

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:42.670
[Judy]- I brought some geraniums that need care they've
been outside and that dead leaves on

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.269
them that need to be cleaned off and let
me get the Clippers here and some of

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:55.569
these are their leggy and they need to
be repotted and this little trick on

00:00:55.569 --> 00:01:00.100
repotting was told to me by a friend of
mine one of our Albuquerque's top

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.750
gardeners many years ago is you take
your your pot and you insert a small pot

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.940
inside when you get the water at you put
your water in here and that water is the

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.060
plants and you just cut your piece of
geranium that you need your repot and

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.980
you really should let this cure on the
end for a while before repotting

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.080
-super eyes and seal that wound

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.520
right but I'm
going to show you how to do it anyway

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.330
the soil is dry so it's not going to do
much harm and then you just poke it in there

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.900
-it has to be nice and loose if it's
harder soil you have to use a pencil or something

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.420
-right this is a garden of
compost and we'll take some of these

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.220
dead leaves off they're looking tacky
clean them off a little bit and put it

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.620
in there and you can do about four or
five of these depending on size of your pot

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.740
-and then you're just water here
through that pot in the middle

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.480
-right and then that also keeps the base of these
of these things from from getting too

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.620
much water in rotting so that's the the
neat trick and then you can put your

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.940
little sign on there that says watch me
grow

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.680
-and that's what we like to do that's why we're doing this

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.640
[laughing] okay

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.820
-we have some other plans to look at now

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.130
I've got an amaryllis and every time a
water if the water just runs through to

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.880
rapidly so the soil needs to be replaced
in here but i noticed i have some

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.880
volunteer plants a little kalanchoe (Judy: oh)
they have come up in there so i want to

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.220
repot them while i'm doing this so--

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.028
-you must have had
this right next to a calico

00:02:31.028 --> 00:02:34.440
-it was right next to it a leaf fell in here and the
babies grew around the edge of the leaf

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.170
which is one of the nice things about
Kalanchoe so I'm going to take one of my

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.180
small pots and we'll put some potting
soil in here

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.580
press it down lightly

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.260
because this soil is very loose right now

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.680
-you want to shovel

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.220
[Laughing] -well I think we're okay the tools are fun but not always necessary

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.500
-they just work very well with these things

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.880
-and then what I'm gonna do is use my finger to make a

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.720
little hole to plant this these other
smaller ones i'm just going to set on the surface

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.920
-and they'll root

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.280
-and they will grow and so they're off and running

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.540
now we can deal with the amaryllis now
we've taken a baby plants out of there

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.740
all i want to do is take this out

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.200
-oh look at root ball

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.060
good healthy roots on

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:29.680
here i'm going to clean this old soil
off of it a little bit loosen these up

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.510
but i'm gonna put it back in the same
pot so I can't open it up too much so

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.340
what I'm going to do is put some soil in
create a bed a lot of its going to fall

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.340
out the holes at the bottom but since
this is moist it's going to work pretty well

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.940
-and they don't need too much soil
anywa

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.870
-they really don't this has been

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.860
in here for about four years as bloomed
every year so what I want to do is work

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.640
the soil and this time I do need the
tool so I can work the soil in

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.640
you continue adding well but this has to
work down the side of it which I find

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.880
very handy is to work like that

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.460
and then I want to tamp it well

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.660
[Tapping noise]

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.880
but if you'll notice the bulb is still sitting high in
the soil and that's the way an amaryllis

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.920
ought to be grown

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.180
-what color is this one

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.740
-this particular ones red I've got a red

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.380
one I've got a white one

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.900
-I like the white ones with a red lines in them

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.009
-okay well good luck with your garden
begin bringing your plants indoors or a

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:29.600
lot of things you can do inside

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.780
