00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.990
Hello, I'm Matt Cail and on behalf of Expert
Village, I'm going to show you today how to

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.130
make some paper snowflakes. Now we have a
nice string of paper snowflakes. They are

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.809
staying apart; they are not sliding over one
another and they look pretty cool. So this

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.840
is just done with nice pieces of paper and
we've done a really great job. Now, for hanging

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.130
these up and putting all your nice work on
display, there are a couple of ways. First

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.449
off, it helps to have a wall with some nice
contrast. If you have a white or really pale

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.370
wall, these guys aren't going to show up well,
unless you have lots of glue and glitter on

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.280
them. But, odds are, these guys aren't going
to show up. But if you have a nice wall with

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.210
some contrast, they really, really show up
nice. It looks pretty sweet. So, to keep them

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.289
on your wall, there are a couple of ways you
can go. I've seen some people use sticky-tack,

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.699
but in my experience, that's not strong enough.
Don't use things like duck tape, or you can

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.890
take a lot of the paint off of the wall you
choose. That probably won't have a...well,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.750
odds are, you can get into trouble if you
are going to do that to your wall (either

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.360
from your parents or your landlord). So, I
recommend some more transparent tape. Take

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.570
the end of your string, and basically, very
firmly tape it up there. Use two pieces of

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.950
tape (at least) for the ends. It's going to
be in an "x" shape. That'll actually help

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.160
give it maximum support. Keep in mind this
first tape, may actually come loose as you

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.771
go. Keep doing it more and more, after a while,
often times it will take. So, kind of stick

00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:35.160
with it; don't give up. So what you are going
to do is then take the other end of your string...of

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.840
your snowflake string and make sure that your
snowflakes are tight enough to where they

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.909
are upright and they are not sagging. Sagging
snowflakes are not much fun. If you actually

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.570
have a little bit of a rainbow, a little bit
of a bow in the middle here, take your string,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.619
get a good piece of tape and put it up on
your wall. Keep the tape off of the snowflakes.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.790
You do not want the tape on the string touching
the snowflakes. That can result in ripped

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:09.090
snowflakes if part of the tape gives way.
Then what you are going to do is basically

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.489
go to the end of your string and finish 'er
off. Then you have to go back and readjust

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.360
some things; make sure some things are staying
right and that it's looking okay. You may

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.569
actually then want to change some positions.
But, by and large, you have your snowflakes

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.990
hung up.
