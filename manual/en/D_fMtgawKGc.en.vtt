00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:11.389
The boat takes you to Egremni Beach and lets
you enjoy 1-2 hours of the nicest blue clear

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.480
water and big waves.
Don’t foreget your camera, it’s a unique

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.480
chance for that profile picture to finally
look esquisite with those colours in the back.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.949
Afteli Beach, one of my favourites. It’s
a little piece of paradise, an intimate place

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.160
with clear water, few people, a tiny beach
and a place where you can enjoy a meal or

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.160
a coffee in front of the sea. It’s surrounded
by trees and rocks, and what can I tell you

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.250
… I just wished I lived here…

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.090
You can drive to Afteli Beach and spend a
whole day here. There’s no need for a boat

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.629
trip.

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:03.629
Agiofilli Beach. I hope I got that name right…I’m
not sure but … anyway.We took a boat trip

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.439
from Vasiliki and lounged here for some hours.
I don’t think it’s a good idea to try

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.170
to get here by car. The beach is not so intimate
but it’s still beautiful. You can rent a

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.689
sunbed and have an icecream or a beer on the
beach, which is great! Try snorkeling, you

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.209
might spot some playful fishes around.

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:33.209
Kavalikefta. Definetly number one on my list.
The road is awful but manageable so yeah you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.440
can drive to the beach but it’s not gonna
be the smoothest ride…

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.459
I was amazed when I first saw this place.
The huge rocks in the water are specific for

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:50.569
this little spot of heaven.
Don’t forget to get the special water sneakers

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:56.099
because there is no sand here, just small
rocks which hurt your feet if you’re not

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:02.779
wearing anything or just simple slippers.
The image of Kavalikefta Beach remains in

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:08.110
my mind always.
Porto Katsiki. Did you know that katsiki means

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.959
goat ? So…yeah Port of the Goat. Great place
as you expected. I suggest a boat trip to

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.019
get here and bathe in the sun for some hours.
Don’t expect it to be a hidden place, everybody

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.349
visits Porto Katsiki, it’s known as one
of the most beautiful beaches in Greece.
