00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.690

teriyaki is a certain rolling

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.389
no I'm sorry service right

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.070
now

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.930
it's going to happen to him

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.509
that's it

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.550
I can't think of the has so far allowed

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.280
Canada

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.439
well ted I think the answer with teriyaki
the military out the looks like

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.349
on out of drag the flat

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:28.640
flashlights the taxes

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.369
the no no so it's wrong

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.320
now terry raskyn times we're going to fix
witcover right now as you can see that terry

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.129
all couple

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.439
nice pictures of teriyaki there she is and
litigious

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:41.740
thinking that you share and the for everything

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.990
I

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.150
now I'm living the way she can balance of
people teriyaki

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.410
tax hit

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.289
which looks like a

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.759
clothing had the attack that early tags that
acts not there are other that it's a train

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:58.079
on us to move from a bottle

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.580
I think that that at the end of the Clinton
plan to seek not the fact that

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.030
this is where you need to go

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.890
so it's a react the way what was something
that stood out in a chauffeur

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.390
we asked the of to be healthy and know how
to the europeans

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.180
and I think maybe less than five texases in
another that that

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.440
what is the top Clinton that he caught me
and explain to the list is one of many positives

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.100
interferon what happens is that I have and
I've seen them of course Iraq the list of

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.149
the watchers to the viewers might not know
and and on

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.980
nato is one of those on it's like a little
team

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.170
and how long does families

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.890
but in this party and what these things honor

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.220
and really the thing that comes out at six
thirty three this side

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.020
we like maple green tea

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.690
you don't you bring to a talk about that and
I believe that it is a fly I don't know that

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.420
even though the master mentor wars and lengthened
about the other of any you the candidacies

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.200
be

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.759
he contends that well the problem I try doing
in a teapot

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.270
and I had

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.620
I would have felt when I was playing the water
down this way

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.870
I felt like it wasn't going out

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.829
my nose at those is drogoul is draining down
my throat salty bolder in Iraq

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.689
yeah more that can happen

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.620
but you have to learn how it happened

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.469
well it's not that right

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:20.930

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.040
the of the that you live in a house with mall
problems but he still stay there

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.449

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.049
I still there now

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.779

evidence is that a hot tub

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:40.870

the three-story house orbit two hundred the
stagnant day

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.169
that's pretty good even if it kills the %uh
the IMF the hall

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:54.729

Tuesday's and a every study not consulting
trillion

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.779

the future of you when you tested from some

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:19.569
