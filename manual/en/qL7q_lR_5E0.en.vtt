Season 1 Finale: Universal Soldier.

00:00:01.799 --> 00:00:14.900
Previously on History of Turrican: We took
a look at the NES &amp; SNES Turrican games,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.050
finding the NES version difficult, the SNES
Super Turrican good,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.659
and SNES Super Turrican 2, not so good.

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:51.059
*titles go here*

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:59.480
So. Universal Soldier. Well, let's begin at
the beginning.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.050
In 1992, TriStar Pictures released Universal
Soldier, a Movie starring Jean-Claude Van

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.050
Damme.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.120
The basic plot revolves around Luc Deveraux,
a Cyborg soldier, and his attempts

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.210
to reclaim his old life.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.560
Now I'm not going to review the movie here,
It'd take far too long

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.920
and I really want to get this over with as
quickly as possible.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.570
The movie licence was given to Accolade, makers
of the Turrican conversions for Megadrive,

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.860
Gameboy and PC Engine. Furthermore, they also
had the licence to make Turrican II

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.860
for the console market.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.860
Thus was born a very bad Idea...

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.860
*Featured System: Sega Megadrive/Genesis*

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.860
The Megadrive version removes little from
what was a masterpiece of gaming to begin

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.860
with.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.620
What it adds, are new levels, a new main sprite,
and a re-ordering of world 1. In its defence,

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:51.030
When it tries to be Turrican II, it does a
good job. If it had been a straight port,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.080
I'd have gladly sung its praises back in episode
3.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:17.060
Sadly, this was not the case, and Universal
Soldier suffers for it.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.060
*Featured System: Nintendo Gameboy*

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.060
In this monochrome 8-bit version, if you squint,
and look from a certain angle,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.060
you can almost imagine you're really playing
Turrican II. Until you get to the added levels,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.060
that is.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.060
Compared to the Turrican levels, the Universal
Soldier level design is generic and boring.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.060
Jumping left, and right? Long platforms with
occasional holes?

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.060
That's the very basics of platforming. Entirely
unbecoming for a Turrican game.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.130
The lo-fi charms of the Gameboy can only limit
the damage. This is a pointless licence

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.360
that only harms the original game.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.850
*Featured System: Nintendo SNES*

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.280
Accolade developed a SNES version of Universal
Soldier, but for some reason

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:47.730
decided not to release it. Thankfully, Factor
5 released Super Turrican,

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.120
an infinitely purer source of Turrican goodness,
and all was well.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.130
The unfinished state of this game is obvious.
This version feels rough, unpolished.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.140
Colours are weird, music loops desynchronise,
even the front end is basic, amateurish.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:08.550
On top of this, They really don't seem to
be pushing the hardware at all.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:25.940
The SNES is easily capable of a direct Turrican
II port,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:39.470
but developers The Code Monkeys intentionally
play it safe.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:55.200
Ultimately though, it's unfair to throw criticism
at an unfinished game.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.510
With a few tweaks, and some better music,
perhaps this would have been enough

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.510
to salvage the reputation of Universal Soldier.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.510
And on that happy note, we bring this first
series to a close.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.510
Thanks very much for watching, and may your
god, or your iPod, bless you. Credits!
