As you enter campus in the Fall of 2014 you

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.500
might encounter four projects that are currently
under construction. Heavener Hall on the Northeast

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.480
corner of campus is a College of Business
project.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.500
Howie Ferguson
It's really more about creating a home,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.529
where you don't just go to class and leave-
you go to class and then in between classes

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.600
you break into study groups and work on stuff,
maybe you grab some lunch, maybe you check

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.519
e-mail, maybe you have a student study group
meeting or an organizational meeting and then

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:46.379
you go to some more classes, all in the same
building- one-stop shopping. This is really

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.489
the new gateway to campus. As part of the
project, we're not just building a building;

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.449
we completely redid what's essentially a
city block.

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.710
Miles Albertson:
The Harrell Medical Education Building is

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.070
closer to the Health Science Center and it's
a College of Medicine building

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.930
Bill Smith:
We're gonna get to bring everybody into

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.909
one building now: Student Affairs, Financial
Aid, the  Clinical  Skills, the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.750
Simulation, and most other classrooms will now
all be kind of brought into one facility

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.940
Miles Albertson:
The Reitz Union expansion, you will obviously

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.430
see- it's in the core of campus

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.010
Norb Dunkle:
This 120,000-foot expansion and renovation

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.180
of over 60,000 square feet are going to add
square footage that students need for all

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.180
of their services.
It is an enormous project that evolves and

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.990
takes shape week after week after week. So
follow the progress of the construction; we're

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.450
gonna be asking for a lot of input and a lot
of involvement over the course of the finishing

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.750
of these projects and, who knows- the idea
that you might suggest might just become reality.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.460
Miles Albertson:
The other building that you might encounter

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.270
currently under renovation is Cypress Hall

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.020
The interesting thing about Cypress Hall is

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.140
there are very few like it in-in the United
States. We're including amenities for enhanced

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.450
mobility disabilities for students

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.760
I hope you get to encounter some renovations

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.519
in the new O'Connell Center facility
that's being planned right now. It's a

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.579
huge renovation that will tear out all the
stadium seating, basketball courts in the

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.090
core of that building, and rebuild them all
with new, more luxurious stadium-type seating.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.879
You're putting something
tangible onto and into a place you care about,

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.919
it's gonna affect lives, it's gonna create
better people, better students, a better environment.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.450
When you cut the ribbon, and the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.069
door is open, and students walk in and say,
"Hey, I suggested that they put that gator

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.120
head in the railing," and it's there,
and you see the excitement on their face because

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.120
it's gonna be there for perpetuity, that
makes it all the more exciting.
