00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.570
I started the Torpedo project in 2006 here
in Montpellier, just after I finished my PhD.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.500
I wanted to create a product that would help
me use my 100W amplifier

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500
mainly at home to record my music,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.970
and sometimes on stage to
play in the best conditions.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.580
I wasn't quite satisfied with analog speaker
simulation or with all-in-one modeling solutions.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.079
I simply wanted the sound of MY amp, 
with MY effects...

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.190
not of something that tried to sound like my amp.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.110
The Torpedo VB-101 was our first product,
and it is still the best we have.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.530
But our best-sellers are the Torpedo Live 
and C.A.B., designed for the stage.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.520
The combination of studio-grade electronics
and the Torpedo speaker processing is so far

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.520
one of the best silent miking solutions, 
and certainly the most advanced on the market.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.649
My name is Ivan, I am in charge of researching
new algorithms for Two Notes.

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.060
My name is Bruno, I am the head of
the Research and Developement team.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.670
I specialize in DSP programming 
and analog design.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.670
I started working on the VB-101 in 2006.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.670
We could see early on that 
the concept was very promising.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.000
We started within a few months 
with an ugly-looking prototype

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.000
but the difficult part was to get
an actual product from that prototype.

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.979
My role was to transform 
this embedded PC running Linux

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.650
into a high-efficiency, 
DSP-based VB-101.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.000
This prototype is now back 
to being a server PC...

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.420
Once we had established the concept of a loadbox
coupled with a powerful digital processor,

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.000
we took some inspiration from the studio world
to design the best convertor possible.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.270
Indeed it is the whole analog design around the convertor
that guarantees that you send the best signal to the processor.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.930
From the first drawings to the final schematics,
mechanical plans and programming,

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.000
everything is done here in this office.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.260
My name is Raphael, and I am in charge of
developing the Torpedo plug-ins.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Having both software and hardware expertise 
is very important for us

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.000
as we can take the best of both worlds.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.709
We want to be as close as possible to our customers

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.709
so we spend a lot of time on our online Help Desk

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.709
and various Internet forums.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.000
My name is Romain, I am in charge of artist relations 
and international communication.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.590
The artists we work with are really taken care of

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.590
as they are both our first source for inspiration

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.000
and the best prescribers for us.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.250
My name is Bénédicte, I am Guillaume's assistant.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.069
I am in charge of the administrative part of Two Notes

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.700
and the relations with customers and suppliers.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I also measured most of the cabinets present in the Torpedo products.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.700
If you call the company, I will be answering.

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.010
I am Jean-Michel.

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:40.010
As Sales Manager, I am most of the time 
out of the office.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.510
I manage the Two Notes 
worldwide distribution network.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.090
We moved to this place in 2010 
because we needed the extra space

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.599
to manufacture the Torpedo ourselves.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.000
Most of its parts are local

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.599
and everything is assembled, 
tested and programmed here

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.409
in Montpellier.

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.629
The Two Notes products are designed for guitarists
and bassists to play real amps and preamps

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.540
if that's how they feel most comfortable.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.090
As we are musicians too, we know that what
matters first is how you feel when you play

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.410
that you love your tone 
and feel supported by it.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.860
Now, if you'll excuse me,

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.860
the audience is waiting...
