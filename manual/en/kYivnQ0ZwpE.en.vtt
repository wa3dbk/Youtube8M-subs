00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:10.150
FEMALE STUDENT: I’ve always been really
curious about exactly what it is.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.460
&gt;&gt; MALE STUDENT: It kind of reminds me of
Poison Ivy from Batman.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.129
That’s what I think of when I see this building.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.829
&gt;&gt; MALE STUDENT: I mean yeah, I’ve been
curious but I guess I wasn’t curious enough.

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.170
&gt;&gt; MALE STUDENT: I don’t know exactly what
it does, but I know there’s plants growing

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.170
in there.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.170
&gt;&gt; MALE STUDENT: I have no clue.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.499
I actually kind of get scared every time I
pass by it.

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:31.880
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: If you blink you might miss it.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.040
And even if you are looking, you might not
know what you’re looking for, or at.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.520
It’s that white nondescript building.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.420
The one that’s just north of the Tower.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.230
The one that looks really out of place on
campus.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.220
The one you’ve walked by hundreds of times.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.690
So what exactly is it?

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.370
&gt;&gt; MICK VANN: This greenhouse is like a warm
blanket to me, you know.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.740
It’s a job I’ve had a long time.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.280
You know, I’m pals with all the plants in
there.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.999
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For Mick Vann, this Greenhouse
has been home for 20 years.

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:10.749
As a horticulturist for the school of Biological
Sciences, it’s his job to watch over and

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:12.360
maintain this campus treasure.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.969
&gt;&gt; MICK VANN: It oozes character.

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:21.950
The north building and the little cottage
next to it were originally built in 1926.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:30.759
If you look at aerial shots from, you know,
the early 30s or late 20s you see the bio-lab

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.890
building and you see this greenhouse.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.770
Now it’s a holding facility for a bunch
of tropical plants.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.090
It’s important that it be close to the bio-lab
building so they can access the plants and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.020
actually bring the students in and do hands
on classes and labs in there.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.469
Everybody loves this greenhouse.

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.109
It’s got age.

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:55.990
It’s mature as they say.
