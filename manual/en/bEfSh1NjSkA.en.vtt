Chris Wall here with the Boulder Rock Club in Boulder, CO

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.060
Today I want to talk to you about training in the gym for endurance

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.980
The climbing gym is a very safe environment for you to train to get stronger and learn how to climb more effectively

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.360
Most of the time you will be climbing with a partner, but on occasion you're going to have to fly solo

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.960
Today I'm going to talk to you about how to train endurance when you're by yourself

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.920
When you're training by yourself, the auto belay is going to become your new best friend

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.240
All the things that you could do with a top rope belayer, you can do with an auto belay

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:52.580
So whether it's climbing all the way up, and then lowering yourself down or climbing all the way up and climbing all the way back down, you can do this by yourself all the while protected by the auto belay

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.240
There are many, many different strategies when it comes to training your endurance for climbing

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.840
When you use an auto belay, the only thing that's really going to be limiting you is your creativity

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.860
All the things you could do with a partner, you can do with an auto belay

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.460
But now you don't have to switch back and forth with your partner because you're doing everything else on your own

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.200
Whether you want to be on, working on super long endurance routes where you're climbing 5 pitches at a time, or whether you're staying on the wall for as long as possible climbing up, down, back up, down

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.520
It doesn't matter which strategy you choose, all are going to be effective and all should be based on your personal goals

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.700
But with the auto belay, you'll be able to do all these things without being hampered by having a partner who has their own needs to fulfill

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.440
At the most basic level when it comes to training endurance, consider what it is that you're training for

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.700
If you're trying to do long, traditional routes that are, god knows, 100, 120, 150 feet long, you need to be spending that much time on the wall which means you're going to be climbing up, down, up, and possibly up and back down again depending on how tall your gym is

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:12.660
If you're training for more moderate power endurance, maybe you're just going to up then lower yourself back down, rest for a very short period of time, and then go up again

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.940
You can do this any number of times depending on your personal level of fitness and what it is that you're training for

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.360
When training alone, the bouldering cave is a great place to not only work on your power and your technique, but also your endurance

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.180
One of my favorite ways of working endurance is utilizing a technique called a 4x4

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.280
Choose 4 moderate to difficult boulder problems that you can do

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.660
Get on the first one, climb it, come down, climb it again, come down, climb it again, come down, climb it again. That's 4 attempts on 1 problem

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.800
Take a little rest, anywhere from 2 to 5 minutes and them move on to the next problem

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.980
Repeat 4 times

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.320
And then the same thing for the 3rd problem, same for the 4th problem

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.440
Each problem 4 times, 4 problems. 4x4

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.540
So the bouldering area is a great place to work your endurance

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.160
You can do long traverses, much longer sometimes than what you would do in terms of number of moves climbing up the wall

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.680
Or you can do big, looping circuits

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.760
And you can do one lap, 2 laps, 3 laps, back and forth, literally hundreds of moves without stepping off the wall

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:26.240
This is a fantastic way not only to maintain your concentration when you're getting tired, but also to work your physical stamina and endurance

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.860
So those are just a few ways to train endurance without a partner

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.120
