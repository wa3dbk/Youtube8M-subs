00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.570
What's yellow and black and green

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.370
and yellow all over?

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.990
Microjig, maker of the GRR-RIPPER.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.170
Work safer, work smarter.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.429
The first thing I need to do is cut these
two, 10' long boards down to manageable lengths.

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.789
By ripping all the boards to 7" wide,

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.570
I'm also squaring off the rounded edges.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.080
Since the tabletop starts out as an octagon,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.369
I need to cut all the miters to 22.5 degrees.

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.849
I'm cutting these on my miter saw,

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.840
then I'll try to get more accurate miters
on my tablesaw.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.660
I think I'll be able to get much more accurate cuts using this brand new miter gauge a viewer sent me.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.980
It looks like they are going to fit together
really nicely.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.080
Now I need to cut a rabbet on the inside edge
of each board.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.180
I'll join the octagon together using pocket
screws.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.860
I'm going to glue and screw these all together.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.470
These are 1x4s that I'm ripping down to 3"
wide.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.659
I'm going to screw all these boards in from
underneath, no glue.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.720
I'm going to start with the center board and
work my way to the sides,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.620
cutting each board to size.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.150
I clamped the board in place along that rabbet and that should hold it so I can put the screws in.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.880
 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.860
I can slide it over and do the same on this
side.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.720
The rest of them, I'm going to space using
the quarter inch piece of plywood.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:05.780
PRO TIP!

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.440
I discovered it's important to drill a pilot
hole in the ¾" board or it will split.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.360
This board is going to need its corner cut
off,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.800
and that is a 45 degree angle.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.280
After a lot of trimming and testing and testing
and trimming,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.520
I finally got it to fit, just right.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.800
All the edge boards are a little easier,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.800
they have 45 degree angles on both sides.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.120
I spent a lot of time sanding this to level
out any of the uneven surfaces.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.459
I'll probably still come back to it and do
some finer sanding once it's all assembled.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.279
Here I'm finding the center point and drawing
a circle.

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.819
I'm building the entire base and legs out
of 2x4s.

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.399
I'm cutting all the pieces to their exact
dimensions using my tablesaw.

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.790
I'm going to join all the center pieces together
using half-lap joints.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.959
And all that means is I'm going to cut out
a large notch, half the thickness of the wood

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.340
in each piece.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.040
I can make sure it's centered by flipping
the board end-to-end and

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.940
 using only one stop block as a reference.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.979
Those two notches just interlock.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.660
Without changing my blades, I can cut rabbets
on the ends of the top boards.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.080
I'll start the assembly by glueing these cross
pieces together.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.599
And I'm also putting some screws in.

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:21.319
I just don't want to put any screws in the
middle where I need to drill a hole for the umbrella.

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.789
To assemble the base, I'm going to start by
attaching the legs to the lower cross brace.

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.839
I decided this needed some clamping pressure
also, to help draw these joints together.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.970
This cross brace drops down into these rabbets.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.980
These 1 ½" diameter holes are for the umbrella.

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:14.639
The idea here is that the tabletop will rest
on this rabbet, rather than on these thinner slats.

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.150
The way that fits in there, I don't really
need to attach the top,

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.950
but I'm going to put one screw in each leg
just to make it easier to move around.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.160
I'm using my router to round over the top
edge.

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.539
I'm finishing this with an exterior, water-based,
spar urethane.

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.079
I think three coats of that spar urethane
is really going to protect this redwood from the weather.

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:05.839
