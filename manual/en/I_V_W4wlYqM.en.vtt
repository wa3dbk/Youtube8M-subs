ANNE MOONEY: Hi. I'm Chef Anne Mooney, the
food columnist for Simply The Best Magazine

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:13.070
out of Delray Beach, Florida, and today I'm
here on behalf of Expert Village, and we're

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:21.140
going to talk about quick, easy, healthy,
last-minute dessert crepes. If you need a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.920
last-minute dessert and you have a little
bit of fresh fruit on hand and you've made

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.430
your stash of crepes, pull a couple out of
the freezer and you'll have instant dessert.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:42.270
Now, this dessert crepe that I'm going to
work on will have red, white, and green fruit

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:52.620
in it. I have some raspberries, nice and fresh,
and big, plump ones, too. They are beautiful.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:03.920
And we'll kind of put some blueberries on
here, too,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:17.510
to make some nice color.
And then we'll put some sauce that I've made

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.560
by mixing a carton--an eight-ounce carton
of creme fraiche with an equal amount of lemon

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.140
curd which I bought. I used Wilkinson's lemon
curd and it looks like this and it tastes

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.280
delicious and it will enhance any kind of
fresh fruit that you have. So we'll pour some

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:52.090
of that over the top, like so. Wrap the crepe.
Put it seam side down. Garnish it with some

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.710
kiwifruit, like so. Put some more sauce over
the top. You never can have too much sauce.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:11.290
This stuff is wonderful. And then, to make
it look pretty, we'll sprinkle some pine nuts

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:23.480
over the top and add just a few more raspberries
for a little color. And there you have it,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.300
instant dessert. If you like this one, check
