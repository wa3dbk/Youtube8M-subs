00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020
The wider Worthing area has a lot of available
fishing.

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:08.020
The main marks we'll cover being the pier...then
moving out of town to West Parade...on the

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:19.089
edge of Worthing at Goring...and finally to
neighbouring Ferring.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.420
The pier has clearly defined areas where you
can and cannot fish.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.270
Look down at the deck for the coloured discs
and refer back to the signs that are up all

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.770
along to make sure you can fish where you're
standing.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.830
It is possible to fish from a wheelchair on
the upper deck with disabled parking close

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.610
to the pier.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.300
For those that can do stairs, the lower deck
is the place to get out of the way of the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.629
candy floss brigade.

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.510
Species-wise, it can do well with flounders
here.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.550
Some plaice show, dabs and rockling of course
- in summer mackerel and gars.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.720
But earlier this year to everyone's surprise
a big stingray was landed off the pier, so

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.300
you never really know.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.590
Which of course is what we all tell ourselves
anyway and keeps us coming back.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.230
To help plan your trip there's a weather station
on the pier.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.620
You can log on and see what the wind speed
and direction is.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:32.620
As the fishing is both sides of the pier though,
you can often find shelter from the wind somewhere.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
The water is shallow here so best to fish
either side of high tide.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.470
Mainly sandy with small outcrops of rocks
you can easily see on a day when the sea's

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.970
clear.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.560
We all know piers attract idiots when the
sun's out, so if you want to escape the crowds,

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:58.270
a 'Plan B' is to move out of town westwards.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.260
Parking is available right by the beach.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.800
On the Worthing borders at Goring, the ground
is getting more and more mixed.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.660
Parking is available roadside here but there's
also a big beachside cafe up this end with

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.530
toilets that is next to a car park.
