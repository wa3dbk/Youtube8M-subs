00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:02.259
"Go!

00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:06.980
Move it, will ya?

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:15.980
Aw, you're lettin' him go right by you!

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.590
Can you BELIEVE this guy?

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.240
Come on!

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:34.500
Don't just--
NINJA KICK THE DAMN RABBIT!"

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.410
When it comes to the treacherous conversion
from comic book to television to film, and

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.710
finally to our beloved video game medium,
the TMNT franchise has comported itself admirably.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.280
Whether it's the classic '80s Arcade beat-em-ups,
NES classics like Turtles 2 and The Manhattan

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.720
Project, or even the PS2-era adaptations of
the wildly underrated mid-2000s Turtles cartoon,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.110
with a few notable exceptions, you can't swing
a dead rat without hitting a bitchin' TMNT

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.110
title.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.781
That said, apart from a brief monsoon in the
form of 2007's CGI Turtles flick, during the

00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:06.750
last decade, the amphibian foursome have withered
during a bit of a drought.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.750
"You're in a desert.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.200
You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.930
It's crawling toward you..."

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.930
"Tortoise?

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.930
What's that?"

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.490
Enter TMNT: Out of the Shadows.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.120
Expectations are inordinately high, considering
this is a $15 Xbox Live Arcade title we're

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.120
talkin', here.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.060
While far from perfect, and with enough technical
issues to be mistaken for the Xbox 360 it's

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.370
running on, I'm pleased to announce this is
the best TMNT game since the '90s, and a stand-out

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.600
in the otherwise lackluster library of downloadable
titles.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.100
Blood Dragon motherfuckin' excluded.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.820
A beat-em-up... let alone one featuring anthropomorphic
turtles in Lone Ranger masks wielding feudal

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.320
ninja weaponry... has no goddamn business
being this Nietszche fuckin' deep.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.760
I mean... the skill trees...

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.140
Riker's beard, the skill trees!

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.230
In an arcade-style hack &amp; slash, no less!

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.990
Every time the pendulous balls of the industry
swing too far afield, there's an inevitable,

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.549
and massive course-correction that pulls in
the opposite direction - usually in a separate

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.380
niche of the very same industry.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.650
When film noir got too dark and depressing,
bring on the musicals!

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.209
When the mid-'70s crime film genre ran out
of guidos to whack - time for the big-budget

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.900
fantasy films of the '80s!

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.530
And frankly, with how 'proper' RPGs of the
day continue to inch ever closer to the precipice

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.290
of set-piece-laden action gamery, I'd be shocked
if we didn't encounter even more of this sort

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.580
of thing from action games in the future.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.920
But frankly... there are times when this game
was more of an RPG... than Mass Effect.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.849
A fact as refreshing as it is a centrifuge
of perpetual despair.

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.980
Juxtaposing the counter-heavy exploits of
the Arkham Batman series with a deliberately

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.350
piecemeal, strategy-heavy hack &amp; slash game
more akin to the Lord of the Rings PS2 and

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.110
Gamecube titles, it wouldn't be unfair to
say the combat spins against the way it drives.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.319
With the wealth of offense at your disposal,
the temptation to mash buttons in perpetuity

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.040
can be a difficult siren call to resist.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.340
Needless to say, more than a few stray profanities
were uttered at a perfectly innocent Television

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.260
screen before I finally sledgehammered into
my hapless cranium the fact that you have

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.489
to take it a bit slower and choose your strikes
carefully in TMNT: Out of the Shadows.

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.050
If you approach Out of the Darkness as the
Batman: Arkham Asylum 'Part Deux' that the

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.180
video game press has appraised it as, mashing
the attack buttons until they bond with your

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.490
fingers at the subatomic level and wondering
why your counter button doesn't stop enemy

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.129
strikes even when you've fully committed to
a move... frankly, the problem lies with you,

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.470
and not with the game.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.430
It's not Arkham Asylum and it's not Sleeping
Dogs.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.970
It's a slower, more deliberate experience
with a punishingly steep learning curve, where

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.160
skill trees and character upgrades genuinely
make a substantive difference.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.620
Initially, I assumed the skills and upgrades
were window-dressing.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.800
'Even football games have experience points'
I chortled, waxing my mustache between mouthfuls

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.690
of fine English snuff.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.550
'Surely they jest that I should partake in
such woolgathering flim-flammery."

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.510
5 merciless dickings later, I applied my Ability
Points and emerged a much more competent fighter,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.769
humbled to admit that this game is every bit
as much of an RPG... as it is a Beat-Em-Up!

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.830
Offsetting the godiva richness of the five-course,
combat and skill tree buffet is an emaciated

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.109
single-player campaign.

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.919
I've had longer showers, people.

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.500
Clocking in at a paltry 3-4 hours, you almost
wondered why they bothered in the first fuckin'

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.500
place.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.800
The only irredeemable grievance on offer from
TMNT: Out of the Shadows is that Activision

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.089
elected to shave a few pesos off the miserly
development budget by hiring the cinematographer

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:37.559
from Metal Gear Solid: Rising on the cheap.

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:39.879
And to him I can only say 'What.

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:40.879
The FUCK.

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:43.810
Are you Looking At?!"

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.941
It's certainly not me, and it's damn sure
not The Foot, as they have a nasty habit of

00:04:47.941 --> 00:04:51.529
barrelling into frame from off-screen with
an unblockable double-dong of doom that I'd

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:53.960
need motherfuckin' tea leaves to have foreseen!

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.249
Seriously, what is it, Sergei Eisenstein?

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:57.740
What is so interesting on the floor?!

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.009
Hell, I don't even need to control you if
you'd just sit at the proper angle.

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.849
Just... hover the fuck above above me and
occasionally fly past my head!

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.180
Pretend that you're comedic subtlety... and
I'm Angry Joe.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.379
It's a merciless annoyance, and drops frequent
enough golden showers on the proverbial parade

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.229
that it knocks the game from a 'Fuck yeah'
to a mere 'Hell yeah' on The Rageaholic's

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.479
non-existent metaphorical rating scale for
the furtherance of convoluted analogies.

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.409
As IGN has rightly pointed out: Camera problems...

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:30.530
KILL hack &amp; slash games... unless of course
you're Metal Gear Rising, in which case, 'Camera

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.530
Issues?!

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.060
WHAT camera issues?

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.060
GAMEOFTHEYEARALLYEARSLULZORN00BL33T!'

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.900
A plethora of kickass alternate game modes
- virtually all of which outstrip the main

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.309
campaign for length, depth and sheer volume
of content - pick up the slack left by the

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:44.719
pants-shitting cameraman, however.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:49.080
Arcade is a blast, Survival is as frustratingly
addictive as it sounds, and Challenge Mode

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.460
is xeroxed the fuck over from the Arkham series,
except with much greater enemy variety and

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.689
a handful of boss fights to offer a much-needed
break from the mounting tedium.

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:00.849
And they all support synchronized swearing--
*ahem* CO-OP!

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.840
This game needs a patch like Robin Thicke
needs to go the fuck away.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.570
With that, it would easily elevate to the
stratosphere it seems to aspire to, and my

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.210
recommendation would come caveat-free.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.759
It's Batman: Arkham Asylum, except with Turtles,
more moves, greater depth, and a wider variety

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.580
in the fighting styles of enemy and player
character alike.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.469
If that sounds awesome to you - and it fucking
should - then don't be a bitch, pick it the

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:27.469
fuck up.

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:28.469
I'm RazÃ¶rFist.

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:40.099
God - fuckin' - SPEED!
