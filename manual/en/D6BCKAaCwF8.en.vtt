How Does SCE Make Money?

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.299
SCE doesn't follow a typical business model. 
Why? Because it's a monopoly,  

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.000
whereas most other companies have competitors 
that determine how they price their products. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.500
This means we don't really earn money, or a profit, through sales.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.800
So how does it earn its money? 
A typical business makes a profit through the number of products sold 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.600
or services rendered, while SCE makes money 
through something called a "return on assets" model.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.850
We use a different model because it wouldn't serve the public
if we generated unused electricity simply to grow sales. 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.100
As a company that provides a basic service critical 
to the everyday lives of millions of people, 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.699
it's important, instead, that we have the funds 
necessary to maintain and upgrade the system. 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.299
And "that system" means assets that 
include one and a half million poles, 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:02.499
close to 90,000 miles of distribution lines 
enough to go around the earth three and a half times!

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.899
and over 700,000 transformers.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.499
So through careful analysis and planning, 
the company projects what it needs for current and future energy needs 

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:16.299
and gets upfront funding from investors and long-term debt. 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:22.400
The company then recovers these costs over 
the life of the assets, including a return.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.899
What SCE is authorized to spend and 
the maximum return we're authorized to get back 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.899
all gets decided in lengthy and rigorous 
proceedings with the California Public Utilities Commission. 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:39.699
It also depends on the company's ability to implement 
and complete projects on time and within budget.

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:41.499
So that's where the returns come from. 

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:45.699
Not from electricity sales, 
since the state wants to discourage consumption, 

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:52.899
but through the capital investments made for 
the safety and reliability of our region's power grid.
