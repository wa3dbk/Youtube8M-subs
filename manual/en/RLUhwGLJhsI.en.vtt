00:00:00.417 --> 00:00:03.051
The backdraft was set up
somewhere in there.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.774
Fried Holcomb when he
opened the inner door.

00:00:07.363 --> 00:00:10.089
But the outer door held
and it waited for Tim.

00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:14.770
Ln a word, Brian,

00:00:16.543 --> 00:00:18.473
what is this job all about?

00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:19.880
Fire.

00:00:35.608 --> 00:00:37.261
Lt's a living thing.

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.832
Lt breathes, it eats

00:00:42.034 --> 00:00:43.381
and it hates.

00:00:44.818 --> 00:00:47.513
The only way to beat it
is to think like it.

00:00:48.797 --> 00:00:51.645
To know this flame will spread
this way across the door

00:00:51.703 --> 00:00:53.418
and up across the ceiling.

00:00:53.478 --> 00:00:56.112
Not because of the physics
of flammable liquids,

00:00:56.171 --> 00:00:57.978
but because it wants to.

00:00:58.313 --> 00:01:00.793
Some guys on this iob,
fire owns them.

00:01:01.587 --> 00:01:03.823
Makes them fight it on its level.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.056
But the only way to truly kill it

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:09.148
is to love it a little,
just like Ronald.

00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:26.344
Hi.
Hi.

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.476
L heard your friend's
gonna be okay.
Thanks.

00:01:30.902 --> 00:01:32.739
Jen, we checked
and your boss was partners,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.924
with all three murder victims
in a company called
Lakeside Dynamics.

00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:39.076
He's keeping that a secret.
L wanna know why.

00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:43.847
L don't know anything about that.

00:01:43.908 --> 00:01:46.266
You might be able to find out.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.438
Get me his files.

00:01:48.498 --> 00:01:50.366
Do you know what you're
asking me to do?

00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:51.436
Yeah.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.651
Four years ago l was
punching a cash register.

00:01:55.077 --> 00:01:57.099
Two years ago,
Swayzak didn't even
know my name.

00:01:57.157 --> 00:01:59.025
L was bringing the guy coffee.

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.320
L practically
run that office now.

00:02:01.564 --> 00:02:04.289
And Marty, he believes in me.

00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:07.165
L just don't...

00:02:09.183 --> 00:02:12.706
You're asking me
to throw that all away.
Your boss is a liar.
