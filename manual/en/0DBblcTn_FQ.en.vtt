00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.459
Hello, friends.

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:02.459
Welcome to Hilah Cooking.

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:06.749
I am a little bit hungover today
from the Austin Blogger Awards last night,

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:09.140
so forgive me if I fumble.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.400
I
also thought that I might make some potatoes

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.500
latkes today, because they are
good for breakfast.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.810
My dad used to make them for me for breakfast
when I

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.460
was a kid; I think he called them potato pancakes,
probably.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:27.150
Also it's
Hanukah, so perfect combination.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:38.000
Yay, potatoes.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.310
The first thing I'm going to do is grate some
potatoes.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.120
This is a pound of
potatoes; it'll probably end up being about

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.410
2 cups once it's grated.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.320
I'm
going to go ahead and grate it on this cloth,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:58.399
so that then afterwards we
can squeeze some of the water out on the cloth.

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:09.470
I'm going to flip it around
and do the last little potato on the smaller

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.100
side.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.200
Having some smaller
pieces in there will help them hold together

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.670
a little better.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.840
Almost done,
hold on.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.300
That's a whole lot of potato.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.740
They turn a little brown because of oxidation,
but you're going to fry it

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.890
anyway, so it's going to be browner.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.990
I would say that's probably closer to
3 cups of grated potato, if you don't have

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.990
a scale.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.829
I'm going to just throw
this over and mash them.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.890
Water comes out.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.950
I don't want to rinse them off
because I want to keep the potato starch,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.060
but I want to get rid of some of
the liquid.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.800
The starch will help hold everything together.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.160
That's probably
good; don't need to go crazy.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.740
I will mix this in the bowl with everything
else, except the oil of course,

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.730
because that's for frying.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.730
Potatoes in.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.730
Oh Lord, they're stuck.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.870
You can use
paper towel too, but you know how I feel about

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.150
paper towels.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.989
I just got
this out of the dirty clothes.

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.500
Just kidding, it's clean.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.220
Onion, one egg,
minced garlic.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.050
You can leave that out, but I like it, and
some salt.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.370
I'm
going to mix it together with this fork.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.019
I've got this, a little bit of
flour here, in case we need it.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.420
If it seems watery, you can add a little
bit of flour, but pressing the moisture out

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:21.830
should alleviate that issue.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.940
This looks well-mixed.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.989
I'm going to let that just sit there while
I heat up the skillet.

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.290
I'm going
to get pretty hot, and then I use a lot of

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.319
oil, more than I usually use
when I cook things, because that's part of

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.360
the deal.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.580
About 1/4 -cup of oil,
maybe.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:49.190
Set them down and flatten them out a little
bit.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.909
The thicker they
are . . . you want them thicker rather than

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.560
thinner, I think; they hold
together better.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:04.660
It's totally going to set that fire alarm
off again today,

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.540
I think.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.420
Sweet.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:27.590
I've got this on high, but I'm going to actually
turn it

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.510
down to a medium-high because I don't want
the bottoms to get too brown

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.200
before the potatoes are actually cooked through.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.570
I guess the deal with Hanukah, according to
my internet research which is

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.890
infallible as we all know; something about
magical oil lasted 8 nights

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.750
instead of one.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.100
In honor of that oil, you're sanctioned by
the religions to

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.330
eat fried foods for 8 days, which in my book's
pretty cool: Donuts and

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.900
fried potato cakes, and stuff like that.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.420
There's probably other stuff too.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.890
That's, I guess, the traditional reasoning
behind using so much oil.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.130
You
probably could do this with some spray oil

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:16.330
or something, if you're
conscious of your health, which I am throwing

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.490
my health to the wind here
today, people.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.850
This smells really good, though.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.400
It smells like frying
potatoes and fried onions.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.170
I'm looking forward to eating them.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:34.050
I'm just making sure they're not sticking;
everything's moving.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:40.710
I don't
know if you can see the cooking differentiation

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:47.170
here, this outer edge
starting to look more yellow instead of white,

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.910
and a little bit translucent
instead of opaque.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.710
That's what potatoes do when they cook.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.340
That's what
you're looking for to know when to flip them,

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.970
is when the edges all the way
up are starting to be soft.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:09.720
I think that some of these are probably ready
to flip.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.580
Look at that golden-brown deliciousness.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.980
Dude, that looks
delicious.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.550
I'm going to take that one off.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:24.210
That one needs to go longer.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.930
These are
done; I'm going to take them off.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:39.030
I have some sour cream and applesauce to
serve with them, which is good and traditional.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:07:05.590
I'm going to just cut a
little on this plate, and then try one.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:06.590
That's really good.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.340
That makes me
think of when I was a kid and having those

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.210
for breakfast with my
cosmopolitan daddy.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.380
I'm going to eat these.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.840
They're very delicious and
crunchy, and similar to hash browns, but better

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.970
for some reason.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.830
I'll see you soon.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.620
You'll see me soon.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.660
Happy Hanukah, everyone.
