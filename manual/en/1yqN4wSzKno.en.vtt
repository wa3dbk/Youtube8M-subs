00:00:18.074 --> 00:00:27.244
Ford sold Land Rover &amp; Jaguar to Tata and Aston Martin to investors.

00:00:27.244 --> 00:00:43.023
Volvo ended up with Geely from China. Now, Volvo uses their own new platform.

00:00:47.316 --> 00:00:56.109
The first car to use it is the new XC90. The old one just turned 13 years old!

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:05.086
That's not strange for Volvo. They keep it in China, we get this new one.

00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:15.883
It's still clearly a Volvo, looking at the design - yet also up to date.

00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:48.179
The wooden-leather interior looks a tad modest. Functional yet nice.

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:58.200
Controls are intuitive with this big central touch screen.

00:01:58.663 --> 00:02:06.934
Seat &amp; wheel heating, climate control, sign recognition - the lot.

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:14.199
Easy and quick. That's rare.

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:38.855
Volvo likes safety. A lot. Now we've got run-off road protection.

00:02:39.782 --> 00:02:53.497
It does indeed protect the passengers when you run off-road.

00:02:53.497 --> 00:03:09.365
Another new system prevents collisions on a junction.

00:03:09.365 --> 00:03:20.658
All meant to prevent traffic casualties in Volvo's in 2020.

00:03:45.485 --> 00:03:51.829
A V8 was the range-topper last time. Not this time.

00:03:51.829 --> 00:04:02.476
No more than 4 cilinders, regardless of the rear badging.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:10.767
All are 4WD, except for the D4. This is the D5.

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:23.968
A nice engine that propels the car well. The ride is comfy.

00:04:23.968 --> 00:04:40.819
Little noise, too. Also, it has the Gothenburg Concet Hall.

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:48.019
What matters, is that this engine is perfect for regular use.

00:04:53.503 --> 00:05:13.056
How about the T8? Well, it's a plug-in hybrid. So: tax benefits!

00:05:14.235 --> 00:05:21.203
This 4-cil has 318 PS, at the rear there's a 82 PS electric motor.

00:05:21.714 --> 00:05:28.070
Sounds great! But is it really?

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:45.610
Volvo says you can drive 40 km on electric power. We couldn't.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:55.191
But then, when both motors are working, it's really quick.

00:05:55.777 --> 00:06:04.357
0-100 kph in 6 seconds. So fluid and easy. It's all you need!

00:06:21.922 --> 00:06:29.456
One change: the lever is made out of Swedish crystal.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:46.353
It's as spacious, too. Batteries are in the center tunnel.

00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:50.306
It seats 7 people as a plug-in hybrid, too. 

00:06:50.306 --> 00:07:14.633
Seats 6 and 7 are for people up to 1m70. Nice boot, too.

00:07:15.021 --> 00:07:33.814
And this can pull up to 2200 kg's of trailer. Nicely done.

00:07:34.518 --> 00:07:39.920
This T8 makes us forget all about the V8!

00:07:45.493 --> 00:07:47.481
+ Comfortable; Intuitive controls

00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:52.097
- Just 4-cilinder sounds; T8 arrives late this year
