00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:13.120
Lexus has no fewer than 6 gas-electric hybrids
in their luxury lineup, 2 of which are SUVs

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.820
and none of them as popular as this one.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:24.420
This is the 2015 RX 450h.Back in 1998, Lexus
was at the forefront of this luxury crossover

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.060
SUV genre which has exploded since then and
continues to grow today.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.530
The RX entry point is the 350 front-wheel
drive with an MSRP of $41,720.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.290
All-wheel drive adds $1,400.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.600
But I’m spending the week with the hybrid
– distinguished by its blue-hued badging

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:53.121
and a lower case h.Under the hood is 3.5-liter
V6 – same size as in the RX 350 – but

00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:56.980
here, it’s been specifically tuned for hybrid
operation.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.649
With one electric motor for each set of wheels
fed by a nickel metal hydride battery pack,

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:09.420
total system output in 295 horsepower.When
it comes to spaciousness the 450h doesn’t

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.380
give up anything to the 350 with just right
sizing for up to 5 and their gear.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.299
But there is a price to pay for this hybrid
technology; an over $6,600 premium over the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:29.899
gas-only model.This RX 450h AWD receives a
29mpg combined rating – that’s up to 9mpg

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:30.929
better than the 350.

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:36.819
Based on the EPA’s calculations, it’s
likely you’ll save as much as $650 per year

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:42.640
at the pump – it could even be more but
the higher compression ratio on this Atkinson-cycle

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.939
V6 means it wants premium unleaded while the
350 will happily run on regular.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.909
I averaged over 27mpg which included a lot
of idle time.

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.820
And this is a hybrid that can tow – up to
3,500 pounds.There’s not much to report

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.099
on the newness front for 2015, with the exception
of these triple-split five-spoke 19” wheels

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:10.399
and the pairing of the LED headlamps with
matching LED fog lights – both part of the

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.540
optional Luxury Package.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.830
This is something you’ll want if you find
it difficult to drive at night because when

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.360
you switch to high beams they are blindingly
bright with a 180 degree spectrum – the

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.670
best I’ve ever tested.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.860
It’s like you’re driving in full sun.It’s
evident that Lexus knows their stuff when

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.390
it comes to this kind of SUV, having honed
the RX over the past 15 years, creating a

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.310
soothing, calm environment with uncomplicated,
purposeful features.The semi-aniline leather

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.950
of the Luxury Package is incredibly soft,
the cabin is quiet and clutter-free and the

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.840
ride quality is buttery smooth.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.370
The kind of vehicle I could drive all day
without any complaints; exactly what Lexus

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.900
is all about.Various driving modes include
a Sport setting which affects steering effort,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.000
throttle mapping and transmission characteristics.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.420
It also glows red in the gauge cluster, as
it takes the RX 450h from 0-to-60mph in 7.4

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.420
seconds.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.260
But accessing Sport, Eco and Snow is done
electronically through the screen and not

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.250
through a simple toggle.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:29.860
Forced EV electric operation can be used briefly.Voice
command technology in the RX is thorough but

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.860
a bit clunky.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.850
If you’re using an iPhone 4S or newer you
can also talk to it by pressing a separate

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:46.540
button to connect to Siri Eyes Free.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.090
[demo]I also wish Lexus would change this
Atari-era sound they use for audible screen

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:01.390
confirmation.Lavishly trimmed like this one,
the sticker price is $60,027.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.740
There’s little that’s cutting edge about
the RX 450h at this point in its lifecycle,

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.700
but it’s undeniably good at just about everything
it aims to accomplish – using considerably

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.470
less gas, displaying uptown style and leaving
the stress at the door.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.089
It’s also tops in its segment in dependability.
