00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.800
Check this out!

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:12.000
Yeah, SpaceX has unveiled an upgraded, passenger
version of their Dragon cargo ship which NASA

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.700
buys for re-supply runs to the International
Space Station.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.419
The unveiling of the Dragon V2 took place
at the southern California headquarters of

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.159
Space Exploration Technologies.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.920
Billionaire technology entrepreneur Elon Musk has
called the spacecraft a big leap forward in

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:39.010
technology.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.350
Conceivably, we could do the first flight
to orbit, and we'd initially do it without

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:53.070
people, at the end of next year. And then
the first flight with people in 2016 we think

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.290
is very achievable.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.760
SpaceX is just one of several private companies
competing to build so-called taxis for NASA

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.549
to replace a retired space shuttle fleet.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.160
It previously flew four cargo missions to
the space station, delivering food and supplies.

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:23.880
Since the shuttle fleet retired in 2011, NASA
has depended on Russian rockets to transport

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.700
astronauts to orbit and back, paying nearly
$71 million per seat.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.060
The space agency has said it wants US companies
to fill the void by 2011 and has given out

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.630
seed money to spur innovation.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.680
That is how a 21st Century spaceship should
land.
