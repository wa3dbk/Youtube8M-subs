My name is Minzai and I am the tofu master of Hotel Sorbenary 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.760
I am about to show you how to marinate a firm tofu

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.180
and make sure that its gonna turn out delicious for your groom

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.730
When you look at this firm tofu, you wanna give it some time

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.470
for simple and delicious recipe

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.850
Take basically a ginger paste tofu and it is gonna be a great marinate

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.810
So with some sea salt, little bit of brown sugar, a tiny bit of white pepper

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.729
and a lot of ginger. Ginger is gonna give the flavour and the acidity

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.730
and garlic peel and then

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.260
turmeric powder

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.790
what we did is plan on these together in a food processor and you get a puree like this

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.000
and when you do it, cut of your tofu

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.480
into a lump like this

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.530
and you marinate it

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.809
see, after twenty four hours, it has enough flavours

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:48.429
when you just start the grill

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.639
you can marinate therefore after a week
if you want after we basically make sure

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:56.559
that it's fully coated i just put it in a zip-lock bag and put it in the fridge

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.550
as long as i want and next we are gonna show you how to grill it

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.369
and its gonna look beautiful for your dish

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:06.229
we want a medium heat you don't want to
burn tofu here's a tofu we marinated

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:06.980
looks delicious

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.280
you wanna get some beautiful grill mark on them

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.790
don't worry if its sizzle

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.220
its okay, if you have the ginger on top you know the ginger will burn to grate that off

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.580
you know some the the most common mistakes when people grill tofu

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.510
 they think they are grilling heat

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.110
 its gonna be hard on the out-side and we don't want that

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.459
each one should be grilled in the inside and the outside

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:27.659
so dont burn it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.770
so i would cook that on an even medium heat. Umm.. don't turn it to hight and don't

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.130
leave it on too long.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.049
three minutes

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.380
uh... to have this

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.340
fully cooked mccook about men in have
twenty-five i've have these on the grill

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.040
for about thirty seconds what i'm gonna
do it is

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.680
not coming for a minute before i flip it
over

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.910
alright film with have this for about
two minutes

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.930
in the grill

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.550
but thank you for a development for a
bit over needed on for another

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.060
men and a half to two minutes on the
side and then you'll be done and what's

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.860
