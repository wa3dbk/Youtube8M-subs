00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.710
... to a better you?

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.840
To a healthier tomorrow?

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.529
To lose fifteen pounds in fifteen days?

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.980
93 shy of a 100 Grand bar?

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.040
Apparently not.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.150
7 Grand Steps is, instead, some weird kind
of mechanical board-game contraption.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.330
A mechanical contraption that just happens
to have its own burial ground, that is.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.570
I'm going to do my best to explain what the
hell's going on here, but I don't know how

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.760
well that's going to work.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.170
Suffice it to say, it's unlike anything I've
played in some time.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.989
7 Grand Steps... well, properly, "7 Grand
Steps comma Step 1 colon What Ancients Begat"

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.010
occupies some hybrid realm between a board
game like Agricola or Stone Age and a video

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.010
game.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.220
What you're doing here is basically an intro-grade
worker-placement affair: Your (usually) two

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.750
adult pawns move around this great circle
of a track, trying to collect beads to spark

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.100
scientific discoveries, heroic deeds, or that
most celebrated of ancient acts, social advancement.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.680
This is done by... um... feeding tokens into
a machine.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.970
Kinda like Candyland, your selected worker
moves to the icon on the token, possibly skipping

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.970
forward if influenced by an ally or lover.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.130
Alternately, by using the ingot at the top-left,
your worker of choice will instead slide backward

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.060
to the nearest occupied space and... um...
"make tokens."

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:51.329
Which is totally going to be my euphemism
of choice from now on.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.860
Sounds completely basic, right?

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.840
Well, buckle down, spanky, because no civilization
survives on a single generation.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.750
Nope, if you want your family to survive,
you're going to have to pound out at least

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.600
one kid, or maybe more.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.420
What can I say, when you make tokens, accidents
can (and will) happen.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.470
And these kids need to be educated, by spending
tokens on them each turn as well.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.400
The more they learn as children, the better
they'll be at... um... making tokens later

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.400
in life.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.360
Favor one child over the others, and the neglected
siblings will raise hell for 'em in later

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.010
years, occasionally smashing pots and losing
tokens.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.140
But should your family die out, either by
daring acts of rebellion or by getting eaten

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.580
by the crocodiles at the far end of the track,
you do have the opportunity to start the game

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.970
anew from the last viable sibling.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.630
And if you've been sticking to one-kid-per-family
and avoiding monogamy at all costs, this might

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.480
end up rewinding you to your great-great-great-great-granduncle.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.310
You've been warned.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.829
Presentation-wise, 7 Grand Steps is rather
spartan, swelling up bits of tribal-sounding

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.690
music when you actually do things, and then
shutting up while you're just staring at the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.260
interface, either planning your next eleven
thousand moves in detail or just admiring

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.120
the rather cool pseudo-mechanical device aesthetic,
complete with a token-dispensing trough, text-box-dispensing

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.040
slot, and other practical - if completely
impossible - mechanisms.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.750
And then, a couple hours and several generations
into the experience, the mechanics change

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.870
abruptly when you ascend to the ruling class,
vis the outermost ring of the wheel.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.229
Now it's a rather light city-management simulation,
where your goal is to accumulate official

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:37.260
offices until you end up running everything,
and declare yourself monarch.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.570
OR you can give ruling a pass and just survive
as an artisan through the copper and bronze

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.560
ages through on to the iron age.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.840
It might not be a Civilization-class time
sink, but it's almost there, which is kinda

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.000
impressive given 7 Grand Steps' more limited
scope.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.499
Besides, who doesn't enjoy makin' tokens for
hours on end?
