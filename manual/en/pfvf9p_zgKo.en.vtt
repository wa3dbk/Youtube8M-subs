00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.380
This review is really a story of two games.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.220
One game is, this...awesome action-platformer.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.990
A game that's inspired by the past, but never
bogged down by it.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.390
A game that packs a challenge, but plays so
well that it's rarely frustrating.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.680
This is the story of a great game.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.940
But it's also the story of a surprisingly
generic game.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.570
A game that seems to promise style, but never
seems to deliver.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.650
A game that's kind of boring, stylistically...and,
honestly has no idea.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.480
And here's the M. Night Shyamalan twist.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:01.130
They're both Blood Of The Werewolf, for the
Xbox 360.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:10.310
So this is a game I had really high expectations
for.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.800
It's from Midnight City, which is just an
awesome independent publisher.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.790
And it's billed as this retro-inspired platformer
with a modern edge, like Castlevania meets

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:20.880
Super Meat Boy.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.860
Come on, how can you not expect a game like
that to be awesome?

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.500
And that's half the story, right?

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.850
Because this actually is an awesome platformer.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.220
Like, the gameplay itself.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.250
It plays as great as you'd expect.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.780
But it's also a game that gets a little confusing
with its style.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.940
As someone with a particular interest in that
style...I have to say, there's where this

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.070
otherwise great game disappoints.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.670
So you play as Selena.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.670
She's a werewolf.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.439
In fact, she's one of the last werewolves.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.320
They've been hunted, and killed...and very
nearly eradicated.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.040
Actually, her own child's been taken away
from her, and that's the premise.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.979
Pissed-off werewolf lady goes ballistic and
goes to rescue her baby.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.250
Which would be fine, but...I don't know.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.310
I kind of expected classic horror.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.810
Like, I was expecting Universal...and I got
Underworld.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.730
So yeah, about that style...it's definitely
not the retro, fun, old-school horror you

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.840
might be expecting.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.760
That is, if you've read anything about this
game.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.500
Lots of talk about classic horror influences,
but...it's not really that classic.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.410
Little too serious, a little too modern...a
little too generic, to be honest.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.799
Like, aesthetically, it just looks like another
2.5 platformer.

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.610
So I mean, it's not just that I was expecting
more of a Karloff-inspired take on horror.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.830
It's also that...what is here just isn't that
special.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.130
The game's style is kind of flat, and unremarkable.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.940
Fortunately, the other half of the story's
much better.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.920
Which is to say, this is an awesome platformer.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.250
It really does combine that retro style—again,
Castlevania is the most obvious reference

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.780
here—with that...modern thing.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.880
Where people really like to make platformers
ridiculously hard.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.120
Like it's funny or something.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.060
Sorry, is this funny to you?

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.350
This is funny?

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.570
But you know, what surprised me is that...it's
not as hard as it looks.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.680
Like, this is definitely a hard platformer,
but it's not as ridiculous as some of its

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.680
peers.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.780
Which I like, it's actually a little more
accessible in that way, and a lot less frustrating.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.500
I mean, make no mistake, it takes platforming
skill to do this, but...like, I didn't get

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.510
stuck in this game.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.410
And I usually get stuck in these games.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.699
And another nice surprise is the addition
of the werewolf sections.

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:44.579
So there are parts of the levels where you
actually become a wolf, Twilight Princess-style.

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:54.400
And that really helps break things up, which
is something this game sorely needs at times.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:05.980
Of course, it doesn't completely do the trick.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.000
I mean, even with a few different modes...after
a while, it all gets very same-y.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.090
Everything kind of bleeds together.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.209
Which has as much to do with the presentation
as anything else, but the gameplay also plays

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.579
a part in that.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:27.210
The game turns into, just...collect tokens,
shoot enemies, oh, now I'm Michael J. Fox.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.120
And we're playing the Dragons in the playoffs,
or something.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.389
So it just gets kind of formulaic.

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.970
And not only that, but...the wolf parts aren't
as much fun as the regular parts.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.280
Like, something about the way it controls
feels floaty, and the whole concept feels

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.870
kind of tacked on, at times.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.550
You know, I really hope it doesn't seem like
I dislike this game.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.550
'Cause I don't.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.759
I genuinely enjoyed my time with it.

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.120
But I also expected to do more than just enjoy
it.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.759
I expected this to be great.

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.580
I got, like, half great.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.069
And there's nothing wrong with that.

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.199
This is an awesome game to check out if you're
a hardcore platformer fan.

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.250
I just thought it would offer something more
than, just...hardcore platforming.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.570
Crossbows are cool, though.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:21.209
It's Blood Of The Werewolf, for the Xbox 360.
