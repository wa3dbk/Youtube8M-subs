Hi everybody and thanks for stopping by.  I've
had my Nexus 7 tablet for a little over a week now

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.329
and so I'm just going to take a few moments today

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:18.769
and kind of give you my first impressions of
the product.

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.309
One of the things I wasn't sure about
when I purchased this tablet is how I would

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:23.070
like

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.570
the seven-inch form factor.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.339
I'd previously used a 10-inch Android tablet
and that was pretty

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.819
comfortable for web browsing - it really
worked well for that because you could

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:35.440
turn it in landscape and have a nice wide

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.340
area to view web pages

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.780
and just wasn't sure about the
seven-inch.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.540
As it turns out i like it very well. In face, I like
it better than the 10 inch

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.820
tablet I had.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.970
The main reason is smaller easier to handle.
You can easily use it in portrait mode with just

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.330
one hand it's very comfortable.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.750
I find that webpages are a little
small but these days a lot of web pages

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.730
are designed

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.520
for mobile devices and so that
makes it easier.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.910
Also many of the common websites I visit
on a daily basis such as,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.480
you know, Facebook and

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.840
and Google+ and so forth have
their own apps so I really don't have to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.860
mess of those websites anyway.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.200
A lot of other sites that I
commonly visit such as Google News

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.930
work very well on a mobile browser so

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.770
yes there are web sites that

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.509
the 7-inch is a little small

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.080
for

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.710
but all-in-all I like the 7-inch better than the
10-inch tablets.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.100
Just a couple of the applications that
come with it that I really like:

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.830
One of my favorites is Currents

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.920
and this lets you  basically
subscribe, if you will, to digital

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.010
editions

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.190
of certain magazines or

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.010
uh... you know certain 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.350
news organizations - ABC News for
example

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.189
and

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.280
what this is it actually fetches these
articles in advance

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.899
it's synchronizes when you're connected
to WiFi

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.920
and even when you're disconnected you can 
go and read anything

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.790
that is downloaded and that's pretty
valuable because obviously

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.349
I have the wifi version of the tablet
here

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.970
and I like to read the news when I'm
out and about and and not connected so

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.840
that's a really valuable application for
me and it was a something I didn't know

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.960
existed but

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.189
was a pleasant surprise when I got my
tablet.

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.139
Another application I'm fairly impressed
with is the Navigation application which

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.489
is still in beta.

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.579
I find it works pretty well - I live in, I guess, a
pretty backwoods area of 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.249
Pennsylvania and so far I've not had any trouble
with the directions this gives.

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:40.329
Now there is a drawback

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.579
by default it doesn't store any of the
maps offline and so for that reason if

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.969
you have a WiFi-only unit like I
have that is somewhat of a problem

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.989
because as soon as you leave, you lose
the map. But it does have the option of

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.909
downloading a fairly large area - just a
rectangular block of the map

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.400
and storing it offline so you can use it.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.120
It probably stores a good hour or two drive
in each direction

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.149
from where I live

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:13.039
and that, of course, isn't sufficient if you're going
on a trip.  There are

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.929
other

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:20.089
free GPS applications out there
that do have offline maps

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:24.279
but I'm guessing , or at least hopeful that
Google eventually will allow you to

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:28.899
download the entire US or a least several
states worth

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:33.659
of offline maps so you can use this
more effectively.

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.229
As far as battery life it's pretty good. I find if
I charge it

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:39.839
overnight

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:43.649
it'll give me pretty much all day of use.  Now I'm
not using it constantly - if I were it would

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:44.930
probably go dead

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.590
but I can use it a lot

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.160
throughout the day and by the end of the
day it's pretty much depleted and ready

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.719
to be charged again.

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.539
If I'm constantly watching videos, for
example, I might have to actually charge

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.990
it

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.850
before the day is over but generally, you
charged it at night and during the day

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.099
you can use it without any trouble.

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.549
One of the nice things about

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.429
Google tablets as compared to other
manufacturer's tablets is that

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:12.979
google seems to be very committed to
providing

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:17.669
operating system updates and other updates as
soon as they become available. Some

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:18.579
of the other

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.049
tablet makers you can wait a good
while before you get new versions of

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.319
Android ,for example, but Google seems
pretty good at releasing updates

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:31.180
for their own devices. That's one of the
things that led me to buy a Google device

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.749
as opposed to one

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:36.169
branded by another manufacture.

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.469
Hopefully this review has been useful if
you're looking into buying this device.

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:42.899
As always, thanks for watching, and I'll see
you next time!
