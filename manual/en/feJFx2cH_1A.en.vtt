00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.679
 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.859
oh thats a nice one there

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.919
look at the size of that

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.429
 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.220
thats a nice crappie there man

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.320
thats a big ol crappie there

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.190
i was going to say

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.760
weve got allot of cover here right up on the bank

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.860
and ive casted at it and you know it just looks to fishey

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.640
but this time of year theres got to be fish on that kind of stuff

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.090
and i casted in it oh good bye you big ol thing boy what a pretty fish

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.130
i casted at it and couldnt get them to bite and when you've got a situation like that

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.410
make sure to get up

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.950
and vertical jig them take your long rod and dabble and dip around those things

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.640
and sometimes that slower presentation is exactly what it takes to get those fish

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.640
that was a good female

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.770
oh come here you

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.770
man i just love springtime crappy

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.170
another little female

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.570
those males turn so

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.920
pretty such a pretty color black

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.020
right now

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.189
there is nothing

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:55.189
nothing special about what we're doing

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:12.359
god look at him pull

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.539
thats a decent male

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:17.629
boy they sure do get pretty dark colors

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:24.629
when they are ready to spawn

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:30.379
thank you young man

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.859
okay

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.669
you know another thing

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:38.099
you know working toward any kind of
cover from the deep side on up

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.409
lay downs are another great place
to do that

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.559
uh... a lot of people make mistake when
they see a lay down to cast up onto the

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:49.009
shallow side and you'll probably catch
fish there but when you do

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.839
when you big those fish off the shallow side you may spook fish that were down deeper

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.119
so start off working the deep side of the lake

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.379
and if you catch any just work your way up that way you will catch the most fish you can off of that

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:06.379
lay down without spooken those fish

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.669
this is just a great little spot right
here

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.059
this is a turn in the creek channel

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:23.569
and there's brush that you cant see all
washed up here

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.609
 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.260
that hit hard oh he got off

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.959
bout lost my rod

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.330
that hit hard

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.969
that took the rod right out of my hands

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:46.799
 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.099
 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.459
there disagreeing about something it looks like

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:59.459
 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.629
oh man he hit it hard thats a decent one

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.689
 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.269
but these turns are a great place to

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.899
group up fish

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:13.089
you never know

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:16.320
a lot of times now this is the outside
bend that i caught that one

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.290
allot of times on the inside bend

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.030
the inside bend of a creek channel is going to be the flat side

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.259
 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:27.379
the inside bend always silts in so its shallower on the inside part

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:30.349
and theres times though when there up on the flats thats the place to fish

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.729
but were fishing the outside bend the outside bend is usually a little bit deeper

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.300
but the neat things about those bends

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.020
when theres any current it brings washes in logs and debris

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.399
and uh... all kinds of cover

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:47.679
and uh... that's what the track
attracts those fish

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:53.639
these bends are such a good place to check out

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.949
oh man theres one

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.029
thats a good one

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:04.919
right of that lip

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.139
come here you

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.680
 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.190
thats got some weight underneath it

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.710
 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:19.710
nice crappie

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:27.939
pretty fish

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:30.679
boy i tell ya i just love these creeks

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:32.870
as good as these creeks can be

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.560
you know weather

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.520
can really affect these creeks say one other thing about the weather

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.210
if you get any rain

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.090
the rain you get a good heavy
thunderstorm

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.789
that brings a lot of watered down into
these creeks

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.919
and it just absolutely ruin the fishing

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.580
and any current or mud that comes in through here and its just death to these fish

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.320
so pay attention to that if its after a good hard rain you might as well

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.539
not fish these creeks your better off going into the lake to fish

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.349
but on the other hand just doesn't take
very long for these creeks to clear up

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:05.939
either once that current is stopped

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:09.839
usually just to three days after their
current stopped in the water will start to

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:10.850
clear up

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.639
and it always clears up from the back
end of the creek to the front

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.759
you come into these creeks and you run into that muddy water and you think man that water is to muddy to

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:18.610
fish

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.280
and it might be there but allot of times you go up above it

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:29.280
then you will find some clear water that could be active

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:46.430
 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.909
man that hit hard

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:54.079
man these things are just so aggressive

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:58.069
 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:00.190
early spring crappie

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.779
clinton lake

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:04.169
lot of fun

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:11.169
we've got to take a quick break but we will be right back with ya

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.720
see ya
