00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.060
Your bathroom. It's one of the first
places you see in the morning and one of

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.250
the last places you see before going to
bed. You use it each day for little

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.770
rituals and routines before you set out
for your next whatever it is that you're

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.730
doing, and the important thing with your
bathroom is you want it to feel fresh and

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.960
clean so that you can feel fresh and
clean. The challenge is how do you keep it

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.080
clean on a daily basis given all the
things that go on in there? And I know

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.230
many of you have been asking me for a
bathroom cleaning routine. So what I'm

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.450
going to do is walk you through some very
easy things you can do on a daily basis

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.730
which will not only help it feel like a
fresh, clean, and serene space but will

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.580
also help make your weekly or bi-weekly or
whatever frequency you choose to clean

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.790
your bathroom routine a lot easier. Okay,
let's get to it.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.210
Each day after you take a shower, remember
to squeegee your tiles, your tub, and your

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.270
glass shower doors. This helps prevent
soap scum, mildew, and hard water stains

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.880
from building up on those surfaces. You
can also use a daily shower spray but I

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.290
think the results of a squeegee are a lot
better. It is so easy to do and anybody in

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.740
the family can do it. You can use a
disposable wipe or you can keep a spray

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.090
bottle and microfiber cloth under your
bathroom sink and each night before you go

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.260
to bed you can just clean off any of those
little toothpaste splatters on the mirror

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.830
and you can also give your countertop and
your sink a quick wipe down. You can shine

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.070
those faucets. You can get rid of any of
that hair or debris that's living on your

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.680
counter and then you can toss that
disposable wipe or you can rinse off your

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.740
cloth and hang it to dry. If you want the
freshest toilet on the block, there's

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.390
something really simple you can do. Just
take a couple tablespoons of baking

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.000
soda. You can even keep a little box under
your bathroom sink, sprinkle it in the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.710
toilet before you go to bed, let it just
do its thing. And when you wake up in the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.300
morning give your toilet a quick flush or
if you notice any rings building up, get

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.060
your toilet bowl brush and give it like a
10 second scrub, flush it, and move on

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.750
with your day.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.180
Bathroom counter real estate is a real
challenge. So my rule is to just keep face

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.250
care and oral care products on there.
Everything else can either go under the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.350
bathroom sink or in a small basket off to
the side or on a shelf. You want to keep

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.520
that counter looking nice and clean. The
items that are on the counter, you can

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.490
line those up quickly parallel and
perpendicular or group them together or

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.310
like our friend Nate Berkus would tell us
to put it on a nice little tray and create

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.430
a little bathroom vignette. Whatever you
have to do to make that counter look good,

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.790
you want to do it. Do a super speedy,
quick, cursory tidy of the bathroom, pick

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.450
up any clothes or anything that's lying
around on the floor, throw anything in the

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.810
laundry that needs to go on the laundry.
Basically, your bathroom is not a big

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.030
place, it will not take you longer than
one minute, but that quick little tidy is

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.430
going to make all the difference. Finish
the task off by closing your shower

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.330
curtain, straightening up your towels,
making sure everything looks neat and

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.340
tidy, fixing up those rugs, and basically
just making your bathroom look appropriate

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:01.290
for a guest to pop their head in.
I'm going to try and be poetic here for a

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.010
second. Bathrooms are like snowflakes.
They're all a little bit different but

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.190
they all kind of do the same thing. So the
routine that I gave you, if it works for

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.200
you, great. If it doesn't and you need
something that I didn't mention or if

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.860
something that I mentioned doesn't quite
make sense for your bathroom, just adjust

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.420
it accordingly. The important part here is
finding something that works for you and

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.830
something that you can stick to each day
because consistency is what's going to get

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.090
you that clean space. Also remember, you
don't have to be perfect at it, you just

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.410
got to do it. And, by the way, you don't
have to spend minutes upon minutes upon

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.350
minutes, you have better things to do.
This will only take you like max five

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.730
minutes, I promise. And as you become more
efficient at it you'll see you can get it

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.960
done a lot quicker. But trust me, when you
walk into that clean bathroom you're going

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.340
to crave it being clean all the time and
this routine is going to sit a lot easier

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.970
with you.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.360
I already hear the comments in your head
for me. "Melissa, I live with somebody

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.830
else. They never keep the bathroom clean.
I'm going to have to be the one to do it."

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.700
Okay, guys, here's what we're going to do.
In that situation you have two options.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.540
Your first option is you can talk to the
person you share the bathroom with. You

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.620
could see if they're into this routine
idea and then you guys can kind of divide

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.780
up the labor. So if you like doing toilets
and counters, you do that. And if the

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.440
other person likes doing straightening up
and tidying up, have them do that. Find

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.480
what works for the both of you or all of
you, however many of you share the

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.300
bathroom. Now, if nobody else is going to
buy into this routine aside from you,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.660
guess what? You're doing it, and the
reason you're doing it is because you love

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.690
a clean bathroom and you feel good in a
clean bathroom. Forget about the other

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.470
people here. This is not about them, this
is about you feeling great in your space.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.180
Trust me, I know how that feels guys, but
it really does makes sense to do something

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.720
good, important, and special for
yourselves and this routine isn't going to

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.260
be too much sweat off your back.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.770
I've got all of this routine business
laid out for you on our blog,

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.290

to do with a thorough bathroom cleaning
routine, so something you can start with
