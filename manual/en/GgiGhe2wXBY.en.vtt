00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:07.310
These days we are seeing lot of developments in UAVs, i-e Drones. Various kinds of drones

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.179
including the drones used for taking aerial
photography are being introduced to the market

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.150
continuously. But, the biggest physical constraint on small

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:24.280
drones is their power supply. As of now Batteries can hold little energy only. And if we add

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.039
more batteries to a drone, it will increase
the weight of that drone, which will further

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.789
increase the demand for energy to fly.
Currently a typical drone can only fly for

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.789
a maximum of around 25 minutes per battery charge.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:46.699
A new drone concept by a Singapore company Horizon Unmanned Systems (HUS) seeks to overcome

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.370
that limitation, by turning to an alternative
power source: hydrogen fuel cells.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.339
Known as the Hycopter, the fuel cell-powered drone is hoped to be capable of 4-hour flight

00:00:58.339 --> 00:00:59.879
times once completed.

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.180
In a clever design feature, the Hycopter stores 120 g of hydrogen gas in its existing structural

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.110
tubing without requiring any additional containers. According to Horizon, that amount of hydrogen

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.350
should provide the same amount of energy as 3 kg of lithium batteries.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.910
The hydrogen gas is converted into electricity by a lightweight lithium polymer hybrid fuel

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:35.090
cell. Altogether, the complete drone should
weigh a total of 5 kg , and be capable of

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.120
carrying a payload of up to 1 kg

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.580
Hydrogen fuel cells work by reacting hydrogen with oxygen.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.880
HYCOPTER is the worldâ€™s first hydrogen fuel cell powered multi-rotor UAV. HYCOPTER is

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.640
being readied for a record flight endurance
of 4 hours, or 8 to 10 times the average flight

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.400
duration of equivalent systems today.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.730
Unlike any other rotorcraft, HYCOPTER makes use of its frame structure to store energy

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.570
in the form of hydrogen, eliminating energy
storage weight.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.860
Because of this new technology, Aerial survey jobs will become materially cheaper and faster.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.310
And drone delivery over longer distances will become more feasible.
