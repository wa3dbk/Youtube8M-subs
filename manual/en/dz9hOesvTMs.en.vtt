00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:00.720
Hi.

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.730
My name's Caroline Barnes, and
I'm a celebrity makeup artist.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.090
In our 20s, we just use cosmetics
as an expression of ourselves

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.280
and enjoy color and fashion and trends.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.450
But it's not until we get to our
30s that we start taking a closer

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.960
look at our face and start
seeing very fine lines appearing,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.380
maybe the texture of our skin
getting a little bit drier.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.930
The current trend is for
hardworking two-in-one products.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.550
And so today I'm here
with the lovely Jocette.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.650
Really, it's key now to have
these multi-purpose products.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.040
They give us great skin.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.230
You've got the SPF 15, which gives
you protection against the sun,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.140
and it also contains these lovely
pigments, which diffuse the light.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.530
So it diminishes any
fine lines and wrinkles.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.170
It's just less for us to do.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.395
It's really, really working for women
and what they need for their skin

00:00:44.395 --> 00:00:45.610
at certain times.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.980
Now I'm going to show you how to create
a really flawless complexion using

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.400
Max Factor's Ageless Elixir
two-in-one foundation and serum.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.690
I prefer as a professional makeup
artist to use two colors, the lighter

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.180
color around the t-zone
of the face and a warmer

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.360
color that matches the neck and chest
on the outside and forehead of the face.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.505
Just start literally around the
eyes and just around your nose.

00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:09.900
Just a little bit underneath your chin.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.250
We're then going to take a darker color,
and just blend it very, very lightly

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.098
into your skin.

00:01:14.098 --> 00:01:18.030
Foundation will last a little bit
longer if you just keep updating it.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.500
Just take a little bit of
translucent powder with you,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.360
and just keep a very,
very small brush, dusting

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.760
around your t-zone to make sure those
natural oils don't break through.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.409
Now we have our foundation base
and add a little bit of color

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.117
to the apples of the cheeks and
sweeping up towards the hairline.

00:01:33.117 --> 00:01:35.979
Mascara.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.320
To finish off our really
simple effortless work,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.253
I'm going to a really
strong statement lip.

00:01:41.253 --> 00:01:42.696
Pick a darker color.

00:01:42.696 --> 00:01:46.980
Go from the inside of the
lips, and spread the color out.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.970
The trends for this season
are very strong statement lips

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.675
balanced with a complexion that's
just slightly a little bit more dewy.

00:01:54.675 --> 00:01:56.690
I'm not going for that
matte heavy finish.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.800
It gives a freshness against the
bold statement color of the lips.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.450
