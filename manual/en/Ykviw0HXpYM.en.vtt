wife's

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.299
log akin continue on the republican
theme really

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.550
briefly so Sam has been talking a lot
about how this whole nomer

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.950
that this whole notion that there's this
big argument between the serious

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:16.920
business

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.369
republicans and and a tea party
Republicans in the

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.760
been on the wall street boys the money
boys are gonna sit down and they're

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.410
gonna start

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.769
are mounting non crazy candidates in
primaries and there's a real fault line

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.360
opening up the Republican Party well

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.360
first the mall at least

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.610
the people saying that are kind and
implicitly acknowledging that there's no

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.770
such thing as a moderate Republican left

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.829
okayed like years alter right-wing
Republicans who happens not be

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.890
absolutely insane understand some basic
principles a macro finance center able

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.559
to like

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.699
shake Barack Obama's hand without
thinking it will make them gay

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.370
okay there those republicans they're all
true conservative

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.239
and then there is Ted Cruz Michele
Bachmann Sarah Palin

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.030
just demented insanity

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.260
I so at least for acknowledging there's
no such thing as moderates everything

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.080
we're talking about here

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.900
ultra-right wing and you know what
because the role to right-wing

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.970
their isn't relieved had become a
conflict here

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.430
and as Alec I the Kilis

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.150
mcgillis our reports in the Republic
he's talking about a new

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.280
I information on on contributions from

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.229
business groups Tea Party candidates and
first he makes is very important point

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.210
and actually the there there's two can
connect the points 1 was also raised by

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.640
Michael into writing slot Michael and
said

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.170
all these right-wing Republicans a
pro-business

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.170
antique popular ENT workers rights
anti-environment

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.469
and the difference in some cases being
that with some these Tea Party guys

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.229
they're more likely to represent

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.450
ot like the interest more pure leave
somebody like

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.329
the Koch brothers or regional business
magnets

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.509
or people like that so it's still
business and corporate interest that

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.239
might not be is exclusively Wall Street
is almost them

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.510
all than take money from Wall Street as
well wanna get ready then ran into

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.709
financial regulations

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.800
but some the dividing line with doing
something like the debt ceiling is just

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.370
a different

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.800
it's just the difference how much a
corporate special interests

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.840
is going to be a affected by given
policy in OK scissors actually a

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.680
rejection of corporate special interests

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.290
mcgillis points out the new republic he
says

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.750
does quote McGill's ever since a tea
party Republicans arrived on the scene

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.700
washed and I've cast a wary eye

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.890
the notion of them is grass roots and
surgeons disconnected from the party is

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.680
big business and Wall Street base

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.989
hack when I went looking for a tea party
Tribune

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.980
red Congressman Tom graves a Georgian
the night at the August 11th so to

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.420
resolve that summer's debt-ceiling
showdown

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.129
I found him at a fundraiser at in AT&amp;T's
box at National Stadium

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.879
no surprise there now there's a Ryann
goes on to quote a recent report

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.010
that was a revealed in today's %uh

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.230
in the washington post with the help of
the center for

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.700
response APOEL tix they talk about some
new campaign contributions

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.900
a given to to tea party leaders and
Republican candidates

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.370
the American Bankers Association game
more money over the last two election

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.930
cycles

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.950
GOP lawmakers who in effect voted to
allow the United States to default on

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:31.629
its debt

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.750
are rather than those who voted against
that scenario

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.530
ABA contributed 2.2 million dollars to
lawmakers who ultimately

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.900
more the group warnings second only to
the Club for Growth

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.330
just ahead of Koch Industries both of
which are leading sources of funds for

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.470
conservative candidates

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.790
at financial services firms including
hedge funds

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.709
and major banks a major banks
contributions sold more than 26 million

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.450
dollars over the last two cycles the
Republican lawmakers

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.209
who voted against the deal to reopen the
government

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.620
and of course let's get specifically it
a cruise senator Ted Cruz

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.189
whose 21 hour for speech blah blah blah
I helped spark

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.129
the shutdown I'm I can especially when
he said that exactly well with more

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.670
movie references

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.410
blah blah blah field operations blah
blah blah doctor seuss

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.759
blah blah blah in eggs and ham green
eggs and ham he took

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.250
I 700 the

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.740
I N 86 a thousand I 157

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.840
financial services companies I he

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.389
more than the amount he received from
the club growth and of course his wife

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.970
works at Goldman Sachs and his health
plan comes to Goldman Sachs

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.540
and you know the the kind of closing
point here these numbers will come as a

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.580
surprise to me was through the show

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.180
but the point is to is that these guys
campaign done this

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.259
when they were getting all these monies
from from the supposedly responsible

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:54.169
actors

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.880
they campaigned were gonna hold the
government hostage

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.360
were gonna wage radical
anti-constitutional

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.199
effort to repeal established law that's
what the campaign that

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.190
and the reason that hedge funds and Wall
Street all the other special interest

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.500
keep delivery money because at the end
that they were the most concerned about

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.820
getting rid of government regulation
everything allowing themselves to have

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.479
to strip away the last tiny

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.820
remnants of accountability that is still
held over them

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.729
they want they're all gone the Tea Party
shares the same agenda

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.910
and fundamentally it's the same thing
its

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.320
the point 00 all 1 percent party

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.340
and everything is just a variation of
craziness

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.960
and varying levels I love well I don't
hate gay people

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.320
I don't really mind abortion but
fundamentally don't touch my money

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.039
or don't or better yet don't disrupt my
ability to take

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.699
your money which is much more accurately
this how to describe it

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.389
and other people who think that shaking
hands Brock Obama

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:02.889
will make them gay that's it there's no
other distinction besides that

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.610
I see can get a bad impression with that
one

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.930
a look a

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.949
its common mytouch but some members of
the

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.600
a Republican caucus think that shaking
hands with them

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.590
at a posh against them will make the
bisexual

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.729
walk look a true up

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.750
this is true I'm a very good looking man
I'm a good-looking map

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.990
and you will have a taste buds more
specific than

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.190
you will want the

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.539
to date me specifically and I think that
that's

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:44.840
a part of the reason that you're seeing
such an intense

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.050
a backlash %uh to me personally

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.099
you look at a cruise and you know what
