00:00:00.892 --> 00:00:02.680
Hello everyone.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.422
Welcome to another Sunday
morning doing hair.

00:00:05.422 --> 00:00:07.380
So the hairstyle this
morning we're going to do

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.430
is called forward
twistback into a bun.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.720
It's a really great hairstyle.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.150
It's good for teens, tweens-- I
think even adult women can wear

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.544
to the office-- prom hairstyle.

00:00:17.544 --> 00:00:19.460
You could maybe even
pull it off for a wedding

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.950
if you did it really fancy.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.640
So here we go.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.290
We are going to
start-- I've already

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.420
started by parting a middle
section on the top of her head,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.490
just kind of a square
section of hair,

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.070
and I'm going to have her hang
onto this for me for a second.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.880
Keep it out of the way.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.335
And with the rest of the hair,
I choose to wet it down simply

00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:44.310
to keep flyaways under control.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.010
You don't have to wet it down.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.570
You can do it dry.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.215
I'm going to just comb
it back into a ponytail.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.480
Standard ponytail.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.852
When you've got it
so that it's nice,

00:01:04.852 --> 00:01:06.060
secure it with a rubber band.

00:01:14.475 --> 00:01:16.455
Now I'm going to
brush out the ends

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:25.013
so they're nice and
smooth, and twist it,

00:01:25.013 --> 00:01:28.750
and I'm going to wrap
it around the ponytail

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.710
to form a nice bun.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.540
And then, I choose
to use a rubber band.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.270
You can use bobby pins.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.270
For me, since she's
younger, I think

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.030
that it's just easier to help
hold it in with a rubber band.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.042
So now you have a nice bun.

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:46.886
With the front
part of the hair--

00:01:46.886 --> 00:01:50.490
I'm going to brush
this out again--

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.050
and I'm going to comb it to
the left side of her head.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.270
You can do wither way, but I'm
going to choose to go to left.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.473
Just water again.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.425
[? I ?] just kind of have these
flyaways combed under control.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.390
OK, now I'm just going to
pick up a section of hair

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.640
and begin to twist it, and kind
of twist in the other hair as I

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.860
go.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.650
Just loose, not
too tight, until I

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.635
have all the hair in the twist.

00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:38.260
I don't like the way
that one's looking

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.530
so I'm going to do it again.

00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:49.620
That's better.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:03:01.256
And twist it all the way down
till you have it all twisted.

00:03:01.256 --> 00:03:05.760
Now I'm going to take it and
wrap it up above the bun,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.410
and cross it over, and then
wrap it back down under the bun,

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.610
and then I'm going to secure
it with another elastic

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.834
to hold that end in as well.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.580
OK, and there you go.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.475
We looked on a website
the other day--

00:03:26.475 --> 00:03:30.630
you can add a little hairspray--
and it said that for 2011 the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.050
in hairstyle is twists,
so the good thing

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.342
is we have lots of twists
on our hair videos.

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:38.120
And there you go.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.290
You have this fun
twist with a little bit

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.160
of an accent twist over the top.
