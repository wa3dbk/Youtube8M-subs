00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
do become a reality if you try hard enough now our

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.540
next story is really going to make you ask the question

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.320
how did a woman entrepreneur do all this. She started way back in the eighties 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.010
into the male-dominated business played the game amongst

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.129
huge MNC's &amp; PSU's yet had to run home

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.820
and business at the same time and still
she managed to turn her business

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.720
into a petro products independent giant.This story

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.100
had just curious as well as impressed.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.000
Siddharth Petro Products is one of the leading Grease

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and Oil manufacturers in India they were among the first

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.739
few players to enter this sector.My husband he was into

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.000
Oils and Lubes he used to give me the feedback about

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.200
the greases that there is a lot of market so we thought of 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.100
putting up the plant.He motivated me that i will be in 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.700
your support but i cann't leave my job.I wanted to prove 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.300
that ladies girls can do wonders in life if they want to do 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.200
seriously so i took it as a challenge and I put up the 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.300
industry in 1988.It was not easy for a lady to get the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.500
licenses and quotas and i wanted to bring a quality 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.300
greases which will be known in the market I wanted to 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.900
supply to big companies not in the local market that was

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.200
my first aim. Ritu Sachdeva's unique ability to balance 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.500
work and family life was a contributing factor to her

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.000
success.I was treated differently in every aspects

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.500
because whenever i used to go to attend the  

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.200
conferences and all there was hardly any lady in this

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:05.390
profession but I used to enjoy sitting with them learning from them and sometime my husband used to accompany me.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.300
Being an engineer and my wife being a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.600
Chemistry student we always thought of putting up a 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.700
Grease unit. I prompted her to come up come forward 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.900
show her entrpreneurship and put up an industry so that

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.090
we can serve India with better quality products

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.900
any it paid off the success story lies in the balance

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.020
which she trove over last 25 years in bringing up the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.280
family at home as well as treating the whole

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.569
staff here as a family.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.400
First last 25 years I'm so happy that at least 25-30

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.500
people who are with me when i started the industry

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.260
they are with me so i treat them as my children

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.000
as I am growing I see them growing and i feel very

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.129
happy.We are constantly developing newer kind of

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.900
products, food grade products, transparent greases and

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.700
those are in fact picked up by the biggest brands in the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.430
world so innovation has to happen.Do you know

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.800
lot of people get a lot of ideas but at the end of the day

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.800
if the execution is not perfect the iPhone was not the

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.260
first touch screen phone that was launched Google

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.670
 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.800
is not the first data interface its all about how well you

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.700
execute and hats off to my mother for executing the

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.670
idea that she conceived back in the nineteen eighties

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.800
I have seen her struggle way too much but again what

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.800
needs to be appreciated is that she's had a wonderful

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.700
balance between her professional life and her personal

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.000
life.One thing that i clearly remember about my parents 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.300
that they always come back home with a smile and I 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.400
think that's the secret for their success. As modern 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.989
lndian women have come to for in the work place

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.400
Ritu Sachdeva has taken it upon herself to pass the

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.370
 baton to the next generation of women.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.290
Today when i see reaching at this stage

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.560
I think i am the motivation for my coming generation

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.860
and my daughter in law after listening my story

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.310
she is putting in full effort to take over

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.800
this business as a challenging women again as I used

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.340
to do it.It's such apleasure to be with her every day and

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.000
the way she teaches me with so much

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.400
patience. I am truly blessed by the confidence that she

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.659
has had me in such a short amount of time.

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.300
