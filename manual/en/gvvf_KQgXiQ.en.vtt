00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:04.270
Mr. Earnest: Welcome to
the West Wing Week,

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.206
you're guide to everything
that's happening at 1600

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.510

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.381
with the First Lady --

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:15.181
The President:
What's going on here?

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:16.349
Mr. Earnest: -- sat down for
a heart-to-heart with

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.584
a White House mentee --

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.018
Noah McQueen: I
love Lucky Charms.

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:19.819
The President: Man --

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:20.854
Noah McQueen: I
love Lucky Charms.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:21.955
Mr. Earnest: -- helped an
immigration town hall

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.056
in south Florida --

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.057
The President: Thank
you, Jose, that was fun.

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:25.291
Mr. Earnest: -- and honored
Black History Month

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.226
at the White House.

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:29.963
That's February 20th to the 26th,
or, "Where Are My Hawaiians?"

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:30.897
The President: Where
are the Hawaiians?

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:31.731
Mr. Earnest: Kicking
off the week with

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.500
an important anniversary,
the President

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.368
and First Lady had some
fun filming a sketch

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.670
to promote the fifth
anniversary of Let's Move --

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.671
The President:
This is not hard.

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:39.606
Mr. Earnest: -- with the
First Lady launching

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:41.808
a campaign encouraging
people to "Gimme Five."

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:43.042
Mrs. Obama: -- and pass on the
challenge to someone else.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:44.244
The President: Wait,
we're still filming?

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:45.078
Mrs. Obama: Uh, yeah.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.846
You've got to me
on it my friend.

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.748
Mr. Earnest: Then the
President sat down with for

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:50.817
a heart-to-heart with Noah
McQueen, a White House mentee,

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.152
who has benefitted
from the President's

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:53.653
My Brother's
Keeper initiative.

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:55.021
The President: -- what I want
to focus on is making sure that

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:59.292
when somebody comes to that
moment where they're ready

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:02.495
to see another possibility
for their life.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:06.699
That there's somebody
there to help them along.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:07.534
Noah McQueen:
That's this program.

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.002
The President: Yeah, well,
that's what My Brother's Keeper

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:09.803
is all about.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.504
Mr. Earnest: The interview was
facilitated by the folks from

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:13.807
StoryCorps who have been
gathering oral histories

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:15.074
from across America.

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:15.742
The President: This is great.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:16.309
This will be fun.

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:18.077
Mr. Earnest: That afternoon, the
First Lady welcomed Civil Rights

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:20.313
leaders for a panel in
the East Room celebrating

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:22.415
the women of the Civil
Rights Movement.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.150
The President kicked off the
work week with the National

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.454
Governors Association comprised
of Democratic and Republican

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:29.255
governors from
across the country.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.191
Later, the President took an
important step to implement

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.760
the Conflict of Interest Rule,
which protects consumers

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.796
against hefty fees associated
with their retirement accounts.

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:37.664
The President: So
today I'm calling

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:40.467
on the Department of
Labor to update the rules

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:43.303
and requirements that
retirement advisors put

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:46.306
the best interests of
their clients above

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:47.807
their own financial
interests.

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:49.042
It's a very
simple principle.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:50.410
You want to give
financial advice,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.278
you've got to put your
client's interests first.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:53.813
You can't have a
conflict of interest.

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:55.682
Mr. Earnest: Tuesday was a
busy day in the Oval Office.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:58.084
The President's first guest
was the emir of Qatar,

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.752
His Highness Sheikh Tamim.

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:01.821
Then the President and Vice
President teamed up with rank

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:04.023
and file law enforcement
officials to discuss how

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:06.993
to build trust in communities
to strengthen public safety.

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:08.728
Then the President met
with a bipartisan group

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:10.663
of 16 senators and
House members --

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:11.297
The President: Leahy.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:13.533
Mr. Earnest: -- to discuss
criminal justice reform.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:14.334
Back at the Oval Office --

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:15.068
The President:
Come on, Hawaiians.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.503
Mr. Earnest: -- The President
designated the Honouliuli

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.571
National Monument,
permanently protecting

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.573
a site where
Japanese-Americans citizens

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:22.542
were held captive
during World War II.

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:24.143
The President: It is wonderful
for us to be able to preserve

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:27.347
this history and make sure
that we teach our children.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.115
Mr. Earnest: Kicking off
Wednesday's day of action around

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:31.885
immigration, advocacy leaders
updated the President on their

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:34.320
outreach efforts to educate
the immigrant community

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.989
on the President's
executive actions.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.957
Then, escaping the bitter
cold, the President was

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:39.425
off to tropical Miami.

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:42.595
He answered questions at a town
hall hosted by Telemundo --

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:43.530
The President:
Jose, how did I do?

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.964
Jose Diaz-Balart: (speaks
foreign language)

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:46.633
Mr. Earnest: -- and jumped in
as the surprise host

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:49.335
for Jose Diaz-Balart's
"5 Things" series.

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:52.372
The President: We've
expanded my authorities

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:56.209
under executive action as
far as we can legally.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.580
So now the question is how
can we get a law passed?

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.083
Now, that's heartbreaking
because it means that not

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:08.087
everybody is immediately helped
but the fact of the matter

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:11.190
is that until that law is
changed, what we have

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.628
to do is prioritize under
the existing law and what

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:18.665
we then have to do is try to
get this legal case resolved.

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:20.266
Mr. Earnest: On Thursday
the President hosted

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.702
African-American faith and Civil
Rights leaders for a sit-down

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.071
discussion, then held a live
from the White House round

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:27.307
robin of back-to-back
interviews from local

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:29.142
television anchors from
across the country.

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:31.945
Then as Black History Month
February came to a close,

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:34.447
the President and First Lady
hosted a reception to celebrate.

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:36.316
The President: We don't set
aside this month each year

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:40.486
to isolate or segregate or put
under a glass case Black

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:43.890
history, we set it aside to
illuminate those threads,

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.026
those living threads
African-Americans have woven

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:49.095
into the tight tapestry of this
nation making it stronger,

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:53.866
and more beautiful, and more
just, and more free.

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.935
Mr. Earnest: So stay engaged
with us online, on social media,

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:58.638
and remember, you can find
out more information

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:00.840
about any of these topics
and see complete videos

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.442
of these events at
whitehouse.gov.

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:03.977
Thanks again for checking
out this addition

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:05.445
of your West Wing Week.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:08.014
(applause)

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:09.115
The President: That guy
-- don't get carried away.

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:11.417
(laughter)

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:15.154
Mrs. Obama: He can
get carried away.

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:15.955
The President: I don't know --

00:04:15.955 --> 00:04:16.856
(laughter)
