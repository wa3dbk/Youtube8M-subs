00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.580
In this video, I'm going to show you how to
avoid mis-hitting the ball.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.959
This is a big thing I see a lot of recreational
players, they don't understand why they're

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:07.959
mis-hitting the ball.

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:13.180
One of the, I would say, the two biggest causes
of mis-hitting the ball is, one, when you're

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.469
hitting, you're moving your head.

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.970
By moving your head, it's going to take the
racket off the ball.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.180
Two, is by coming off the ball with your body,
so you're not finishing the stroke.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.430
You're setting up here, and then you're actually
in a recovery as you're hitting the ball,

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.869
and you're pulling off the ball.

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.350
I'll give you the two examples.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.060
If I'm moving my head, it should look like
this ... and I move my head.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.070
That's a great way to mis-hit a ball.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.800
The other one is coming off the ball like
this.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.550
As you can see, I mis-hit the ball.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.890
Now, the first one, for fixing moving the
head, is keeping your head down after the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.300
ball's hit.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.470
Don't hit and look up immediately.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.700
Keep your head down, finish, and then look
up.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.530
It should look like this.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.300
I'm keeping my head down through the stroke.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.290
You see pros like Roger Federer do this.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.720
They're constantly hitting the ball, staying
, and then looking up.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.350
The other fix is to make sure you stay with
the ball longer.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.480
I'm going to demo this first.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.480
I'm going to move out.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.250
I'm going to make sure when I hit, I'm going
to stay on this outside leg, and then recover,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.450
instead of coming back and doing the recovery
too soon.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:31.750
I'm going to go out, I'm going to stay on
my outside leg ... outside leg.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.820
Compared to if I were to go out and try to
recover, I'm going to get a mis-hit.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.090
I can almost make a mis-hit happen every time,
because I'm pulling back.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.080
Make sure we stay out, on the outside leg,
and that'll take away those mis-hits.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.590
Make sure we're keeping our head down and
still, and we're staying on the outside leg,

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.390
staying with the ball, so we don't have any
more mis-hits.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.060
