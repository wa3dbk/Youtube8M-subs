Howie: A Kiwi Banana Smoothie with an extra ginger punch.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.779
which makes it really fun to drink. It's done in only 3 minutes.

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.019
High in potassium, high in fibre. A really good way to start a day.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.100
My favorite form of cooking definitely is making smoothies.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.600
And we found a new one! The Kiwi Banana Smoothie with a good punch of ginger.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.300
Let's make it right now!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.400
Preferably with a bit of ice because it's just too hot.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.090
Now this is what you need for two big servings.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.400
It's 2 Bananas, 3 Kiwis, 2 Yogurts or 200 grams more or less.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.900
Then 4 tablespoons of oats, 200 ml of soy milk or you can just use normal milk.Whatever you prefer!

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.170
Then, let's say half a centimeter or a centimeter of ginger.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.270
I preferred using centimeter. And then
depending on the fruits if they are

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.900
sweet or not so sweet yet, you can add about 2 to 3 teaspoons of honey.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.900
I won't because I'm no such a sweet guy.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.990
Ummm...Instructions are simple, just put everything into the blender and blend it.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.350
Okay! Let's start with the two bananas.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.390
Lovely

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:26.900
Now scoop out the kiwi like this. You can just cut it in half and then use a tablespoon to scoop it. Very simple, very easy!

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.180
Now let's add the Soy milk.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.600
And the oats. Perfect!

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.500
Now the natural yogurt.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.900
And then last but not least 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.100
Grate in some ginger.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.720
I like it spicy so I would grate in lots.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.500
And because of the recipe, I will add 1 tablespoon of Honey.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.300
Even though I wouldn't normally. And as mentioned, let me add 2 Ice cubes.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.400
I am not sure if my blender will survive this or not.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.500
All right!!!!

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.900
That's it!

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.760
Lid on top and blend.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.600
Lid on top and blend.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.960
That looks good!

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.920
And everything you have to do is to try.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.600
Really tasty this one.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.200
Especially the ginger gives it a really interesting extra punch.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.380
Definitely worth trying!

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.200
