00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.139
It's the engine bay of the estart before that we had removed the engine and rebuilt

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.269
What happened here was the engine overheated and

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.189
it pushed water with oil into the

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.309
Heater core and this is 14 meter cord lines are but you can see

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.649
There is a oil and water that's mixed in this on both side you can see them

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:46.558
We are going to replace this out heater core hoses also the inlet and outlet of this

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.699
And this is the reason why jack is?

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.660
replacing the heater core of this vehicle

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.489
Because it's full of junk and you know like

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.690
gonca

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.580
Squirted out into the windshield of this vehicle

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.540
Always found in srt course, and this is like probably like

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.570
The 14th or 15th engine that we had rebuilt we noticed something very peculiar about this engine

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.240
number one is

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.509
The exhaust manifold where the turbo bolts in I will show you this

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.559
This is something that Mopar probably has to address

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.269
As you can see that crack in here. This is a very common problem

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.439
of

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.719
What Mopar is building and designing a very common problem?

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.209
Sometimes it cracks in here sometimes we see the crack in here

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.979
Or sometimes it's somewhere here I

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.889
Don't know. I hope that I you know from from showing this in YouTube that

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.770
Mopar would

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.130
address this problem

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.929
I know that there's a lot of srt for owners run into this kind of problems. We try to search for

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.980
Different sources for this manifold and

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.869
Four of what we have found already that they're selling for like 20 bucks 30 bucks Wow

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.470
it's junk it's basically has almost the similar problem having a cracked manifold like this and

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.660
You know with this video. I hope that Mopar might see this and

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.420
might have to address this and

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.919
Put a technical bulletin on it if they don't if they don't have it here

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.619
So I hope this add this would also help you know with the industry. Thank you

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.680
We will

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.389
Hi welcome to autumn on again

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.630
We just finished this rebuilt of

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.530
SRT 4 and here we've got here might the owner of the guard and

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:49.269
It's pretty happy with what he sees so shortly. We'll be doing a test drive and

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.109
Here, we'll show you how we clean this up

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.670
We rebuilt basically from bottom up

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.880
replace all the

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.519
piston ring piston rings

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.809
This was the notorious the notorious turbo is right there, which was like a took us forever

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.139
Just to look for this. That's the manifold and the turbo and we had shown in the earlier video

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:26.019
the replacement component so now we're going to be taking this bad boy for a test drive and

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.200
We'll go from there. Thank you

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:02.398
Very good the shop is very thorough

00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:05.259
no shortcuts

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:07.259
quality work I

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:11.549
guess I can't say enough about the shop they do it right the first time I

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:14.739
Don't mind that

00:07:14.739 --> 00:07:17.939
That's what I want. I don't want nothing halfway done

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.210
And his work

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.419
Thank you Mike again this is

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:37.099
Okay, this rap that pops it up. We're on Ahmad we build SRT for long block engine
