00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.810
What's up guys, hope you're doing well.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.850
So you want to learn how to tell if a guy
likes you? Well, grab a black Xbox controller

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.240
and a black statue of a puppy...and strap
yourself in cause this one's going to be a

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.130
doozey.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.250
The easiest way to tell if a guy likes you
is if he says that he likes you. Almost 100%

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.019
of the time when a guy says he likes you...it's
true.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.310
As simple as this may seem, some girls just
don't understand this type of straightforwardness.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.109
They think we're joking, kidding, playing
around...but we're not.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.099
So if a guy is man enough to tell you that
he has feelings for you, make sure to tell him

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.250
if you have feelings about him...or friend
zone him. It's that simple.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.570
Some guys will never verbalize how they feel
about you. They just show their feelings in

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.050
other ways. One of those ways is textback
speed.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.230
How fast does it take him to respond to your
text? Does he always text back? Does he ever

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.660
text you first? Your answers to these questions
will go a long way in determining if a guy

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.600
likes you or not.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.570
If it takes him one or two hours to respond
to a text, but he always responds...could

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.240
be a good sign. On the flip side, if it takes
him one or two months...it's not looking good.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.990
But not all guys are great texters. However,
if a guy likes you, he's going to want to

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.600
get to know you a little bit better, brining
me to rule number 3: Increased Communication.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.729
If a guy likes you, you may see a rise in
phone calls, Skype attempts, even personalized

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.700
SnapChat messages. If a guy is willing to
take time just to get to know you a little

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.009
bit better, he's definitely interested.

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.390
Now you have to be careful here because these
are also the same characteristics that stalkers

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.899
demonstrate. So use good judgment.

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.979
Another way to tell if a guy likes you is
if he asks to hangout with you, especially

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.130
if it's in a one-on-one setting. Maybe you
think you're just going to get coffee with

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.179
a friend, but you're wrong.

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.909
Always keep in mind, guys are only friends
with girls who they fail to get with or girls

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.979
who they know they have no chance of ever
getting with. And even then we're still trying

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.679
to get you to hook us up with your friends.

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.679
Besides, asking to hangout is really just
a way of increasing communication, which of

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.619
course brings us back to rule number 3.

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.840
Now that you've got the basic rules down,
here are a couple of things to look out for:

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.679
Boyfriend Bashing. If a guy's always bashing
on your boyfriend, one of three things is

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:44.100
true.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.789
1) You're dating a douchebag
2) He wants to be your boyfriend

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.899
3) You're dating a douchebag and he wants
to be your boyfriend.

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.759
And finally compliments. Just because a guy
compliments you doesn't mean that he likes

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.950
you. You may actually be looking very beautiful
that day or he just wants to have sex with

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.200
you.

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.670
In fact, even if all of the previous rules
are followed, a guy may just be trying to

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.490
use you for sex...and the move on afterwards,
leaving you brokenhearted, vulnerable, and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.359
distrusting of any other males in the future.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.759
We've all seen this before: guy acts like
a good guy, guy gets what he wants, guy never

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.619
talks to you again.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.989
The only way to protect yourself from this
is due diligence. You just got to do an extensive

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.980
background search on this guy and figure out
what his true motives are, which you should

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.400
be doing anyways, especially if you see a
future with this guy.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.470
With that being said, these rules are still
great guidelines to follow. If he tells you

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.930
he likes you, if he has a good textback speed,
if he's increasing his communication with

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.950
you or even asking to hangout in a one-on-one
setting, these are all good signs that that

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.659
guy just might like you.

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.780

likes you? Leave a comment down below.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.780
Remember, I'm Scooter Magruder and now you
know how too.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.530
Well, grab a black Xbox controller...grab
a black Xbox controller and a...

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.650
DAHECK. It's cause I just lotioned my hands.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.250
Well, grab a black Xbox controller and a black
statue of a puppy...and strap yourself in

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.939
cause this one's going to be a doozey.

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.310
I'm a grown man.
