Hi my name is Movin On, and I've been working
in the field of car audio and mobile electronics

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:07.250
for 8 over years.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.110
I've installed everything from navigation
systems to full car stereo systems, remote

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.670
starters, alarms, and beyond.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.090

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.150
Today I am going to be sharing with you my
knowledge on car audio and mobile electronics.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:29.460
When you are getting a car stereo for the
first time you want to ask yourself what you

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.810
are looking to get out of that stereo.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.780
Are you looking to play a form of media that
you could not play before, like an iPod?

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.440
Are you looking for better sound?

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.110
Are you looking for more bass?

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:47.800
A lot of times it is easy to just replace
your head unit, which is the main part that

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.740
you put the CD in and plug iPods into.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.670
But often times it is not really possible.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.230
You are going to want to go to a local car
stereo shop and consult with a professional.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.020
You need somebody who has experience to look
at your car, determine what can be changed,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.710
how it can be changed, and how it is going
to be done properly.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.549
If you plan on doing it yourself you are going
to want to do proper research and maybe even

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.509
go to a car stereo shop to ask what type of
parts you are going to need.

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.960
For instance if you are going to want to play
your iPod, there are interfaces that we can

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.429
add to make it play.

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:22.969
If you want more bass, we can add a subwoofer
and amplifier.

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.640
And if you want better sound, we may be able
to replace your speakers or add an amplifier

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.580
or a sound processor without replacing the
head unit at all.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.859
When you are looking to change a stereo, you
may want to ask yourself what are you looking

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:34.939
to gain by that.

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.119
Is it better sound?

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.119
Is it more features?

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.119
Do you want to be able to play your iPod?

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.119
These are all things that can potentially
cut your cost in half.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.119
You may not need to change every single component
in your car stereo just to give it a little

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.119
more bass.

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.119
Changing your speakers isn't always the answer.

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.119
Sometimes changing the head unit is a better
idea.

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.119
Sometimes adding an amplifier with a little
bit of bass will give you that extra impact

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.119
that you need.

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.940
A lot of people will jump straight to the
big box store because they know the big box

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.940
store has a big selection and that they have
lots of sales people and help that is readily

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.540
available, but I tend to recommend the local
car stereo shop because typically you can

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.780
have more dedicated professionals with a lot
more experience.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.369
You are going to get better work done to your
car, you are going to get better advice, and

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.659
a lot of time you are going to have higher
end brands to choose from.
