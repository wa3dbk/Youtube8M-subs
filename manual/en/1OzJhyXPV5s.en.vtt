00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.280
With any major joint in the body, it's really
important for the health of the joint that

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.280
the energy is passing through that with a
really great alignment and ease.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.050
So for the knee, we're just going to do a
little bit of a rocking motion.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.599
I'm just tapping my foot.

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:25.310
It's a really gentle way to support the knee
joint and to loosen up the joints on either

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.689
side in the ankle.

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:36.350
And then place both hands underneath the knee
and just give a little bit of a bounce, just

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.120
to, again, support that joint, loosen it up
a little bit.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.550
And then with extending the whole leg I'm
bending right under that crease and placing

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.550
my knee there.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.440
So he knee is really supported.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.579
And this gives me access to work on all of
the energy pathways that run up the front

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:01.449
inside of the knee as well as the outside
of the leg, through the back of the knee.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:09.110
So there's a great pressure point about two
inches down from the knee on the outside of

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.950
the shinbone, right around here.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.329
And in Japanese it's called ashi san ri, and
in English that means three-mile run.

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:22.320
This is a great point for runners, but really,
any athletes who are having a lot of stress

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.539
on the knee, it helps to free up this whole
area and you can apply quite firm pressure

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:29.780
into that.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.570
So, again, the knee is here.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.090
It's just about two inches down.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.700
And often, when you press that pressure point
you can feel it radiating energy up and down

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.049
on the leg which helps to remind us that Shiatsu's
really not just about a particular part of

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.920
the body but it's about connecting and integrating
a really great alignment and balance throughout

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:03.020
the whole body.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.200
So to balance both sides of the knees, I'm
just going to place on hand on the in and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.970
one on the out and just send an opposing motion
of energy.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.069
And this is the way an actual flow moves up
the inside and down the outside, just to finish

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.930
the work around the knee.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.450
And great, just to hold and find a little
bit of pressure and find a little bit of pressure

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.909
and warmth into the knee joint.
