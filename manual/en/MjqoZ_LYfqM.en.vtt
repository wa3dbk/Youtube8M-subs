[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.110
-2013 is the 30th anniversary
of "Return of the Jedi."

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.850
So this is a nice time to
celebrate the legacy of "Return

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.230
of the Jedi," which is not
only the conclusion of the six

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.804
films of "Star Wars," but it's
the launch pad for everything

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:23.220
to come. "Return of the Jedi,"
one of my personal favorite

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.130
movies.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.530
But without any
further ado, I do

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.261
want to introduce our special
guests if they're ready.

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:31.760
We're going to open the magic
door and see if they're ready.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.500
They don't need any
introduction at all,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.375
but of course I'm going
to intro them anyway.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.090
Please welcome-- well, some
stormtroopers as well--

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.810
but please welcome Carrie Fisher
and Mark Hamill to the stage.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.799
Please welcome.

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:45.793
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.780
Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.040
Come on over, guys.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.670
Yeah, come sit down.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.970
Whatever you want to do.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.440
No Gary?

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.810
-No.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.310
-OK, well I'm going to get you
a couple of microphones here.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.330
I'm going to make sure
these are working.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.730
We do it nice and formally
here, as you can tell.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.698
-Very nice.

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:14.570
-Is this on?

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.140
Check, two.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.400
There you go.

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.760
There you go.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.360
That's for you.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.960
-OK.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.396
-So, welcome to Germany.

00:01:26.396 --> 00:01:26.972
-Thank you.

00:01:26.972 --> 00:01:28.930
-Yeah, welcome to Star
Wars Celebration Europe.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.170
Of course, you've both
been here to Germany

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.770
many times before
for certain events.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.150
I know Mary Lou backstage
was telling me a story.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.250
Back in 1980, promoting
"The Empire Strikes Back,"

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.357
you were here, I believe.

00:01:39.357 --> 00:01:39.940
Is that right?

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.460
-Yeah, we were in Munich.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.610
And then I went to visit
an actor, Siegfried Ralph,

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.530
who was in "Big Red One,"
in a little town in Bavaria.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.060
And Nathan's first film
was Disney's "Peter Pan"

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.745
dubbed in German.

00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:56.890
With dialogue, [GERMAN].

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.297
I still remember that.

00:01:58.297 --> 00:02:00.255
It was weird, because
when there's a little kid

00:02:00.255 --> 00:02:03.170
and he knows the story and
all the German dialogue's

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.670
coming out of the
mouth, for a while

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.545
he thought he spoke German.

00:02:05.545 --> 00:02:06.461
He wasn't really sure.

00:02:06.461 --> 00:02:08.440
He was very confused.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.880
But he's better now.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.210
-So you've both now become
veterans of Star Wars

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.700
Celebration, having appeared
in Orlando and other places.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.970
And certainly, you've done
a lot of Star Wars events.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.130
What is it about Star
Wars Celebration--

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.900
-This is my fifth.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.820
-This is your fifth?

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.320
-Yeah.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.765
Two in Florida, one in
England, and one in Japan.

00:02:26.765 --> 00:02:27.400
-Wow.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.900
OK.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.983
So this is your fifth one.

00:02:28.983 --> 00:02:32.080
And they're obviously
very special--

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.425
-Have you stopped counting?

00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:34.470
-I-- I have no idea.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.890
How would you remember that?

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.750
-I just remember because
Japan and England were exotic.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.600
And Orlando--

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.630
-Was not?

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.710
-Well, unless you're--

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.480
-It was hot.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.580
-Well, Disney World.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.150
There's that.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.780
And there's the park where
there's the Harry Potter ride.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.030
-I thought we were a ride
on-- I felt like a ride,

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.311
I know-- on Star Tours.

00:02:56.311 --> 00:02:56.810
-Yeah.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.830
Oh, that's right.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.080
But that wasn't a celebration.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.190
-Lets just go through
our memories now.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.260
-Well, there was the
"Last Tour to Endor"

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.351
in 2010 at Disney World.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:05.850
I remember.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:06.580
Yes, Star Tours.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.330
I was there, yeah.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.260
-Was I there?

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.268
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.990
-I'm not joking.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.330
I don't remember.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.440
-We're going to ride
it, and they said,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.907
can we film you
when you ride it?

00:03:19.907 --> 00:03:21.365
And we said, no,
we know it's going

00:03:21.365 --> 00:03:23.920
to turn into a commercial.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.880
-Get all the crazy faces
with gravity during its work

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.680
and screaming and bumping.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.130
Yeah so--

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.340
-There's no dignity there.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.760
Don't ever let yourself be
filmed on an amusement park

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.200
ride.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.100
-Especially if you're one of us.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.150
And I don't encourage
that either.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.580
-Yeah, that just turns into
a GIF on the internet, right?

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.580
Then an endless loop.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.510
-Everything turns
up on the internet.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.320
-That's right.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.029
That's right.

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:46.695
So tell me, this is
the 30th anniversary

00:03:46.695 --> 00:03:48.731
of "Return of the Jedi," and--

00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:49.230
-It is?

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.964
-It is the 30th anniversary
of "Return of the Jedi," 2013.

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:53.630
Oh, and there's a fly
here to celebrate.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.720
-That's how old we are.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.680
-Swooping like vultures.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.930
-Do you have any fond memories
of "Return of the Jedi"

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.660
now that you look back
and think about everything

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.800
that's happened.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.985
It's been such a whirlwind
of fans and a legacy--

00:04:08.985 --> 00:04:11.820
-It was called "Revenge of the
Jedi" when we were making it.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:12.320
-Yes.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.240
-Right.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.160
-And then somebody figured
out, wait a second,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.680
Jedi's don't have revenge.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.885
-And it's a negative thing.

00:04:17.885 --> 00:04:18.510
-Very negative.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.860
-It was so negative.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.740
-He had to save it for
"Revenge of the Sith."

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.057
-Was that a revenge thing?

00:04:24.057 --> 00:04:25.140
-Well, he loves that word.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.005
Because it's a proactive word.

00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:28.947
-It's good.

00:04:28.947 --> 00:04:30.280
-But you know what it felt like?

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.192
It was the wrap up.

00:04:31.192 --> 00:04:33.816
It had this feeling of closure.

00:04:33.816 --> 00:04:34.940
Beginning, middle, and end.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.520
And there was a feeling of,
like, clearing out your lockers

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.322
and finishing up.

00:04:39.322 --> 00:04:41.640
It was sad, in a way,
because you would never

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.030
see any of these people again.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.095
-And here we are.

00:04:46.095 --> 00:04:47.270
-Why am I seeing you again?

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.740
Oh, we're here, that's right.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.570
-So, did you ever
think back in 1983

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.310
that you would be here doing
a press conference in Germany?

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.930
-Yes.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.450
-You did?

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.950
Oh, good.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.310
-I knew that I would
be, and it made me sad.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.896
[LIGHT LAUGHTER]

00:04:58.896 --> 00:05:01.150
-I hope you saved up some
good anecdotes for 30 years.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.110
-Well, I'm psychic.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.443
And so remember, the whole
time we were making the movie

00:05:04.443 --> 00:05:06.690
I said, this is going
to be hilarious 30 years

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.180
from now when we're both
sitting on a stage in Germany.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.700
It was terrible, having
your memories early

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.200
and then living them.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.160
It's not a good thing, I
don't care what you've heard.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.090
-And being escorted up
by stormtroopers, yes.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.590
-I knew that was
going to happen to.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.089
-You did?

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.600
-Mm-hmm.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.590
-Well, it's been really
amazing backstage

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.920
seeing everyone together.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.377
And we do have a lot of people
here from "Return of the Jedi"

00:05:33.377 --> 00:05:34.960
that we want to have
join you on stage

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.940
for a photo op for all of you.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.940
I think this might be the
first time in 30 years

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.140
that there's been
seven of you here,

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.090
with Ian McDiarmid and Warwick
Davis and everyone here.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.600
So, really excited to get
everyone else on stage.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.220
I know you guys
have a lot going on.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.780
I'm sorry, you we're
going to say something?

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.260
-No, no.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.510
I was just scratching my face.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.149
-They'd rather hear
from you than hear

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:54.190
from me, that's for sure.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.440
-I don't know what's going on.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.300
-I don't know what
I'm doing up here.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.530
But yeah--

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.972
-Are all of you German?

00:06:00.972 --> 00:06:01.930
-Where's everyone from?

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.720
How many people from Russia?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.520
-Oh, OK.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.370
-How many people from Germany?

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.870
-OK.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.770
-UK?

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.450
What else, Mark?

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.670
What else?

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.280
-Australia?

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.120
-Australia?

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.740
-Spain?

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.520
Canada?

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.690
-Ireland?

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.461
-USA?

00:06:17.461 --> 00:06:17.960
Oh, OK.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.650
-Wow.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.370
Amazing.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.130
-Supposedly everybody's
happy that the Germans

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.340
beat Barcelona?

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.797
Is that not true?

00:06:25.797 --> 00:06:28.130
Somebody just told me backstage
that the Germans are all

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.672
in a good mood because
they won in futbol.

00:06:30.672 --> 00:06:34.500
-I can't make sports jokes.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.130
That was yesterday's news.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.139
Today we're all friends again.

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:39.180
-Already old news, is it?

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.110
-So you're German then?

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.440
Is that it?

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.300
-No, I'm Spanish.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.360
-Oh, you're Spanish?

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.000
OK.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.186
-Oh, so you're not happy.

00:06:45.186 --> 00:06:48.114
-I support Real
Madrid [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:48.114 --> 00:06:49.090
So I'm happy.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.070
-Oh, OK.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.570
Good.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.980
-You seem happy.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.650
-We'll put an end to that.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.650
-Well, listen, I know
you guys have a lot to do

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.410
and you're very, very busy.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.201
I want to thank you on
behalf of Lucasfilm,

00:07:01.201 --> 00:07:04.850
on behalf of all the fans, for
making the time to be here,

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.976
for answering my questions.

00:07:05.976 --> 00:07:08.308
It's a good thing I'm not a
huge "Star Wars" fan or else

00:07:08.308 --> 00:07:09.350
I'd be nervous up here.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.450
Oh wait!

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.380
So thanks, you guys.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.050
-Thank you.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.835
-And we do want to have a
little bit of a photo op.

00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:17.380
So I want to invite some friends
up here so we can do that.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.670
And then I know you
have to be on your way.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:19.750
But thank you so much.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.270
-Thank you.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.340
-Thank you, everyone.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.690
