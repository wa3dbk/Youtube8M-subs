&gt;&gt;TIM NICHOLS: All I'm doing is stepping back
and forth, but I see that character on screen

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.760
looking awesome, probably way cooler than
I look.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.939
So there's this concept of an attentional
spotlight where early on in experience you're

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.470
really hyperfocused on just a little bit of
what's going on in that game.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.660
You're not really paying attention to anything
else.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.309
Over time, that spotlight starts to expand.

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.879
You're able to see the entire experience.

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.879
Same thing for like, the boombox down there,
the score.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.920
Even the same thing the little circle underneath
the character.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.030
If I do the move right, you can see I'm going
to try to get one right here.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.570
Kind of got one, right?

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.629
If I do it right, you can see I get some positive
feedback, right?

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.030
Even that stuff, people really weren't even
seeing.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:11.170
And really understanding what the human attentional
system is capable of seeing and hearing and

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.760
coding is what helps us to design that initial
experience.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.760
My name's Tim Nichols.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.970
I'm a user research lead at Microsoft Studios
and the studio's research team.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.870
Basically what that means is my team and I,
we conduct research on video games.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.010
And so, specifically the research that we
focus on are questions on how people play

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.430
games, why they make the decisions that they
make in games, why they do well in some games,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.510
why they don't do well in other games and
we try to answer, really just any question

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.140
related to how people interact with video
games.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.480
The biggest thing that I do is, the consistent
thing that I do from day-to-day, is I think

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.310
about games, I talk to people about games.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.660
My team and I, we're always working with teams
who are actually out there making games and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.300
they have a lot of questions about how their
game is being received by their target audience.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.870
And so, frequently what that means is the
folks on my team and myself, we've got sort

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.590
of a long history and a lot of experience
in thinking about human behavior, and specifically,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.960
how human behavior relates to playing video
games.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:32.980
So, what that means is that we talk to these
teams about, questions about how difficult

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.750
a game is, whether people are learning how
to play a game at the right pace, whether

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.730
something's fun or not, and not just whether
something's fun or not but what is it that

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.960
makes it fun, what is it that makes it not
fun and how can we cut out some of that not

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.500
fun stuff.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.620
So if I had to sum it up on a day-to-day basis,
the thing that I do is I talk about games

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.170
and I talk about human psychology and human
behavior in the context of games.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.990
So, a lot of people ask me how they can get
into a games user research job in the industry

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.250
and for me, the two big things are be passionate
about research.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.540
Be passionate about games.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.560
If you're a grad student right now, there's
no reason why you can't combine those two

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.870
passions and start doing research right now,
even when you're in school answering the kinds

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:28.420
of questions that I answer on a daily basis.
