00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:05.839
Location and Discussion Track Rod / Drag Link
for Discovery II, 1999 - 2004 or Range Rover

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:06.839
P38, 1995 - 2002
Hi it's Jim.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.670
I take care of the technical support here
at Atlantic British.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.010
Today we're going to have a little discussion
on the front end geometry of Range Rovers

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.760
and the Discovery II.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.119
We have the Discovery II on the lift.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.531
I overhear our sales people all the time,
people call in and they want a tie rod end

00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:27.630
or something.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.140
Land Rover calls tie rod ends 'ball joints'.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.840
I don't know why.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.230
And then they ask where they want it for,
and the 2 words track rod and drag link come

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.230
up.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.350
What I'm going to show you on the Disco II
is where they are.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.240
We'll just move over here.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:53.390
The drag link on the Disco II and the Range
Rover (that's P38 1995 - 2002) is in front

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.220
of the axle.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.180
It also has this steering damper attached
to it.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.740
The track rod is actually behind the axle.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.610
Doesn't have anything attached to it on this
particular car.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.130
If you had an older Discovery I, the steering
stabilizer is attached to that one.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:23.890
So what the usual problem is with these is
either the tie rod end ball joint gets warn

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.859
out and lose, the boots get torn up, and you
want to replace it.

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:35.389
You have to tell them if you are doing the
track rod or the drag link.

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:41.090
The next problem is that these cars are getting
old.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.579
Your labor to get this out because it is rusted
in tight, sometimes it is just a smarter deal

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.499
to buy the whole unit.

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:56.000
Especially if the one on the other end goes
bad, it's part of this whole rod, so you would

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.170
have to buy it any way.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.069
It is not that much more money to get the
adjuster, the clamps and the other tie rod

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.479
ball joint here.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.209
And then it makes doing the alignment the
alignment 100% easier.

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:15.189
This you can see is the drag link because
that is where the steering stabilizer would

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:16.250
go.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.959
This is the track rod for the Range Rover.

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:27.200
It is bigger than the Disco II, you can see
it is the same deal on this end the tie rod

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.319
end or ball joint is part of this whole rod.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.159
And then you have your adjusters and stuff
here.

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:39.140
Again, if it is old, unless you live in the
middle of the desert, not the northeast like

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.650
we are here, it's going to be rusty, cruddy
and hard to manage.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.739
It's good money just to put the whole piece
on it.

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:53.730
While we are up here, the steering stabilizer
for Disco II you can have a choice of the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.349
OEM one.

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.819
You can get a Bilstein gas German one, which
is nice.

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.010
My personal favorite is the Old Man Emu here.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.099
This is a pretty solid unit.

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.959
It will get rid of any shakes in the front.

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.409
For the Range Rover you can only buy the original
equipment one.

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:22.079
So if you need ball joints, tie rod ends or
the whole track rod, check us out at RoverParts.com

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.659
or give us a call at 1-800-533-2210.

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.069
Talk to the sales department, they'll know
exactly what you need.

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.609
And you can surprise them this time because
you know where the track rod is and where

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:35.609
the drag link is.
