00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.520
Hi, I'm Zak and I'm here in the Crutchfield
video studio today to show you something about

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.790
the JVC KW-NT1 navigation receiver.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.809
It's a double sized stereo and sports a big
6.1 inch touchscreen display.

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.109
Now there's three things I want to show you
about this stereo.

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.750
First, some of the really cool GPS features
that it has.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.189
Second, I'd like to demonstrate the built-in
Bluetooth capability.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.720
And third, show you just how easy it is to
control your iPod.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.189
But let's start with GPS.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.200
The big display makes it really easy to see,
and this navigation system, I've got to say,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.250
really exceeded our expectations and I'll
show you how.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.570
The navigation guides you with text-to-speech
voice prompts, meaning it calls out the name

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.660
of the next turn.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.300
And here's something pretty cool, it tells
you what lane you should be in.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.190
Now say you're approaching a complex interchange
you haven't seen before, that's pretty good

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.920
to know.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.010
The built-in database has 6 million points
of interest already loaded, and it's really

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.070
easy to load your own.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.380
You just download them from Google Maps, put
them on an SD card and there's an SD slot

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.829
right behind the removable faceplate.

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:18.689
Well, let's say today I want to go out to
lunch and I feel like barbeque.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.689
Arthur's Smokehouse.

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.780
You bring it up and it's got all the info
you need.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.130
If you've got a Bluetooth phone hooked up,
just tap that icon and it will call ahead

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.590
so you'll know if their busy, what their lunch
specials are.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.430
Or just tap go and it will calculate, rather
quickly, a route and take you right there.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.249
Now, here's something really interesting that
I found that I've never seen at all: You can

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:49.590
actually tell this to alert you when you've
gone over the speed limit.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.460
And you can set different parameters here.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.950
Now that's really great.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.219
It let's you keep your eyes on the road for
one thing, but it also, if you live in a place

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.799
where radar detectors are illegal, it'll tell
you to slow down before the Highway Patrol

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.119
does.

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.049
The built-in Bluetooth let's you make and
receive phone calls through the stereo.

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.810
It uses an external mic, which you can mount
on the mirrors, sun visor or dash.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.760
Now when a call comes in, the number will
appear on the display, or if you've downloaded

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.370
your phonebook, the caller's name will also
appear.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.300
You can answer the call using the touchscreen,
or you can tell the stereo to automatically

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.310
answer or reject all incoming calls.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:42.709
To make a call, you can use the keypad here,
or tap an entry from your phonebook, or from

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.490
your call history.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.890
Now this stereo's version of Bluetooth doesn't
let you stream music, but it's great for making

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.900
and receiving calls.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.760
When it comes to listening to your tunes,
the KW-NT1 has you covered.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.040
There's a USB input mounted right up front
where you can get to it easily.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.209
And the cool thing about it is that you can
plug in your iPod directly and control it

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.500
using the touchscreen.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.430
Or, if you want, a passenger can control the
tunes using the iPod itself.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.410
And you'll still get song info on the screen.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.190
It's up to you and JVC makes it really easy
to switch back and forth.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.330
The stereo is compatible with the newer iPods,
including the iPod Touch.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.840
But if you want to view video from your iPod
on the stereo's display, or if you have an

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.840
iPhone, then you'll need the optional video
cable.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.220
No matter what source you're listening to,
the music's going to sound great, thanks to

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.969
a powerful amplifier, a 24-bit D-to-A converter,
and a 7 band EQ.

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:50.080
Here's something that JVC does that most other
stereos don't: If you're using your factory

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.579
speakers, you can turn on the amplifier gain
control and limit the amount of power going

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.219
out, so that you don't overload your speakers,
they run more efficiently and they always

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:00.890
sound their best.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.109
Now, besides the USB input and the CD/DVD
playback, there's also a handy auxiliary A/V

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.829
input right on the front.

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.909
And as I already mentioned, there's an SD
card slot behind the removable display.

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:20.130
All that adds up to give you a lot of flexibility
for listening to your music sources.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.020
An important thing to keep in mind is that
the KW-NT1 is part of JVC's Arsenal line of

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.770
audio gear.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.590
What that means is that it's built to perform
and to last.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.870
And JVC stands behind that with a 2-year warranty.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.500
That's a quick look at the JVC KW-NT1 navigation
receiver.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.150
Now, I've got to tell you, this is a really
great stereo.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.550
When we took it out of the box and hooked
it up, it just worked so easily from the start.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.680
We didn't even need to look at the manual.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:58.050
