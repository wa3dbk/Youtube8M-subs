Hello its Kinoshita Yuka

00:00:05.396 --> 00:00:12.872
today there was a train station Bento (prepared meal) festival/event at a local supermarket and I bought 3 bentos... they're so expensive :'(

00:00:12.872 --> 00:00:17.822
and well the first one is this "pulling octopus rice" &lt;I guess the the appeal of the octopus is supposed to lure you in&gt;

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:26.030
oh oh wow look its got an illustration of an octopus on it I can't wait ITADAKIMASU

00:00:26.557 --> 00:00:31.007
hmm there is a rubber band.... oh you can smell the octopus already

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:37.765

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:40.269

00:00:46.648 --> 00:00:47.566

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:58.934

00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:32.538

mmmm flavored rice is so delicious

00:02:09.413 --> 00:02:11.820
the aroma and umami of the octopus permeates throughout

00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:14.838
and to be able to eat it in this octopus pot is cool

00:02:17.618 --> 00:02:18.824
a momiji leaf shape

00:02:22.863 --> 00:02:23.748

oh its got eggs they've really put a lot of time and labor into this sooo gooood

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.616
the rice has a nice base flavor of soy sauce and its so good

00:02:47.282 --> 00:02:49.981
&lt;talking about a leaf I am unfamiliar with &gt;

00:02:57.031 --> 00:03:00.969
if I walk around with this little bento box it would be super &lt;can't tell what she said&gt;

00:03:05.874 --> 00:03:16.187
oh whats this whats this? look at it whats this? is it an age (bean curd) or a fish cake or a fired fish cake perhaps itadakimasu

00:03:21.846 --> 00:03:23.260

00:03:28.088 --> 00:03:33.494
these train station bento boxes are so yummy but they're super expensive too

00:03:34.024 --> 00:03:39.517
egg mmm its been flavored nicely

00:03:42.356 --> 00:03:43.532
a nice sweetness to it

00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:12.779
mmm the sea eel is very yummy and it has all sorts of things its amazing that on top of octopus they would add eel as well

00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:16.414
the last piece of octopus

00:04:23.692 --> 00:04:25.819
its so sweet and tender soo goooood

00:04:27.612 --> 00:04:31.627
hmmm octopus are pretty cute aren't they if it was a cute small one like this I'd love to have one as a pet

00:04:33.827 --> 00:04:36.943
but you know what.... its kind of difficult eating out of this pot

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.576
its nice to have something different though

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:47.886
all done it turned out that there were no live octopus to be found in here

00:04:49.607 --> 00:04:51.309
