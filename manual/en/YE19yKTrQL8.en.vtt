Hi, I'm Rachel for Expert Village. Now the
second flower in our vase is going to be a

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:15.670
collage. We're going to take a few pictures,
I have them laminated already and we're going

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:44.039
to cut them out first. I'm just going to cut
them and later on I'm going to put them close

00:00:44.039 --> 00:01:35.310
together on the flower. As you can see I'm
not cutting it straight. And then I have all

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.630
the pictures cut out and then I can start
placing them on the flower the way I want.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:02:00.999
So this is a little bit too big, so I'm going
to cut the corners. To do a collage it's important

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:26.470
not to get the face out. Okay, this is one
picture, another one, you can put it over

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:53.489
here, the third one. You can
cut it and play with it as long as you leave

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.180
the face usually uncut of course.
