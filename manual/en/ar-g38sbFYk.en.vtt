00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:27.439
Say what you want about causal gaming, Facebook
and Mobile games, but it’s my guess that

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.439
they’re here to stay.

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.680
So we’re faced with a choice, learn to peacefully
coexist or be at constant odds with each other.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.610
I’m choosing the peaceful way mostly because
when I find a game under that category that

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.309
I enjoy, there’s no guilty pleasure associated
with it but rather I can proudly share the

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.510
game with friends, family and you guys!

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.960
And that’s the case with this app, Zombie
Farm.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.140
Now the title leaves little to the imagination...

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.120
You’re on a farm and there’s zombies involved.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.379
Developed by the Play Forge, Zombie Farm is
a real-time farm simulation game.

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.190
You play the farmer and you’ll be plowing
fields, planting crops and growing zombies.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.910
Each crop or zombie has a certain amount of
time before it’s ready to harvest ranging

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.410
anywhere from 15 minutes to 24 hours.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.160
Plowing and harvesting will earn you XP, higher
levels will unlock more crops, zombies and

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.420
items that can be purchased in the market.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.080
Here you’ll spend gold earned from selling
crops or brains which are obtained by quests,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.150
purchasing with real money, or invasions.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.860
That’s right these zombies aren’t just
for show or to sell like the rest of your

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.890
crops they are for action and they are hungry.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.990
There are a variety of zombies with strengths
and weaknesses, a balanced regular zombie,

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.570
a slightly quicker but weaker female zombie,
a really big, strong, but really slow brute

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.850
zombie, a really tiny, but weak mini zombie,
a headless tanking type zombie, and a fertilizing,

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.730
healing garden zombie.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.390
Eventually as you progress and complete more
invasions you will learn new abilities to

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.920
help out during your attacks, which can be
done every two hours.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.850
The invasions are a fun feature and it sets
it apart from a game like Farmville.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.891
You actually send out your zombies to attack
another farmers, which award you gold and

00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:11.950
a chance at random items and power-ups.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.430
Youl tap your zombies to send them out as
they fight off minions until the boss comes

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.380
down to duke it out themselves.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.590
You can spend gold on items and decorations
for your farm.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.940
Some are functional, like the storage shed,
mausoleum, and gravestones, but most are just

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.640
for show and will award XP and “Life Force”
which will increase the chance you won’t

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.410
harvest a “lifeless” zombie and increase
chance of mutations.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.660
You can purchases mutations in the market.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.400
Planting that type of crop by a zombie has
a chance of giving it a bonus, to either life,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400
power, or speed.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.740
You can have multiple mutations for almost
every part of the zombie, head, arms, body,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:49.740
etc.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.780
There’s a few powers-ups too mostly farming
related.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.170
Forget to harvest your crops and they will
wilt, but you can use a regrowth boost to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.170
revive them.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.100
There’s also a lot of time saver boosts
that will instantly grow crops, harvest and

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.510
plow everything for you and allow you invade
without waiting!

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.760
Recently added, you’ll be able to add friends
and visit their farm.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.959
While there you can just check out the scenery,
or give them a gift or play tag with their

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.120
zombies and earn some extra experience.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.570
I enjoy Zombie farm a lot.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.000
The cartoonish design adds to the humor and
charm of the game.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.630
The music and sound effects are all well done.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.210
Overall it provides a great way to kill some
time especially for the price of free of charge!
