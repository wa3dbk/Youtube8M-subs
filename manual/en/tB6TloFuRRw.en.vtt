00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.240
Think Porsche, and most people imagine a sleek
low slung sports car, so might surprise you

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.640
to learn that the company's best selling model
worldwide is the Cayenne, a large, heavy 4X4.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.640
This Â£47,000 entry-level model here even
has a diesel engine. We're going to put put

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.180
the Porsche through its paces on our test
route, but remember to log in for lab results

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.960
for fuel economy, performance, and more.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.809
The Cayenne was first launched in 2002, but
this second generation car following in mid

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.940
2010. There are essentially three engine options:
diesel, petrol electric hybrid, and a petrol

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.449
V8; with anything from 400 to a frankly ridiculous,
540 brake horsepower. The Cayenne is based

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.820
on the same platform two of its closest rivals.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.820
The Audi Q7 and Volkswagen Touareg. We've
got a video review for the Touareg along with

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.799
two of the Cayenne other main rivals. The
Mercedes ML and Range Rover sport. Now lets

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:19.799
take it out on the road and see if it can
live up to that famous badge. With 245 brake

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.369
horsepower, the diesel engine in this Cayenne
won't shove you back in your seat like the

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.840
more powerful petrol engines.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.700
But remember this car does weigh 2.2 tons
and in some ways the diesel engine is better

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.509
suited to a large 4 x 4 like this, you have
got a lot more torque or pulling power, which

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.439
gives you in-gear performance, and it does
mean that if you do want to tow something

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.999
like a horse box or a caravan, it will be
a lot better suited to that.

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:52.700
It's also very refined, you can tell its a
diesel engine when you first start it up,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.020
but once you are on the move the exhaust note
is actually lot more muted than the Petrol

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.020
Cayennes. an 8- speed Techtronic S automatic
is the only choice of transmission. Shifts

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.160
are seamless and super quick. And you can
also control the gearbox manually using the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.600
buttons on the steering wheel.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.610
The fastest model in the Cayenne range is
the turbo, which sprints to 62 miles in just

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.440
4.7 seconds and doesn't stop until 172 miles
an hour. The diesel isn't as quick, with figures

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.440
of 7.6 seconds and 136 miles an hour respectively,
but it's much more economical. For such a

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.940
large car. The Cayenne doesn't feel as spacious
in the front as you might expect, and that's

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.910
because it's got this really wide center console
and a high dashboard making you feel very

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.110
enclosed.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.760
But it certainly is comfortable especially
if you opt for the adaptive sports seats here,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.760
which were a three and half thousand pound
option. So they're certainly not cheap, but

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.050
they do adjust 18 different ways, including
allowing you pump up and deflate the side

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.590
bolsters. And you can really get an excellent
driving position.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.340
Of course one advantage this car has over
most of other models in the Porsche range,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.360
is that you can bring your family along with
you. There's loads of head and leg room back

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.410
here and space for three adults across-ways.
Plus you've got these hefty grab handles in

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.370
case the driver gets over a bit over enthusiastic
with the cornering.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.470
You need to spend an extra Â£2000 if you want
the touch screen Sat map system fitted to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.180
our car. Unlike some rival systems there is
no all-in-one controller or buttons on the

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.030
steering wheel. But that makes it easier to
get used to quickly. Porsche purists may have

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.060
turned up their noses at the Cayenne, but
its proved them wrong with strong sales success,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.950
and handling that's in a different league
to most other SUVs Nobody is pretending that

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.730
you are going to take this car off road.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.860
But if you need sports car performance, 4
wheel drive traction, and enough space for

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.630
a family of 5, then little else comes close.
Our main stumbling block is the price. The

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.290
Cayenne diesel starts at 47,000 pounds and
this car tops 60,000 pounds with the options

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.540
fitted and is by no means fully loaded., But
if you can afford it, it's a very compelling

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.150
package.
