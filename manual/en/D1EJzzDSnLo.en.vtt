00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.880
emirates or

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.779
murderer scooping university an internet
everywhere

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.029
worldwide

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.920
secretly epic schedule muscles are
greatly needed equipment to do

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.640
goldberger

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.610
according to

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.070
through their workers

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.440
well you know

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.920
admirably

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.330
we'll be back our p_n_c_ it's
recommended you doing

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.180
everybody got reflector

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.810
where they were picked up a p_r_ to be
able to really look at them more

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.220
training

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.700
murcia or

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.740
doing better in school

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.690
uh... panel about getting out of that he
has some really good question uh... as a

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.350
license to i'd take those energy drinks
to cram for that

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.470
midterms finals whatever

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.380
look you would really have to look into
the long-term health hazards of treating

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.690
these things overtime rate so if you're
drinking it just to stay up in standard

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.460
genic for midterms and finals but other
than that you don't really drink bad i'm

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.799
sure it'll be fine but keep in mind that
these trains have a high amount of sugar

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.880
uh... date back it's sela rate your
heart rate uh... and that's not a good

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.630
thing

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.319
so jane m regularly is not a good idea
uh... however uh... if you just as you

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:35.400
get

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.319
for like a week to stick around and
should be fine

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.710
but you should definitely look into the
risks and and uh... you know reports

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.060
that have been written about however to
be noted we are not doctors

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.460
you have a not were not that's ok and as
often set without office on board

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.369
but you don't drink something that has
such a high content of sugar and like

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.930
unnaturally and happy i shouldn't be
drinking coffee either and soon

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.320
no coffee has the health benefits to and
what i think that the industry

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.570
which is those reports and i drink off
ill title nothing i don't think we

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.279
consume all sorts of things everyday
that about press

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.399
