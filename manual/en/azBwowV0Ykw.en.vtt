00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.180
One of Kansas’ newest and perhaps best prospective
hunting areas is a recently opened portion

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.470
of the Kansas Army Ammunition Plant near Parsons.
This army installation, no longer an active

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.830
ordnance production facility, sold approximately
3000 acres to Kansas Wildlife and Parks last

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:26.759
year. Rob Riggin, KDWP Public Lands Manager,
is currently developing it as a public wildlife

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.089
area.
“The Grand Osage Wildlife Area is one of

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.230
our newer acquisitions for the Department
of Wildlife and Parks, and it’s a shared

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.440
property between the army and Kansas Department
of Wildlife and Parks right now. We’re excited

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.080
about allowing opportunities on this property.
Turkey numbers and deer numbers are exceptional.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.520
Years of army management for the resource
have produced an excellent age class of deer,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:04.280
and a large population. We’re working on
providing limited access for deer and turkey

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.870
hunting by limited drawing.
“As a deer and turkey hunter myself, I must

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.710
say, I’m very impressed with the property,
and it’s the type of place I think anybody

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.600
would want to hunt.”
Habitat varies widely, from timbered draws,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.979
to pastures and brushy lots, to crop fields.
Deer density as measured by surveys is more

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:32.219
than 50 whitetails per square mile. And eastern
turkeys are plentiful as well. Due to restricted

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:37.549
access to the gated army base, all hunts are
currently by drawing only.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:45.159
“Hunting is allowed by drawing and permits
only. We allowed in the past 40 to 50 deer

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.459
hunters in the fall, and 40 turkey hunters
in the spring.”

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:55.719
Two special hunts, now closed, will allow
17 2-person groups to hunt two short seasons

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.270
in 12 units during the upcoming spring turkey
season.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.639
Hunters must attend orientation classes to
hunt Grand Osage, since access remains through

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:11.670
a base security checkpoint and requires a
badge. The area has a number of fishing ponds

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.319
and lakes, with bass slot limits in force.
Other recreation will be developed as the

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.140
base is transitioned completely to the Great
Plains Development Authority, which is taking

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.060
over the decommissioned base in the near future.
The Grand Osage Wildlife Area has ongoing

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.209
agricultural and livestock leases, and hunters
must be respectful and attentive to these

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.159
interests while hunting. Drive-over spring
cattle guards help alert hunters where cattle

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.540
will be encountered.
As the area is developed, Grand Osage promises

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.970
to be a valuable recreational opportunity
for Kansas outdoors enthusiasts. Hunters interested

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.489
in fall deer hunting on this new area should
contact the Mined Land Main Office in Pittsburg

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:06.990
at (620) 231-3173.
I’m Mike Blair for Kansas Wildlife and Parks.
