My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today, I'm going to show you how

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.710
to shuck an oyster and how to prepare them
a couple of different ways. Alright, at this

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.270
point, you're going to want to make sure your
broiler is on in your oven, because you're

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.949
going to throw these right in the oven. So,
what you're going to do now is, if you don't,

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.550
traditionally these will be served on a platter
with rock salt on it. Not everyone has the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.070
right kind of platter, not everyone has rock
salt at their house. So, I'm going to show

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:35.949
you a nice shortcut, a muffin tin. So what
you can do is you can take your oysters and

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:44.400
just set them down in the muffin tin. This
just so happens to be a gigantic muffin tin,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.489
if you have a small one, it works in that
too typically. As long as your oysters aren't

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.710
too big to fit in there. You see, there you
go. You can do six at a time as far as this

00:00:51.710 --> 00:01:01.620
is concerned. So, it's a nice little secret
thing. They also do make specific cookware

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.700
just for doing Oysters Rockefeller. I think
it's a bit silly. What you're going to do,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.520
is we're going to take our spinach mixture
here and we're going to put one heaping spoonful

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:24.710
on top of each oyster and make sure it evenly
covers the whole oyster. And if you put too

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:35.870
much in and it runs over the sides, not a
big deal, not the end of the world. I'm also,

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.360
something else you could do at this point,
is once you do this before you put them in

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.270
the oven, you could also go get some bread
crumbs and sprinkle on top or you could also

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.870
put some more Parmesan on top of these if
you saw fit and if you had some. And so for

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.840
now, it's off to the oven we go. And they
only need to go in there for a couple of minutes.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:09.800
Alright, open up your broiler, take your oysters,
put them in, close your broiler, and we'll

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.260
come back in about a minute, maybe a minute
and a half.
