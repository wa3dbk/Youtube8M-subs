00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.262
When I was asked to say a few words about the new

00:00:11.262 --> 00:00:13.845
Armstrong Student Center, it caused me to think back

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:16.546
over the duration of this entire project and I think

00:00:16.546 --> 00:00:19.012
a lot of people would be surprised to learn that

00:00:19.012 --> 00:00:22.260
we've been working on this specific project for over

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.929
six years.

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.306
I can distinctly remember during that first meeting,

00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:29.429
the president made it very clear that he wanted to

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.261
make sure we kept the students at the focus of our

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:34.648
conversations and our discussions about the design

00:00:34.648 --> 00:00:37.762
of this facility. He definitely wanted it to become a

00:00:37.762 --> 00:00:39.486
'student center.'

00:00:39.486 --> 00:00:43.072
Back in the earliest days of our campus history,

00:00:43.072 --> 00:00:45.867
students met in what was the top floor of the

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:49.178
original Harrison Hall. Frequently called 'Old Main'

00:00:49.178 --> 00:00:50.577
in those days.

00:00:50.577 --> 00:00:53.013
Harrison Hall, the home to Miami University's political

00:00:53.013 --> 00:00:55.346
science department, was named for the 23rd

00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:57.930
president of the United States, and miami alum,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.512
Benjamin Harrison.

00:01:00.512 --> 00:01:03.261
Harrison Hall sits on the site and was modeled after

00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:06.472
the Old Main, the first academic building on

00:01:06.472 --> 00:01:08.222
miami's campus.

00:01:08.222 --> 00:01:10.809
And Old Main stood as the classroom building, office

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:13.979
building, the major building for everything until the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.149
1950s when it was replaced by Harrison Hall.

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.429
Harrison Hall actually looks a lot like Old Main

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.903
keeping that classic architecture. That building was

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:27.115
followed in 1825 and 1832 by Elliot and Stoddard Hall,

00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:30.995
now our oldest remaining buildings on campus.

00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:33.929
By the end of World War II however, the university

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.263
had grown to the point and abnormally was starting

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:38.292
to grow that they realized they really needed a

00:01:38.292 --> 00:01:41.714
facility specifically for more students.

00:01:41.714 --> 00:01:45.012
So our first center for students was built, it was a

00:01:45.012 --> 00:01:49.096
modest, one story, wood-framed, white wood sided

00:01:49.096 --> 00:01:52.012
building that was located approximately where

00:01:52.012 --> 00:01:54.262
Roudebush Hall parking lot is today.

00:01:54.262 --> 00:01:57.179
One of the first things the committee did was to

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.262
really analyze the campus to find the right location.

00:02:01.262 --> 00:02:05.096
It needs to be convenient, needed to be in the flow

00:02:05.096 --> 00:02:08.658
of traffic of the campus, and through many walks

00:02:08.658 --> 00:02:11.619
around campus, a lot of student input, we finally

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:15.372
settled on this location where it is today.

00:02:15.372 --> 00:02:17.749
As we developed the floor plans for the building,

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:21.595
initially, actually the plan called for the removal

00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:24.549
of three buildings as the design continued

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.842
and progressed, we ultimately came to the

00:02:26.842 --> 00:02:29.385
realization that we could accomplish what we

00:02:29.385 --> 00:02:32.596
wanted to accomplish with the project without

00:02:32.596 --> 00:02:35.094
removing those buildings, but rather building a new

00:02:35.094 --> 00:02:37.844
construction in the center of those buildings that

00:02:37.844 --> 00:02:41.012
connect Gaskill Hall, and Rowan Hall, eventually

00:02:41.012 --> 00:02:44.262
Culler Hall to become a part of the new student center.

00:02:44.262 --> 00:02:46.846
But it also gave us the opportunity with the new

00:02:46.846 --> 00:02:49.699
construction in the center to really open it up and

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:52.117
create a lot of dynamic spaces, a lot of visual

00:02:52.117 --> 00:02:55.596
connections through multi-levels of the facility.

00:02:55.596 --> 00:02:58.958
Create an energy that we really want in this new

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.762
student center. A lot of light flows into the building

00:03:01.762 --> 00:03:03.796
and a lot of nice views out to the campus as well,

00:03:03.796 --> 00:03:06.012
so it did both of those things.

00:03:06.012 --> 00:03:08.595
One of the vocal points of the Armstrong Student

00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:11.052
Center, is a replica of the university seal.

00:03:11.052 --> 00:03:13.473
The celestial pattern in the replica seal will match

00:03:13.473 --> 00:03:17.179
that of February 17th, 1809, the day our university

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:19.011
charter was signed.

00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:21.096
Probably hundreds of us that have worked on this

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:25.012
project begin to get the feeling that its our project,

00:03:25.012 --> 00:03:28.012
you know, we spend hundreds of hours working on it,

00:03:28.012 --> 00:03:31.096
we live and breath the project for several months

00:03:31.096 --> 00:03:32.700
and several years.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.179
But on the first day when we open the doors to the

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:38.261
public, miami students come flowing in the

00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:42.334
facility for the first time, it's no longer our project,

00:03:42.334 --> 00:03:46.511
but as it should be, it becomes the students project.

00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:49.262
Legendary poet Robert Frost once said of miami,

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:51.510
"the most beautiful college campus that ever there

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.762
was." And the Armstrong Students Center will be

00:03:54.762 --> 00:03:56.307
the culmination of that beauty.
