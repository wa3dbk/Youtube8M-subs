00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.330
This video explains how to fix your printer if vertical lines or streaks appear on copies

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.590
or scans or if the printer produces a plain black output.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:18.250
Sometimes just resetting the printer will resolve some copy and scan quality issues.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.250
Reset the printer by first pressing the power button to turn off the printer.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.850
Unplug the power cord from the back of the printer.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.510
Wait 30 seconds. Plug the power cord back into the printer.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.739
Press the Power button to turn the printer on. After the printer has finished powering up,

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.510
attempt your original scan or copy from the Automatic Document Feeder or from the scanner

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.100
bed. If the page copies or scans successfully,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.100
you do not need to continue troubleshooting. If the page does not scan or copy correctly,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.170
continue on to the next step. Dust or dirt on the scanner glass or scanner

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.460
lid backing can degrade the quality of scans or copies. Here we will clean the scanner

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.640
to ensure the best quality scans and copies. Begin by gathering the following cleaning

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.250
materials: • A mild glass cleaner

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.549
• Clean, soft, lint-free cloth • Clean water to dampen the cloth. Distilled

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:45.700
or bottled is preferable but not required. To clean the scanner glass you must first

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:57.670
press the Power button to turn off the printer. Lightly spray a mild glass cleaner directly

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.670
onto the lint free cloth. lift the scanner lid.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.060
Then proceed to clean the entire surface of the scanner glass.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.159
Dry the glass with a dry cloth to prevent spotting.

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:20.790
Next we will clean the scanner lid backing. To clean the scanner lid backing you will

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.859
need to use a cloth or sponge lightly moistened with warm water.

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:32.040
Wash the backing gently to loosen and remove any debris. Make sure not to scrub the backing

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.870
to prevent any scratches. Dry the backing with a dry cloth. Close the

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:48.169
scanner lid. Dust or dirt in the Automatic Document feeder,

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:55.169
also known as the ADF, can also degrade the quality of scans or copies. In this step,

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.340
we will clean the ADF. Clean the ADF by first making sure the printer

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.340
is off

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:19.689
and then unplugging the power cord from the back of the printer.

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:26.120
Next, remove all documents from the document feeder tray.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:35.359
Raise the scanner lid. Lift the ADF cover and then locate the rollers

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:41.870
and the separator pad. Lightly dampen a clean, lint-free cloth with

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.870
distilled water and squeeze any excess liquid from the cloth.

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:55.949
Use the damp cloth to wipe any residue off the rollers.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:06.739
Then, using the same cloth, wipe any residue off of the separator pad.

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:13.650
Lift the ADF mechanism to access the glass strip underneath.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.260
Clean the glass strip with a soft cloth or sponge slightly moistened with a nonabrasive

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.340
glass cleaner. Dry the glass with a dry cloth to prevent

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:30.340
spotting. Lower the ADF mechanism and then close the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.560
cover of the ADF. Close the scanner lid.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:52.100
Reconnect the power cord to the back of the printer.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.310
To ensure that no further vertical lines or streaks will appear on copies or scans, try

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.230
a blank copy on the scanner or ADF. If further cleaning is needed, it will show up on the

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:11.230
copied document or scan. Make sure paper is loaded in the paper tray.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.850
Press the Start Copy Black button to print a blank page.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.580
Examine the printout. If the printout is blank with no streaks or marks on the paper, you

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.960
do not need to continue troubleshooting. If the page does still have streaks or marks

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.150
on it, repeat the cleaning process once more. If after cleaning a second time the page still

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.030
has streaks or marks on it, continue on to the next step.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.550

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.250

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.220
