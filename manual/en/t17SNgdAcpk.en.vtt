00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.750
Hello, Candice and friends.
Happy Thursday. Dodie's here!

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.630
Dodie's here. Hello, Dodie.
Hello BriBry.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.340
We are making our television debut for the
first time in our careers. We've never performed

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.980
on television before.
National television.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.980
The only bad thing is right... and we didn't
realise this.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.400
It's like a kids show, like an actual kids
show. Like proper small people.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.979
It's very exciting 'cause the last guest they
had was Maddie Ziegler who is the dancer for

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:29.099
Sia' videos.
And now they're going to have BriBry and Dodie.

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.520
We're 21 minutes late for our first TV appearance.
21 minutes late, 21 minutes late.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.060
Oh, Dodie, don't you hate.. being 21 minutes
late?

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.910
Hey, does anyone wanna procreate?
No.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.250
21 minutes late.
*music*

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.300
O Reilly is the surname.
The make up lady was just about to put my

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.800
make up on and she did all the stuff and went..
'oh, you've got lots on already'

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.979
hahaha
You'll have that licked off within about 30 seconds

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.100
oh. hahaha

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.000
Our next guests are soon to be travelling
to the other side of the world. With their

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.999
musical instruments in tow.
Yes, they've been making waves on the internet

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:24.000
and they've got almost half a million subscribers
between them.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.189
They are about to take the world by storm.
Will you guys please put your hands together

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:34.100
and welcome to Swipe Tv, BriBry and Dodie!
*applause*

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.500
And how did you guys actually meet each other?
Oh wow. I used to watch Bry actually.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.300
Oh you.
I met BriBry through a friend at Kings Cross station

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.000
We went to platform 9 and 3 quarters together.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
To share our love of Harry Potter and now
we're friends.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.359
Oh very good. But when did you actually start
making music together?

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.279
Yes. On platform 9 and 3 quarters. We wrote
a song about our love of Ron.

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:09.600
You started making magic.
Ayyy!

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.870
Yes, and if you like BriBry and Dodie and
you want to see more of them, then you better

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.520
check out their Youtube channels, and don't
go anywhere because they're going to be performing

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.700
live in studio.
So will you guys please give it up for BriBry and Dodie!

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.500
*applause*

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:35.500
5 seconds! 4, 3,
'You've been sleeping in, cause you know no better

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.600
and whether you care for' - Shit, sorry.
Oh, sorry! Sorry! Start again, sorry.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:51.000
Bad word. Never say that word.
You all right guys?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.800
Try get it right this time.
'I've been trying to try to work it out,  I can't do it

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.700
'I've been trying to try to work
it out, I can't do it'

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.500
'Shame! When you're all I'm thinking of. You're
alright, love. You're alright'

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.000
'If I'd a way with words, I'd write away the
hurt'

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.500
'You're alright, love. You're alright!'
'I've been trying to try to work it out, I

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.500
can't do it, 'I've been trying to try to work
it out, I can't do it'

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.200
*applause*

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.000
Dodie, what's the one thing you're not allowed
to do on kids TV?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.920
You shouldn't swear.
What's the one thing Brian did today?

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.460
Oh, he swore. He swore. Twice.
Like a dirty sailor.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:49.000
They loved it. They thought I was a rogue.
Oh, he's such a rockstar. He curses when he wants.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.700
He says sh*t and balls.
Very bad.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.000
So we're back after our TV debut. The TV people
actually asked myself and Dodie 'make sure

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.210
you play a happy song'
So we just played a song called 'Alright',

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.900
about my sister having cancer.
I'm too dark to do happy songs.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.700
I've got too many feelings.
Kids were terrifying by the way.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.600
They were great, like, weren't they?
Yeah but

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.710
You're so bad at talking to children.
There was one child and she was really nice

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.440
right, but for the whole duration of our interview,
she was looking directly at me like this..

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.690
Right?
I had her in the corner of my eye so I thought

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.160
it'd be funny to just kinda look over at her
and give her a smile.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.100
So I smiled and made direct eye contact with
her, and she just went like this..

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.030
hahaha
and looked the opposite way.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.100
You're just a scary man.
I'm not scary, I was sitting down!

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.300
Comment question for this week, have you ever
been on TV? How did it go? Did you swear?

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.530
Did a child stare at you?
Yeah, have you had any fame whatsoever in

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.840
any way.
We could get used to that, couldn't we.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.400
Yeah, I quite liked it.
Get your make up done.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.970
Aw, I didn't like that.
No.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.000
I was painted.
'There's nothing wrong with a little bit of paint'

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.900
Nothing wrong with a little bit of
paint'

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.260
Thanks very much, we'll see you on Sunday.
Bye, Dodie.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.000
Bye!
Go home. Yeah, piss off.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.930
Hi! So the song myself and Dodie did on the
telly show was called 'You're Alright' and

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.400
we performed it recently on my music channel,
so please go watch it now if you haven't seen

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.500
it already.
It's got very nice lyrics and it's going to

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.150
be on the album! How exciting.
See you Sunday. Bye.
