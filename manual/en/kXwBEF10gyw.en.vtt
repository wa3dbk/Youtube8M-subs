00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.730
Coach here.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.890
I got my team together.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.060
We're in Sparks, Nevada
at Lean Lemon Fitness.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.190
We're going to work on
our hip hop dancing, which

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.040
is going to get some cardio
going and also some rhythm.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.680
And you know you need rhythm if
you ever come to my warmup zone.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.857
So let's get our hustle on.

00:00:29.857 --> 00:00:31.354
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:31.354 --> 00:00:33.350

00:00:55.306 --> 00:00:58.798
It's battle time.

00:00:58.798 --> 00:00:59.298
Damn.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.237
I think that first move, there's a
little half thing with the knee kick

00:01:12.237 --> 00:01:13.820
that's got me a little bit twisted up.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.090
And then from there, I'm a half step
back the whole rest of the shebang.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.910
And I'm just playing catch-up.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.509
These ladies are fierce.

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.465
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.080
It's a war out there.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.412
Hip hop dancing I never knew
was such a full-on sport.

00:01:41.412 --> 00:01:42.120
I'm not done yet.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.730
I'm not giving up.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.490
I'm going to take this thing
all the way to very end.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.365
I [? ain't ?] scared.

00:01:45.365 --> 00:01:47.556
I [? ain't ?] scared of nothing.

00:01:47.556 --> 00:01:49.050

00:01:59.508 --> 00:02:01.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.986
[CHATTER]

00:02:04.986 --> 00:02:05.520
All right.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.610
I've got my team here.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.810
We just got our battle on at Lean
Lemon, proving that fitness is a blast.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.410
We had so much fun here.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.470
And cardio, rhythm, we got it all.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.770
Check us out next week.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.110
See you soon, Mudders.
