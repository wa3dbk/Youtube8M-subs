00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:02.140
- Hi, it's Parris from Epic Review Guys

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.474
once again putting myself in harm's way

00:00:04.474 --> 00:00:06.077
to find out if something works.

00:00:06.077 --> 00:00:08.201
This is actually supposed
to be completely safe.

00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:12.231
Today I'm checking out My Magic
Mud Tooth Whitening Powder.

00:00:13.572 --> 00:00:16.132
♫ Epic Review Guys ♫

00:00:16.672 --> 00:00:19.772
So, mud in the mouth,
yep that's the story.

00:00:19.772 --> 00:00:22.535
This is made from coconut shells

00:00:22.535 --> 00:00:25.855
that have been turned into charcoal

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:28.538
mixed with some other things including

00:00:28.538 --> 00:00:32.054
volcanic ash and you don't use this

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:33.679
instead of your regular toothpaste,

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:36.512
your regular brushing,
you use it in addition to.

00:00:36.512 --> 00:00:38.049
And they claim in a couple weeks,

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:39.987
your teeth will be whiter.

00:00:39.987 --> 00:00:41.369
Goes for just over $20.

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:43.447
I'll put a link to this
down below the video.

00:00:43.447 --> 00:00:45.467
Now early on, doing reviews,

00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:47.615
I got requests from people to do

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:50.227
tooth-whitening toothpaste,
tooth-whitening gels,

00:00:50.227 --> 00:00:52.326
tooth-whitening strips
that go on your teeth

00:00:52.326 --> 00:00:54.509
and I was a little
hesitant to do it because

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:56.493
I know some of them have
very strong chemicals

00:00:56.493 --> 00:00:57.875
that can harm your teeth.

00:00:57.875 --> 00:00:59.593
And then I started to think what if

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:01.334
everyone's requesting
that as a way of saying

00:01:01.334 --> 00:01:03.065
"Hey your teeth aren't very white."

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:04.853
And I don't have particularly white teeth.

00:01:04.853 --> 00:01:07.209
Most people don't naturally.

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:10.313
Your teeth have a color to them.

00:01:10.313 --> 00:01:14.271
Now that's internal, on the
surface you do get stains

00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:16.535
if you drink a lot of tea, red wine,

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:17.940
you will stain your teeth.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.503
I do drink a fair amount
of tea, coffee also.

00:01:21.135 --> 00:01:24.873
So those stains can come
off with some scrubbing.

00:01:24.873 --> 00:01:26.835
Always worried me a little
when my dental hygienist

00:01:26.835 --> 00:01:29.076
would get on the front of
my teeth though and just,

00:01:29.076 --> 00:01:32.558
I feel her leaning in and using the device

00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:33.894
to try to get the stains off.

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:35.031
I said "Don't worry about it that much.

00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:37.300
"I'd like to have some enamel left."

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.798
Because that was my concern.

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:41.570
So that's the trade-off with the stains

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.750
is not scrubbing so hard or
with something so abrasive

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.550
that you take the enamel,
the protective coating

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.685
off your teeth but scrubbing hard enough

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:51.949
to remove that exterior stain.

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:55.210
Your teeth with this sort of
thing or any kind of thing

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.987
that cleans just the surface stains,

00:01:56.987 --> 00:01:59.724
I don't think will ever
be movie-star white

00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:00.861
like you see people have.

00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:03.961
Those people will have a
chemical put on their teeth

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.364
that actually soaks in and they basically

00:02:06.364 --> 00:02:07.826
are changing the color of their teeth.

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:10.266
They're not restoring the natural color,

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:12.006
they're changing the color of their teeth.

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:13.545
And if you want to do that to your teeth,

00:02:14.258 --> 00:02:16.638
be my guest but I don't
want to put those chemicals

00:02:16.638 --> 00:02:19.494
on my teeth, risk damaging
my gums and my teeth

00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:21.630
to make my teeth an unnatural white.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.290
A little less stained though,
okay, I will try that.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.051
So, saw a TV commercial
for this My Magic Mud.

00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:29.293
This was a couple months back

00:02:29.293 --> 00:02:31.731
and finally decided to give it a try.

00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:34.412
Supposed to take two
weeks of daily brushing

00:02:34.412 --> 00:02:36.227
at least once a day, you
can brush more often,

00:02:36.227 --> 00:02:37.655
it won't hurt anything.

00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:38.462
What they recommend is you

00:02:38.462 --> 00:02:40.506
before going to sleep at night.

00:02:40.506 --> 00:02:42.270
This is a mess.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.266
When I first got it I opened
it up and tried it a little.

00:02:46.684 --> 00:02:47.683
Oh, is it a mess.

00:02:47.683 --> 00:02:49.842
Well, you'll see but if
it actually does work,

00:02:49.842 --> 00:02:52.059
lightens the teeth one or two shades,

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.696
gets rid of some of the stains,

00:02:53.696 --> 00:02:54.880
maybe it'll be worthwhile.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.518
Again just under $20 for this.

00:02:56.518 --> 00:02:59.617
This seems very small and it
is but you don't use much.

00:02:59.617 --> 00:03:01.404
You basically take your toothpaste,

00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:02.461
get a little bit of water on it

00:03:02.461 --> 00:03:04.225
and you just dip it into this powder.

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:06.608
It's not a paste or a
liquid and with that powder

00:03:06.608 --> 00:03:08.604
you brush your teeth for two minutes.

00:03:08.604 --> 00:03:11.820
And they change color and they
don't look white at first.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.643
The best place to
initially open this package

00:03:13.643 --> 00:03:15.743
is over your bathroom sink

00:03:15.743 --> 00:03:17.463
because the black powder will come out

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:19.320
and just start falling everywhere

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.120
if it's around on the sides of it

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.456
which I hope it isn't
anymore here, let's see.

00:03:24.448 --> 00:03:25.726
Don't do it over white carpet

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:27.944
or if you're wearing
light-colored clothing.

00:03:27.944 --> 00:03:29.499
Can you see the black powder in there?

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:32.923
It looks like ash, really
that's what it is in large part.

00:03:32.923 --> 00:03:37.521
It's burnt coconut husks
turned into carbon.

00:03:37.521 --> 00:03:39.042
Gonna take my toothbrush.

00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:40.957
You can use an electric with this

00:03:40.957 --> 00:03:43.244
but the brush heads are
so expensive on that

00:03:43.244 --> 00:03:43.983
and they don't look very nice

00:03:43.983 --> 00:03:45.724
once they're stained black so I'm using

00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:49.160
just a couple dollar toothbrush here.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.005
I have dipped the bristles into the water

00:03:52.005 --> 00:03:54.945
now I'm gonna take just a
little bit of the powder.

00:03:59.164 --> 00:04:02.468
Start with that much and see
what that does to my teeth.

00:04:02.846 --> 00:04:04.472
Now it probably seems
like that small amount

00:04:04.472 --> 00:04:06.086
that I took just on the
tips of the bristles

00:04:06.086 --> 00:04:08.572
isn't enough to do anything,
well take a look at this.

00:04:09.621 --> 00:04:11.473
I'll zoom in here in a minute.

00:04:18.096 --> 00:04:19.369
(speaking with brush in mouth)

00:04:21.044 --> 00:04:23.480
Yeah, not white, not yet.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.813
Okay, that's what it looks like

00:04:25.813 --> 00:04:27.363
when you're brushing with this.

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:32.924
It's messy.

00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:36.884
Okay, that's about two
minutes of brushing.

00:04:37.435 --> 00:04:38.626
Here's the toothbrush.

00:04:38.626 --> 00:04:39.881
This is why I didn't use my expensive

00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:41.901
electric toothbrush to do this.

00:04:41.901 --> 00:04:44.247
Now I've swallowed some of this

00:04:44.247 --> 00:04:45.279
and it doesn't hurt you.

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.579
Again, it's coconut husk

00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:50.724
and a little bit of pumice,
a little volcanic clay,

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:52.883
so it's just gonna pass right through you

00:04:52.883 --> 00:04:54.683
but probably you want to
go to the sink and spit.

00:04:54.683 --> 00:04:56.041
You will notice all around your sink

00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:59.047
you're gonna have a nice
big black color as well.

00:04:59.047 --> 00:05:01.726
I'm back from the bathroom,
I have washed my brush.

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:06.352
Pretty clean but a little
bit of black residual color

00:05:06.352 --> 00:05:08.974
to me it looks like and on my
teeth I've rinsed five times

00:05:08.974 --> 00:05:10.948
before I didn't have any
more black coming out

00:05:10.948 --> 00:05:12.337
when I was spitting.

00:05:12.957 --> 00:05:15.661
And that's what you're looking at.

00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:18.424
I'll take the My Magic
Mud and put it by my sink

00:05:18.424 --> 00:05:21.523
and try to remember every
night to brush with this.

00:05:21.523 --> 00:05:23.323
In the morning I'll be
brushing with my regular

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:26.283
electric toothbrush
and fluoride toothpaste

00:05:26.283 --> 00:05:29.441
but every night with this
and I will be back in a week.

00:05:29.441 --> 00:05:32.842
After a week we'll see,
I'll show you up close,

00:05:32.842 --> 00:05:34.654
whether, you can tell me whether you see

00:05:34.654 --> 00:05:35.942
any improvement or not.

00:05:35.942 --> 00:05:37.836
Then I'll do another week
of brushing every night

00:05:37.836 --> 00:05:40.401
with this for the
recommended two-week period

00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:42.003
where I should definitely be seeing

00:05:42.003 --> 00:05:44.058
some whitening of my teeth.

00:05:44.058 --> 00:05:44.999
Now if you'd like to get this

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:47.320
and try along with me that's great

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.293
and hopefully you would
have good results as well.

00:05:49.293 --> 00:05:51.361
I will tell you, however, that I am not

00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:52.880
going to stop drinking tea

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.377
which means unless I continue to use this

00:05:55.377 --> 00:05:57.722
or use it, I don't know,
two, three days a month

00:05:57.722 --> 00:05:59.498
or something to keep those stains off,

00:05:59.498 --> 00:06:00.613
they will come back.

00:06:00.613 --> 00:06:01.622
They're surface stains.

00:06:01.622 --> 00:06:02.980
They're based on the food you eat

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.259
and the drinks you drink.

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:05.802
If you keep eating and
drinking the same things,

00:06:05.802 --> 00:06:07.859
you're just going to restain your teeth.

00:06:07.859 --> 00:06:09.879
But I suppose if it made
a noticeable difference,

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:11.800
maybe I'd dedicate a few days a month

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.690
to brushing with this just so
I could take those stains off.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.698
I've heard good things about My Magic Mud

00:06:17.698 --> 00:06:19.173
so let's see what happens.

00:06:19.173 --> 00:06:20.600
You can be the judge of whether my teeth

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.634
actually get whitened or not.

00:06:22.634 --> 00:06:24.989
I'll be back in one week
and then again in two weeks.

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:26.313
