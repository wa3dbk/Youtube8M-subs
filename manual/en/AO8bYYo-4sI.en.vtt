Welcome to eCligner's "Dental Impressions" demonstration video!

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to eCligner's "Dental Impressions" demonstration video!

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.780
This video will demonstrate the basic procedures of taking a patient's alginate impression then creating dental casts from them.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.079
This video will demonstrate the basic procedures of taking a patient's alginate impression then creating dental casts from them.

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:11.579
This video will demonstrate the basic procedures of taking a patient's alginate impression then creating dental casts from them.

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.529
There are two types of dental trays: One for the upper jaw, the Maxilla, and the other for the lower jaw, the mandible.

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:15.700
There are two types of dental trays: One for the upper jaw, the Maxilla, and the other for the lower jaw, the mandible.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.390
There are two types of dental trays: One for the upper jaw, the Maxilla, and the other for the lower jaw, the mandible.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.920
There are two types of dental trays: One for the upper jaw, the Maxilla, and the other for the lower jaw, the mandible.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:29.920
Dental trays come in three different sizes: Small, Medium, and Large.

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:35.600
Estimate the tray size and check if it fits the patient's mouth.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.150
Make sure that the tray fits comfortably in the patient's mouth and double check with the patient by asking.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:47.150
Make sure that the tray fits comfortably in the patient's mouth and double check with the patient by asking.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.750
Mix the appropriate ratio of alginate according to your brand's instructions, and spread them evenly on the tray.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.040
Mix the appropriate ratio of alginate according to your brand's instructions, and spread them evenly on the tray.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:24.040
Mix the appropriate ratio of alginate according to your brand's instructions, and spread them evenly on the tray.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.640
Apply more alginate on the posterior region since it requires more alginate for it to be fully captured.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.720
Apply more alginate on the posterior region since it requires more alginate for it to be fully captured.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:40.720
Apply more alginate on the posterior region since it requires more alginate for it to be fully captured.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.930
Place the tray inside the patient's mouth and make sure that the posterior and the anterior gingival is pressed deeply to ensure the quality of the expression.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.350
Place the tray inside the patient's mouth and make sure that the posterior and the anterior gingival is pressed deeply to ensure the quality of the expression.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.940
Place the tray inside the patient's mouth and make sure that the posterior and the anterior gingival is pressed deeply to ensure the quality of the expression.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:06.940
Carefully take out the tray from the patient's mouth.

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.089
It takes approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds for the alginate to harden. Swiftly finish the application before it hardens.

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:16.489
It takes approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds for the alginate to harden. Swiftly finish the application before it hardens.

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:26.489
It takes approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds for the alginate to harden. Swiftly finish the application before it hardens.

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.919
Mix the stone plaster until its consistency is thick and not droopy.

00:02:34.919 --> 00:03:03.919
Mix the stone plaster until its consistency is thick and not droopy.

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.199
To avoid bubbles from forming, place the tray against a vibrating apparatus while pouring the stone plaster on the tray.

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:29.199
To avoid bubbles from forming, place the tray against a vibrating apparatus while pouring the stone plaster on the tray.

00:03:31.459 --> 00:04:13.459
The stone plaster should be poured from one corner to the other, while shaking off excess water during the process.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:33.319
Unload the rest of the stone plaster on top of the cast to give the model more height and space. This is especially important when the model is 3D scanned, because it provides eCligner technicians with more space to work with.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:56.319
After the stone plaster is fully applied on the tray, it is important to flip it on its back where the stone plaster is applied.
If not flipped on the stone plaster side, the stone plaster's weight may cause the alginate to expand and change form.
Resting it on the stone plaster side prevents this from happening.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:09.810
When the cast is completely hardened, carefully remove it from the tray.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.680
And there you have it, your very own eCligner-friendly, dental impression!

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.380
Thank you for watching, and Good Luck!
