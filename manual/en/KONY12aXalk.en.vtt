00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.479
&gt;&gt; KATHY: Welcome to McDonald's, can we
take your order?

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:12.479
&gt;&gt; ALI: On Wednesday, we got the chance to
work behind the counter at a McDonald's

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.740
restaurant.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.750
&gt;&gt; KATHY: We need some fries. Fry girl!

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.760
&gt;&gt; MCDONALD'S STAFF: So this is drive through.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.039
&gt;&gt; NAOMI: Yeah, yeah.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:38.489
&gt;&gt; MCDONALD'S STAFF: This is our merge point
right here, because we have two lanes going.

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.339
&gt;&gt; NAOMI: Yeah.

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:44.069
&gt;&gt; LAURA: There you go....there you go! Your
spoon's in the bag.

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:46.219
&gt;&gt; MCDONALD'S STAFF: Ahh, very good.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:47.929
&gt;&gt; LAURA: Good job, Ali!

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:49.219
&gt;&gt; ALI: Oh yeah.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.519
&gt;&gt; MCDONALD'S STAFF: It's all set up for
you, right here.

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:54.929
&gt;&gt; KATHY: Oh, now I get it. Okay.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:55.179
&gt;&gt; MCDONALD'S STAFF: Good job, guys.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.390
&gt;&gt; LAURA: It's hard.

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:55.519
That's all I'm going to say.

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:55.859
No, it's not as easy as it looks.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.190
&gt;&gt; CORINNE: Today we spent the day at Cargill
Meats Canada

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.609
and you can be assured that every hamburger
that is served in a McDonald's restaurant

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.940
is the best hamburger that it can possibly
be.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.740
&gt;&gt; HANS: You're going to come around and
wash your hands right away.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.520
So everything is received there, comes in
here.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.880
But before anything comes into the plant we
get what's called a "certificate of analysis,"

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.689
which means that we have to receive that before
we will break the seal

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.999
on the truck and unload any product at all.

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:27.200
&gt;&gt; CORINNE: At McDonald's, you can be assured
you are getting a top quality hamburger.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.710
&gt;&gt; HANS: Anybody that does not, if we have
not received that certificate,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.609
waits and we don't care how long they have
to wait.

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:33.409
&gt;&gt; CORINNE: Wait outside?

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.310
&gt;&gt; HANS: They will wait outside.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.130
Nothing comes into this facility unless it
absolutely got that certificate.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.520
If there's any kind of question about what
happened to the seal on the truck, they're

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.069
going back.

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.189
&gt;&gt; NAOMI: The quality procedures were very
overwhelming.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.170
I didn't really realize how intense and
how intricate everything was.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.829
&gt;&gt; ROBERT: And you'll see that we perform
2482 recorded checks every day.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.719
&gt;&gt; LAURA: I was quite impressed with the fact
they do a four-hour cleanse and sanitization

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:02.649
process every single day.

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.200
&gt;&gt; BRIAN: I mean if something is not visually
clean, it's not clean. I won't start.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.889
&gt;&gt; HANS: First you do a dry clean.

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:12.480
Foam the equipment so it's all foamed. You
can see where the soap is.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.700
Then it's hosed off, then sanitized.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.010
&gt;&gt; BRIAN: It may look clean, but there might
be bacteria on it.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.110
So we have to track that

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.430
and measure how clean the cleaners are getting,
in the facility.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.330
&gt;&gt; LAURA: Just touching on food quality, I
think after today I learned a lot of the actual

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.209
process ...

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.100
and they are very, very meticulous.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.049
&gt;&gt; HANS: You can see -- we've got people
that are inspecting,

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.620
making sure that there's nothing that came
through the processing plant

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.329
that we don't want to put in our hamburgers.

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.040
&gt;&gt; ROBERT: We have our metal detection that's
documented and recorded every hour.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.750
We test to as small as 1.5mm ferrous.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.200
And I'll pass this around.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.959
That's the size our metal detectors will
pull out if there is any metal that goes through.

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.340
&gt;&gt; HANS: What's going to happen is, he's
going to put a plastic disk that's got metal

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.540
in it on that belt.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.450
What you'll see is that gate flip up and
the burgers will come down.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.750
We're testing that to make sure the machine
works every hour.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.000
&gt;&gt; LAURA: If they have metal detection then
obviously they're looking for it.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.379
So is it something that's common?

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.409
&gt;&gt; HANS: No, it's not a common occurrence.

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.689
Metal detection is a standard food industry
practice.

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:26.379
We are detecting at a finer sensitivity than
the other beef plants that we know of.

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.010
All of the things that we are doing here are
a secondary step.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.180
It's like what you would do, really, in
your own kitchen.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.049
&gt;&gt; BRIAN: That's part of our process control,
meaning we make a very consistent product--

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.290
not only shape, thickness, all those things,

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.349
but also it's got to have very consistent
fat content in the patty.

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:46.459
&gt;&gt; HANS: What we're going to do now,

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.319
I will cook up some hamburgers on the grill.
Let's get them going.

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.519
And then what we'll do is some comparison
on Quarters and Angus,

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.800
to show you exactly what we do. There we go.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.300
&gt;&gt; BRIAN: For our history evaluation, we get
samples about once every hour.â€¨

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.209
&gt;&gt; CORINNE: You're making a hamburger every
hour?

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.450
&gt;&gt; BRIAN: Yes. So the things we're looking
for is: appearance of the patty,

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.749
the texture and mouth feel, and the aroma
and flavor.

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:16.459
&gt;&gt; HANS: See if you can taste the difference.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.760
&gt;&gt; NAOMI: I don't' know. We kind of switched
it on each other and now I forget which one

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.600
was which.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.430
&gt;&gt; CORINNE: No, I didn't taste the other
one yet.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.919
&gt;&gt; ALI: Oh you didn't taste the other one
yet?

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.320
&gt;&gt; NAOMI: There is no filler. There is no
preservative.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.139
&gt;&gt; CORINNE: They are a hundred percent ground
beef.

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.180
&gt;&gt; KATHY: It's like burgers that you would
buy at the grocery store.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.410
&gt;&gt; HANS: A lot of what we do, honestly, is
around consistency,

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.930
because you have to hit the mark every time.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.550
You know, you're cooking a hamburger at
home,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.010
you know they're going to be different,
different size and shape.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.460
You're going to cook them different lengths
of time.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.290
Here, it's the same.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.400
And we need that, because when they are out
in the store,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.080
the grills are set to cooking times on each
of the products,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:01.080
and if there's any deviation in our product,
it won't cook correctly.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.710
So it's very important that we get it done
correctly here.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.630
&gt;&gt; HANS: This has been really fun for us.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.630
It's really refreshing, actually, to come
in and have an excellent discussion

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.970
and an open discussion about concerns.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.850
And, you know, where your questions are coming
from are great for us.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.610
&gt;&gt; CORINNE: So we're at the end of trip
number 2.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.330
It went a lot faster than trip number 1.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.870
But we saw some amazing things and we're
really getting into the nitty-gritty of what

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.460
we're here to do.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.840
&gt;&gt; ALI: I'm just really happy to know where
my food is coming from.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.580
It's, you know, just a small little thing,
but it is comforting to know

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.750
that the cows are from Canada

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.920
and that they're made in plants in Canada
and it's shipped across Canada.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.740
&gt;&gt; LAURA: I'll be honest, I thought I was
going to come out of there and be a vegetarian.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.070
[Others laugh.] I'm not even joking, I really
did.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.290
"I'm going in there, I'm going to be
totally freaked out, and I'm never going

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.890
to eat meat again."

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:58.270
And I totally didn't feel that way. I can't
wait to have a burger!
