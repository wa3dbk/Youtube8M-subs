00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.680
summertime often means rest and
relaxation and a break from school for

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.650
many students

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.420
but a group of nearly three dozen students
is hard at work on the Iowa State campus

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.679
this is something that not everybody gets to do, especially someone so young.

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.199
13 high school students in 22
undergraduate students are part of the

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.650
largest class of George Washington
Carver interns through the college for

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.349
Agriculture and Life Sciences

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.800
the eight-week program immerses
multicultural students and breakthrough

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.579
research

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.550
encourages them to pursue education
careers in STEM fields

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.610
science technology engineering and math

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.550
program also attracts students to Iowa State to obtain a bachelor's or advanced

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.520
degree

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.190
we bring students in from all across the
United States to study under

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.830
faculty members here in the college
they can be doing anything

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.270
from testing soil to heat stress and resistance of soy bean plants

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.260
tuskegee university students Jimmy le

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.159
brazelton

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.400
are working on

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.030
mapping the genes in soybean plants
they will try to alter the makeup of the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.649
plant

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.670
making soy beans resistant to sudden death
syndrome rather than focusing on

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.829
external factors

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:21.380
as a way to cure the disease being at a
research one institution there are using

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.350
some pretty

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.509
high  technological

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.630
instruments right as so as some in their
schools they don't have opportunities to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.310
use this type of equipment

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.380
or they might have older versions at
their school and so to be using a

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.069
state-of-the-art technology

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.619
is a pretty amazing experience for some
of them

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.819
helping them get some invaluable
hands-on research

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.439
I'm actually out there getting some
experience, getting

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.060
training

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.780
from  great professors who are

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.200
at the top of their field

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.829
who are very humble about what they do

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.939
they get to interact with industry professionals they
are able to networks they can be

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.130
key in relationship building when they
want to

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.420
pursue jobs are they want to pursue
internships

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.159
or even graduate programs and the
students say the one on one interaction

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.140
with professors at Iowa State

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.569
is unlike any other they actually sit
down with us

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.860
talk to us make sure that we
understand what's going on

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.750
so that we can take it further by ourselves

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.849
some of  them by the end of  this summer will be
our research papers with the faculty so

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.780
there have their names on publications
and how big is that to have your name on

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.079
a publication here

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.790
high school it's really cool I really
enjoy it because we've been thrust into

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.629
the project

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.170
head first and we've been since the
first day we've been doing

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.049
projects on our own everything now we
are almost completely self sufficient in

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.079
the lab both the students and the
organizer's agree

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.610
this program is very rewarding you get
impact and inspire minds

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.470
the impact is just tremendous just to 
know that's something we're doing as

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.430
interns could potentially change how the
crop is cultivated and grown

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.459
and save billions of dollars a year in
soybean crop this is almost overwhelming

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.989
makes me feel like I'm really making a
difference but actually sitting down and

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.930
doing something that really really matters

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.750
