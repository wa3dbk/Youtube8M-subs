00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.440
Now I'm going to talk to you a little bit
about liqueurs that you might use. Now liqueurs

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.610
versus liquors are different because they
are a little bit sweeter and generally they

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.619
have a strong flavor of some type of either
fruit or just taste in general and they also

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.070
tend to have less alcohol than a liquor. So
first off, we'll talk about some basic ones

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.370
that you'll most likely need if you want to
have it in your own home bar or if you go

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.000
to a bar what they'll most likely have. Usually
they generally have some type of peach snaps,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.970
because it's a lot of drinks, such as Sex
on the Beach made with such a drink, such

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.789
a liquor, liqueur. Next, we're going to talk
about Triple Sec. Triple Sec is a really necessary

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:45.699
liqueur to use because it's in a lot of drink
such as Margaritas and other drinks for use

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.289
such as Kamakazees where you need a little
bit of that orange flavor. In addition to

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.280
that, another one to know about is Blue Corn
Style. This is the same taste as Triple Sec,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.719
it's exactly the same, it's just a different
color. So you can use that if you want to,

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.739
contrary to its color, it's going to taste
like orange. Another one to know about is

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.180
Amaretto. Amaretto or any other similar type
of almond flavored liqueur is great, and this

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.330
is use a lot of times in anything where you
want that almond taste. So a toasted almond,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.271
a roasted toasted almond, anything like that
is going to get Amaretto. The next one's to

00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:21.860
know about is Kahlua, this is a coffee liqueur,
this is probably the most common one used.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.300
There's also other basic friends of coffee
liqueurs that you can use that are just use

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.890
coffee liqueur, so you can always get one
of those if you want as well. But this is

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.400
great. It goes in Black Russians and White
Russians, those are probably the most popular

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.820
two drinks to use with Kahlua. Some other
ones that are probably less common but also

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.480
good to know about is Creme De Menthe. This
is obviously flavored like mint and its use

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.921
in drinks such as Grasshoppers and other drinks
that just need that minty kick. Also, as you

00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:52.420
can tell by the color, it's extremely green
color, so it's going to flavor what or color

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.200
whatever drink you pour in with a very bright
green color. Typically this is mix with a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.310
milk or a milk type drink. You can also get
it, if you don't want that green color, you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.920
can get it in a clear color. Another liqueur
I want to talk about is Razzmatazz. This is

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.100
a raspberry flavored drink or raspberry flavored
liqueur. It's very similar also to Sloegin,

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.470
you can replace any of these three with Razzmatazz
either or Sloegin or Chambord, can all be

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.751
replace. Chambord is the fancy one, it costs
a little bit more and Razzmatazz and Sloegin

00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:31.330
are a little bit cheaper. So these are the
ones you want to go with if you're just making

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.130
quick drinks to people. And these are your
basic liqueurs.
