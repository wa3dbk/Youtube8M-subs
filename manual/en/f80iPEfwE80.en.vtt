00:00:02.367 --> 00:00:05.000
This consumer update is
brought to you by the U.S.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.300
Food and Drug
Administration.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.166
FDA is changing the
labeling on sunscreens to

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.300
make it easier for
everyone to protect

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.066
themselves from the
harmful rays of the sun.

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.467
We encourage consumers
to use broad spectrum

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:22.433
sunscreens that are
labeled with an SPF value

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:24.500
of at least 15.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.166
These sunscreens reduce
the risk of sunburn, skin

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:30.166
cancer, and early skin
aging when used as

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:33.300
directed with other sun
protection measures.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.400
For the best protection
also limit your exposure

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.900
to the sun with protective
clothing, shade, or by

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.233
staying indoors,
especially between 10 AM

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:46.200
and 2 PM when the sun's
rays are strongest.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.000
Many are familiar with
"SPF" values, which refer

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.533
to protection
against sunburns.

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.400
The term "Broad Spectrum,"
which may be less

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.867
familiar, refers to
protection from the sun's

00:00:57.867 --> 00:00:59.800
full range of light ...

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.367
... which causes sunburns,
skin cancer, and early

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:06.266
skin aging, such
as wrinkles.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.400
It is important to protect
against ALL types of skin

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.166
damage caused by the
sun-not only sunburn.

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.834
FDA's new labeling
requirements will make it

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:17.934
easier for consumers
to choose the best

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:19.633
protection.

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:23.300
In 2012, manufacturers
will be required to prove

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.934
all "Broad
Spectrum" claims.

00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:28.600
When used as directed
with other measures - only

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.266
sunscreens with "Broad
Spectrum" AND an SPF of AT

00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:35.633
LEAST 15 will protect from
the sun's full range of

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:36.667
light.

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:40.867
FDA does not have evidence
that SPF values above 50

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:43.533
provide any
additional benefits.

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.266
There is no such thing
as a waterproof or sweat

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:47.900
proof sunscreen.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.467
Once wet, all
sunscreens begin to lose

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:52.567
effectiveness.

00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:55.100
Only the term "water
resistant" with the length

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.800
of time water resistance
lasts will appear on

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.533
sunscreens.

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:02.834
If this language does not
appear, the product is not

00:02:02.834 --> 00:02:05.200
water resistant.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.633
With spray-on sunscreen,
avoid breathing it in and

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:11.467
do not spray it
directly on the face.

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:15.033
Instead, spray it onto
your hands and then apply

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:16.500
it to your face.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.900
Always follow the
directions on your

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.533
sunscreen product.

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:21.633
This includes applying
and spreading it on

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:25.367
thoroughly, and reapplying
it at least every 2 hours,

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:27.467
more often if you're
sweating or jumping in and

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:28.734
out of the water.

00:02:28.734 --> 00:02:31.367
While proper clothing and
limited exposure remain

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:34.600
our best protection from
the sun, improvements to

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.100
sunscreen labels will make
it easier to use these

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.000
products safely
and effectively.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.633
