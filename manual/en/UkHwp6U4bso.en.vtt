00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.939
you may have noticed an increase in
prices for a while I'm so bartenders are

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:06.339
looking for other ingredients to

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:10.540
replace the line our lives now the
reason why this is happening here in for

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.940
your scene is increase in prices is
because

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.810
%uh some lime trees are dealing with a
bacterial diseases are some known as

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.840
H lb and also climate change it plays a
role in this

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.460
%uh the weather has been very cold and
rainy in areas in Mexico where they grow

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.349
lime trees

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.710
so as a result they have limited
supplies

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.070
and they have to sell it at an increase
price so the farmers can't make a little

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.620
money

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.309
well there's another element to this
that is actually really really scary

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.200
since limes RI a hot commodity and since
there are fewer of them

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.940
cartels are now stopping trucks with
farmers that have the ones in the back

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.590
and they're basically giving them like a
ransom they're holding the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.379
the lime hostage until the farmers pay
for it

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.010
right so they'll pay I don't know how
much like hundred dollars thousand

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.090
dollars whatever it is

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.729
and then the farmers have to transfer
those costs on to us

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.850
it sounds like the cartels are lining
their pockets with profits from the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.450
lives they've crossed the line here

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.920
okay yeah it does matter now with good
UK

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.570
so I like a climate change his so

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.229
worked with the car to drug cartels to
school was over online prices

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.650
yes let me give you an exact example
company is interesting I'm the price the

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.790
wind is about 100 per 40 pound box today

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.430
up from the usual price about
twenty-five dollars a box this time last

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.009
year

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.180
cheeses what am I gonna put my yeah
Corolla now

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.460
her gay so a looked

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.549
the the to me the most important this
story is

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.829
once you have bad laws like they are war
on drugs

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.079
and you create a problem like the drug
cartels in then becomes

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.229
a bigger and bigger problem and takes on
a life of its own

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.710
so the same thing that happened with
probation so the the gangsters the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.409
mobsters grew outta probation

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.149
and when they do they go to shop owners
and they say will break your legs unless

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.110
you give us

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.349
money for extortion all that stuff right
and so and

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.060
they went into a every piece of our
lives and they grew bigger better in

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.800
this case is console absurd so large

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.989
yet they're all the airlines hostage
right

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.879
city is so I'm maybe the problem is the
war on drugs the first box

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.670
I it's interesting how this goes back to
the war on drugs but it's true the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.959
cartels are so powerful as a as a result
about prohibition

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.720
that they are able to hold the limes
hostage which is insane it's so crazy

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.730
yeah I try to be with other line fun I
couldn't I well that's good

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.400
ok yeah I
