00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.149
Well, it was an unbelievably hard decision
because Ashley is a player that I and the rest of

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:10.520
my staff really appreciate. I think he is
a magnificent player and what he's done for

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.820
England is second to none. And at the end
of the day, it was a decision I had to take,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:23.400
and it was a hard job to ring Ashley to explain
that to him, and I can only be unbelievably

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.900
grateful for the gracious way that he accepted
the decision and accepted that it was a choice

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.370
I had to make. Everyone knows what Ashley
Cole is and what Ashley Cole can do, and circumstances

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.340
will prove whether the decision to take the
younger player was the right one or not. I

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.700
had to make a choice, and I've gone for Luke,
and I can only say that I'm unbelievably impressed

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.000
by the maturity and graciousness that Ashley
Cole showed.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.700
Frank has been captain of the team on many
occasions during my two years. He's been the

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:08.000
vice captain to Steven Gerrard. He still plays
a very important role in his club side, despite

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.010
the fact that he's not as young as some of
the other players, and we think his leadership

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.850
qualities and the qualities that he will bring
to us in Brazil, the help he will give us all,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.400
and the ability he has a player make
him a man who fully justifies his selection.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:37.100
The only one I would say that seriously I
suppose still poses a question is Phil Jones.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.400
He had his shoulder injury a week ago today.
Everything points to the fact that it's a

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:51.700
three week injury to be back fit to play,
but we can't guarantee that and as a result,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.700
I will be talking John Stones and Jon Flanagan
with us on this trip, and John Stones will

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.950
be Phil Jones' replacement if by the second
of June, we are not confident that Phil Jones

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.059
will be fit, but everything tells me he will be.

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:17.000
Well if it's up to Wayne. If it has anything
to do with desire and ambition and wanting

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.870
to do it, then there's no doubt in my mind
that we have nothing to fear with Wayne in

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.499
that respect. At the moment, he's in this
week. Well, I've actually said to the players

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:34.359
that I'm more than happy for them to go and
forget football for a week and go and get

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:40.459
themselves mentally prepared for the many
weeks we have ahead. Wayne's decided to take

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.909
some physios with him where he's going to
continue his programme because he's so determined

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:50.989
that when we meet up on the 19th, he'll be
able to join in with us straight away. Attitude -

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:58.100
spot on. Desire - could not be better. Has
he got the ability? Yes, he has. So, it's

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.669
just a question of bringing on the matches
and hoping on that particular day he can find

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.000
the form that makes Wayne Rooney who he is.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.700
We shouldn't get hung up I don't think on
the fact that there are some youngsters in

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.400
there, but I must emphasise one thing. They
are there because I think they deserve to

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.400
be there, and they are capable of playing.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.200
If we're going to win it, we'll have
to play very well. If we're going to win it,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.790
we'll have to prepare very well. If we're
going to win it, this talented group of players,

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.900
as I think many of you in the room would
agree with are talented players, they've got

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.300
to show their talent. I think we're right
to have some degree of optimism. I think we're

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:41.200
right to work on the basis that there is a
mood of positivity in the country, if I understand

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.800
it correctly, and we're going to try to feed
off that, get our energy from it, and make

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.000
certain that we do nothing to let people down.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.400
Steven is mentally extremely strong. He's
extremely proud. He loves Liverpool, but he

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.449
also loves England, and I don't have any doubt
whatsoever that he'll be as good as he ever

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.300
was during this World Cup.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.400
If these players here believe we're not really
very good. We've just an ordinary bunch.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.769
What do they believe? What do they think they
can do?

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.539
Well, you'd have to ask them individually,
but if I get to my feelings about what they

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:24.419
think they can do, they think they can have
a very good tournament. They can win matches,

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.860
and they can go a good way in the tournament.
That's what they think, and that's what they'll

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.599
be hoping for.
