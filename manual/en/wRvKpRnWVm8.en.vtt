00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.960
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ketchum: This video will compare and
contrast the two types of smooth muscle: single-unit,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.500
also known as visceral smooth muscle, and
multi-unit. Multi-unit is in the first column.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.970
Single-unit is in the second column. Single-unit,
again, is also called visceral smooth muscle.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.949
So be sure you know single-unit as visceral
smooth and use those terms interchangeably.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.390
So let’s take a look at the difference between
these two types of smooth muscle. We will

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.500
do this by looking at several characteristics.
First, multi-unit smooth muscle functions

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.700
as discrete functional units. So that means
each muscle fiber contracts independently

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:57.000
of all the other fibers. Is that similar to
skeletal muscle? The answer is yes. Remember

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.100
skeletal muscles have motor neurons that tell
this fiber over here to contract, and a motor

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.640
neuron over here telling this muscle fiber
to contract. So these muscle fibers are contracting

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.600
independently of each other. Multi-unit is
the same, and is therefore neurogenic. What’s

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.600
that mean? Remember to break down the words.
The suffix “genic” means producing. So

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:36.500
what is causing or initiating the contraction
of the muscle? The neuron. Remember—neurogenic.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.049
The next characteristic to discuss is where
in the body would one find multi-unit smooth

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.560
muscle? These are the places that you would
find multi-unit muscles, some of which we’ve

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.079
already talked about. But we weren’t to
muscle yet, so it wouldn’t have done any

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:59.289
good for me to tell you what kind of muscle
it was. The following smooth muscles are multi-unit:

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:06.249
ciliary muscles. What are ciliary muscles
important for? Hopefully you answered accommodation.

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:12.670
The circular and longitudinal muscles of the
iris are also multi-unit. What are the circular

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.500
and radial muscles in the iris important for?
The pupillary reflex. The smooth muscle at

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.200
the base of the hair follicle is also multi-unit
smooth. What is it when your muscles contract

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.069
and the hair stands up—what do you call
that? Those are goose bumps, right? So goose

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:40.010
bumps are caused by multi-unit smooth muscle.
Okay, some of the smaller airways of the lungs

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.780
have multi-unit smooth muscle, and then the
walls of your larger blood vessels—which

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:54.100
we haven’t talked about those quite yet—are
also types of multi-unit smooth muscle. The

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.890
next characteristic for multi-unit smooth
muscle is that these smooth muscle cells are

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.700
not self-excitable. This should make sense
because they are neurogenic; they rely on

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:17.000
a neuron to tell them to contract. So these
cells are not self-excitable, and since these

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.200
cells are not self-excitable, they have no
gap junctions. This is the last characteristic

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.489
for multi-unit smooth muscle.

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:35.600
All right, so now let’s compare those characteristics
to single-unit smooth muscle, which remember,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.930
is also called visceral smooth muscle. So
single-unit smooth muscle becomes excited

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:51.200
and contracts as a single-unit. This is called
a functional syncytium. This is where the

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.999
whole muscle works as one unit. Rather than
independent fibers contracting, the whole

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:04.579
muscle contracts. Let me give you an example.
All right, let’s talk about the single-unit

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:10.959
smooth muscle of the uterus and childbirth.
During birth, is it a good idea to have the

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:17.639
smooth muscle of the uterus function as one
huge unit or for each fiber to independently

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:24.100
be stimulated while poor mom sits there waiting
for those independent contractions? That will

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.440
not make mom happy. The single-unit smooth
muscle of the uterus is an example of a functional

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.220
syncytium because all of those muscle cells
together will function as one, and therefore

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:45.100
one huge contraction can occur all at once.
So it makes it easier on mom to give birth.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:51.470
This means that single-unit smooth muscle
is myogenic. Which means what? Remember to

00:04:51.470 --> 00:05:00.500
break down the word. “Genic” means producing
and “myo” is muscle, therefore, it’s

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.030
the muscle cells that initiate contraction.
And let’s say it’s this muscle cell here

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:14.900
that initiates contraction. How does this
next cell receive that message? Through gap

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.330
junctions, that’s correct. See how the two
go hand in hand? If the muscle is myogenic,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:29.100
it will have gap junctions. If it is neurogenic,
there is no need for gap junctions. So where

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:36.300
in the body would one find single-unit smooth
muscle? Walls of your hollow organs. So I

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.800
gave you an example of the uterus, therefore
the reproductive tract has single-unit smooth

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:49.900
muscle, but also the digestive tract and the
urinary bladder are good examples.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:56.069
In single-unit smooth muscle there are also
these pacemaker potentials and slow-wave potentials.

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:02.000
I’m just going to briefly introduce you
to them here, as we will discuss them in detail

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.720
later. Let’s look at the pacemaker potential
first. A pacemaker potential is a type of

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.979
graded potential. So when you look at this
pacemaker potential, does this cell stay at

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:22.100
rest for very long? No, it is only at rest
momentarily. As soon as the membrane potential

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:29.600
comes back to rest, another action potential
fires, but it has to come back down to rest

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:36.099
in order to fire another action potential.
This entire graph we are going to call pacemaker

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:41.379
activity. We’ll talk about why those are
important and the mechanisms involved at a

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:48.900
later time. Now let’s look at a slow-wave
potential. These are also types of graded

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.620
potentials. These are important in the gut;
they are important in digestion. Let’s look

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.300
at this graph of a slow-wave potential. So
in a slow-wave potential, does the cell always

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:08.500
reach threshold? No. When the cell does reach
threshold, however, does the cell fire only

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:17.300
one action potential or several action potentials?
The cell fires several action potentials.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:24.600
Furthermore, the cell is only at rest momentarily,
and if the cell does not reach threshold (which

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:32.700
a lot of times it doesn’t) an action potential
will not occur. If the cell does reach threshold,

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:38.849
multiple action potentials will occur. This
is very different than a pacemaker potential.

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:44.900
We will come back to pacemaker potentials
when we study the heart and slow-wave potentials

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.809
when we study the regulation of digestion.
