00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.800
Prophecies

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.900
He's a French painter who came to our prison in search of inspiration.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.400
Is he famous?

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.448
Of course!

00:00:53.448 --> 00:00:53.948
[Whistling]

00:00:56.873 --> 00:00:58.900
I like the sound it's making.

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:01.300
Come on, you dunce!

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:04.213
[Yelps]

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.300
Careful, the climb may not end well.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.200
Joe?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.100
JOE?

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.526
Behind you, you dimwit!

00:01:14.526 --> 00:01:15.417
Over here!

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.364
What does that shorty want?

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.719
The wall will crumble soon like a sandcastle. Boris just had a vision.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.600
Seeing visions, eh? What a lunatic.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.900
Boris is always right.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.940
Earthquake! Get away from the wall, quick!

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.900
[Yelling]

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.400
The guy's sight is terrible, but his visions are pretty clear.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.293
The vision continues.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.500
Boris is always right.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.600
If you can see the future, then why are you here?

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.100
Boris warned the police about a robbery,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.100
but the police did not believe Boris.

00:02:04.743 --> 00:02:07.700
After the robbery, police thought Boris was the thief.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.038
Such injustice!

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.900
Yeah, what a sad tale.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.400
So, tell us. How do we get out?

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.500
Ah! Knowing the future isn't always a good thing. Boris does not recommend it.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.100
Tell us, or you'll get to taste my fist!

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.000
Well, if the fellow inmate insists, Boris sees...

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.800
Boris sees Joe Dalton's leg get squished under a brick.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.800
Then he gets stuck underneath planks,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.300
and finally, a stupid dog bites him.

00:02:38.593 --> 00:02:42.300
Nothing but pain, eh? Doesn't the future hold anything else?

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.800
Oh, it does! Boris sees, Boris sees...

00:02:46.255 --> 00:02:50.400
...Joe Dalton and his brothers climbing down the rope from a tower in the rain,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.700
and cheerfully running to the desert.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.800
Ah! Finally a good vision!

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.400
Does it happen today?

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.700
The future is near. Boris is always right.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200
[Yells of pain]

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.700
It hurts! Ow, ow... the guy's vision is being fulfilled!

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.400
I doubted the guy for a moment!

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.200
So, I got hit with a brick and then planks.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.400
And uh, what was the third step?

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.000
[Crunch]

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.300
Now I remember! Hold this for a moment.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.800
[Anguished yelling]

00:03:39.114 --> 00:03:43.100
Sorry, but I can't control my teeth. It was a reflex.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.000
Oh, that's okay.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.100
It's like the Daltons are seeking misfortune.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.900
[Rumbling]

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.600
The moment is near!

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.100
Yeah, soon it'll be pouring like crazy!

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.200
[Slam]

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.700
[Cheering and hollering]

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.451
We're free!

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.400
Heh, you're right! The more they get hurt, the happier they are!

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.600
Why didn't you see that?

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.400
The visions are like photos, not living pictures.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.200
You better look further into the future, and see something nice!

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.800
Boris is concentrating, Boris sees...

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.600
...a bright future! The brothers will be successful!

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.000
Golden bath tub!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.300
Golden revolver!

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.300
Our own golden chains!

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.300
The painter's inspiration is gone!

00:05:01.206 --> 00:05:03.400
So, when are we escaping?

00:05:03.474 --> 00:05:07.400
At about 10:42 a.m. this morning, during the solar eclipse.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.900
A precise vision.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.800
Oh, no, Boris saw it in the newspaper, like the others did.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.735
It was a great idea to give sunglasses to everybody, warden, sir.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.200
I spare no expenses, Miss Betty. Especially when I get to deduct the prices from taxes.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.700
[Chuckling]

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.000
Alright, freedom's calling!

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.500
Where's Averell?

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.100
I'm here! You forgot to take the rope!

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.600
[Yelling]

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.100
[Crash]

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.200
If you start something, you must finish it.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.900
Who turned off the lights?

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.400
Hm?

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.800
[Groans of pain]

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.400
Boris doesn't understand!

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.614
Oh, Boris is always right? Boris is full of rubbish!

00:06:17.614 --> 00:06:21.300
Hey, Daltons! Check this out!

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.800
'The Perfect Getaway' - what a charming painting!

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.900
That'll take a lot to achieve!

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.200
Boris is always right!

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.900
Ah!

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.800
Boris had another vision!

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.100
The real thief will be caught, and Boris will be released!

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.700
Mr. Boris, I received quite a telegram! All your charges will be dropped!

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.600
What about us? Could you check the future again?

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.625
Boris sees an exploding storm, booming noises, and lots of Dalton hailstones.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Dalton hailstones? Something must have snapped in his head.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.600
I wonder what 'Ching, chong, chong' means?

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.500
[Yelling]

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.500
Boris is always right.

00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:16.859
[Slam]
