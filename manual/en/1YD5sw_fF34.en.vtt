00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.119
So this is the International
Football Clinic.

00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:08.160
It's kind of a collaboration
between the Athletic

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.826
Association, Student Government,
and the Office of International

00:00:10.826 --> 00:00:11.327
Education.

00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:13.409
It's an opportunity for
our international students

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:15.280
to come and hang out
with the football team,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.830
go through the locker,
room, see some tape

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.820
of the games and
everything, and learn

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.770
how to play football the way the
football players do all season.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.855
How many guys have been to a
football game here-- home game.

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:27.110
That's great.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.610
[CAR HORN]

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.424
The goal is really to
bridge the gap sometimes

00:00:38.424 --> 00:00:40.340
between our students and
our student athletes,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.852
and also give our international
students a taste of what

00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:45.560
we really love to do
in America, but also

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.550
have a good time for
our cultures to overlap

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.040
and have the football
players learn

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.650
a lot about the international
students and their cultures

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.419
as well.

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:51.960
What you got?

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.456
What you got?

00:00:52.456 --> 00:00:52.997
What you got?

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.270
The DB stuff and the touchdown
celebrations and then everyone

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.978
going wild.

00:01:02.978 --> 00:01:04.019
It was just a lot of fun.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.152
The hype video that they
showed us in the room--

00:01:06.152 --> 00:01:06.860
I got goosebumps.

00:01:12.544 --> 00:01:14.460
I've played in a bunch
of different countries,

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.100
and it's just awesome
seeing different cultures.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.215
And you know, out
here everyone's equal.

00:01:20.215 --> 00:01:21.090
Nothing else matters.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.910
You're out here having fun.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.243
You've got a smile on your face.

00:01:23.243 --> 00:01:24.240
In my life?

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.270
Because in Panama, no.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.395
Practice is a sport.

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:30.850
It's an exciting experience.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.350
I feel good, very happy.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.330
I don't know nothing
about football.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.736
It's new for me, but
it's very awesome.

00:01:40.736 --> 00:01:42.700
Tech has a lot of
international students,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.550
and it gives you
something to talk about.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.320
When they know what's going
on in the football field,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.150
it's kind of like icebreakers
a little bit, man.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.390
So you get a chance to open
up and share a little bit more

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.620
with them through football.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.380
Almost.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.340
And it's completely different
to be here on the field

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.890
than just watching the game.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.229
So, it was really
nice today to be here

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.145
on the field with the
team and do some drills.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.570
They're really open
minded, and they

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.410
come to you-- talk to you
like they know you forever,

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.729
and that's a cool feeling.

00:02:12.357 --> 00:02:13.400
There you go.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.092
That's how it's done.

00:02:15.092 --> 00:02:15.800
Winners on three.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.000
One, two, three.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.550
Winners!
