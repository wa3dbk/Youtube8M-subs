You have art? Yes. You have music? Yes
P.E? Yes! They have options they can

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.398
take notes on paper or on the Chromebook which ever they prefer...

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:22.720
We're starting atomic theory.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.640
Nobody is throwing money at you, but

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.393
you have some good hearted
people who care about the kids.

00:00:34.393 --> 00:00:36.360
What we have is just few

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.245
boxes with books that I've 
collected but I need books

00:00:40.245 --> 00:00:44.129
I've been to a lot of schools and some are like really

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.480
nice and some aren't that great.  
I just don't think all the schools are

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.469
up to the same level and some are  new and some are old, but I think

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.910
that some could use like some like deep
cleaning.  You said a really important

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.340
thing too, that some schools have a whole
bunch of stuff and they're newer they're

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.420
better taken care of, and some schools
are older and they need more love and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.150
they're not getting all the repairs that
they need. So every school needs to be

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.119
taken care of.  I saw two amazing schools. One you walked through the halls

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.520
of the STEM Academy and it was fabulous
and these kids had everything they

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.210
needed to take off. These kids are
on a launch pad to someplace

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.520
amazing. We are a K-8 STEM academy, where
the students integrate the science

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.140
technology engineering and math into the
curricula.  We do have support from the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.720
administration. We do have resources that
come in,  that support us. We have a lot of

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.189
tutors that come in. We've had great
community support. We have a STEM

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.329
integration specialist that focuses on
the STEM component then along with that

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.930
we do have the integration technology
specialist and we also have music!

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.299
And the second school I went to was also
amazing. You have these very very caring

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.649
teachers and support staff, the principal.
Everybody wanting these kids to succeed.

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:14.069
But you couldn't help but notice the
facility wasn't quite like the first one.

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:21.840
"What we need are resources that will help us bring up basic skills. In my own

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.829
classroom I'd love to have an updated
chemistry lab. My lab was built in

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.230
1973  and I would love for 
it to be brought up to the 2000's. I would

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.409
love to see the school updated. I love
these kids. There are real people here,

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:43.079
that really care. We keep coming back day
after day and we love it here. There's

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.314
something special about it.

00:02:45.314 --> 00:02:48.709
It was so obvious that some kids had all the

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:56.069
services, the programs, the facilities
and other kids had a lot of hopes and

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:05.060
dreams. We need to close that gap. I just
think that school districts sometimes

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.340
play into what the community is and if
it's a well resourced community,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.359
the more money is put into that
community and if it's a poor community

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.109
then it's just the lack of funds and it
shouldn't be that way because that's

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.290
where we see the disparity with our
children. The National Education

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.840
Association has a mission and our
mission is to make every public school

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.479
as good as the best public school you
can find and that means that we need to

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:39.299
close the resource gap, we need to make
sure that every child has the

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.500
opportunity to learn.
