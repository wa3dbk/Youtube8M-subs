Today's nail art is inspired by a very pretty

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.870
stone: Bornite.
I'm probably pronouncing that wrong.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:26.550
It's full of beautiful dark purples, blues
and pinks.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.179
These are the polish colours I used.
You can use the same technique with any though.

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.250
You will also need tweezers and a tissue.
Start with a basic dark purple base.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.790
It doesn't need to be neat at all.
Add a drop of light purple to the tip, scrunch

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.609
up a piece of tissue and use the tweezers
to dab it lightly into a pattern.

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:55.510
This same basic technique is used to add the
other colours too so if you don't feel confident

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:08.230
with it practice a little first.
Add a drop of pink glitter around the base

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.870
and repeat.
You can use different items such as sponges,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.300
paper or fabric for different effects.
The more crinkled your tissue is the more

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.430
interesting the pattern will be.
Add some darker splotches to cover any gaps

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:38.390
and dab in place.
Lastly add some shimmery green highlights

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.890
in the same way.
Getting a good pattern depending on your polish

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.900
consistency so if you can't get it right,
try leaving your polish to dry slightly on

00:01:46.900 --> 00:02:00.741
the nail first.
Clean any mess with a cuticle stick and a

00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:07.810
tissue dipped in polish remover.
Once dry, give all of the nails a clear top

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.069
coat.
And you're all finished!

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:21.310
Shiny and very pretty.
Just like the beautiful stone that inspired

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.340
them.
I hope this was a useful video.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.290

Thanks so much for watching!

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.620
Bye!
