from a human point of view on something is tibers

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.700
So Let's turn it so that the floor was at the bottom

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.020
on the steps that are left we can see Amumu who sits with a gift

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.240
Queen Ashe skin at first glance, there is nothing interesting

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.779
but when it approaches an image on top

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.220
we can observe the image illuminati

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.360
Hearts on the skin Łamaczka Ashe Tryndamere see why his

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.460

on the skin of the brand vandal we see a beer keg

00:01:56.358 --> 00:01:58.358
but one of them has a picture Gragas

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.880
peel Cho'Gath BattleCast also has something interesting

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.240
and it is that roughly we can see BattleCast Urgot and Skarner

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.380
At a basic picture of Darius, we see probably a raven Swain and Aatroxa

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.560

It looks so that was the end of interesting things in the picture

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.240

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.320
on plain splash-art Gnar not see too much

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.695
but there is something interesting

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.440
a question of helmet that is hidden on the right

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.180
currently nothing you can not say about him

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.320
but behold further because this topic is quite interesting

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.820

and 3 characters that I can not quite tell who it is

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.380
but probably in the middle is the Garen

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.380

On the skin twitch, we see the Mafia Jinx and Miss Fortune

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.520
but we can also note Urgot

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.140
Theme Bloodmoon Kalistra in the background has probably Akali

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.396

Theme Dr. Kennen update these Cho'Gath that something eaten

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.080
at first I thought that it is Amumu but we see the hammer and shield

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.240
so we are sure that it is a poppy

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.380
Plain picture Kog'Maw, shows the helmet but why

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.231
on this we have to think about

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.720
this is the end section so I have not finished all

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.480
