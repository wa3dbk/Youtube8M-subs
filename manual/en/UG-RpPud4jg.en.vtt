00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.500
I lost my husband to cancer.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000 position:83%
They said he probably had a couple of months to live.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000 position:98%
She lost all her hair and went down pretty bad towards the end.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It was an end of life situation.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.000 position:58%
He desperately wanted to die at home.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000 position:98%
He just assumed that he would have to be in hospital but then found out that there was another way.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.500
We had good days and bad days

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000 position:98%
I just didn’t know what to do. I looked on the internet, I looked everywhere for support.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000 position:61%
There was nobody else there to help me.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000 position:97%
We got special chairs in. We got a hospital bed in. What we didn’t get was the 24 hour care.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000 position:98%
I’ve had more support since she’s died, than she had when she was dying. She had nothing bless her.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.500 position:97%
The benefit of the nurses coming in was that we were able to stay at home.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000 position:84%
They just held our hands throughout the whole process.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000 position:97%
Change his pyjamas. Make him more comfortable. Clean his teeth, even give him a shave.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000 position:98%
We had a sort of team of angels who would come and help preserve Dad’s dignity.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000 position:98%
And we couldn't have coped without that safety net, we really couldn’t.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000 position:94%
She said, I don’t want to go to the hospice. Simple as that.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000 position:97%
I got a phone call at 10 o'clock in the morning to say he’d passed away already.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000 position:89%
What’s he got at home? He’s got his own settee to sit on.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
He could watch football on TV.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.500
He’s got a wonderful, big garden.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.500 position:98%
We had a goldfish pond at the top and she virtually knew each goldfish by name.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000 position:98%
He’d always wanted to live by the sea and being at home meant he could see the sea.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000 position:88%
These are simple things that everyone takes for granted.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000 position:98%
He was in the place he wanted to be, with the people that he wanted to be with him.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000 position:70%
The hospice was wonderful, but it's not home.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000 position:97%
Now I really feel angry because I know it should have been possible that I was there with him.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.500 position:67%
It’s important that people have the choice.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000 position:98%
I just want to say to people: look, I hope you get what you want.
