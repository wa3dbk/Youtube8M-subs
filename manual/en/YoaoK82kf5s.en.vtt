00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:05.100
Ok, for the corner I am going to put a little
bit of a embellishment and I am going to bead

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.889
up a small loop using seed beads and some
of these larger beads. I am going to start

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:24.550
with three seed beads and then take a medium
sized bead. Two more seed beads and then,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:38.960
the larger bead. And then, continue that pattern
again with the two seed beads, a medium bead,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:48.020
and three more seed beads. And, that will
finish our loop. We have our thread coming

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:57.570
out from the corner, and then we will just
take it right back into the corner like that.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:06.741
And, that just puts a little bit of color
and a pretty accent on the corners. And, you

00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:13.140
can knot that off. Keep your knots on the
bottom of the pin cushion so that they do

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:29.950
not show as much. Here we are making a loop,
and a loop, and another loop, and then pulling

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:42.369
it tight.
Careful not to cut your newly beaded strands

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:50.759
off. Ok, now I have finished all my scalloped
edges with the pre-strung beads and now I

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.990
am just finishing up our Edwardian-style pin
cushion with some finishing beading on the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:05.490
side. And, I am just taking each bead singly,
like so, and just grabbing a little bit of

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:13.450
material and then adding another bead. And,
I will continue this trim all the way down

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.610
the edge of the pin cushion. Ok? Another way
you can embellish your pin cushion is with

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:30.590
pins and here I have used some straight pins.
Just a regular straight pin and we put on

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.489
just a small bead and then another larger
bead. And then, just push that right into

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.380
your pin cushion in any kind of a design that
you would like. And, that gives a really pretty

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.860
look to our pin cushion. This is beautiful.
I used jewel colors. I used emerald colors

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.330
and then we have the ruby and gold. These
are very rich colors for a beautiful Edwardian

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.950
pin cushion.
