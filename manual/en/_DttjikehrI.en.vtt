00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.590
SOME CITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES HAVE
TRIED BANNING THE OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN DOG

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.290
BREEDS, MOST NOTABLY THE PIT BULL.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.090
THESE EFFORTS ARE CONTROVERSIAL, DESPITE PIT
BULLS' REPUTATION OF BEING DANGEROUS.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.480
BUT NOW, THE DOGS AND SOME FORMER PRISON INMATES
ARE GETTING A BOOST FROM A PROGRAM THAT PUTS

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.400
PEOPLE ON PAROLE AND ABUSED ANIMALS TOGETHER.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.060
WE'RE JOINED BY VOA'S REBECCA WARD, WHO WENT
ON ASSIGNMENT TO EXPLORE THIS PROGRAM, WHICH

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.100
GIVES A CHANCE AT REHABILITATION TO BOTH THE
PEOPLE ON PAROLE AND THE ANIMALS.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.719
REBECCA, TELL US HOW THIS ALL GOT STARTED.

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.700
WELL I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF DOG CAUSES, I
HAVE TWO RESCUES MYSELF, SO WHEN I WENT TO

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.039
NEW ORLEANS, MY FRIEND SAID, LET'S GO TO VILLA
LOBOS RESCUE CENTER, WHICH IS THE SUBJECT

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.399
OF A REALITY SHOW CALLED PIT BULLS AND PAROLEES
ON ANIMAL PLANET.

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.970
AND SO I GOT TO TALK TO THE FOUNDER OF THE
RESCUE CENTER, TIA TORRES, AS WELL AS A COUPLE

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:04.890
OF THE INMATES, OR FORMER INMATES I SHOULD
SAY, AND I HAVE TO SAY THEY WERE GREAT, AND

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.700
WERE SO CARING OF THE DOGS.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.390
IT'S SUCH A GREAT PROGRAM.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.340
AND WHAT KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCES DO THEY FIND
THESE DOGS?

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.250
WELL THEY CAN BE IN ANY KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCE.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.540
I GUESS THE SADDEST CIRCUMSTANCE IS WHEN THEY
RECOVER DOGS FROM A DOG FIGHTING RING, WHICH

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.740
HAPPENS ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND ALL
ACROSS THE WORLD I IMAGINE.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.659
OF COURSE IT IS ILLEGAL, AND SOME OF THE DOGS
I SAW HAD BEEN USED AS BAIT DOGS.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.250
SO THEY'RE NOT REALLY VICIOUS, THEY JUST HAVE
HAD SUCH TERRIBLE LIVES UP TO THIS POINT.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.670
WHAT'S THE CENTRAL GOAL OF BRINGING TOGETHER
THE PAROLEES WITH THE PIT BULLS?

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.670
I THINK THE GOAL IS THAT THEY'RE JUST KIND
OF A NATURAL FIT.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.140
THEY HAVE BEEN KIND OF CAGED, AND ACTUALLY
ONE OF THE GUYS THAT I TALKED TO USED THAT

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.140
WORD.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.180
HE UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY HOW THE DOGS FELT.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.190
AND IT KIND OF BRINGS OUT THE BEST OF BOTH
OF THEM.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.190
IT'S FASCINATING.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:32.560
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR PIECE AND WE'LL
COME RIGHT BACK.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.700
EARL MOFFETT IS USING HIS SECOND CHANCE TO
GIVE ABUSED ANIMALS A SECOND CHANCE.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.700
HE'S ONE OF SEVERAL PAROLEES WORKING WITH
VILLALOBOS RESCUE CENTER IN A CITY KNOWN FOR

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.990
ITS OWN REBIRTH FROM A DEVASTATING DISASTER.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.190
HURRICANE KATRINA NEARLY DESTROYED THE NEIGHBORHOOD
WHERE VILLALOBOS NOW RESIDES.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.680
AFTER NEARLY TWO DECADES IN CALIFORNIA, NEW
LOCAL REGULATIONS PROMPTED VILLALOBOS FOUNDER

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.370
TIA MARIA TORRES TO FIND A NEW HOME IN NEW
ORLEANS.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.159
THE CITY AND THE STATE, SHE SAYS, HAS BEEN
MORE THAN WELCOMING.

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.349
"WE'VE BEEN APPROACHED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF
CORRECTIONS HERE IN LOUISIANA - I MEAN YOU

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.480
TALK ABOUT A STATE THAT IS SO INTO REHABILITATION
FOR THEIR PRISON SYSTEM.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.290
SO REFRESHING, SO REFRESHING.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.010
WE HAVE POLICE OFFICERS THAT HAVE COME TO
US AND SAY, I ARRESTED THIS GUY LAST WEEK

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.910
AND I KIND OF FEEL SORRY FOR HIM.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.580
HE'S PROBABLY A GOOD GUY.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.349
IF HE GETS OUT OF JAIL, COULD WE HIRE HIM?"

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.100
THIS IS NO ORDINARY PET RESCUE PROGRAM.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.049
NOT ONLY DOES VILLALOBOS SAVE PITBULLS WITH
THE HELP OF FORMER PRISON INMATES - TIA AND

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:39.800
HER TEAM ARE THE STARS OF A POPULAR REALITY
TV SHOW ON CABLE'S ANIMAL PLANET.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:47.610
BUT THIS BEING A REALITY SHOW, THESE DOGS
ARE REALLY RESCUES - SOME BEING FOUND IN APPALLING

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.610
CONDITION.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.670
"THE VET SAID THE EAR WAS PROBABLY CHEWED
OFF BY A RAT OR RACCOON."

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.939
AND THE GUYS GIVING THE TOURS TO PROSPECTIVE
PET OWNERS ARE REALLY FORMER INMATES.

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.490
"WE'RE TRYING TO HELP THEM GET A SECOND CHANCE
JUST LIKE MS.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.230
TIA GAVE US A SECOND CHANCE SO I CAN IDENTIFY
WITH THEM GUYS LIKE BEING INCARCERATED."

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.240
"I THINK THE PAROLEES DO REALLY WELL WITH
THE PITBULLS BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.240
A PITBULL.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.240
THEY SAY WE LOOK SCARY, AND PEOPLE JUDGE US
OUT THE GATE.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.580
AND SO THEY SAY THEY REALLY KNOW WHAT IT FEELS
LIKE TO BE LOOKED AT AND PEOPLE WALK ACROSS

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.310
THE STREET WHEN THEY WALK BY."

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:29.680
PITTBULLS AND PAROLEES WAS THE BRAINCHILD
OF MIKEY D - NOW THE CREATIVE PRODUCER.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.990
HE MET TIA WHEN HE ADOPTED A DOG AND NEEDED
HELP WITH TRAINING.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.980
"LONG STORY SHORT, I WOULD GO TO TIA'S TRAINING
CLASS BUT I'D BE LOOKING AT HER SAYING OH

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.780
MY GOSH, SHE IS A ROCK STAR."

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.259
MIKEY D WAS ALREADY WORKING IN THE MUSIC AND
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY WHEN HE APPROACHED

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:45.979
TIA ABOUT THE IDEA.

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.840
"I PUT SOME STUFF ON PAPER.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.380
SECOND CHANCE SHOW, OH MY GOD...YOU KNOW,
EX-CONS YOU KNOW.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.320
IT WAS HARD FOR PEOPLE TO VISUALIZE AND I
GET IT.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.650
THEY WERE LIKE, WE DON'T CARE ABOUT PITBULLS
OR PAROLEES."

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.900
BUT SOMEBODY FINALLY DID GET IT AFTER MIKEY
D. FOLLOWED TIA AROUND FOR A MONTH WITH A

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.900
VIDEO CAMERA.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.520
PITBULLS AND PAROLEES DEBUTED ON ANIMAL PLANET
IN 2009 AND BEGINS A FIFTH SEASON THIS YEAR.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.259
IN THE MEANTIME, TIA TORRES AND HER TEAM OF
PAROLEES AND VOLUNTEERS CONTINUE TO HELP HUNDREDS

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:22.220
OF DOGS FROM ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES.REBECA
WARD, VOA NEWS, NEW ORLEANS.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.860
THEY SEEM TO BE GETTING TOGETHER PRETTY WELL.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.860
THEY'RE GREAT.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.082
THE TWO PAROLEES THAT I MET WERE SO CARING
ABOUT THE DOGS, YOU COULD TELL THAT THEY'RE

00:05:31.082 --> 00:05:32.630
REALLY WAS A CONNECTION THERE.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.630
IT WAS INTERESTING.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.479
AND REBECCA WE KNOW THERE WAS A STRONG CONNECTION
FOR YOU, AS WELL, YOU MENTION THAT YOU OWN

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:38.960
TWO DOGS YOURSELF.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.550
NOT JUST DOGS, THEY'RE RESCUES.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.060
TWO RESCUE DOGS, ABSOLUTELY.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.789
WELL REBECCA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING
THIS STORY TO US.

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.370
ONCE AGAIN REBECCA WARD, WITH OUR VERY OWN
ON ASSIGNMENT TEAM.
