00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.724
- Hi, friends, I'm here
with the one and the only

00:00:03.724 --> 00:00:05.806
- Jenna Marbles. (laughing)
- [Tyler] Woo!

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:06.924
- [Tyler] What are we doing, Jenna?

00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:09.779
- I'm gonna ask you some Brain Quests

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:11.682
some fourth grade (both laughing)

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:13.240
some fourth grade questions.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.695
- Mm-hmm.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:16.220
- And you're gonna have
three seconds to answer them.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.217
- Fuck, okay, well these
are hard questions,

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:19.153
we were going through them a little bit.

00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:20.680
- Yeah, some of them are easy.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.614
- For a fourth grader, you gotta be smart,

00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:26.389
and as a 25 year old
I'm dumb as shit, so...

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:27.070
- Yep.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.701
- If I don't get the question
right in three seconds,

00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:29.272
what are you going to do?

00:00:29.272 --> 00:00:31.241
- I'm gonna rip your hair out your leg.

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:32.588
(laughing)

00:00:32.588 --> 00:00:34.248
No pain, no gain, honey.

00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:35.660
- What is the gain from this?

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.879
(laughing)

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.224
- [Both] Just like smooth legs.

00:00:39.224 --> 00:00:42.858
- Okay, find an antonym of generous,

00:00:42.858 --> 00:00:43.880
here are your choices:

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.866
- Oh, great!

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.401
- I have choices for you.
- [Tyler] Oh, okay, yeah.

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:50.930
- Kind, tasty, difficult, miserly.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.437
One, two
- [Tyler] For generous?

00:00:53.437 --> 00:00:55.713
- [Jenna] Three
(Tyler stammering)

00:00:55.713 --> 00:00:57.210
- [Jenna] It's miserly.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.439
- (laughing) Oh, shit!

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:01.332
Wait, miserly?

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:03.955
Ow, oh my God, ow!

00:01:03.955 --> 00:01:05.220
(laughing)

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.556
- Holy shit!
- [Jenna] It's beautiful!

00:01:06.556 --> 00:01:08.411
- [Jenna] Look!
- [Tyler] Look at that.

00:01:08.411 --> 00:01:10.302
- [Tyler] Oh my God, it tingles.

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:12.779
- This is terrible, I feel awful!

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:14.741
- But that look smooth as shit.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:15.879
- You look like a baby!

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:17.354
I looked at the laser hair removal,

00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:20.302
because it's like if you wax,
it's expensive to do anything,

00:01:20.302 --> 00:01:20.838
you know what I mean?

00:01:20.838 --> 00:01:22.938
So I looked into it, it was
a lot cheaper than I thought

00:01:22.938 --> 00:01:25.212
to get like six sessions, or whatever.

00:01:25.212 --> 00:01:27.441
And they get all in, just like a stranger,

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:30.192
they make you like spread eagle like that,

00:01:30.192 --> 00:01:31.157
and they just get in there and like

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.465
(scratching) to your asshole.

00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:33.704
- Wait, your talking about laser.

00:01:33.704 --> 00:01:34.410
- Mm-hmm.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.173
- Lasering your asshole.

00:01:35.173 --> 00:01:37.729
- Yeah, and all of it.

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.010
- You live your dream, girl.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.213
- To put money in the bank,

00:01:40.213 --> 00:01:42.266
do you make a deposit or a withdrawal?

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:45.087
- A deposit. (laughing)

00:01:45.087 --> 00:01:49.445
- What do you look for if you
need water in shade trees?

00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:50.648
- An oasis?

00:01:51.585 --> 00:01:52.894
- Yeah.
- [Tyler] Oh my God.

00:01:52.894 --> 00:01:55.225
- What continent is located entirely

00:01:55.225 --> 00:01:58.467
in the eastern and southern hemispheres?

00:01:58.648 --> 00:01:59.711
- Australia?

00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:02.978
- Yeah, holy shit, you're
crushing it right now!

00:02:02.978 --> 00:02:04.184
- Thank you, thank you.

00:02:04.184 --> 00:02:09.109
- Alright, subtract 3,996 from 6,325.

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:12.092
- Are you, holy! (laughing)

00:02:12.092 --> 00:02:14.147
- One,
- [Tyler] No, wait!

00:02:14.147 --> 00:02:15.077
- Two,

00:02:15.077 --> 00:02:17.175
- I forgot the numbers, this is...

00:02:17.175 --> 00:02:18.638
- Get waxed!

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:21.232
- What, no (laughing) no!

00:02:21.232 --> 00:02:22.932
- Ah, one, two, three, ah!

00:02:22.932 --> 00:02:27.378
- Oh my God, oh my God, ouch! (laughing)

00:02:27.732 --> 00:02:28.864
Oh my God, oh my God!

00:02:28.864 --> 00:02:30.539
- I'm sorry, Tyler!

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:32.345
- The worst was when I
thought you were gonna rip it

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:33.019
and you didn't.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.088
- I know.

00:02:34.088 --> 00:02:37.146
- (breathing heavy)
(laughing)

00:02:37.146 --> 00:02:39.083
- What three digit numbers can you make

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:41.568
from the numbers one, two, and three?

00:02:41.568 --> 00:02:43.668
- Three,
- [Tyler] 321.

00:02:43.668 --> 00:02:45.422
- Two, one.
- [Tyler] Wait!

00:02:45.422 --> 00:02:47.100
- [Tyler] How many do you need? (laughing)

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.352
- There's six answers.

00:02:48.352 --> 00:02:50.177
- No, I gave you one, that counts!

00:02:50.177 --> 00:02:50.728
(laughing)

00:02:50.728 --> 00:02:51.692
That's good.
- [Jenna] Okay, okay.

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:52.885
- [Jenna] In what state can you visit

00:02:52.885 --> 00:02:54.824
the Kennedy Space Center?

00:02:54.824 --> 00:02:56.821
- Oh, fuck this shit!

00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:59.323
Some type of, Nevada?

00:02:59.323 --> 00:03:00.395
(buzzing)

00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:03.943
(laughing) Oh, fuck, oh my God!

00:03:03.943 --> 00:03:08.005
(laughing)

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.553
Oh!

00:03:10.553 --> 00:03:12.015
- I didn't mean to rip them both,

00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:13.908
but they were stuck together. (laughing)

00:03:13.908 --> 00:03:15.510
Oh my God, are you okay?

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.134
- Oh my God!

00:03:17.134 --> 00:03:19.271
- Does our number system
come from the Arabs,

00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:21.928
the Greeks, or the Chinese?

00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:26.005
- Uh, the Chinese?

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.408
- (buzzing) The Arabs!

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:31.414
- (laughing) Oh fuck, thank you, Arabs.

00:03:31.414 --> 00:03:32.299
(Jenna humming)

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.587
- What?

00:03:33.587 --> 00:03:36.031
- Get waxed (laughing)

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.615
Oh, it's gonna be so
good, make it real warm,

00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:41.137
oh, make it nasty!
- [Tyler] I hate you!

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:42.634
- [Jenna] Make it nasty!
- [Tyler] I hate you!

00:03:42.634 --> 00:03:44.990
- [Jenna] Drop, drop it to
the floor, make it nasty!

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.076
Take the antonym of
play and at it to home,

00:03:48.076 --> 00:03:51.048
what compound word do you get?

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.497
- Layhome? (laughing)

00:03:54.497 --> 00:03:56.660
I don't know, what is it?

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.180
- Homework?

00:03:58.609 --> 00:03:59.976
- Oh, work and play, I thought--

00:03:59.976 --> 00:04:00.745
- That's right!

00:04:00.745 --> 00:04:03.008
- No! (laughing)

00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:05.424
- What info is not
gathered in U.S. Census?

00:04:05.424 --> 00:04:09.186
A person's name, age, race, or weight?

00:04:10.815 --> 00:04:11.738
It's weight.
- [Tyler] Name?

00:04:11.738 --> 00:04:14.167
- [Tyler] Wait, no! (laughing)

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:16.579
Oh my God, I thought it was name, though.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.452
Oh, fuck that!
- [Jenna] That's nice.

00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:21.363
- [Jemna] Okay, let me get in here.

00:04:21.363 --> 00:04:23.103
- Oh, it tingles.

00:04:23.103 --> 00:04:25.624
- Dude, like really, the
home little waxing kit,

00:04:25.624 --> 00:04:27.351
this shit's doing a bang up job.

00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:28.444
- Thank you.

00:04:28.444 --> 00:04:30.527
- Turn the word part into a word

00:04:30.527 --> 00:04:33.627
for something you set to catch a rat.

00:04:33.627 --> 00:04:34.642
Three,
- [Tyler] A trap!

00:04:34.642 --> 00:04:35.581
- [Jenna] Yeah.
- [Tyler] Okay, oh my God.

00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:37.110
- [Jenna] It's a trap!
- [Tyler] Got it.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.687
- [Jenna] If Mario eats three meals a day,

00:04:39.687 --> 00:04:42.451
how many meals does he eat in three weeks?

00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:43.935
- Oh, fuck this shit!

00:04:43.935 --> 00:04:45.574
Three times seven is 21,
- [Jenna] Three, two,

00:04:45.574 --> 00:04:47.799
- [Jenna] one!
- [Tyler] Oh, God, 63!

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:49.560
- [Jenna] You're right,
but you're out of time!

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.040
- No, oh my God, ow! (laughing)

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.423
- Ready?

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:58.301
- Oh! (laughing)

00:04:58.301 --> 00:04:59.529
- I'm sorry!

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:01.225
- That was by far the
most painful one yet.

00:05:01.225 --> 00:05:05.172
- Okay, which comes first
in a butterfly's life cycle?

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:06.090
- Fuck this.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.832
- The larva or the pupa?

00:05:07.832 --> 00:05:09.903
- Oh, fuck this, the pupa.

00:05:09.903 --> 00:05:11.085
- It's the larva.

00:05:11.085 --> 00:05:13.587
- No, no, those are calls.

00:05:13.587 --> 00:05:16.900
- Get wax, alright, I'm gonna
do this as hard as I can.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.167
One, two...

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:21.361
(Tyler laughing)

00:05:21.361 --> 00:05:25.603
- Oh, my goodness!

00:05:25.603 --> 00:05:27.688
- We didn't get this one yet, two, three,

00:05:27.688 --> 00:05:29.243
four, five, six, seven!

00:05:29.243 --> 00:05:30.306
(Tyler whining)

00:05:30.306 --> 00:05:31.811
Oh my God.

00:05:32.426 --> 00:05:34.536
- Considering all the pain
that you just put me through,

00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:37.135
I think I deserve to wax one strip on you.

00:05:37.135 --> 00:05:37.693
- Yeah.

00:05:37.693 --> 00:05:38.315
- Where do you want it?

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:38.979
- Anywhere.

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:39.832
- Right here?
- [Jenna] Where ever you want.

00:05:39.832 --> 00:05:40.848
- Wait, can I really?

00:05:40.848 --> 00:05:43.008
- Yeah, it's just gonna be
a butt load of fake tan.

00:05:43.008 --> 00:05:46.702
- Wait (laughing) okay,
let's do this, oh my.

00:05:46.702 --> 00:05:47.909
- Yeah, that's the way to do it.

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:49.361
- Is it gonna stick?

00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:51.261
Oh, wait! (laughing)

00:05:51.261 --> 00:05:52.985
- I'm like, yeah, that's the way to do it.

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:54.681
It's like my entire forearm.

00:05:54.681 --> 00:05:55.556
Fuck!
- [Tyler] Yeah, it is.

00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:59.474
Does electricity move through
a conductor or an insulator?

00:06:00.181 --> 00:06:01.575
- An insulator.

00:06:01.575 --> 00:06:03.258
Well I mean it comes from a conductor--

00:06:03.258 --> 00:06:04.510
- (laughing) Okay, I'll give
you that because you're--

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.984
- No, tear it off.
- [Tyler] Are you sure?

00:06:05.984 --> 00:06:08.072
- Just get waxed, just get waxed, what!

00:06:08.072 --> 00:06:09.699
Oh my God!
- [Tyler] Are you ready, okay?

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:14.284
- Three, two, one.

00:06:17.436 --> 00:06:19.918
- Oh my God!
- Oh, God!

00:06:19.918 --> 00:06:22.473
(laughing)

00:06:22.473 --> 00:06:24.909
- [Tyler] That is the
best thing I've ever seen!

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:26.336
- Oh, dude, oh!

00:06:26.336 --> 00:06:28.978
- 100% fucked over tanner.

00:06:28.978 --> 00:06:30.291
- Fake tanner, you guys.

00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:33.151
- Oh my God! (laughing)

00:06:33.151 --> 00:06:36.980
This was fun, while she does
my last little knee pit,

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.860
I guess I can say goodbye,
thank you for watching everyone,

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.400
and be sure to thumbs up and
subscribe to me and Jenna,

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:48.682
and I'm like on the edge of
my fucking seat right now!

00:06:48.682 --> 00:06:50.341
(laughing)

00:06:50.341 --> 00:06:52.735
Um, goodbye everyone, I love you.

00:06:52.735 --> 00:06:56.831
Fu..oh my goodness, grascioniess!
