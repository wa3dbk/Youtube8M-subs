00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.970
- I've grown two different
plants of rhubarb

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.950
in two different places,
but they both died.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.120
What do I do?

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.790
Rhubarb does better in more
northern parts of the country,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.110
where it's colder.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.080
But it will grow here, if
it's given well-drained sites.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.850
So if you've got a
sandy soil or a raised

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.790
bed with enough organic
matter so it doesn't dry out,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.529
you can grow rhubarb here.

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:36.570
But the important thing
is don't keep it too wet,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.680
especially when it's dormant.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.370
Or it will rot.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.170
And that's probably
what happened to yours.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.640
If it's in a clay soil, it's
very likely to rot, as well.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.600
So a sandy, well-drained soil is
your best bet to make it grow.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.400
[MUSIC PLAYING] .

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.480
- Curtis.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.600
My name is Curtis Brown.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.900
And I've talked to you before.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.190
With this plant, I've had
it for about two years,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.273
and it' the plant from my
father-in-law's funeral.

00:00:57.273 --> 00:00:59.060
So it does have a
sentimental value to it.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.940
But we've been having
these brown buds, leaves,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.530
for the past year, two years.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.830
I just wondered what
we could do with it.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.940
What do you suggest?

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.440
- OK.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.080
What we've got here
is a peace lilly,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.070
which is native to the tropics,
to a very humid environment.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.840
It doesn't like our
dry air very much.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.170
That's part of the problem.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.480
The other part of the
problem, though, is the fact

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.610
that every time we water,
there's salt in our water

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.200
that accumulates in the soil.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.940
In time, the plant absorbs it.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.336
It causes this leaf burn.

00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:27.210
So the combination of
salt, plus the dry air,

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.860
is causing the leaf burn.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.660
What we need to do
this plant is repot it

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.720
in a well-drained,
organic potting soil.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.616
It has to stay
moist, but the water

00:01:34.616 --> 00:01:36.240
has to flow through
it easily, as well.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.948
So you might want to
take a potting soil,

00:01:37.948 --> 00:01:39.645
and some sharp sand to it.

00:01:39.645 --> 00:01:41.520
When you repot it,
though, take this one out.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.980
Wash as much of the soil
off the roots as you

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.110
can before you repot it.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.839
So you remove a
lot of these salts.

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:48.630
Then, once you've done
that, keep it moist.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.170
Water it.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.750
Keep it in a fairly
well-lit location,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.220
but it tolerates good shape.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.260
But the important thing
now, we need to be sure

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.830
we don't let water soak back up.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.576
We can see from the
salt stains here,

00:01:58.576 --> 00:01:59.700
it's been sitting in water.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.325
When you watered,
the water accumulated

00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:02.200
and it drew back up.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.960
So it really did
accumulate the salt.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.597
- OK.

00:02:04.597 --> 00:02:06.180
- This time, when
you repot it, set it

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.596
so that when the water comes
out of the bottom of the pot,

00:02:08.596 --> 00:02:09.360
it drains away.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.220
Set it on a stack of
rocks or something

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.730
inside a dish that holds water.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.960
But don't let the water--

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.460
right.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.220
Don't let the
water soak back up.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.307
- Well, I appreciate it.

00:02:18.307 --> 00:02:18.890
- My pleasure.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.848
- Appreciate your help.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.200
- This is Master Gardener
John Charles from Albuquerque.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.860
He has a garden which
is made of sand.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.840
John, your garden is very sandy.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.454
You bought a lot that is sand.

00:02:33.454 --> 00:02:35.620
But you've been able to
turn it into quite a garden.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.350
What are the tricks to
making sand work as a garden?

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.680
- Well, actually, I
prefer to start with sand.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.550
I've set up gardens in
other areas of the city

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.890
when I've lived in
other houses, where

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.450
there's been a different
texture to the soil.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.970
But I prefer sand.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.070
What my secret is, and
it's really not a secret,

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.000
is to add lots of organic
material to the soil.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.880
I apply compost every year in
the Fall and in the Spring.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.610
I top dress my lawn, I top
dress my raised beds every year.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.060
And I think that's the secret
is the organic material that's

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.451
in there that I
apply to the garden.

00:03:12.451 --> 00:03:14.200
- And what's nice about
that is compost is

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.630
made from something we would
normally landfill, throw away.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.379
So we're actually being
very environmental

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.610
by using compost, which is
made from waste material.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.510
- That's correct.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.480
I also will crumble up egg
shells from the kitchen.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.880
I will apply the coffee grounds.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.520
Any kind of organic material.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.430
I dress my garden
with that material.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.930
- Very good.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.590
Thank you.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.298
- You're welcome.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.880
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.220
- Dani's come to us today with
a question about her fern plan.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.690
You've got a question?

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.410
- Yes.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.170
I was going to plant
the-- repot the fern,

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.715
and I pulled it
out of the planter,

00:03:48.715 --> 00:03:50.590
and I notice all these
little knobs on there.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.131
And I was wondering
what they were.

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:52.630
- OK.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.590
This is Boston fern.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.710
Boston fern produces runners.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.780
And, like a potato,
that will sometimes

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.850
swell up as a storage
organ, and so you've

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.385
got tubers, which are part
of the fern's storage organ,

00:04:03.385 --> 00:04:04.750
just part of the plant.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.950
It's nothing to worry about.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.450
So I wouldn't worry
about it at all.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.480
Just repot it, and
be happy with it.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.060
- OK.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.560
Thanks.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.680
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.740
- George Duda, with New
Mexico State Farm Department,

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.940
is here to tell us why a lot
of trees planted in New Mexico

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.790
landscapes fail
to grow, why they

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.909
die after just a few
years in the landscape.

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.200
George, what's the big problem
that you've been seeing?

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.750
- Well, we see a lot of problem
with poor quality stock.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.810
People are buying trees
that are not really quality.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.480
They may have been in the
pot too long at the nursery.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.527
They have the circling roots,
and that spells problems.

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:38.860
- You've got an example of that.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.900
- I happen to have
an example for this.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.080
It's nice that you asked.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.580
OK.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.600
Here we go.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.040
And here is a classic--

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.470
a rather extreme
example, of a tree

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.120
that was bought by someone.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.220
And it had been in
the pot too long.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.000
And it's quite evident with the
roots have done, staying close

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.600
to the tree.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.550
Not getting out
where they belong.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.320
And, in addition, this tree
was planted way too deep.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.780
Should have been planted at
a level way down in here.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.200
And we see that the root--

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.090
roots-- the
coloration of the bark

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.342
shows that it was
underground way up here.

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:11.050
And when this tree
was planted, it really

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.540
had no chance of surviving.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.790
Had-- had a person inspected
this tree in the pot

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.830
before that planted
it, maybe perhaps they

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.800
could have gone to another tree,
and got a better quality tree

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.620
to plant.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.890
So this is one of the
reasons why we fail.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.490
- Circling roots
are a major problem.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.570
What would someone do
if they bought a tree

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.790
and they knew they
had some circling

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.873
roots when they bought it?

00:05:28.873 --> 00:05:31.600
- If the problem isn't too
extreme, they can take a knife

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.296
and swirl the roots along
the side, inside the pot

00:05:34.296 --> 00:05:35.920
there, on the surface
of the root ball.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.810
- Just cut through
the roof ball,

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.267
you're those circling roots.

00:05:38.267 --> 00:05:39.100
- And then plant it.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.560
And also, we tried
to avoid planting

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.160
a tree in a site that is
the exact same configuration

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.150
as the pot.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.190
And we shouldn't be adding
a lot of amendments,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.520
because we may trick the tree
into thinking it's another pot.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.340
And so plant your
tree in a larger area,

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.180
and makes you have
a quality tree.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.090
- And I noticed right
here that this root

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.730
was girdling, or choking, the
trunk of the tree right there.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.410
You can see the
tree's constricted

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.180
where that root was against it.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.804
- This tree tried, but
it didn't have a chance.

00:06:06.804 --> 00:06:07.970
- Waste of money to buy a --

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:08.553
- Waste money.

00:06:08.553 --> 00:06:09.260
- --like this.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.910
- And it's a waste.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:10.618
It's a sad thing.

00:06:10.618 --> 00:06:14.057
We expect this tree to produce
and to help us, and it doesn't.

00:06:14.057 --> 00:06:14.890
- Thank you, George.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:15.806
- Thank you very much.
