Christiana Ronaldo is from Portugal

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.050
and I want to eat what he's eating.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.002
So, that's why we're here.

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:09.090
(festive music)

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.600
- Just spittin' ball

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.150
I'm gonna say it's a mix
of Latin and Mediterranean.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.730
- Well, you lived in Spain for a while

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.280
do you think it's somewhat a Spanish food?

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.150
- I would guess, yeah.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.313
- I don't really know what to expect.

00:00:24.313 --> 00:00:25.610
- Bring it on, Portugal!

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.650
- What is it?

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.990
- It's a pizza sandwich!

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.330
- It tastes like pepperoni pizza.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.660
- Very meaty.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.540
- Mmm!

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.460
- I don't know how many types
of meat there are in there,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.580
but there's quite a lot.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.710
- I think it's, like,
every single type of meat.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.380
Like, have it your way, by chews.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.760
- I love it.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.470
- This I would have
again. I quite like this.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.510
- Everything looks good on that,

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.130
except for the fish...

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.680
- I gravely disagree.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.020
Yeah, it's so salty and good.
Sardines are where it's at.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.770
- I thought it looked
really good until I realized

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.230
there's a sardine on top.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.710
- For Portugal!

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.610
(laughing)

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.213
It's not as bad as I thought!

00:01:06.213 --> 00:01:07.720
- A lot of flavor that I would not

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.160
normally think to put together.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.453
I mean, I've had salads before with eggs.

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:11.820
I haven't had salad that also had

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.040
potatoes and sardines in it.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.500
I like it.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.160
- If you're into fish,
this is going to be tasty.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.040
- I am in love with this dish

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.090
- Wow, that's interesting.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.083
That's like breakfast lunch and dinner.

00:01:24.113 --> 00:01:25.550
- Is there fish in there?

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.760
- Yeah, there's fish in there.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.122
- Damn it. Not what I was expecting!

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:32.640
Still delicious but, not
what I was expecting.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.520
- I was kind of expecting
like, an omelete-y,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.480
eggy consistency.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.600
- It has like, fish in it!

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.140
- Yeah! It's very fishy!

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.512
- Oh, no!

00:01:40.512 --> 00:01:42.650
- It's like a quiche with fish.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.280
- A Fuiche?

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.880
(laughs)

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.232
- So good.

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:48.440
Agh...

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.420
- Oh, it's hard!

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.250
- Oh wow! It is hard!

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.040
- I was right. It's kinda good.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.500
- Mmm... I've had dryer cake.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.340
- Mmmm!

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.630
That is really good.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.220
- It's like a donut, but better.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.430
- I'm gonna keep eating this.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.760
You go Portugal!
