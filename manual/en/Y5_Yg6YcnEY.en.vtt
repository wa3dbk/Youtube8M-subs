00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
Hey everybody, Iceycat here and today
there's pretty much only one thing to

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.450
talk about. The release date for Siege
has been officially pushed back. Is this a good thing?

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.300
or a bad thing? What's the
reasoning behind the delay and how will

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.000
this impact Siege going forward?

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.200
Today Ubisoft posted on their official blog that the release date was being pushed back from October 13th to December 1st.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.300
Giving them 6 additional weeks to work on the game. They said it mostly had to do with feedback they

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.380
received as well as internal testing as
reasons for coming to this conclusion.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.829
They also cited improvements across the
board to the co-op experience, weapon and gadget

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.450
balancing and menu and interface navigation.
I'll be honest I'm not real sure exactly

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.320
what that last one is all about.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.390
There were some bugs in co-op though and
some of the gadgets caused bugs as well.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.170
If you watch the Road to Montreal
live stream you saw a few camera bugs with

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.230
Mute's jammer messing up the player view
when coming out of a scrambled drone cam.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.230
I myself ran into a couple of bugs using
Pulse and IQ's gadgets as well. The game was

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.030
definitely playable but it had a few
bugs to be worked out for sure. But then again

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.270
what pre beta game in development
doesn't? I don't know what's going into

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.689
all the changes but I do know the week our
team spent out in Montreal play testing

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.330
was an interesting one for sure and may
have had a real impact on this

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.040
particular turn of events.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.439
Originally we were scheduled for nearly
constant play testing with a few feedback

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.600
meetings but it sort of organically
evolved into MORE substantial feedback

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.119
meetings about halfway through the week
We had a lot to share with them on all

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.689
aspects of the game.

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.549
Things we loved, things we were
concerned about, things we thought were

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.750
missing, should be adjusted or just
outright changed. Even after the business

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.390
day was over the developers stayed with
us as we went out to get dinner and hang out

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.880
and just continue to talk and give
feedback VERY late into the night.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.560
While that event was huge they've also
specifically cited other events like E3 and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.770
Gamescom as giving them a lot of
feedback too. I know they've been talking

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.640
with both casual gamers and professional
gamers gathering input. Even looking at

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.509
things like the closed Alpha feedback
surveys, you can see that they've always

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.490
been about listening to the community.
We've seen not one but two change logs

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.490
already based on the community feedback
and the game hasn't even gotten to Beta yet.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.819
I think the only thing I wish they would
have done differently would have been to

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.180
ask for the community feedback and
testing at an earlier stage in the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.400
game when things weren't so set in stone
for core game mechanics and infrastructure.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.840
So we know a very little bit about what's
being worked on but there's also the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.270
issue of what HASN'T been talked about
anywhere in much detail yet which is

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.730
pretty much anything non PvP. They
mentioned co-op across ALL modes. Does

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.250
this simply mean the 4 terrorists hunt
types or does this also include the single

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.200
player missions that can ALSO be played
cooperatively? I hope it does! The mission

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.709
mode is something which very little
information has been released about. While I

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.420
was there I advocated heavily for this
mode as Rainbow Six has always been a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.260
franchise with 3 distinct ways to
play it. From multiplayer to single

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.910
player to cooperatively, no matter what
kind of gamer you are one of these modes

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.110
would offer something for you and many
people enjoyed playing all the modes.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.290
Or at least 2 out of the 3.
If refinements are being made to the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.510
mission that would be a great thing for
those of us who enjoy non-competitive

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.920
elements of a good Rainbow Six title. I'm
glad to hear at least some of the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.750
investment in the extra polish is going
to be going to these co-op elements as

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.799
well because I'm just not as big of a
PvP player and the meat of my experience

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.760
will be with the other modes of play.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.850
Delaying the game's release date is
going to provoke some very emotional

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.730
responses in people. There's no way
around it. There's going to be people who are

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.630
really mad or disappointed with the
decision but if we can just take the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.670
emotional aspect and set it aside for a
minute, I think it becomes pretty obvious

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.850
that it's the right thing to do. Doing
this is going to help ensure the best

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.060
possible game and that's something I
think we can all agree with in the end.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.100
We've all watched games like Halo Master
Chief Collection or Battlefield 4 come

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.540
out with broken game play or issues that
were just NOT ready to be pushed into

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.570
the market and yet they were anyway. The
results of those games were damage to

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.590
the brands they represent, damage to the
developers reputations and a pretty

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.019
pissed off community of fans. It's a hard
thing to push a release date back. I mean, you

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.440
risk upsetting players by doing so but
nobody threw a dart at the wall that

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.420
just happened to land on a post-it note
that said to delay the release. This was

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.810
done with lots of internal deliberation
and as a result of community feedback

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.880
and playtesting to give all of us the
best game they can give us. Personally

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.590
I'd much rather wait an extra 6 weeks
for a more polished and complete game than

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.979
a hurried job that hurts the Rainbow
franchise and leaves me as a player

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.500
upset and alienated. What about you? What are your feelings on the new release date?
