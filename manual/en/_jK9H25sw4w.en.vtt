00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.779
Hi! This is Megan with Beadaholique.com and I want to show you

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.699
how to make a half hitch knot

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:16.239
and a half hitch knot is a very basic

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.840
knot and

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.009
it's used

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.240
for quite a few different applications in jewelry making

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.679
commonly used if you're doing a friendship
bracelet knotting

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.009
it's all half hitch knots to do a
basic one like that

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.850
but you can also

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.600
see it in a lot of other applications, it's
done in this necklace here to attach

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.700
a ribbon around the beads

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.170
so it's a good staple to have

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.530
and in a half hitch knot you have

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.040
your base cord

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.720
and then you have a cord you're going to tie  around it

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.130
start with these knotted together. You don't have to, I'm just going to do it for the

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.090
interest of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.970
holding it in place

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.430
so I'm going to have

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.330
my pink cord be my base cord and the black cord be

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.940
the cord I'm knotting around it

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.530
so to do the half hitch knot

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.120
you're going to take

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.140
you're knotting cord

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.150
go over

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.630
the cord

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.930
and make like a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.780
number four

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.490
then you're going to go through the loop you created and pull

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.160
that's your basic half hitch knot and if you did this

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.630
over and over and over again

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.010
it's going to

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.619
loop around the cord

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.500
now there is one thing

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.510
to consider and that is you can see here

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.670
you have this knot going over and the loops

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.009
off to that side, this knot going under the loops
off to that side, this one going

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.090
over the loop off to that side so

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.350
it does make a difference in your knot
whether you go with your

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.060
knotting cord over the core and through

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.249
or if you go under the core

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:11.589
and through

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.559
so those are both half hitch knots but

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.389
usually in your project it will make a difference

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:21.439
You usually want to keep them all going to
one direction to keep it a nice

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.319
consistent

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.639
look to your finished piece

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:27.799
that's how you do a half hitch knot.
