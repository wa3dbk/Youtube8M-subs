00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:13.130
It's quite a deep history of how Manchester
United came about. It was originally formed

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.650
as a working team for Newton Heath and Lancashire
railway in 1878 and then it changed its name

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.089
to become Manchester United and then moved
to Old Trafford in 1910. They first won the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:32.050
league in 1907 and then the following year
in 1908 we won the FACup for the first time.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:46.050
We dominated again in the early 50's under
Busby. Matt Busby had a real idea of bringing

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.890
in players from an early age and when people
talk about George Best and Dennis Law and

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:00.200
Bobby Charlton, Nobby Stiles, there is quite
a romance to the club and those magical players.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:10.079
That's what brought a lot of fans to Manchester
United. Matt Busby was basically the pioneer

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.979
with United winning the league. Two years
earlier he had insisted that the club actually

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.409
take part in the European Cup despite what
the FA wanted at the time and what the football

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.579
league wanted. The team was away at Belgrade
and everyone that knows about Manchester United

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.180
will know about that night on February 6th,
1958. The Munich air disaster, the team plane

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.310
tried to take off a couple of times, there
were heavy winds and heavy snow and on its

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.790
second or third attempt it didn't quite make
it. Several of the players, the press that

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.090
were on board, club officials were killed.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.420
It affected fans all over the world. Famously
Real Madrid offered to loan Di Stefano to

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.429
United to get us through that period because
we lost a lot of the players. A few years

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:06.909
later we triumphed in the European Cup. Getting
to that European Cup final in 1968 was the

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.090
pinnacle of what Busby did, he built the club
and it took ten years after the Munich disaster

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.849
to do that. Due to that we turned to youth
and that's something that we have continually

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.569
done throughout the times. We have always
used young players and promoted young players

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.909
into the first team squad. People will always
talk about the babes, they will talk about

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:34.760
Munich, but he had his legacy during the war
when Old Trafford was badly bombed. The club

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.769
were playing games at Manchester City and
it was Busby who helped get Old Trafford re-built

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.560
into the football stadium it is now.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.110
Theatre of dreams. It was something that Bobby
Charlton came up with himself. It's written

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.909
on the side of the stands. The atmosphere
has gone, I have seen it here when the atmosphere

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.860
has been white hot. The Stretford End certainly
has retained the majority of that and that's

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.610
where the atmosphere is. I'm part of the Stretford
End flags group and predominantly what we

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.799
were set up to do was to do the banners which
you see on the front of the Stretford End

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:13.660
such as 'one love' 'for every manc a religion'.
Along with other supporters groups we have

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.780
spent the last three or four years talking
to the officials at Manchester United to put

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.140
in place a singing section and that is where
we wanted like-minded fans located down near

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:31.940
to the pitch to try and improve the atmosphere.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.780
To pick the best manager of Manchester United,
it's between Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.250
You look at Sir Alex Ferguson's history and
what he has won. We won the FA Cup in 90,

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.510
Cup winners' cup in 91, League Cup followed
that then we won the Premier league title

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.599
in the first year of the Premier League in
92/93. He brought the club back into winning

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.239
the league title after going 26 years without
winning one.

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:05.499
Won two European Cups, countless community
shields, 13 league titles, a world club cup.

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:11.220
Fergie is a one-off, you won't see anything
like him again. An unbelievable manager. The

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:23.740
last couple of years has really brought it
home how great he was. To see that same team

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:31.060
under David Moyes just made you realise how
massive Fergie was. He could turn average

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.740
players into fantastic players and fantastic
players into world class ones.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.090
It's an impossible call to say what your best
player or team was. Bryan Robson is my favourite

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:53.800
all-time player. Captain Marvel, he drove
United. An older fan would say a Chartlon,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.889
a Best or Law, Gary Pallister, Steve Bruce,
Paul Ince, Paul Scholes, David Beckham, Ryan

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.720
Giggs, he has won absolutely everything there
is to win.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.380
For me the best player I have seen in a red
shirt is Cristiano Ronaldo. The goals he scored

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.010
were unbelievable, there was one season where
he got 48 goals for the club. Peter Schmeichal,

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.569
Ferdinand, Dennis Irwin, Roy Keane, Yorke
and Cole, Cantona, van Nistelrooy, I could

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.910
go on and on and on.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.490
The rivalry with City has obviously always
been there because it's obviously another

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.440
club within the city of Manchester. Our rivalry
was more so with Liverpool really. City are

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:43.139
just City, they are not our rivals, the derby
of the north is United v Liverpool.

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.900
Manchester City are always the local team
that we play against and you want to beat

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:54.110
them because you have friends and family that
you will go to work with. Liverpool has always

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:01.550
been the biggest game when it comes to United.
That is gradually changing as City change

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.669
as a club.

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:10.020
Manchester City in the last four or five years,
definitely the rivalry is more intense. The

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.620
tension has been built up a lot more because
City are there as a force now, you can't ignore

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:30.220
them. They have got a great team and they
are fighting for the league again this season.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.801
We probably had our worst Premier League last
year under David Moyes and what we have had

00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:38.229
since Ferguson took over, I think Louis van
Gaal is a sensible appointment. We have seen

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:42.181
exactly what he has done with Holland in the
World Cup, there is a bit of Sir Alex Ferguson

00:06:42.181 --> 00:06:52.410
about him as well. It's good to see the world
class signings coming back to United that

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:58.190
is what we have needed. I believe in his philosophy
and I think with Angel di Maria he has got

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:05.139
a superstar and he will drive the club forward.

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:11.410
If you look at Van Gaal's record at Ajax he
brought through a lot of youth players and

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:19.449
we have seen it this season with Tyler Blackett,
Paddy McNair and James Wilson. At the moment

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:28.280
it is an exciting time to be a Manchester
United fan again. We turn up at Old Trafford

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:34.060
and we don't know what we are going to see
in front of us. There is still a lot to be

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.183
done and I don't think we can judge him until
the next transfer window when there are a

00:07:38.183 --> 00:07:38.910
couple more signings coming to the club.
