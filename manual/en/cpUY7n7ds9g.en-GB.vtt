00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.540
&gt;&gt; Afternoon, doctor. Champion that you could
see me at such short notice.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.100
&gt;&gt; Well, that's alright, lad.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.600
&gt;&gt; Me name's, er...

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.200
&gt;&gt; Yeh, do come in, sither, and sit thee sen down, aye.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.659
&gt;&gt; Pew.

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:29.500
&gt;&gt; I know, I've just had Josiah Ackroyd's
lurcher in here having pups, thou knows ...

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.480
... fair takes the breath away doesn't it ?

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.900
&gt;&gt; Nay, nay, Pew, me name is Pew.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.300
&gt;&gt; Oh I see.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.210
&gt;&gt; I rang thee on the telephone about me tortoise.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.800
&gt;&gt; Oh, happen as nothing like as maybe I remember now, yes.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.200
Let's have a look at the little fellow, what's the matter with him then, sither ?

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.200
&gt;&gt; Well you see he's just not been feeling
himself of late, thou knows.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.100
&gt;&gt; Well that's not but difficult with a tortoise, you know.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.900
In fact well nigh impossible with them little stumpy legs.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.400
&gt;&gt; Nay, you see he's not been feeling himself and I just reckon ...

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.340
he may be a martyr to some kind of mental stress, you see.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.700
&gt;&gt; Ah, well there's nothing like as maybe
we all are, eh ? What's to say ?

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.210
Let's have a little gander at the scamp then, sither.
Come on, get him out.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:26.500
&gt;&gt; Well he's been acting right queer. Fair
mithers me, you see. You see I'm fair mithered ...

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm fair mithered you see because his little legs and little head have been tucked away out of sight all day.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:51.100
It's as if he's got kind of fed up of
living, you know what I mean ? I mean, has ever seen owt look so dejected ?

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.919
&gt;&gt; Well only in a British Rail buffet.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.000
&gt;&gt; Beg pardon ?

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.700
&gt;&gt; Well you see Mr Pew, yon's not a tortoise.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.300
&gt;&gt; Yon's not a tortoise ? What do you mean
yon's not a tortoise ?

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.100
&gt;&gt; I mean yon's not a tortoise.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.900
Yon's a meat pie.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.500
&gt;&gt; A meat pie ?!

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.000
&gt;&gt; Aye, a meat pie.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.500
&gt;&gt; Getaway.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.900
&gt;&gt; No, I'm telling thee it's naught but factual.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.849
Yon's a meat pie and I'd swear that on me mother's whippet's grave.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.500
&gt;&gt; Nay, thou must be blind or soft in head.
Yon's a tortoise and no mistake.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.200
&gt;&gt; Listen if yon's a tortoise, thine's a Chinaman.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.400
&gt;&gt; Tell you, if yon's a meat pie then thine's
another Chinaman.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.300
&gt;&gt; Alright then, alright, happen we'll test
it with a lettuce test, what's to say, eh ?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.200
&gt;&gt; Fair enough, yes. Happen lettuce test will
settle matter.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.300
&gt;&gt; Righto, here we go, then. Give it lettuce
test.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.000
&gt;&gt; There you are, you see.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.300
&gt;&gt; Well, it has eaten a little bit, hasn't
it ?

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.100
&gt;&gt; No, course it hasn't, that little hole
was in the lettuce to start with, you barmpot.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.300
No, that is a meat pie, admit it.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.500
&gt;&gt; Ee, there's nowt but right thou knows,
yon's a meat pie.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.850
&gt;&gt; Aye, I'm thinking there's no mistake, sither.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.300
&gt;&gt; Just a moment, though.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.700
If thon's a meat pie ...

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.700
