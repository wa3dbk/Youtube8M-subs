00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.369
Profoto B2 brings an unprecedented level
of power and portability to the table,

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:28.739
in an easy-to-use kit.

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.120
I call it a kit because it has everything you
need to take your studio on the road with you.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.780
Indoors or on location, this system
has the tools you need to get the shot.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.320
During my time in Beijing, I needed lighting
that would perform both in a studio-style setup

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.529
and on location.

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:48.170
I didn’t have the option to bring my studio
lights and a portable lighting system.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.979
I needed a system that was versatile.

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.490
The biggest challenge I faced previously
was how to control the light.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.350
Light is everywhere, but controlled light
and power is something completely different.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.140
I need Light Shaping Tools that let
me move quick and efficiently 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.770
no matter where I am in the world.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.140
The B2 system comes with Grids, Snoots,
Octaboxes, Barndoors etc. All very portable.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.940
Extremely practical for the mobile photographer.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.900
I’m a running gun style shooter.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.000
Most places I photograph today
don’t allow you to set up

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.070
light stands, sandbags and a crew
of five just to watch gear.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.410
Not to mention I travel all over the
world shooting weddings and portraits.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.600
I need something that is portable –
the smaller the footprint, the better for me.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.300
Shooting in unique locations, we have to
be able to move quickly to get the shot.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.140
Lightweight and powered don’t always go hand in hand.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.140
Not the case here with the B2.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.200
Another part of this system I love is
the ease of use – plug it in and go.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.349
It’s how lighting should be.

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.880
With the built in TTL system,
I can use my Canon metering system 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.690
and put out the light I need
without manually metering,

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.499
letting the system assist with the changing conditions.

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:23.880
Add to that, the system supports manual mode
as well. So if you’ve got more time, perfect.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.859
Set up the lights, get dialed
in with your favorite meter.

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.609
The system has the Profoto receiver system built in.

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.999
One less piece of equipment I
have to carry and worry about.

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:56.389
With 250Ws of power, this is guaranteed
to put out more light than your speedlight.

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.620
Typically, when we talk about portability
it’s usually at the sacrifice of power.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.650
I need power when I want it, how I want it,
and the B2 doesn’t disappoint.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.230
This system has all the features you would expect.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.499
I can control power right from the controller,

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:12.699
again, allowing me to move quickly
and adjust power as needed.

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.240
Shooting on the Great Wall was a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.870
I couldn’t leave anything to chance.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.639
I had to take the equipment I could trust,

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.260
equipment I knew would perform
no matter what the conditions, 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.699
equipment that I could easily travel with.

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:34.609
The B2 is now part of my travel kit
and one I plan on incorporating 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.609
into every aspect of my business.
