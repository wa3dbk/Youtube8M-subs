00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.340
I'm Tom and today i'm going to show you how
to assemble what is currently the most popular

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.219
3D printer hotend - the E3D v5.

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.970
Now the E3D is popular for a couple of reasons:
Well, first of all, it's an excellent hotend,

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.130
and second of all, it's what is know as an
all-metal hotend, which means that there are

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.699
no plastic parts used to hold the individual
parts of the hotend together, like the PEEK

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.080
insulator in designs like the Jhead.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.380
Instead, they are using a machined stainless
steel heat break and a large aluminum wheatsink.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.821
So what that means is that the E3D hotend
can be run at temperatures up to 300°C, or

00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:48.350
even hotter with some modifications, without
the risk of the hotend melting down, which

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.990
is great for printing polycarbonate or some
ABS varieties.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.070
It also means that, with the fan on-board,
the temperatures inside the hotend are very

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.540
tightly controlled, so that the heater block
and nozzle stay hot while the heatsink and

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.259
the groovemount stay cool, which is a problem
on other hotends and would cause issues especially

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:10.619
with printing PLA.

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.659
Now, when you order an E3D, you're going to
get a kit with all the parts you need.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.659
You'll get the heatsink, the heat break, the
heater block, a nozzle, a heater cartridge,

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:27.049
a thermistor with some parts for assembly,
a fan with a shroud and some screws and kapton

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.200
tape.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.549
Because i ordered a bowden version i also
got the couplings for the bowden tube and

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.090
the bowden tube itself.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.180
The only difference on the actual hotend from
the direct-drive to the bowden version is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.439
the top end of the heatsink - the bowden one
has a thread for the coupler, the regular

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.259
one simply has a flat top.

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.159
Other than that, they are the exact same hotend.

00:01:52.159 --> 00:02:02.979
You will also need a philips number 1 screwdriver.

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:11.950
Now, for the actual assembly i'm going to
start with the trickiest part first, and that

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.640
is installing the thermistor.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.420
When handling the thermistor, keep in mind
that the glass body and the thin legs are

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.980
quite fragile, so try and bend them as little
as possible.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.940
So the tricky part here is fixing the thermistor
in that hole right here while keeping its

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.670
legs from shorting to each other or to the
heater block.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.580
This is where the Kapton tape comes in: we're
going to use it to insulate the thermistor's

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.010
legs and also for attaching it to the heater
block.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.470
You want to touch the sticky side of the tape
as little as possible to keep it sticky.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.120
I'll be using my own Kapton tape for this,
but you can do this just as well with the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.740
supplied bit of tape - just cut a strip off
each time you need a piece.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.740
Same result.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.430
Also, if you want it to stick really well
to the heater block, clean the block with

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.570
a bit of acetone or alcohol.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:10.910
First up, to insulate the thermistor's legs,
what i like to do is to take one strip of

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.820
Kapton tape and wrap it around one leg and
then use another strip to insulate the second

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.080
leg and to tie the two legs together.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.730
Leave about a centimeter uncovered on the
end.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.570
Then strip a short part of both ends of the
high-temp wire's glass insulation.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.010
Slip a ferrule over each of the wires.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.820
Bend both the ends of the thermistor's legs
and one side of the high-temp wire into little

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:42.480
hooks and hook them together.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.980
Slide the ferrule over the joint and crimp
it down - you can use a regular pair of pliers

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.680
for this if you don't have a crimping tool.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:58.510
Then use some more tape to insulate those
and to really tie everything together.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.270
So next up, slide the thermistor into its
hole on the heater block and bend its legs

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:10.190
90 degrees so that they sit smooth on the
side of the heater block and make sure the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.980
thermistor's head is as far inside the block
as possible.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.980
This next part is really critical to your
hotend working reliably, so take extra care

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.609
and do it as nicely as you can.

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.310
Take a piece of kapton tape and secure the
thermistor to the heater block with it.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.840
Now, tape won't last long when it has to adhere
to a straight surface like this, so make sure

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.349
to have a single piece of tape going around
at least two corners of the heater block for

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:45.740
securing the thermistor.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.169
Once you're confident that the tape is going
to properly secure the thermistor in its hole,

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.020
we're going to move on to the more fun parts
of the assembly.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.860
Take the nozzle and screw it into the heater
block from the side that has the threaded

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.880
hole in it.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.529
Once it's all the way in, unscrew it by a
quarter turn.

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:08.310
This will make sure that the nozzle will actually
seal against the heat break and not the heater

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.310
block.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.550
Then screw in the heat break from the other
side.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.300
Just make it finger-tight for now, we'll tighten
it down later.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:24.330
Next up, add the heat sink.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.340
Screw the fan onto the fan shroud and slide
that over the heat sink.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.939
For the heater cartridge, you'll need the
little grub screw and the hex wrench that

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:35.370
came in the kit.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.449
Now, what i like to do is use the wiring from
the heater cartridge as a strain relief point

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.990
for the thermistor's wiring, so i'm going
to install it so that they both have their

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.919
wiring on the same side of the heater block.

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.779
Center the heater cartridge in the heater
block and use the grub screw to secure it

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:54.779
in place.

00:05:54.779 --> 00:06:00.370
It doesn't need to be super-tight as you can
easily dent the heater cartridge this way.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.559
Basically, tighten it until the grub screw
feels like it's not going to fall out on its

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:07.759
own.

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:12.849
So if you're assembling a direct-drive hotend,
the assembly is basically done at this point.

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.960
If you've got a bowden hotend, you'll also
need to add the bowden connector.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.409
Clip the insert into the main body of the
connector and screw that whole thing into

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:24.400
the top of the heatsink.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.031
Don't use tools to tighten this down as the
plastic thread will easily snap off if you

00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:32.629
over-tighten it, just give it a firm twist
by hand.

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:37.529
Make sure that the bowden tubing has a nice
and straight cut on its end, then slide it

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:40.800
into the hotend as far as you can.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.449
To release it, hold down the insert with one
hand and pull the tubing out with the other.

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:50.909
Now there's one more step to finishing it
off, and that's finally tightening it down.

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:55.409
Configure your printer's firmware to use the
right thermistor table for the Semitec thermistor,

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:57.870
which is usually number 5.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:03.970
Also check that the maximum temperature is
set to 300°C for the hotend.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:10.749
Then hook up the hotend to your printer and
heat it to 290°C - make sure to connect the

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:14.669
E3D's fan directly to 12V.

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:20.089
Use a 16mm wrench to hold on to the heater
block, then tighten the nozzle with another

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:21.990
wrench or a ratchet.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:27.530
Again, this doesn't need to be super-tight
- E3D recommend using just one finger to tighten

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.809
it.

00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:33.719
Then let go of the heater block and lightly
tighten the nozzle one more time - this will

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:38.229
actually tighten the heat break inside the
heat sink.

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:39.229
So that's it!

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:43.839
Before you start using your brand new hotend,
don't forget to run PID autotune, adjust your

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:48.219
z-endstop's height and calibrate your extruder
if you haven't done so already.

00:07:48.219 --> 00:07:53.749
After that, you're all set for taking your
E3D hotend for a spin.

00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:56.680
So that's it for today - as always, thanks
for watching.
