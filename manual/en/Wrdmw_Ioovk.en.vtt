00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.450
Dinosaurs get their names because paleontologists give them their names. 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.109
We name dinosaurs all the time and

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.150
you know there's just different conventions
people have different styles. Some of these

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.849
complex dinosaur names we know just roll
off the tongue of little kids but how 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.219
did they get those names? There's a nomenclature and there are rules to that

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:24.140
nomenclature

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.609
that require every dinosaur, in fact every
organism, name to have two separate names.

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:31.649
The first

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:37.289
is the genus name, and it's always
capitalized like Tyrannosaures. Rex is

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.780
the species name that follows, in other
words

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.430
there's a particular species of
Tyrannosaurus

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.490
called Tyrannosaurus rex.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.840
Now these names kind of came from Latin
or Greek words. Tyrannosaurus

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.260
means terrible lizzard

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.350
and they can either describe

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.600
some anatomical characteristic of the
dinosaur, like triceratops, it's named

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.470
after the three horns on top of his
head.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.039
Or they can be

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:11.030
names that honor someone; maybe the
person who collected a lot of dinosaurs.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.400
Sometimes

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.320
dinosaurs are named afterwhere they're  found like Edmontosaurus is good example,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.080
it means it's from near Edmonton in Canada.
Traditionally in the old days almost

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.170
every dinosaur ended in "saurus" so we
have, you know Edmontosaurus,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.130
Tyrannosaurus, Albertosaurus. 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.640
That sort of changed a little bit.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.040
One of the things that we regularly do now is we name dinosaurs that are found in China have

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.380
the suffix long. l o n g

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.869
so like, Guanlong, Khunglong.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.610
Long means dragon in Mandarin. And
this is kind of how these dinosaurs

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.650
get their names. they're not simply

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.760
meaningless, but they're either
describing some aspect of the animal,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.780
where it was found, or someone that was
important in its discovery.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.320
And we have a lot of these examples in
the dinosaur halls here at AMNH.
