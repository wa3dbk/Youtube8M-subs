00:00:01.882 --> 00:00:02.882
Man, it's hot.

00:00:02.882 --> 00:00:05.932
I think I'll pour this sports drink all over
myself.

00:00:05.932 --> 00:00:06.932
Dinger!

00:00:06.932 --> 00:00:07.942
I won!

00:00:07.942 --> 00:00:11.412
And I didn't even scuff my loafers!

00:00:11.412 --> 00:00:13.472
Oh my god.

00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:15.532
We just won a cross country dual meet.

00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:20.931
Let's destroy property to show how much we
appreciate the team.

00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:22.241
Riot!

00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:23.562
Riot!

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:27.501
Stupid stop sign.

00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:28.821
Riot!

00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:30.132
Riot!

00:00:30.132 --> 00:00:32.762
Yeah, books.

00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:34.082
Ready?

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:35.392
Okay!

00:00:35.392 --> 00:00:36.711
Riot!

00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:39.342
Yeah, books.

00:00:39.342 --> 00:00:44.601
AHAHAHAHAHA
Flip the pool!

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:47.231
Thank you!

00:00:47.231 --> 00:00:48.542
Er-aaaahhh.

00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:52.492
Those loveable scamps!

00:00:52.492 --> 00:01:01.741
They're rioting at a college level.

00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:04.312
Riot!

00:01:04.312 --> 00:01:06.002
That riot was unacceptable.

00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:07.162
Unacceptable?

00:01:07.162 --> 00:01:09.471
Did you see the pool?

00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:10.471
They flipped the bitch!

00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:13.971
Principal Scudworth, if you were running this
school properly there would be no riots, only

00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:17.312
clone soldiers trained for superior intellectual
and physical combat.

00:01:17.312 --> 00:01:22.041
Little do they know, I have my own plans for
these clones.

00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:24.832
Plans that don't involve these shadowy figures
at all.

00:01:24.832 --> 00:01:27.992
[laughs]
You're talking in a normal indoor speaking

00:01:27.992 --> 00:01:28.992
voice.

00:01:28.992 --> 00:01:29.992
So I am.

00:01:29.992 --> 00:01:34.772
[whispers] Little do they know, I have my
own plans

00:01:34.772 --> 00:01:35.922
Scudworth!

00:01:35.922 --> 00:01:38.571
You're walking on thin ice man.

00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:41.702
I think this is an issue we should talk about.

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:44.052
In person.

00:01:44.052 --> 00:01:46.492
Maybe we could have dinner.

00:01:46.492 --> 00:01:48.162
Perhaps the Olive Garden?

00:01:48.162 --> 00:01:53.092
It's like eating in the private kitchen of
a delightful Italian stereotype!

00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:55.322
We were thinking somewhere more intimate.

00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:56.791
Your house.

00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:58.001
Next Friday.

00:01:58.001 --> 00:01:59.702
No dairy.

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:00.702
Please.

00:02:00.702 --> 00:02:01.702
Dammit!

00:02:01.702 --> 00:02:05.512
I haven't been to the Olive Garden in, like,
forever!
