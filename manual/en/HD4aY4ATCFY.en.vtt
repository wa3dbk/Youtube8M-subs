Hey Cookaholics, Chef Kendra here and today
we're making Cuban Sandwiches.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.469
Now these are not authentic, I mean a lot
of Cuban Sandwiches have salami in it.

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:16.469
This does not.

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:17.820
But it's very delicious.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.210
And what we're going to do is we're going
to use some of that pulled pork that we made

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.050
with that pulled pork sandwiches a couple
days ago, or weeks ago or last week.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.320
Whenever that went down.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.310
Now you guys know I love my sandwiches.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.840
I mean I just can't help it.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.960
The simplicity and the complexity with sandwiches
always thrill me.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.309
Alright, let's do what we do.

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.610
Let's head into the kitchen and make it happen.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.719
We have some Cuban bread that I sliced.

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.089
Let's start by buttering up our bread.

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.289
Next thing we're going to add is some mayo.

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.100
I'm a fan of putting spreads on both sides
of some sandwiches.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.780
The next thing we're going to do is slide
on some yellow mustard.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.929
Just like so.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.329
Now we're going to add some dill pickles.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.140
This bread is about 6 or 7 inches long.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.360
If you can't find Cuban bread go with French.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.829
Now we're adding some Swiss cheese.

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.430
I'm just tearing this to fit, I don't want
a bunch of cheese hanging out the sides because

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.960
we're going to grill this boy and we want
the cheesy goodness tucked into our amazing

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.399
sandwich not falling all over everywhere,
son.

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.679
Time for our ham, brand is called Kentucky
Legend and this ham has been double smoked

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:31.930
and right now is my favorite ham.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.259
Now we're adding our pork to this beast and
we're going to slap the top on it and revel

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.399
in our awesomeness.

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:44.580
Now the last thing we're going to do is brush
on a little butter on top.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.259
But hey, this is totally optional.

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.140
It's your kitchen do what you want.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.479
You can find the link to this recipe in the
about section below.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.370
We're going old school here without George
Forman Grill, of course you can use a Panini

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.149
press or a stovetop grill with and just place
something heavy, like a pot wrapped in foil

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.420
on top for weight for this.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.500
It's no big deal.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.560
So we're going to let this machine do its
thing and we're going to pull it out, cut

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.190
it in half.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.760
Then we're going to eat it.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.090
But first a selfie.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.650
That's all it is to it guys.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.959
