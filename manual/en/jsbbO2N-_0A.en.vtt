00:00:04.911 --> 00:00:06.599
Choreographers out there more and more,

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:10.139
are looking for dancers that have the ability to move well 

00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:14.312
with a strong technical background in modern and ballet.

00:00:14.432 --> 00:00:18.033
Students are required to take both classes at the same level. 

00:00:20.328 --> 00:00:23.277
I think in today's word it is important to be a well-rounded dancer.

00:00:23.397 --> 00:00:25.948
I think Iowa definitely offers that.

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:28.345
I came here because I wanted to perform,

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:34.831
but what I didn't expect is the program helped me realize that I liked choreography. 

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.636
We bring in so many guest choreographers from L.A. this year and New York as well. 

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:43.754
The selling point, I would say, is having access to all of these great choreographers. 

00:00:43.874 --> 00:00:45.712
Since I started out as a ballet dancer, 

00:00:45.832 --> 00:00:50.646
the modern faculty have completely changed the way I approach dance.

00:00:51.696 --> 00:00:54.868
If you are going to be a good teacher, every teacher learns from their students. 

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:59.554
You are always figuring out or learning new ways to help them improve. 

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:06.612
You have students from Brazil, from Italy, from Japan, from Germany, from the United States, from everywhere!

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:12.708
The University of Iowa Department of Dance has a very high recognition nationally and internationally. 

00:01:12.828 --> 00:01:16.077
One of the things that was really attractive to me to come here, 

00:01:16.197 --> 00:01:18.711
is the faculty is outstanding.

00:01:18.831 --> 00:01:22.858
We are teaching students what they actually have to do in the world of dance.

00:01:22.978 --> 00:01:26.067
It's a very intensive program for performance.

00:01:26.187 --> 00:01:29.697
This is definitely one of the strongest departments in the country. 

00:01:30.763 --> 00:01:33.916
You always have an opportunity to perform and show your work,

00:01:34.036 --> 00:01:36.142
that was something very appealing to me.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:41.057
As well as when I saw the building and the studio space, I totally fell in love with it. 

00:01:41.695 --> 00:01:45.311
I think it's a great program, I would definitely recommend it to anybody.

00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:51.540
All of this works to prepare a student for what is to come in their dance careers.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.150
It is a total package at Iowa.
