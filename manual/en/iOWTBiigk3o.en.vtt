00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.990
Today I’m going to talk about plant sickness
and specifically I’m going to be looking

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:23.090
at a book that was written by a French guy
named Francis Chaboussou - it’s called Healthy

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.919
Crops and it’s really amazing.

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:30.679
What he did is he went and looked at a lot
of different research about why plants get

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.120
sick and why they get attacked by insects
and I want to talk about that here.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.750
So let’s say you have a plant.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.949
You have a plant and it’s getting attacked
by insects and I’ve talked a lot before

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.540
about how only sick plants get attacked by
insects.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.920
A healthy plant doesn’t get attacked because
it’s not food for insects - an insect cannot

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.570
digest it.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.600
But this research really got more interesting
as to exactly what’s going on in the plant

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.720
and what makes that happen, and he found out
that if a plant has excess soluble nitrogen

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.470
and I think also excess sugars then what’s
gonna happen is insects are gonna wanna come

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.930
and get those - especially nitrogen is my
understanding.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.050
As to what happens, there can be many reasons,
but for some reason the plant is having a

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.820
problem taking these things and producing
proteins and carbohydrates.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.590
The synthesis of these things is stopping.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.860
Now this could just be a soil imbalance of
minerals - you know, we have very imbalanced

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.860
soil.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.549
It could be a poor soil food web where we
don’t have the beneficial microorganisms

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.570
to help them out.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.950
It could be a water issue.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.740
It could be that the plant got injured.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.130
It can be a number of things so on its own
- it doesn’t really tell us that much but

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.880
there are a couple of implications for us
gardeners.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:13.349
One is definitely that if we apply too much
nitrogen, which is very common in the spring,

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.349
especially soluble nitrogen if you use chemical
fertilizers (pile them on the lawn in the

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.420
spring to get that nice green up and even
into the garden), what’s gonna happen is

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.040
often you’ll see later in the summer the
insects come to dine on the excess nitrogen.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.730
So we don’t want to be applying too much
nitrogen.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.200
It’s an important nutrient but we don’t
want to apply too much.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.939
Now if you’re applying compost, it’s more
slow release so it’s not going to be as

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.790
big of an issue, but you can apply too much
compost and especially manure as well.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.480
My main point there is let’s not apply too
much nitrogen at any one time cause that can

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.480
cause a problem.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:59.300
The other one interesting thing he found is
that chemicals, especially pesticides, cause

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.930
this to happen.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.370
They sort of stimulate this response where
the plant can’t form protein or carbohydrates,

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.239
so if we’re spraying an insecticide to kill
insects we know that it hurts the plant.

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.810
It causes this to happen to a plant.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.349
So more research showing you how spraying
any kind of pesticide, insecticide, fungicide

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.790
- these things affect the plants too.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.950
They affect the whole soil food web.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.579
So that’s the main thing to realize.

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:32.459
I guess it’s really just more proof that
only sick plants get attacked.

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.019
If a plant is balanced and has the right amount
of nitrogen and sugars and minerals to create

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.969
protein and carbohydrates, it’s not gonna
be food for the insects.

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:46.310
They simply won’t even find the plants.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.019
So that’s just what I wanted to talk about
today about plant sickness.

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.099
It’s a little more advanced and the details,
the science of it, is not super crucial but

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:00.069
some of the implications are: not applying
too much nitrogen, not using pesticides and

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.650
just making our plants healthy instead of
fighting the pests.
