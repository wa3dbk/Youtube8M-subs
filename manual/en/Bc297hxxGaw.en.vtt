00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.020
Let's open the box and find out what it is.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.900
It's the McDonalds Happy Meal Minion toy, Tim Giggling, from the movie, Despicable Me 2.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.240
 [Tim talking]

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.980
Tim is a tall two-eyed minion with sprout cut hair.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.340
He's usually seen dressed as a dad.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.800
This McDonalds Happy Meal toy is well-made

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.640
with tough plastic and very nice details.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.920
There are no buttons or switches but when you shake him, he starts giggling.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.420
You can also combine Tim with the rest of the McDonalds Happy Meal minion toys for more fun.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.420
