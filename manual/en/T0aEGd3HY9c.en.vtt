00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.199
Anthony: I'm here with Brian from Code 8, a team
from Uganda

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:06.330
and you guys have created a project called
Matibabu. Tell me a little bit

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.300
about this because this is this is a
really important project I think.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.059
Brian: Yeah Matibabu is to diagnose malaria
without having to pick your body for any

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:13.910
blood sample.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.090
It takes around fifteen minutes for a normal diagnosis

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.850
They pick a small blood sample, which may, at early stages, not be infected

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.849
But with Matibabu, we are going to
diagnose a blood stream for

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.939
sixty seconds which gives it more efficiently

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.040
In Africa you may find a hospital have no
power for 24 hours

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.210
and that means more children are dying
because a child dies every minute

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.770
of malaria. Malaria
affecting 160 countries

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.309
and in Africe it's ninety-one percent. We
are moving out to

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.379
partner with the associations, like The World
Health Organization,

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.480
so that we can plug into their distribution
platform, and then put up a booth like in a

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.059
village

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.340
where everybody can have this accessible.
Anthony: Can you operate it with minimal training,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.750
I'm guessing right like anybody can...

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.830
Brian: No training you just have to tap a button,
which is absolutely no training.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.939
Anthony: So lead me through how Matibabu
works. Brian: All you need is a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.810
such a small device, though this is still a
prototype, that's why you see

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.439
that Arduino board around it. Anthony: And so why are
you using light sensor what happens when

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.810
I put my finger in here?

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.909
Brian: The the red blood cell is by concave and
when it's affected by the malaria

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:22.439
plus modium

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.770
it affects that light scatter properties

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.290
So if I put a red light through your finger at different wavelengths

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.340
I'm able to pick intensities of that...
Anthony: So you're saying yeah the red blood

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.329
cell gets deformed so light bounces off it a
bit differently

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.409
and you guys are able to see that
difference in scattering.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.509
Brian: Actually not only the shape because the shape is
one factor

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.960
but also that biochemical properties. Anthony: And on a personal level, what what

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.200
made you want to tackle this. Brian: Uh
personally I suffered from the disease

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.840
for some good time and during that moving
you reach

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.409
a clinic no no power so they can't diagnose you. You move to...they have to prick

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.130
every time

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.159
prick every time and they take a sample
and they say, "We are not sure it's malaria."

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.079
You go back home you come back you're still feeling not
good

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.170
and then they keep on doing the same thing so...
Anthony: So you you could spend a day two

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.560
days just traveling from clinic to
clinic trying to get properly diagnosed

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.069
Brian: yeah

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.250
that's true. Anthony: So you're using some off the
shelf parts here. How

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.970
how inexpensive do you picture Matibabu
being. Brian: Actually it won't be

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.720
higher than twenty dollar. Anthony: So tell me
about you know coming from Uganda

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.750
creating this thing

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.800
to the Imagine Cup. Brian: Oh it's great. You
sometimes come and say you're in

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.890
Saint Petersburg, Imagine Cup, the final.
It's it's really

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.470
great experience. Anthony: Tell me about the
tech scene in Uganda. Is are there a lot

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.340
of people who are doing things like this
computer engineering

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.870
Brian: I'm its it's pretty hard because I it's
a a new

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.290
a new field in Uganda but you're trying
hard to put put up

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.599
um supporting. Microsoft has a
innovation centres

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.319
For example Microsoft  Innovation Centers
another pubs and other technological

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.239
hubs

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.819
done planted. So with with assistance
from those

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.180
we are fighting I to see that we devote
that the industry you can

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.620
Anthony: So cool. So if people want to find out
more about this, they want to know about

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.000
Matibabu how it

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.819
maybe help out in some way how can they
how can they do it? Brian: Actually we have a

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.980
a blog. It's matibabu.blog.com

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.750
You can find us on Facebook at matibabu
 and Twitter at matibabu8

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.470
Anthony: Thank you so much Brian.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.989
Best of luck for you today. Remember guys we
have tons more from Imagine Cup all week

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:25.760
there are some

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.310
brilliant brilliant innovations here on
the floor

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.170
including some games if you wanna see
those those are over the Rev3Games

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.310
