00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Firstly, I offer my greetings to
Afghanistan and to the brave afghan people

00:00:05.524 --> 00:00:13.224
I am Mitra Kohzad Kochee, daughter of
Mohammad Yussuf Kohzad and Ms Zakia Kohzad.

00:00:13.248 --> 00:00:18.148
I am proud to be an Afghan. I
am proud to be an Afghan woman.

00:00:18.172 --> 00:00:27.272
because, despite several decades of wars,
our Afghans could bravely resist it.

00:00:27.296 --> 00:00:39.296
When I see girls going to schools
and acquiring knowledge,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.620
it really grants me the
feelings of proud.

00:00:41.644 --> 00:00:51.944
In past, we had lots of knowledgeable
persons such Mevlana and other famous poets

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:55.668
We were the developed people.

00:00:55.692 --> 00:01:03.792
It should be noted that when I came
to Afghanistan after a long time

00:01:03.816 --> 00:01:06.016
I visited many places.

00:01:06.115 --> 00:01:13.715
I saw very equipped hospitals. The
technique has reached to its peaks here.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:24.040
Every one owns mobile phones. And many
reconstructions have been occurred.

00:01:24.064 --> 00:01:31.764
These all gave me pleasure. And once
again I felt proud to be an afghan.

00:01:31.788 --> 00:01:38.988
I saw splendorous hotels.

00:01:39.012 --> 00:01:46.512
Briefly, I must say that reconstruction
has occurred in different areas.

00:01:46.536 --> 00:01:50.636
We have the same talents as
European or any other countries.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:02:03.360
Afghan people are brave. We are the people
that all the Asia has to be proud of.

00:02:03.384 --> 00:02:05.784
Because, we are the
heart of Asia.

00:02:05.808 --> 00:02:09.908
My message to my countrymen is,

00:02:09.932 --> 00:02:19.032
please do your best to serve your country,
your people, your sisters and brothers

00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:22.856
so our lives continue with
exact stability and peace.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:33.080
We have to live as brave
and dignified Afghans.

00:02:33.104 --> 00:02:37.504
I am proud of every
single Afghan.

00:02:37.528 --> 00:02:40.028
I am proud of my people, my sisters,
and my brothers and I am proud

00:02:40.052 --> 00:02:55.452
that you do your best in order to lead
the country to reconstruction and unity.
