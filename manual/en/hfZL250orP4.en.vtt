00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.760
Majesty...

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.440
My name is Naveen Badukar.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.280
I am a jewel merchant.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.440
The day before yesterday night,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.640
I kept all my money...

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.760
in a leather bag and placed it in the almirah.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.340
Yesterday morning, I found it missing majesty!

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.180
Yah, Allah!

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.980
Then?

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.360
There are four servants in my house majesty.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.400
I have a feeling that one of them has stolen it.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.420
When I enquired them,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.940
they told me that they don't know.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.120
If I had to beat them to tell the truth,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.500
I may find out the culprit,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.580
but other three will leave.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.960
So please help me to enquire,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.700
and find the thief without hurting them,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.920
Your majesty!

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.440
My friend,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.140
it's very difficult to find the truth,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.720
without punishing anybody.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.480
But you want me to do it and find the truth

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.260
I will try but it's difficult.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.720
Okay...

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.920
Tomorrow you bring your servants to the assembly,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.920
and I will try to put an end to this problem.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.180
Your majesty... Good morning.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.300
These are my servants.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.260
Here they are!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.800
Mmm...

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.080
Birbal...

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.180
Mmm...

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.200
Your majesty...

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.860
I will take up this case and solve it,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.540
by using the knowledge of my magical powers, which I have.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.880
Magical powers...?

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.720
Yes, your majesty.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.760
Mmm...

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.420
Majesty! These sticks have magical powers.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.260
Now, I will give one stick to each of them.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.900
The stick of the person who stole the money,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.040
will increase in length by 4 inches by tomorrow morning.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.120
I think by doing this, we can find the culprit your majesty.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.180
Hmm... Seems to be a very good idea.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.360
Hmm... Do as you wish Birbal.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.040
Take...

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.460
Each one of you take one stick.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.960
Have it beside you while sleeping tonight.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.280
Tomorrow morning, bring the stick to the court.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.740
Yes huzoor...

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.240
Are you a magical stick?

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.960
Hm...m...m... Will you put me in trouble?

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.400
How will Birbal know that, I am a culprit?

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.620
He will find me only if you grow four inches tomorrow.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.620
Hm...m...m..

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.620
I will see to it

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.320
Now Birbal cannot find me.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.060
I have escaped. I have escaped. Escaped....

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.960
Now let's see how I'll get caught.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.320
Give me the sticks, which I gave it to you yesterday.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.360
Mmm...

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.840
You can leave.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.100
Thank you, huzoor

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.780
Show me the stick which I have given to you

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.900
Please take.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.580
Mm... you can leave.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.360
Thank you, huzoor.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.860
Show me the stick which I have given to you.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.900
Please...

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.600
Can I leave you Huzoor?

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.000
No, you can't go wait.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.840
Huh...Huh...

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.100
What's your name?

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.560
Burkand huzoor...

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.140
Okay, Burkand return the merchants money, which you have stolen.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.000
Huzoor, what are you telling?

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.580
I haven't taken any money.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.280
If that is so then what does this mean?

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.100
Mmm... I can't escape, I think.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.620
Don't try to cheat.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.280
Accept your fault.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.260
Birbal... What's happening here?

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.580
I can't understand the magic in it.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.040
Your majesty...

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.140
I have given them just ordinary sticks.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.380
They don't possess any magical powers.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.420
They are just sticks majesty.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.980
But this man was afraid,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.200
that it will grow by four inches.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.540
So he broke the stick yesterday.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.060
If he hasn't stolen, why should he break the stick?

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.560
What Burkat?

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.460
Do you accept that is enough?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.120
Your majesty! Forgive me.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.360
I was the one who stolen the money.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.487
I will return it today.

00:05:05.487 --> 00:05:06.680
Kindly forgive me.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.100
Please forgive me.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.180
I have a family.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.180
Ha...ha...ha...

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.940
Brilliant Birbal... Brilliant...!

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.040
I am at loss of words to praise your brilliance.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.580
Sabash Birbal!

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.080
Minister Birbal...

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.460
Long Live... Long Live...

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.455
Minister Birbal...

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.760
Long Live... Long live...

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.780
Long live... Long live...
