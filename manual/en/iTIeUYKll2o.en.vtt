[ music ] 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.020
 A Super-Sized Lunar Eclipse. 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.710
Presented by Science at NASA. 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.710
Waking up before sunrise can be tough to do, 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.110
especially on a weekend. 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.650
On Saturday, December 10th many of us will be glad we did. 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.250
A total eclipse of the Moon will be visible in the early 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.770
morning skies of western Northern America. 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.150
The action begins around 4:45 am Pacific Standard Time when 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.530
the red shadow of Earth falls across the lunar disk. 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.050
By 6:05 am Pacific Time, the Moon will be fully engulfed in red light. 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.970
This event the last total lunar eclipse until 2014 is 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.570
visible from the Pacific side of North America, across the 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.730
entire Pacific Ocean to Asia and Eastern Europe. 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.170
For people in the western United States the eclipse is 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.640
deepest just before local dawn. 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.260
Face west to see the red Moon sinking into the horizon as 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.100
the sun rises behind your back. 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.590
It's a rare way to begin the day. 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.790
Not only will the Moon be beautifully red, it will also be 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.670
inflated by the Moon illusion. 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.450
For reasons not fully understood by astronomers or 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.240
psychologists, low-hanging Moons look unnaturally large 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.690
when they beam through trees, buildings and other 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.240
foreground objects. 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.580
In fact, a low Moon is no wider than any other Moon 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.420
(cameras prove it) but the human brain insists otherwise. 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.900
To observers in the western USA, therefore, the eclipse 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.090
will appear super-sized. 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.160
It might seem puzzling that the Moon turns red when it 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.430
enters the shadow of the Earth aren't shadows supposed to be dark? 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.630
In this case, the delicate layer of dusty air surrounding 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.210
our planet reddens and redirects the light of the sun, 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.080
filling the dark behind Earth with a sunset-red glow. 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.890
The exact hue (anything from bright orange to blood red is 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.580
possible) depends on the unpredictable state of the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.540
atmosphere at the time of the eclipse. 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.720
As Jack Horkheimer (1938-2010) of the Miami Space Transit 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.030
Planetarium loved to say, "Only the shadow knows."

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.600
Atmospheric scientist Richard Keen of the University of 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.440
Colorado might know, too. 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.980
For years he has studied lunar eclipses as a means of 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.180
monitoring conditions in Earth's upper atmosphere, and he 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.280
has become skilled at forecasting these events. 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.080
"I expect this eclipse to be bright red with a possible 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.540
hint of turquoise at the edge," he predicts. 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.830
Earth's stratosphere is the key: "During a lunar eclipse, 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.740
most of the light illuminating the moon passes through the 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.140
stratosphere where it is reddened by scattering," he explains. 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.490
"If the stratosphere is loaded with dust from volcanic 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.180
eruptions, the eclipse will be dark; a clear stratosphere, 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.350
on the other hand, produces a brighter eclipse. 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.150
At the moment, the stratosphere is mostly clear with little 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.080
input from recent volcanoes."

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.510
That explains the brightness of the eclipse, but what about 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.440
the "hint of turquoise"? 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.290
"Light passing through the upper stratosphere penetrates 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.310
the ozone layer, which absorbs red light and actually makes 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.110
the passing light ray bluer. 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.170
This can be seen as a soft blue fringe around the red core 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.430
of Earth's shadow."

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.790
Look for the turquoise near the beginning of the eclipse 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.010
when the edge of Earth's shadow is sweeping across the 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.530
lunar terrain, he advises. 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.280
A bright red, soft turquoise, super-sized lunar eclipse: 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.980
It's coming on Saturday, December 10th.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.720
Wake up and enjoy the show. 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.110
