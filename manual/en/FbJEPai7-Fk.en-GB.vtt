00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.820
Thailand - March 2015

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.460
This project is something I’ve been thinking about

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.600
for a long time.

00:00:30.474 --> 00:00:31.294
I want to show these fireflies

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.580
I want to influence their behaviour,

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.960
their flickering, with artificial lights.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.434
We established some preliminary links with researchers,

00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:44.474
notably in Thailand,

00:00:44.474 --> 00:00:47.474
where you find these large populations

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.480
of synchronous fireflies.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.640
We first arrived in Bangkok,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.740
where we were welcomed by Anchana Thancharoen.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.880
She brought us to this site in the forest

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.160
where we were able to see

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.500
these fireflies for the first time.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.520
We then spent two weeks at the site,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.060
first to document their synchronous behaviour,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.780
then to start on the experiments,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.140
in which we attempted to influence

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.960
the synchronisation of these fireflies.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.960
Japan - April 2015

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.180
We started out in Tokyo,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.120
where I launched into a somewhat technological search,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.620
to find measuring devices,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.700
scientific tools,

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.360
that I wanted to bring with me to Basel.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.600
Then we were able to pay a visit to Dr Ohba

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.520
at his Firefly Institute, near Yokohama.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.360
He had helped me enormously,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.120
by sharing lots of information with me:

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.280
about breeding,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.720
transporting and presenting these living creatures,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.180
how to work with organisms.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.560
I am very happy Audemars Piguet

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.500
is giving me the opportunity to show this work,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.660
that they are interested in what I am doing

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.300
and see the links between our practices.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.140
It will of course be a special kind of experience…
