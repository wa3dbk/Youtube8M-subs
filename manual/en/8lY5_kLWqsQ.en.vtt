It is important to keep your saxophone clean.
You've got pads all down the sides of your

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.210
saxophone that get wet over any period of
time playing, just moisture coming from your

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.940
breath. The hot air going through a cold saxophone
makes precipitation inside the sax so it is

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:23.690
important to keep it dry inside there, obviously
your pads can get kind of prematurely worn

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:30.300
down if you don't keep them dry. A great took
to keep them dry that does not damage the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.530
horn is this great cleaner pad. They have
got every brand in the world that makes any

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.680
kind of saxophone accessories makes these.
It is basically a nice soft little pad that

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.130
is attached with some weights inside so that
you can pull it through the saxophone. I will

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.010
just demonstrate on my sax here how it gets
pulled through. You just drop the weights

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.870
down in the saxophone like so and give it
a lot of slack because whenever we want the

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.630
weights to go down around the corner at the
bottom and put some slack down in there, turn

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.549
the saxophone over and give it a little shake.
It should just come right out of the bell

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:17.189
like that and then you pull it through. You
want to hold on to the sax securely when you

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:34.459
are doing this because you don't want to drop
it. There you go with one swoop you get all

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:40.140
the moisture through the whole saxophone out
and it is that simple. There are also smaller

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.799
cleaners to use for the neck strap and the
mouth piece. This is a similar kind of deal.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.959
There are no weights necessary in this one
it just needs needs to be kind of stiff so

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:56.930
that you can poke it through and here is my
mouth piece in question. You get a little

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.380
bit of moisture or a little bit of spit clogged
up in there it can get pretty nasty and you

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.009
just pull it right through and that is going
to be clean. Same deal with the neck of the

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:22.260
saxophone, put it right through there and
pull it through there you go, nice and clean

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.170
and dry and ready to go.
