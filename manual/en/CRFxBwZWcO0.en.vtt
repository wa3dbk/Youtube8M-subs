00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.560
This morning we have witnessed the commencement 
of the journey of the flame of Hope to

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.270
Newcastle for the inaugral Special Olympics

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.800
Asia Pacific Games. As custodians of the
flame, the law enforcement officers

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.510
carry the torch on behalf of Special
Olympics.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.070
The flame symbolises the struggle and
challenges people with an intellectual

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.120
disability

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.580
have in our society. Special Olympics,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.150
through it's programs of sport and
leadership training,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.260
offer hope, so the people we serve can enjoy

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.910
the opportunities and life that so many
of us take for granted.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.110
Today we witnessed 90 police runners
bring the Flame

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.489
of Hope across the Harbour
Bridge with law enforcement through the

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:58.360
torch run

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.530
working with Special Olympics Australia
we've seen

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.720
a wonderful, wonderful morning.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.470
I know that the torch is about to
move up into the Hunter, it will

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.759
over the next few days and it will arrive on
Sunday

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.660
for the grand opening of the
2013 Asia-Pacific Special Olympics.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.570
Those games will stretch for a week,
we'll see

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.290
representatives from over forty nations
coming together

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.240
to celebrate all that's good and right in
this particular

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.470
event and it's something that we've been
proudly associated with for many years.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.890
What you need to understand as law 
enforcement officers

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.430
is that you give a voice to a population

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.320
that has kept silent for so long,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.369
you give vision to a certain population
that has been kept in the shadows

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.680
and you make dreams come true. Dreams

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.470
of not being picked last for the team, dreams

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.869
of inclusion and simple dreams

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.200
of just being treated like everyone else.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.500
Our athletes and those with intellectual
disabilities are incredible

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.829
people and they provide so much value to
our communities

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:13.110
and I can tell you, after being involved in this
great movement for so long and those

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.530
of you who have as well

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.910
understand that we receive far more than
we could ever give to them.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.889
