00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.900
Today I’m going to show you how to replace
the camera on the iPhone 6.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.480

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.899
Here’s the iPhone 6.

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.469
First we’re going to have to go ahead and
take off the screen.

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.450
To do that, we have to take out the two pentalobe
screws down at the bottom of the phone.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.130
If you are looking for replacement tools or
replacement parts, go ahead and look in the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.770
video description and I will link some of
them for you there.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.600
I’m going to take my suction cup and pull
up on the screen just a little bit so it’ll

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.720
leave enough room for me to wedge my pry tool
between the screen and the frame.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.620
You can use a plastic tool or a metal tool,
just make sure you pry up on the metal part

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.190
of the screen instead of the middle of the
screen or else you are going to crack it.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.180
There are five screws all along this metal
plate.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.020
Take all of that out and then there are 4
ribbon cables that you have to unlatch from

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.020
the phone.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.680
They are kind of like little Lego pieces.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.739
So just lift them up and away and then that’s
the only thing holding the screen on the phone.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.610
So once that’s off, your screen is off,
and you’re good to go.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.700
Now we have two screws holding on the rear
camera.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.470
The first one is easy to see; you can just
unscrew that and lift it out.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.960
The second one is hidden underneath black
tape, so just kind of put your screw driver

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.619
there and just pull it out.

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.020
And then you can pull it out with your tweezers
after that.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.719
The camera bracket comes off and then the
camera itself comes out of the little holster

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.109
that it’s in.

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:31.140
This is the 8 megapixel iPhone 6 camera.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.380
It’s actually pretty awesome.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.609
Then here you can see the little hole.

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:39.499
So if you get like dust or dirt or anything
down in there you can blow it out pretty easily.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:42.450
Then there are these little brackets along
the side that kind of pinch the camera into

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.990
place as you push it back in.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:55.039
The camera can do 720p at 240 frames a second
which is pretty phenomenal for a cell phone

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.270
camera.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.249
Get those two screws back in and then you
just want to clip each of these little ribbon

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:01.919
cables back into place.

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:06.249
Make sure not to be too aggressive with them
because you can bend pins and then you have

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:08.729
to get a new screen after that which would
be pretty annoying.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.220
So go ahead and be gentle with those.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.920
Clip them in kind of like little Lego pieces.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.370
And then take your little metal bracket and
those 5 screws; put them back together.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.400
And then you can pinch down your screen again.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.170
Make sure to align the top of it first so
they’ll slide in these little grooves and

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.640
it’ll be completely flush along the top.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.340
Then you can pinch along the edges all the
way down the phone.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.890
And then don’t forget those 2 bottom screws,
the pentalobe ones.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.120
Then if you’re looking for parts or anything
else go ahead and look in the video description.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.680
I’ll have everything there, linked, that
you’ll need.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.921
