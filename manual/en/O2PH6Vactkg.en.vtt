Hello in this tutorial I show you how to make a surprise box, where you can put sweets, chocolates or a small gift

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.900
Material

00:00:21.846 --> 00:00:34.631
cardboard of the color you want, ruler, pencil and eraser, crease-tool, table and cutter

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:46.768
scissors, glue stick, cold silicone, rice paper, acetate

00:00:48.750 --> 00:01:01.388
to decorate: craftingeek deco paper or wrapping paper, ribbon, stickers, markers, perforator of figures

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.017
3d objects like this flower and what you're going to put in

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.358
Take the cardboard, ruler and pencil, trace a figure 
 in the center of 32 x 15 cm

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.436
you will have this

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:41.040
make marks on the top and bottom at 
 2, 7, 12, 22 and 27 cm

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.580
join each pair of marks with a straight line

00:01:52.234 --> 00:01:59.120
locate the column of 10 cm wide, on top we 
 will draw a rectangle 4 x 10 cm

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.430
and one at the bottom of 5 x 10 cm

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.570
the figure will look like this

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.060
the next step is make rectangles of 2 cm 
 wide on each side of the lower rectangle

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.010
We will do one of 2 x 5 cm, another of 2 x 
 10 cm and the last one of  2 x 5 cm

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.570
you should have this

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.510
trace diagonal lines in these figures

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.890
also in the first rectangle

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.450
cut the figure, cut the shaded areas to form the tabs

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.690
If you want you can round these corners

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.140
the result will be this

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.220
make marks on these two lines at 5 cm from the top

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.580
join with a straight line

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.320
we will work with these two rectangles

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.970
make marks right in the middle at 2.5 cm

00:03:49.378 --> 00:03:53.380
Make diagonal lines from the edge to the mark of 2.5 cm

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.350
you must have triangular shapes

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.070
when you finish, we will work with this Ã¡rea

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.380
Make marks at 1.5 cm on each side

00:04:08.533 --> 00:04:11.360
join each pair of marks with a straight line

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.560
in this square is where the window will be

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.890
if you want you can make other figures

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.340
you can also round the corners

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.380
Put the table below the figure, with the cutter, cut the outline

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.610
help yourself with the ruler to make straight cuts

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.500
you will have this

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.870
in the acetate, trace a square of  8 x 8 cm

00:04:52.687 --> 00:04:56.060
cut and glue to the main figure

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.520
Now mark the fold over these lines

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.860
flip the figure, in the place where there are no lines begin to decorate

00:05:31.745 --> 00:05:35.460
use different materials, like ribbons, deco paper, etc.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.800
before assembling the box you have to fold the triangles

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.970
Now, you can assemble the box, first the 
 big tab that is in the back

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.470
put glue on this tabs

00:05:59.384 --> 00:06:01.440
and glue this way

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.300
press

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.550
the top should fold like this

00:06:11.384 --> 00:06:13.980
now, you can put the sweets or the gift

00:06:14.764 --> 00:06:16.960
before doing that, take the rice paper 

00:06:19.477 --> 00:06:22.240
and fold in half 2 or 3 times

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:27.510
make horizontal cuts trying to cut small pieces

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.270
when you have enough, make this move to unfold

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.270
Put the papers in the box and accommodate the sweets or the gift

00:06:42.187 --> 00:06:44.590
when you like the result you can close the box

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.440
you can keep putting decorations on the front like this flower

00:06:55.213 --> 00:06:57.610
your box should look like this

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.430
we're done

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.570
