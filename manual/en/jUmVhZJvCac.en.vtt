00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
[M] Today, we will be introducing our new segment,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.705
which will be replacing our former Wednesday WTF, a.k.a. Wonderful Treasure Find.

00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:08.411
So today, we introduce to you:

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.235
[M] We'll be wanking every Wednesday from now on!

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:18.189
[S] We'll be the biggest, most dedicated WANKers Korea has ever seen.

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:25.025
[M] You know, now that I hear that word out loud for 
 the first time, I think wank might have a different meaning.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.744
[S] You're right. I've heard that word before. [M] Yeah...

00:00:26.744 --> 00:00:28.167
[S] You know what it is? (light bulb appearing over person's head sound) 

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:32.005
Wank is a very popular mountain in Southern Germany.

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:35.379
[M] Ahh! Yeah, the Wank is actually a really popular hiking destination. [S] Yes!

00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:37.984
[M] And you can actually stay overnight on the Wank at the Wank House.

00:00:37.855 --> 00:00:42.787
[S] That's right. Right, so just to clear things up, 
 we're not talking about the Wank mountain 

00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:45.078
because I know a lot of you were confused by that. 
[M] I'm sure.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.394
[S] We're talking about a totally different kind of WANK.

00:00:47.394 --> 00:00:50.512
[M] Ok. Now this isn't going to be like a simple, boring day trip.

00:00:50.512 --> 00:00:52.458
We've thought of some devious challanges 

00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:55.547
and like plans to make our wanking adventures more exciting.

00:00:55.547 --> 00:00:58.359
[S] Number one: Kind of like a 'Where's Waldo' in Korea,

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.097
we have to find a picture of a Kpop idol and 
 take a picture of ourselves wanking in front of it.

00:01:03.097 --> 00:01:07.155
[M] Number 2: Both Simon and I will be on 
 the lookout for really creative uses of Engrish.

00:01:07.155 --> 00:01:08.697
[S] Oh, there's lots of it.  [M] There sure is.

00:01:08.697 --> 00:01:11.806
And you guys will vote on which one 
 of us picked the best Engrish! 

00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:15.405
You can do so in the facebook poll 
 or in the comments underneath this video.

00:01:15.405 --> 00:01:16.156
It's probably gonna be me.

00:01:16.156 --> 00:01:17.517
[S] Doubt it. [M] I'm pretty good at that.

00:01:17.517 --> 00:01:19.179
[S] I'm much better. [M] My eye's always open for it.

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:25.047
[S] And number 3: Each video we're gonna have a 
 random challange. A showdown. A WANK-off if you will.

00:01:25.047 --> 00:01:28.937
The loser of each challange will be punished.

00:01:28.937 --> 00:01:34.292
The loser will roll the random punishment die 
 and suffer the dire consequences. (Wiggles fingers)

00:01:34.292 --> 00:01:38.515
[M] So next week we've actually prepared a special Christmas shopping WANK in Myeongdong!

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.290
Yes! But after that we'd like you guys to participate 
 in helping us choose where we want to go.

00:01:42.344 --> 00:01:43.350
[S] It could be a broad idea.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.090
For example, what's an ice cream shop in Korea like?

00:01:46.087 --> 00:01:50.650
Or it could be something more specific like I want you to 
 go to this university and show us what it is like.

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.610
Please leave your suggestions for future WANKing locations in the comments of this video,

00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:56.160
on our Twitter, or on Facebook.

00:01:56.287 --> 00:01:57.460
[M] Oh we almost forgot!   [S] Right.

00:01:57.456 --> 00:01:59.960
[M] The winners of our last WTF, the two care packages 

00:01:59.956 --> 00:02:02.550
will be announced in the Blooper footage. [S] Oh, yes!

00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:04.540
[S] So make sure you subscribe so you can stay up-to-date

00:02:04.538 --> 00:02:08.460
with all of our Wonderful Adventure Now Korea videos.

00:02:08.463 --> 00:02:11.990
(Bong) Thanks for watching the WANK of EYK! Bye!
