What's up dudes and dudettess, dudarinies,
I'm Hilah.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.130
Today, I'm going to show you how to make some
Hummus.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.500
Hummus was real popular a few years ago and
then everybody got off on to this other food

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.830
like Sushi and Turduckens and anything that
you could buy out of a trailer, but whatever

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.320
Hummus is still good.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.910
If you were dating a vegan, it's one thing
that you all can eat together, so let's make

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.470
some.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.019
[Music]

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:33.789
Here, I have one, two, three, four, five ingredients
plus water.

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:34.789
I don't count water.

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:37.440
I put my chickpeas in there.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.210
I rinsed them and drained them.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.500
Sometimes I use a food processor, since most
people don't have one and my food processor

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.559
looks all grimy and it does not look sexy
on camera I decided to use my blender.

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.449
Probably for one can of chickpeas put in like
the juice of one lemon.

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.600
It's a good start, so I'll do that in just
a second.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.960
I'm going to squeeze the lemons, yikes.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:19.070
Then a couple of cloves of garlic, you don't
really need to cut them up because I'm going

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.500
to put them in a blender.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.830
I'm just going to do that.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.830
Sorry, I'm all jazzed today; I'm feeling sexual
because of the hummus.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.770
Anyways, Tahini; Tahini is a sesame based.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.830
This is Yum Nature brand and probably it's
going to be good because it has the word Yum

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.060
in the brand name.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:55.430
I'm going to shake it because it's like the
natural peanut butter in it and it separates;

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.630
probably two tablespoons to start with.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.970
It's kind of bitter if you put too much in,
but then the lemon juice kind of counteracts

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.560
that bitterness and that's good.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.250
Just a couple of tablespoons of olive oil;
I'll use a lot more water than olive oil generally

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.480
because I like to keep the fat content lower,
so I can watch my figure better and look good

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.120
to make my cooking show on the TV.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.730
Okay, I'm going to blend it up in the blender.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:44.900
I'm going to jab at it, stir it around, and
then do that some more.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:59.650
Totally perfect, oh my god, kitchen genius.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.920
Alert!

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.190
Alert!

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.290
All right, so I like it real, real smooth
so I let it blend for a minute or so.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:17.030
I don't need to add any salt because the chickpeas
have salt in them and juice of one lemon approximately

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.560
two tablespoons, two tablespoons of Tahini,
a tablespoon of olive oil, about half-a-cup

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.540
of water, well, quarter cup of water -- perfect
hummus!

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.900
Look at that and look, hey, if I want to I
can get some Hungarian paprika and put that

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.020
on top.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.569
Make it look like it's at your favorite Mediterranean
restaurant.

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.560
All right, that's it.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.150
See you guys later.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.420
