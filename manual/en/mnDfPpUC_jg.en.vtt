00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.220
Sleep and Smartphones: 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.100
Is chemistry keeping you awake?

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.520
It’s 1am.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.359
You should be sleeping,

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:08.860
but you’re glued to your smartphone,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.250
catching up on the latest news,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.880
facebook updates and tweets.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.340
It turns out that the smartphones and tablets

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.340
that keep you connected and organized...

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.140
May also be keeping you awake.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.019
See, our eyes perceive light

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.910
in a range of wavelengths.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:22.640
Different wavelengths produce

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.579
different color sensations.

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:25.599
And those sensations help

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.249
tune your internal clock.

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:29.130
Here’s sleep researcher Brain Zoltowski.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.009
“One of the best biological cues we have to what

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.980
time of day it is… is light. And it turns out

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.800
that blue light in particular is very effective

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.210
for basically predicting when morning is.”

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.700
And guess what puts out a ton of blue light.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.780
Your ipad, your phone, your computer

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.910
emit large quantities of blue light.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.890
That means when you’re under the covers texting,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.710
tweeting or playing your latest game obsession,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.470
you’re essentially telling your body

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.770
“it’s morning!” Again.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.550
What you want instead is more red light,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.170
which is more abundant towards dusk.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.240
And that will help your body basically recognize

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.469
‘It is now evening,

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:06.969
and I should be preparing for sleep.’

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:09.590
Your body gets that signal through melanopsin.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.210
Melanopsin is a protein that undergoes

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.560
a chemical change when exposed to light.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.289
This protein hangs out in cells called,

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.240
well, we’ll let brian explain.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.819
“They’re referred to as Intrinsically

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:21.659
Photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells.

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.060
It’s a mouthful.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.329
Basically these cells are located

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.920
deep behind the eyes where you’re going

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.630
to be able to get and collect light

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.749
through your normal process, but

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:34.229
it’s just not affecting basically

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.560
the same visual regions of the brain.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.340
Rather, they’re more signaling through

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.060
to the Supercreasmatic Nucleus, called the SCN,

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.759
where our master clock is located.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.560
That master clock regulates circadian functions…

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.780
everything that tells your body

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.189
to wake up and go to sleep.

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.530
There’s still a lot we don’t know about
sleep and how it happens.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.289
So what can you do in the meantime to help
reset your clock?

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:57.759
If we basically do

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.789
what our bodies naturally want.

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.600
Eating at the right time of day,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.029
going to sleep when we’re tired.

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:07.779
You’ll find that you’ll get

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:08.989
much more restful sleep.

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.179
So shut off the screens well

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.760
before you hit the sack. And

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.980
don’t follow this sleep researcher’s example.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.010
I am a horrible example.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.400
Despite knowing a lot about these processes,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.040
every night I still fight

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.500
the urge to go to sleep.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.120
I am most productive probably starting

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.640
at about 10pm at night.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.680
So most of my research and work then

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.709
is being tried to be done at a time

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.560
when I’m supposed to be going to sleep.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.260
Hey instead of hitting that snooze button,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.629
why not hit the subscribe button

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:38.890
and get more chemistry fun

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.829
and facts from reactions.

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:41.959
Sleep well, internet.
