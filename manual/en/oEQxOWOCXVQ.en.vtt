00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:13.040
(((Music &amp; Laughter)))

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.380
(((Applause)))

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.820
Play?

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.980
How does it relate to clown?

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.800
Play?

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.660
Hmm...

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.120
Mmm...

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.670
That's the thing you press when
you want to watch the video.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.119
You "click" and it goes "play".

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.759
How does one describe...

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.840
...to describe play?
You know it when you don't have it.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.600
(((laughter)))

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.700
Play?

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.660
Play is one of the most important
aspects of clowning.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.820
It's what it's really all about.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:18.320
(((music)))

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.960
I think playing and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.410
creativity

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.990
are sort of the same thing.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.920
Play in it's pure sense has...

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:30.329
no structure.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.740
We live in a world that's very square.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.420
We live in a society that is based on
an engineering model of the universe...

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.479
everything is created and success depends on having an idea...

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.340
...this isn't play...this is fucking irritation.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.390
The idea...(((Laughter)))

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.509
The play involves accepting things are
happening

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.230
and rolling with them and creating
something totally new out of

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.250
nothing or out of where you were and
then you're playing and then..wow...

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.970
You're in this whole new place. 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.200
It's about how you interact with things...

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.460
and I think interacting with things...

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.920
...in a...with a forward...

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.929
...with a forward...

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.509
curiosity. 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:26.809
(((Music)))

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:32.089
(((Applause)))

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:33.729
Play is the look on...

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:38.249
...on people's faces when they're not
trying to perform and their just trying to...

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:42.209
...to play a game, you know, like you watch people playing tag...

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.129
...and their not thinking about...

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.480
performing, there just thinking about fucking
either being it or not being it!

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.209
 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.889
I am always telling my students...
...you know...

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:56.090
...just play! Just play! Try this, try that, lets do this,
and you know...

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.829
do 20 versions of it!

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.459
Change this, try that just just see
what happens...

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:10.329
it's the...
...I mean that's how you get ideas!

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.510
That's how you create things!

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.790
(((Laughter)))

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.310
Thith ith a vewy dark, an seedy bawr.

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:26.069
Do you understand what I am saying?

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.369
(((Laughter)))

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:29.369
Yeah, because in a film-noir

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:31.369
there's a lot of literal poetry

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.539
So if we are not all absolutely queer.

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:36.159
You need to raise your hand.

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.039
(((laughter)))

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.599
Is everyone QUEER?

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.579
You learn all your technique...

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:46.759
...you learn all your craft...

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:50.329
the you forget all that...stuff

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.009
and you just...play and have fun.

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:58.799
Play without competition.

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.269
To play for the sake of fun.
To have fun, to play, not to win.

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.779
and the moment we make play

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:08.519
something competitive,
It's no longer play...it's competition.

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:18.019
(((Music)))

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.729
It's when you're at your most...

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.279
vulnerable...

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:27.030
...situation or position as a human,

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.209
that you get to be...

00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:34.400
...very aware and very open...

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.319
...to whatever...

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:37.999
...is out there.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.960
Aaaaggghhh!!!!

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.300
Well you know as a little kid I use to play all
by myself...

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.860
(((Crying)))

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.759
...trains you know... (((Train sounds)))...

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.370
even if i didn't have the trains...so...

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.350
clowns like to play...

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.930
...and they make...

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.330
...they create worlds...

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.270
that have a certain since of...uhh...

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.570
of... new and freshness that you see with kids.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.050
Play to me lacks a kind of idea going into playing...

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.900
that I'm going to finish somewhere...

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.139
I don't play...

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.620
uh... necessarily in the purest since...uh...

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.150
...with a result in mind.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.080
You sort of have an idea of where you want
to go...

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.760
but you're letting your environment...

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.400
and your letting the experience...

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.680
and your letting the idea of fun...

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.869
guide you.

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:45.789
And in that sort of free-form flow

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.209
that's that's play.

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:50.749
But often the most powerful parts of the clown, are the parts that you...

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:52.329
Are,,,may not...

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.160
((giggle))

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160
be most happy to show initially.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
Clowns look at things and and turn them into

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.400
uh...

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.250
something new and innocent and...uhh..

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.170
full of vim and vigor and sometimes
fear and scary but funny!

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.429
And I think in some way when we play...

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:09.429
we find harmony in the mind...

00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:11.429
...the body...and the soul...

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.300
and we understand what it is to be....

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.740
...to be!

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:44.980
(((music)))

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:47.899
For a clown to really come up with
those discoveries...

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.700
that are really interesting.

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:52.669
That really do show a different way
of looking at things,

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.320
the eccentric solution to the problem,

00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:59.809
uh... really creative problem solving,
play is essential because you'll just try

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:01.370
stuff that you wouldn't

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.599
ordinarily try...it will...it will free you from...

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:08.159
the shackles...uh...you know...over...overly
rational thought

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.180
We can play...at our job...

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.050
we can see work as play.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.969
And if we can play...

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:17.629
and find the game in everyday life...

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:21.369
in the mundane things we have to do everyday to make money and make a living...

00:07:21.369 --> 00:07:23.369
if we can find play in that

00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:24.610
we are winning the...

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.499
we are winning the big game of life!

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:27.979
I play with myself every night.

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:58.899
