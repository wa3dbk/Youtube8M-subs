00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.680
This magical glowing mixture is very strange,
because it handles like pizza dough, but the

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.150
instant you stop moving, it liquifies and
melts into a glowing goo. In this project

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:17.150
you'll see how to turn your ordinary garden
potatoes, into this fluorescent magical mud.

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.199
Let's get started by grabbing a big bag of
potatoes, and washing the outsides so they're

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.289
all nice and clean. Now we need to chop these
up into the smallest pieces possible so, for

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:36.870
convenience, I'm using a food processor. If
you don't have one, you can always chop your

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.449
potatoes with a knife and cutting board. When
you've got your potatoes reduced to tiny bits,

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.649
slide them all into a large mixing bowl, and
pour in enough hot water to cover them completely.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.089
We'll need to stir this around for a few minutes,
and you may have noticed the water turning

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.120
red, and that's completely normal. Now let's
grab a strainer and another large bowl, so

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.839
we can separate the potato water from the
chunks, then watch closely as something incredible

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.770
begins to happen. After about 10 minutes,
you can see a strange white layer appears

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.220
at the bottom of the bowl. Now if we try pouring
everything out, you can see this new white

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.680
layer, amazingly, stays in the bottom.  The goop is a little bit dirty, so to

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.930
clean it, let's mix in a bit of fresh water,
and pour it into a tall thin container, like

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.590
a glass or a jar. When the lid is on tight,
let's just shake it all up again, then let

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.750
it sit for another 10 minutes. Once again,
you can see it separates into layers, and

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.719
this time, almost all the impurities are collected
in the middle. Now check this out. If we quickly

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.829
dump out the water, it takes most of the impurities
with it, leaving us with a very clean, and

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.250
magical substance. It kind of looks like milk,
but if you try stirring it around, you can

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.030
see it behaves very strangely. Now if this
goo is left out for a day or two, you can

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.000
see it will crumble into a powder without
much effort at all. And that's exactly what

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.049
we need, to take this to the next level, and
add the glow. The magic happens with a bottle

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.920
of tonic water, because it contains quinine.
If you turn on a black light, you'll notice

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.009
the water fluoresces, and the whole bottle
looks completely supernatural. Now let's go

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.220
ahead and put a few spoonfuls of our magical
white powder in a bowl, then try mixing in

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.330
small amounts of tonic water to see what happens.
In just a few seconds it becomes amazingly

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.940
difficult to stir, because the magic goop
hardens, every time we push on it. With a

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.320
little patience, everything should combine,
and behave exactly the way it did before.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.950
The difference this time, is that now it's
fluorescent. If we turn on some black lights,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.900
you can see the magic mud takes on a mystical
glow, and looks and feels a lot like pizza

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.470
dough, as long as we move it around constantly.
If you pause for just a second though, the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.480
dough collapses into a glowing goo, and slimes
down between your fingers. But maybe that's

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.780
ok, as long as you're in the mood to make
a mess. I tried pouring some out of a flask,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.340
and rather than dropping straight down, you
can see it actually flowed out in a rippled

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.200
wave. It's mind blowing to think this stuff
is inside our potatoes, but if you don't feel

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.170
like going to all the trouble to get it out,
just use cornstarch instead. It will work

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.850
exactly the same. Well know you know how to
turn ordinary potatoes, into a glowing magical

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.200
mud, that's non-toxic, easy to make, and even
safe to eat. By the way, you can still eat

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.220
the potatoes as well. I tried loading mine
into a waffle iron and made some toasty golden

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.920
hash-browns. Well that's it for now. If you
liked this project, perhaps you'll like some

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.700
of my others. Check them out at www.thekingofrandom.com
