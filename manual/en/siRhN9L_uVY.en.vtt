Hi, this is Yolanda from vanveenbulbs.com,
and in this segment we're going to talk about

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.139
how to grow flowers in a greenhouse. Now I'm
very fortunate to live in an area where I

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.129
can build a greenhouse. We have a nice area
of land and we have room and so we built this

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.789
beautiful 24 x 48 greenhouse. And you just
plant flowers in a greenhouse just like you

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.560
would outside, so it's very simple. See I
love my pineapple lillies, this is a eucomis,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.040
and so I just plant the bulbs in the spring
and I throw them in the greenhouse and they

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.520
come up and bloom by late summer into fall.
And because it's going to start freezing outside

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.431
they would die back if I left them outside
at night, so by leaving them in the greenhouse

00:00:44.431 --> 00:00:49.880
I get an extra couple months of growth, so
a lot of things won't die back. I'm not heating

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.140
my greenhouse at all just because of the incredible
expense of heating a greenhouse, but if you

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.760
live in a milder climate or you have a large
production then it is worth heating the greenhouse.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.250
But any more in colder climates it's very
difficult to handle the expense of heating

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.820
it, but there's a lot of different options
and a lot of different ways that you can take

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.460
care of your plants. Now there's all types
of plants that grow great in a greenhouse,

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.760
any plant that grows outside. I've got a crocosmias
that have done really well, my pineapple lillies,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:29.250
my begonias have done really well in the greenhouse.
And even my alstrumaria, or Peruvian lillies,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.800
they're a little bit hard to get to grow outside
because it doesn't get quite hot enough for

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.170
them, but they love the greenhouse conditions.
I try not to use any chemicals or any insecticides

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.711
in my greenhouse because I want my garden
to be as organic as possible and I found outside

00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:48.570
of a few little slug bites on some of the
foliage, I really have been lucky and not

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.140
had a lot of issues with any kinds of bugs
or insects. And I try to dry everything out

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.420
periodically too just because the slugs and
a lot of the bugs need the moisture, so by

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.810
drawing it out then a lot of the bugs don't
seem to be the problem that they are in the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.160
early spring. So another trick is as soon
as everything turns brown I chop them down

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.940
and I just leave everything dry over the winter
and then I just start watering them in the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.890
spring again. So whether you plant plants
inside or outside, it's very easy to grow

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.650
them in a greenhouse.
