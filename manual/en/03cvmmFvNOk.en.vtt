00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:01.110
-Hi.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.500
I'm Dr. Mark Proctor, a
pediatric neurosurgeon

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.430
at Children's
Hospital in Boston.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.910
And I'm here to
talk to you today

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.750
about plagiocephaly, also
known as flat had syndrome.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.930
When a baby is born,
the skull is made up

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.329
of several individual
bone plates.

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:17.870
And they come together at what
we call cranial sutures, which

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.520
are these junctions here.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.870
The major sutures include
the coronal suture,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.880
seen here from above
the child's head

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.210
and here on the side
view of the child's head;

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.820
the metopic suture here;
the sagittal suture here;

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.390
and the lambdoid sutures here.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.420
And as a result of these,
the baby has a soft head.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.200
This little area you
see in the middle

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.990
is the soft spot, also called
the anterior fontanelle.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.430
In this illustration
here, what we're depicting

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.700
is the normal infant's
skull and then

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.600
various phases of the skull
becoming flatter over time.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.260
As you can see, all
it really involves

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.220
is the soft skull of the infant
resting on a flat surface.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.840
It's important to note that
although the plagiocephaly,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.260
this flatness over here, may be
cosmetically a concern to you,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.630
it's really not, to the
best of our knowledge,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.870
affecting the growth and
development of the child's

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.600
brain.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.740
If your child does have
this head shape, usually

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.370
someone with
expertise in the area

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.760
can establish this diagnosis
by examining the child.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.320
It is not, in most cases,
necessary to obtain x-rays,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.720
CAT scans, or MRI
scans to figure out

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.420
what this represents.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.410
When the change
in the head shape

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.460
is a little bit more
severe, we might

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.670
consider a helmet for the child.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.430
What we can see
here in this diagram

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.106
is that the blue
represents the helmet.

00:01:33.106 --> 00:01:35.480
And what's important to note
is that the helmet is really

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.410
a shield for the child's head.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.240
In other words, it's
not like a vice.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.910
It's not squeezing the child's
head in on the prominent areas.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.020
It's shielding the flat areas
so that the normal growth

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.420
of the child's head is
filling into the flat areas.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.520
Usually we can make
this about 50% to 90%

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.560
better than it was at the
start of helmet therapy.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.119
If you'd like your child
seen for plagiocephaly,

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.535
there are lots of
specialists here

00:01:59.535 --> 00:02:01.400
at Children's
Hospital who treat it.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.230
Those specialists are both in
the Department of Neurosurgery

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.230
as well as in Plastic Surgery.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.979
