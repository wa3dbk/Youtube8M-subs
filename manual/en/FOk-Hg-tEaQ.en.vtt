00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.120
Trials Fusion.

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.350
The next in the massively successful trials
series from Red Lynx.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.650
From this, to this, the games have come a
long way.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.770
Trials Fusion follows the success story of
Trials Evolution which got itself universal

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:19.410
acclaim and alongside it the trophy for highest
selling day one release on XBLA until of course,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.310
the release of Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.119
The turning point for the guys at Red Lynx
was this game and Trials HD, so what's fusion

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.939
going to bring to the table?

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.620
Before we get started I've got to let you
know, the gameplay I've recorded is on PS4

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.510
and as some of you may have heard, the Xbox
One edition will run in 900p as opposed to

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.680
the 1080p you're getting a look at here.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.390
Anyway, on the topic of graphics, this Trials
is truly something else.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.300
It leaves the games before it in its massively
realistic looking dust.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.520
Maybe it's Ubisoft's strong hand behind it,
maybe it's the general uphill climb which

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.360
has seen the series go from strength to strength
but with next-gen consoles, comes a next-gen

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.220
look.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.369
You've got your helper SynDI who will take
you through training levels before more tracks

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.380
open up in the campaign mode and unlike the
last game, there's no four player online mode

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.899
but there's something in the works according
to a Ubisoft spokesperson who has said, "The

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.350
team decided to take this time to create a
new, more robust online multiplayer experience

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.159
that will be released as a free game update
in the months after launch."

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.889
The addiction strikes again where you'll end
up screaming at it in frustration or celebration

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:34.979
while you try and get your best time or pull
off all the tricks for those medals.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.660
The game isn't all about competing though.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.450
There is of course the track editor opening
up a whole world of creation and sharing.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.799
With a mixture of terrains, you can make some
fun or not so fun tracks.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.340
This game is just kinda funny.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:57.060
You'll end up laughing at the usual inapproriate
jirating your biker will do once falling off.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.319
The Homer Simpson voice that blurts out all
kinds of chat as well as a massive scream

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:14.830
if you fall off the course.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.300
And just at how ridiculously frustrating it
can be.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.320
The controls are tighter this time round and
thank god, because you'll have FMX training

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.370
in a wind tunnel which will have you pulling
off certain moves with your right stick that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.840
are ultra tricky.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.510
Of course, you'll also want the tighter controls
to help ease you through the uneasy terrains.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.400
On the topic of terrains, players will get
a massive variety from snowcapped mountains,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.940
to futuristic sci-fi buildings and classic
dirt tracks.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.000
Each one comes with a setting that will move
and distract you but that's all part of the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.970
challenge.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.110
Trials Fusion has given a push into the world
of next-gen with the visual stakes and the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.510
tighter controls and it's all the wonderful
elements of the previous games in a beautiful

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.189
new world.

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:01.250
It's definitely worth a play and it's coming
out on Xbox One, Xbox 360 and PS4 on April

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.549
16th followed shortly by a PC release on the
24th.
