This is Rob McManhon for Expert Village. To
avoid splits you want to stay inside from

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:17.710
the edge of the wood. The closer you are to
the end the more likely it is for you to get

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:32.969
a split. Here we are going to intentionally
split. I'm about three quarters of a inch

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:44.699
from the end there.
You can see that we got a crack - not so bad

00:00:44.699 --> 00:01:00.149
as a split. Come a little closer to the end
and it's splitting even more. Now this are

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:16.159
things that you want to avoid. So if you can
stay away from the knots and come as far in

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:26.320
from the end of the wood as you can. Keep
a nice clean board. Here we have a split.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:37.859
See it is a little unpredictable. What caused
this one here is the hole in this area which

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:52.189
had already weakened it.
So it is impossible to avoid completely but

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.409
the further away you stay from knots or the
edges the better off you will be.
