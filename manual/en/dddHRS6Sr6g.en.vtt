00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Some Ayurvedic Medicine Worse
Than Lead Paint Exposure

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:05.450
In terms of antioxidant power,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.500
I couldn’t imagine anything
ever beating out cloves.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.320
But then, silly as a goose,
berry comes along.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.970
But then, in a whole
‘nother league, triphala.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.810
Triphala is the most commonly
used herbal formulation

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.699
in all of Ayurvedic medicine.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.679
“Tri” means “three”;
“phala” (in Sanskrit) means “fruits.”

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.839
It’s just a combination of three fruits:

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.650
Indian gooseberries (amla),
bibhitaki fruit, and haritaki fruit.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.280
It’s not some drug, some extract,
but just three types of fruits,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.940
dried and crushed into powder.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.030
What can it do?

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.440
Well, antioxidant-wise, one little
pinch between your fingertips,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.710
which would cost a fraction of a penny,
has as much antioxidant power as about

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.449
a cup of blueberries.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.940
We’re in the big leagues, here!

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.489
It seems to be able to do
all the same amla tricks:

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.960
preferentially wiping out
breast cancer cells in vitro,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.350
but leaving normal breast cells
relatively alone.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.640
Pancreatic cancer, too.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.570
By the time this concentration
of triphala was reached,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.500
90% of the pancreatic cancer
cells were dead.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.810
As you can see, only 10%
of the cancer cells survived.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.020
If triphala were less toxic
to normal pancreas cells,

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.299
we’d expect to see
something like this.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.360
And if it were completely
nontoxic to normal cells,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.340
we’d expect maybe this.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.420
But what they actually found was this.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.040
It actually kind of went out of its way
to protect the good cells

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.439
while killing off the bad.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.180
Quoting from a review, recently

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.420
“All these reports suggest the
effectiveness of triphala

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.579
as a nontoxic selective
antineoplastic [anticancer] agent.”

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:53.079
Meaning, nontoxic to normal cells
at doses toxic to tumor cells.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.740
That’s what we want.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.840
So what’s not to like?

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.080
2011 analysis:

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.060
“Detection of toxic heavy metals and
pesticide residue in herbal plants

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.990
which are commonly used
in the herbal formulations.”

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.009
Uh oh.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.430
We started recognizing it as a
problem about a decade ago,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.050
when the CDC started
noticing cases of

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.360
“Lead Poisoning Associated with
Ayurvedic Medications.”

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.510
Fatal infant brain disease,
paralysis, deafness.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.630
So, researchers in Boston went to
every Indian market within 20 miles,

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.500
and picked up every Ayurvedic herbal
medicine product they could find.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.800
One in five contained lead,
mercury, and/or arsenic.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.800
And that’s just a little bit.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.780
They found out that those suffering
Ayurvedic lead poisoning had higher

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.140
lead levels than those suffering
lead paint removal poisoning!

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.580
And it’s not just Boston.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.670
A national survey a few years ago found
that women using Ayurvedic herbs

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.760
had lead levels 24%
higher than non-users.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.450
As spelled out in an editorial in the
Indian Journal of Medical Sciences:

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.760
“Ayurvedic lead poisoning [is]
an under-recognized,

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.040
international problem.”
