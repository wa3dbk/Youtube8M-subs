00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.200
Sing me your favourite song

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.200
Translate for me as you go along

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:56.100
So I can better understand

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:07.200
How you want to be loved

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.600
Living it up, you came in on a high tide

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.000
Calling to court all my fears

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.100
Letting it go, this wild untried emotion

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.600
Say it loud and say it clear

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.400
But you know we could talk from dusk until dawn

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.500
And everything in my world would make sense

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.200
Rewind the night, let's get lost from dusk
until dawn

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.700
Pause it here in the perfect tense

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.000
Sing me your favourite song

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Translate for me as you go along

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So I can better understand

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.000
How you want to be loved

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.200
Repeat it for me, one more time now

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.300
Make it as slow as you dare

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.900
Word by word, interpreting this emotion

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.000
Share as much dear as you care

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.100
But you know we could talk from dusk until
dawn

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.200
And everything in my world would make sense

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.800
Rewind the night, let's get lost from dusk until dawn

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:31.100
Pause it here in the perfect tense

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.800
Sing me your favourite song

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.800
Translate for me as you go along

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:53.500
So I can better understand

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:30.100
How you want to be loved
