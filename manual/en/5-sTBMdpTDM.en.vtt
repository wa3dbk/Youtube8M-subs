00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.820
about seven hundred and eighty million
people around the world do not even have

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.689
access to clean drinking water according
to a u_n_ report from last year

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:13.889
one question that often comes up is why
can't we remove salt from allusion water

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.889
because of course of overwhelming
majority did not upper nineties percent

00:00:18.889 --> 00:00:23.949
of uh... the water on earth is not
drinkable because it is saltwater and

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:29.009
it's considered a very very costly
process typically to i_d_ salad water

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.930
isn t cell in a pretty sela nice

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.519
ability stalin eight

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:39.140
is alan a catholic but but it is of
course the salad is a shed mechanism

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.830
uh... what was that in time

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.600
i think it's def our nation may have
anyone wants to love the stuff i think

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.230
you'll find them right we did look it up
and it's a d desalinization but i know

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.500
what were your lab

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.300
we now have at lockheed lockheed-martin
corporation

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.880
a traditionally considered a weapons
manufacture

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.350
which is developing a new technology
which could solve the water problem they

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.560
have been developing a process which is
basically offended carbon membrane with

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.100
with basically regular holes in it there
and then a meter in size that uh... is a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.040
billion of a meter louis which actually
are uh... did this hensley worked like a

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.500
sieve and you can just sit l the cell
essentially is what you can do and if

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.210
this technology can be developed one of
the issues right now is that these

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.610
membranes are so delicate that even
working with an makes them likely to

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.600
tear and you don't even get to the point
of human being able to employ them this

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.520
could be a huge break through and the
removal of of salt from ocean water

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.430
which some say could solve the drinking
water problem

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.610
yeah it uh... it's a step in the right
direction of course is a lot of

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.190
questions as to

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.640
or how do you prompted to people and
landed right and uh...

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.039
you know who's gonna find these plants
and where they're gonna be placed on the

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.840
funny thing is interesting do you care
at all that that this is lockheed

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.870
electives manufacture

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.479
that is working on this would you rather
it be a different company or would you

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.010
rather to solve the problem

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.150
well we've talked about his path

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.140
for i mean it seems like

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.890
the companies that we don't want
involved in projects like this

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.299
unfortunately are ones that have the
resources to do it

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.879
um... so you know i can't think off-hand
how this is going to uh... you know

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.670
create more weapons that are gonna kill
people descriptor sbi

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.189
something that they see as a huge profit
maker tonight and good for them if if

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.090
they can pull it off

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.230
the dentist something good gathers very
views on that but i think it's

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.019
interesting technology nonetheless and
we also need better technology for

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.279
reusing wastewater i'm turning that into
water that that is drinkable right
