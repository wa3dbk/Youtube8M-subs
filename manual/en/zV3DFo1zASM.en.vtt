00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.490
NARRATOR&gt;&gt; Visible from quite a few Southeast
Queensland locations,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.840
the Glass House Mountains, in the Sunshine
Coast hinterland,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.960
captivate onlookers with their dramatic, craggy
peaks.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.830
And some of these volcanic remnants are so
abrupt, so peculiar,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.560
that you can't help but wonder if they have
some sort of unfinished business.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.600
Their collective name hails from Lieutenant
Captain James Cook,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.150
who, upon sighting them in 1770,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.810
thought they resembled the shape of glass
furnaces back in England.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.930
However, their individual names are derived
from local Aboriginal words,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.390
for example, Tibrogargan, which means 'flying
squirrel';

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.730
Beerwah, or 'up in the sky';

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.770
Coonowrin, derived from the term for 'crooked
neck';

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.570
and Ngungun, which means 'charcoal' or 'black'.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.660
KARA&gt;&gt; So we're getting ready to hike up 253m
Mt Ngungun today.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.329
It's only 2.2kms return, so it shouldn't take
us that long.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.690
The sign here tells us it's going to take
about two hours, so we'll see.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.320
The great thing about this hike is that

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.760
it's one of the easiest hikes here in the
Glass House Mountains...

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.940
NARRATOR&gt;&gt; I've walked this track before,
and, at first, it behaves as expected.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.630
It starts out flat and ascends gently,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.160
passing soft ferns,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.610
slow-growing grass trees,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.000
and expressive scribbly gums.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.970
Then it develops into a series of switchbacks,

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.470
with occasional steps, as it proceeds towards
the summit.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.510
Just before the cave, though, the track pleasantly
surprises me.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.840
KARA&gt;&gt; Last time we did this hike, the path
took us straight up this gully,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.750
which was a bit of a climb, a little bit challenging.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.599
But now it's closed off, entry is prohibited,

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:46.080
and the track, instead, runs this way...

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.360
NARRATOR&gt;&gt; The track still climbs, of course,
but it's a heck of a lot easier.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.420
Pausing briefly to look towards the Pacific,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.170
we continue along the final stretch towards
the ridge.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.280
Coonowrin and Beerwah are first to greet us,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.250
and they remain in our company the rest of
the way to the summit.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.129
KARA&gt;&gt; So that took less than a half-hour
to get up here,

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:05.890
and as you can see, from the top,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:14.170
we've got these fabulous views of Tibrogargan
over here,

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.170
and over to our side, this way,

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.170
Crooked Neck and Beerwah.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.750
NARRATOR&gt;&gt; From this vantage, we also take
in the lush hinterland,

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.740
Wild Horse Mountain, and, in the distance,
Moreton Island.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.730
KARA&gt;&gt; How was that?

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.490
TONY&gt;&gt; Absolutely wonderful, beautiful day,
crisp, great.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.400
KARA&gt;&gt; How's the climb?

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.310
TONY&gt;&gt; Relatively easy, actually, since they've
done the bypass.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.940
NARRATOR&gt;&gt; While getting here isn't difficult,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.420
the drop-offs from the upper ridge and summit
demand caution.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.050
KARA&gt;&gt; Last time we were here, we abseiled
off the side of this,

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.750
which was a thrill, it was great fun,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.040
but I think today I'm kind of glad that we're
just enjoying the view from here

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.260
and not scaring ourselves too much.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.900
NARRATOR&gt;&gt; These mystical mountains have inspired
me from the first moment I saw them,

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.690
and they're spiritually significant for local
Aboriginal people.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.120
Their creation legend goes something like
this:

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.540
Long ago, a family lived by the sea.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.350
When the father, Tibrogargan, saw the seas
rising

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.790
he ordered Coonowrin, his eldest son, to help
his pregnant mother, Beerwah, and younger

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.100
siblings get to higher ground.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.540
Fearful for his own life, though, Coonowrin
instead ran away.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.180
Fuming, Tibrogargan caught up with his eldest
son,

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.350
striking and permanently dislocating his neck.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.790
Tibrogargan, disgusted with his son's cowardice,
now stares out to sea,

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.460
with his back to Coonowrin, who holds his
head in shame.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.420
Thankfully, though, our emotions on this lovely
autumn day don't reflect this story at all.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.730
Like the other hikers we encounter, we're
absolutely elated to be here.
