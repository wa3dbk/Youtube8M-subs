00:00:00.812 --> 00:00:04.178
- Good morning, clan,
and welcome to day 1018.

00:00:04.178 --> 00:00:07.273
Just got done editing the
vlog and today's gaming video.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:09.858
It's gonna be a Minecraft
video with Sierra

00:00:09.858 --> 00:00:11.971
and I think that's it, I
think I'm out of gameplays.

00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:13.752
I gotta record some more today,

00:00:13.752 --> 00:00:16.076
which means I've gotta move some stuff

00:00:16.076 --> 00:00:18.853
and make a hole so I can
get to my PlayStation.

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:20.521
And yeah, this is like my first day

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:24.184
at my desk editing and I like it.

00:00:24.184 --> 00:00:25.230
I like it, but it's a little different.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.874
I'm a lot further away from the screen.

00:00:27.874 --> 00:00:29.656
Because I have one of
these keyboard shelves

00:00:29.656 --> 00:00:32.026
for my mouse and stuff,
it's a lot more comfortable.

00:00:32.026 --> 00:00:35.832
My arms are at a good level
instead of being raised.

00:00:35.832 --> 00:00:39.084
'Cause, for the last
forever, I've been editing,

00:00:39.084 --> 00:00:40.080
the keyboard was up here.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.042
Biggest difference is I'm
really far away from the screen.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.489
Like, I can't even touch the screen,

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:44.689
which is good for the kids, right?

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:45.581
They won't be touching the screen

00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:47.905
as much or at all, hopefully.

00:00:47.905 --> 00:00:49.235
LIke I said, very comfortable

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:50.744
but just a little further away.

00:00:50.744 --> 00:00:52.574
So, I don't know. Maybe I have
to pull this up a little bit.

00:00:52.574 --> 00:00:54.658
We'll see, we'll see. But
today was pretty good.

00:00:55.948 --> 00:00:59.054
- Hi guys, we just got back from school

00:00:59.054 --> 00:01:03.522
and Mommy and Daddy haven't got one clip.

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:06.952
All Daddy got was the intro.

00:01:06.952 --> 00:01:09.878
Sierra.
- [Sierra] What?

00:01:09.878 --> 00:01:13.298
- [Bryce] Say hi.
- Hi.

00:01:15.706 --> 00:01:18.692
- [Bryce] Anything to say?
- No?

00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:26.250
Okay. (both laugh)

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.054
- Well, bye.

00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:28.128
- Holy crap, you guys.

00:01:28.128 --> 00:01:31.903
Super productive day
doing boring adult things.

00:01:31.903 --> 00:01:34.921
Seriously, I had to call both
of my insurance companies

00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:38.121
for my new insurance that we
have now that I'm independent.

00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:41.953
And I was on hold with my
medical provider for 45 minutes.

00:01:41.953 --> 00:01:43.222
Forty-five minutes, yeah!

00:01:43.222 --> 00:01:44.550
I mean, I knew I was gonna be on hold

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.673
for 40-plus-something
minutes 'cause it told me.

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:48.001
But, just the fact that I had

00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:50.235
to wait that long is just (explodes).

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:52.408
But now, I got the kids and we are headed

00:01:52.408 --> 00:01:55.759
to my parents' house to help my dad

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.126
put together his new grill.

00:01:57.126 --> 00:01:59.088
My brothers and I got him a new grill.

00:01:59.088 --> 00:02:03.976
It's awesome, it's a
three-piece charcoal/gas/burner.

00:02:04.722 --> 00:02:07.095
So it's this huge grill
and I told him, I said,

00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:09.207
"I'll deliver it and I will
help you put it together,"

00:02:09.207 --> 00:02:11.140
which is what we're doing today.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.529
- So, we're here at my parents' house

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:14.521
and this thing is a beast.

00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:17.902
Check out all of this
crap. Here's the box.

00:02:17.902 --> 00:02:21.410
That's the grill, pretty
much right there, the base.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.410
There's the tops, bottom, trash, legs,

00:02:26.703 --> 00:02:30.270
and there's like three of these
boxes with parts and pieces.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.406
OMG, why didn't I look
into assembling this

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:35.866
before I bought it? (laughs)

00:02:35.866 --> 00:02:37.312
All right guys, so about an hour in,

00:02:37.312 --> 00:02:38.912
here's what I've got so far.

00:02:38.912 --> 00:02:41.568
Pretty much the whole base is done.

00:02:41.568 --> 00:02:44.888
The next step is to grab
the actual grill piece

00:02:44.888 --> 00:02:45.663
and set it on top.

00:02:45.663 --> 00:02:46.408
- [Clintus] Well I guess
somebody was hungry.

00:02:46.408 --> 00:02:47.978
I didn't even have a chance
to pull the camera out

00:02:47.978 --> 00:02:51.206
and inhaled your In-N-Out
burgers, holy crap.

00:02:51.206 --> 00:02:52.044
- [Clintus' mom] He did.

00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:53.270
[Clintus] At least now
you got fries right?

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.035
- [Clintus' mom] Sloppy mess.

00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:56.388
- [Clintus] This is what
it looked like before.

00:02:56.388 --> 00:03:00.265
Now, it's just a pile of
crap. (Clintus' mom laughs)

00:03:00.265 --> 00:03:01.762
- [Voiceover] Pile of Bryce.
- Pile of Bryce.

00:03:01.762 --> 00:03:03.543
(all laugh)

00:03:03.543 --> 00:03:06.862
- [Clintus] Back at it,
got the side burner going.

00:03:06.862 --> 00:03:08.675
Now we're hooking up the gas lines.

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:11.059
And there we go, guys, the final product.

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:12.295
Look at that bad boy.

00:03:12.295 --> 00:03:17.237
It's got charcoal on one
side, gas on the other,

00:03:17.237 --> 00:03:21.373
and a nice little infrared searing burner.

00:03:21.373 --> 00:03:23.995
I've never even heard
of an infrared burner.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:26.344
But, it looks pretty gnarly.

00:03:26.344 --> 00:03:30.236
It's got a bottle opener on the side,

00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:33.750
three gas burners.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.622
I'm really excited about the charcoal.

00:03:35.622 --> 00:03:37.522
I don't cook charcoal, ever.

00:03:37.522 --> 00:03:39.727
Supposedly this thing will hold 20 burgers

00:03:39.727 --> 00:03:42.202
and, trust me, my dad
will put it to the test.

00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:48.801
- [Clintus] And just
like that, it's bedtime.

00:03:48.801 --> 00:03:52.001
Look at that, Baby's already
snuggled up, ready to go.

00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:53.773
She's like, "Yeah, I'll sleep some more."

00:03:53.773 --> 00:03:54.515
That's the thing with the dog

00:03:54.515 --> 00:03:57.555
is she's basically been
on the couch by herself

00:03:57.555 --> 00:04:00.060
for like five or six hours
and then we come home

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.336
and we go straight to bed.

00:04:01.336 --> 00:04:03.117
And so, it's horrible
because she's up all night,

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:06.709
she's restless. I feel
bad but it's what it is.

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.911
And you got school tomorrow.
- Yeah.

00:04:08.911 --> 00:04:10.482
- [Clintus] You guys still doing science?

00:04:10.482 --> 00:04:12.957
- Um, we didn't do it today
'cause Monday's our short day,

00:04:12.957 --> 00:04:15.232
so we don't do science.
- [Clintus] But tomorrow?

00:04:15.232 --> 00:04:16.347
- Yeah, tomorrow we're gonna do it.

00:04:16.347 --> 00:04:17.181
- [Clintus] Sweet.

00:04:17.181 --> 00:04:19.907
And this knucklehead. Got
your Cardinals blanket?

00:04:19.907 --> 00:04:22.565
- Yeah, I have three blankets.

00:04:22.565 --> 00:04:24.708
- [Clintus] I know, what's up with that?

00:04:24.708 --> 00:04:26.457
- Because I have no shirt on.

00:04:26.457 --> 00:04:28.209
- [Clintus] Well why
don't you put a shirt on?

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:29.166
- Because I have three blankets.

00:04:29.166 --> 00:04:30.856
- [Clintus] Because I have
three blankets. (laughs)

00:04:30.856 --> 00:04:32.607
But you have three blankets
because you don't shirt on.

00:04:32.607 --> 00:04:34.146
So put a shirt on. "But I
don't wanna put a shirt on

00:04:34.146 --> 00:04:35.356
"because I have three blankets."

00:04:35.356 --> 00:04:37.568
- (laughs) So, once I have three--

00:04:37.568 --> 00:04:39.439
- [Clintus] You're like all bundled up.

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:44.431
- Once I have a shirt on, I'm
only gonna have two blankets.

00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:46.001
- [Clintus] Oh, okay.

00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:49.864
Somebody wants to play.
Somebody wants to play.

00:04:49.864 --> 00:04:54.265
(toy squeaks)

00:04:55.135 --> 00:05:00.063
(dog growls)

00:05:21.658 --> 00:05:23.559
- This is what happens when
she's cooped up in the house

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:26.850
for six, eight hours at a
time with nothing going on.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.566
11:30 at night and she wants to play.

00:05:29.566 --> 00:05:30.351
So that was cool, guys.

00:05:30.351 --> 00:05:32.907
I was able to put my dad's
grill together for him.

00:05:32.907 --> 00:05:34.356
It made the present that much sweeter

00:05:34.356 --> 00:05:36.046
that he didn't have to
put it together, right?

00:05:36.046 --> 00:05:38.345
It was done for him.

00:05:38.345 --> 00:05:41.881
He got home, helped me out
with the last, I don't know,

00:05:41.881 --> 00:05:44.145
10 steps or so, 15 steps.

00:05:44.145 --> 00:05:45.926
For the most part, he
held the flashlight for me

00:05:45.926 --> 00:05:49.970
and just kept me company and
kind of talked a little bit

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.918
about work and my new journey
that I'm on and whatnot.

00:05:54.918 --> 00:05:56.913
The funny thing was it
brought back a lot of memories

00:05:56.913 --> 00:05:59.539
of working in the garage.

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:03.161
He'd be working on a car or
doing something in the garage

00:06:03.161 --> 00:06:05.695
and I would be the one there
holding the flashlight.

00:06:05.695 --> 00:06:09.228
And I joked a little bit, I
remember how I'd be out there

00:06:09.228 --> 00:06:11.039
holding the flashlight for
him and I'd start to think

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.277
about other things and daydream

00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:14.360
and the light would start to veer off

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.839
and he'd be like, "Hey Clint, Clint."

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:17.469
The whole reason why I'm out
there is to hold the flashlight

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:19.250
for him and I'm not paying attention.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.302
So, it was cool. It was cool just to chill

00:06:21.302 --> 00:06:22.963
and hang out with my dad.

00:06:22.963 --> 00:06:25.106
- Sorry there wasn't more
going on in today's video.

00:06:25.106 --> 00:06:28.435
Like I said, doing boring adult
things for most of the day

00:06:28.435 --> 00:06:29.914
until I picked up the kids from school

00:06:29.914 --> 00:06:31.967
and went to my parents' house.

00:06:31.967 --> 00:06:33.476
And that's what you got.

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:35.801
But tomorrow is another
day and another opportunity

00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:37.219
for another great vlog.

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:40.540
So stay tuned, check back
tomorrow for that and vlog on.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.139
- [Clintus] Once again
guys, thank you so much

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:43.166
for watching our videos.

00:06:43.166 --> 00:06:45.913
I really do appreciate it,
it means everything, really.

00:06:45.913 --> 00:06:47.422
And if you're listening to this right now,

00:06:47.422 --> 00:06:49.746
an extra-special thanks to you.

00:06:49.746 --> 00:06:52.976
If you're listening to this
right now, leave a comment

00:06:52.976 --> 00:06:56.981
and put whatever your favorite fruit is,

00:06:56.981 --> 00:06:59.064
just one word after a comment.

00:06:59.064 --> 00:07:01.177
If you're gonna leave a comment,
at the end of your comment,

00:07:01.177 --> 00:07:03.984
just leave a fruit, a name of a fruit.

00:07:03.984 --> 00:07:06.278
A banana, apple, cherry,
grape, whatever it is,

00:07:06.278 --> 00:07:08.179
and that way I'll know that you listened

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:10.474
to all of the end slate and
then I know who you are.

00:07:10.474 --> 00:07:12.503
Because I really do love you.

00:07:12.503 --> 00:07:14.137
You know what, the fun
doesn't have to stop there.

00:07:14.137 --> 00:07:16.249
There's two more really
great videos on the screen.

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:18.091
You're seriously not
gonna wanna miss these.

00:07:18.091 --> 00:07:20.023
One year ago, we went dirtbike riding

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:22.407
for the first time in 2014.

00:07:22.407 --> 00:07:23.634
If you're a big dirtbike fan,

00:07:23.634 --> 00:07:25.415
you gotta watch that video, it's great.

00:07:25.415 --> 00:07:29.361
Two years ago, I babysit
Victoria for the very first time.

00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:31.428
And so she hangs out with us

00:07:31.428 --> 00:07:34.241
after we have a long fun day of bowling

00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:36.564
and having sleepovers and whatnot.

00:07:36.564 --> 00:07:39.070
So, this video is great.
Both these videos are great.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.028
So watch them both.

00:07:40.028 --> 00:07:42.020
You can click on the link
or click on the screen,

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.559
it'll open in a new
window, you can go back

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:44.415
and watch the other one.

00:07:44.415 --> 00:07:46.252
Watch 'em all. Watch 'em all!

00:07:46.252 --> 00:07:47.945
I'll see you guys tomorrow. Bye.
