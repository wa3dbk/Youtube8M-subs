00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.140
Nothing stands still.
All of life is in motion.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.780
Everywhere you look, Lenoir Rhyne is in motion.
Record enrollments.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.140
The merger with the Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary and the movement into greater Asheville

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.580
with the Graduate program.
Testify that Lenoir Rhyne is a university in motion

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.120
and direction.
Rising up is the premier private higher education

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.560
institution in Western North Carolina.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.560
Founded in 1891, Lenoir Rhyne has been a faith centered institution for young people to gain

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.440
an education based on religious principles and Christian values.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.780
The four Lutheran pastors who guided this institution through it's birth determined that

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.320
the Church would be at the center of it's life.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.640
Those founders had a singular aim to impress all the minds of the young, the principles of Christian morality.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.640
That committment continues in the classroom and in the minds of the administration and faculty.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.920
As a continuing commitment of this university in the 21st century.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.240
As most of you know, Lenoir Rhyne is a university on the rise.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.280
We're enrolling and expanding, adding new programs, increasing our enrollment and rapidly

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.080
becoming one of the premier institutions in the south.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.120
We're doing this in a way that is very different from other institutions who have had similar growth.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.460
We are not moving away from our commitment to our church and to our spiritual education here at

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.920
Lenoir Rhyne.
Rather we are trying to grow by enhancing the spiritual

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.800
opportunities for our students and now finally we'll be constructing the chapel right in the center of campus

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.140
Chapel has been something people at Lenoir Rhyne dreamed about, visioned about for about 50 years.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.600
Certainly a Chapel on our campus and right in the middle of the campus where we plan to build

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.540
right in the gaze of this tallest statue in the world, Martin Luther.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.540
A Chapel on our campus would impact my ministry.
However, I think a greater impact would be on the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.060
ministry of our facutly, staff, and students.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.080
The presence of this chapel will be a symbol to all  as to who we are at Lenoir Rhyne as a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.780
college and university of the church.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.480
A chapel on the campus of Lenoir Rhyne University will be made possible only through two things

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.400
One will be individual, secondly will be elective commitments on the part of those who believe in

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.940
the mission of Lenoir Rhyne.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.780
A Chapel will not be possible mearily because there is a fervent wish for one.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.220
A Chapel will not be possible because of the fact that we pray mightily that it would happen.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.620
A Chapel instead will be made possible only because of the fact we do hard work of making

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.040
it a reality.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.960
Every gift larger or small is tremendously appreciated and it will take a large number

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.220
of gifts to reach our goal of 4 million dollars.
Once that goal has been reached we will be
