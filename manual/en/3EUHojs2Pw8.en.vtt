00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.280
Between 2008 and 2010 Texas spent more Medicaid
dollars for braces for poor children than

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.250
the other nine most populous state programs
combined.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.250
Now the state is on a mission to reclaim hundreds
of millions of mispent Medicaid dollars.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.360
So how did Texas get in this mess in the first
place?

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.970
It began with good intentions.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.140
In 2007 Texas agreed in a legal settlement
to increase poor children's access to dental

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.230
care by raising Medicaid payments for a handful
of dental services.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.230
It worked.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.890
By 2010 Texas children on Medicaid were more
likely to receive dental care than children

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.410
on any other stage's dental program.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.300
But something didn't add up.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.750
Texas hand't raised payments for orthodontetic
services buy the number of kids receiving

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.540
braces had exploded.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.530
To qualify for braces under Texas Medicaid
rules a child's teeth must be so crooked that

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.570
it causes difficulty chewing.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.670
Dentists and orthodontists must submit X-rays,
molds of the teeth and a dental score sheet

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.280
to prove the treatment is medically necessary.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.190
Turns out the company Texas contracted with
to review Mediaid claims was not thoroughly

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.590
reviewing whether braces were medically necessary.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.409
In 2008 Texas auditors discovered that the
company, called Texas Medicaid Health Care

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.560
Partnership, had only one dentist on staff
to evaluate thousands of claims each month.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.479
And workers without dental licenses were approving
most of the claims for dental care.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.929
The problems persisted.

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.889
In 2012 reviewers found inspectors were still
rubber-stamping forms.

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:42.139
And the company hadn't hired additional dental
experts.

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:47.889
The lax oversight had devastating consequences:
poor children were forced to under go unnecessary,

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:51.009
sometimes painful, dental procedures, like
root canals.

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.279
And taxpayers lost millions of dollars.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.539
Years later Texas is still cleaning up the
mess.

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.450
Spending on orthodontics has dropped dramatically,
but so has spending on diagnostic and preventative

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.099
care for poor children.

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:05.619
And there are fewer dentists to provide those
services.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.479
The state is attempting to recoup money from
dentists and orthodontists by withholding

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.100
millions in Medicaid payments, while it investigates
allegations of fraud.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.590
Investigators are also looking into whether
the company violated its contract with the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.630
state.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.191
