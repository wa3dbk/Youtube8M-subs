Kathy Savoy: &nbsp;Hi.

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.519
I'm Kathy Savoy, Extension Educator with the
University of Maine Cooperative Extension.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.289
Summer is at its peak in Maine and today we're
going to talk about how to use fresh raspberries.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.330
Raspberries, whether from your own backyard,
your local farmer's market or farm stand,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.840
are vitamin rich and fiber packed.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.210
Freezing is a simple, inexpensive and quick
method of food preservation.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.420
Why not take advantage of those raspberries
when you have a bunch of them available so

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.180
you can have access to them later on in the
winter, when local raspberries are no longer

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.180
available?

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.120
You do not need to pack your raspberries in
a sugar or syrup solution.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.970
Materials to freeze in need to be moisture/vapor‑resistant,
very durable and leak proof and not become

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.250
brittle and crack at low temperatures.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.730
You want to protect your foods from developing
off‑flavors or odors, and make sure that

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.140
they are easy to seal and easy to mark with
the date and label.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.320
With clean hands, clean equipment and a clean
work surface, you're ready to start.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.820
Raspberries are very perishable and need to
be eaten or preserved within two days of picking.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.350
Raspberries should be at best quality, at
optimum maturity and freshness.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.950
Sort raspberries to remove any spoiled or
crushed fruit.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.150
Rinse very gently under cool, running water.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.340
To improve the quality of your frozen product,
remove water by spinning in a salad spinner,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.420
placing on paper towels or clean towels.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.940
Remember, excess water creates clumped berries
that are hard to break up and use.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.300
Pack into freezer‑grade material leaving
headspace for expansion that occurs during

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.300
freezing.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.690
Label, date and freeze in a freezer set at
zero degrees or lower.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.100
Keep a thermometer in your freezer and check
the temperature frequently.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.890
Remember, berries should be used within eight
to 12 months.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.100
A tray pack is an alternative that may make
raspberries easier to use later on.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.760
Simply spread berries in a shallow layer on
trays and freeze.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.700
When frozen, remove from the tray and pack
in freezer‑grade packaging.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.400
Frozen berries can be used in your favorite
recipes, including pies, quick breads, smoothies,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.329
shortcake and frozen berries can even be used
to make your own homemade jams and jellies.

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:26.989
When serving frozen fruits, serve them while
there are still a few ice crystals in the

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:27.989
fruit.

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.599
This helps compensate for the mushy texture
frozen fruits have when they are fully thawed.

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.720
Fresh raspberries can also be preserved by
canning in water, juice or syrup using a boiling

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.689
water bath to safely process.

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.900
Raspberries also make a delicious jam or jelly.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.121
I encourage you to try a low or no‑sugar
pectin product for jam or jelly making, to

00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:52.230
help reduce the amount of added sugar you
use.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.590
Also, considering using raspberries in homemade
berry syrup to use on pancakes or flavored

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.980
vinegars to jazz up salads or other vegetable
dishes.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.269
Try dehydrating to make fruit leathers with
Maine raspberries as well.

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.090
There are many options for preserving raspberries,
so you can enjoy the flavor and nutritional

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.650
benefits of Maine raspberries year round.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.579
U Maine Cooperative Extension is your go‑to
resource for the latest USDA recommendations

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.930
for home canning and preserving.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.319
Check out our website for food preservation
information, including hands‑on preserving

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.180
the harvest workshops near you, publications
from our "Let's Preserve" series, books, pressure

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.170
gauge testing services and more.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.439
There are many options for preserving raspberries.

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:44.999
So you can enjoy the flavor and nutritional
benefits of Maine raspberries year round.
