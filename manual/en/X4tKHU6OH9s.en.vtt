00:00:00.374 --> 00:00:04.195
The "Lights Game",
Elidio and José Luiz will play.

00:00:04.195 --> 00:00:06.897
Please, give me a feeling.

00:00:06.897 --> 00:00:10.531
- Startled!
- 'Startled'.

00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:16.367
You in the middle,
give me a style... Action.

00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:18.034
You over here, give me an animal.

00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:20.981
- Turtle!
- 'Turtle'.

00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:26.989
What happens in Lights is that
when they are under this light

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.580
they will have to get startled.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.162
In the next light they will have
to embody the spirit of 'action'.

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:43.727
And in the next light, they will have
to embody the spirit of a turtle.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:46.964
Now I will need a place,
everybody give me a place.

00:00:48.964 --> 00:00:50.300
'Garden'!

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.993
You are in a garden. It's the
"Lights Game", garden, you're up!

00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:03.729
I love the pigeons.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.507
Come here, pigeon, come here!

00:01:06.507 --> 00:01:11.235
Popcorn, popcorn, popcorn!

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:16.260
- Want some popcorn?
- Another bag, please?

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.265
- Butter, caramel?
- Butter.

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:27.526
He's feeling sick...

00:01:28.378 --> 00:01:32.762
I know...
Manoel, are you okay?

00:01:35.275 --> 00:01:38.298
Oh, he's already fine.

00:01:39.404 --> 00:01:42.259
- Butter, right?
- Large, please.

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.818
- Look, Manoel, I'll give you...
- That's 4 reais.

00:01:45.818 --> 00:01:47.925
Okay. All right, Manoel...

00:01:47.925 --> 00:01:50.438
- That's 4 reais.
- All right, Manoel...

00:01:50.438 --> 00:01:56.584
- That's 4 reais. - Come, Manoel.
Let's get out of here...

00:01:56.584 --> 00:02:01.712
Sir, that's 4 reais...
Now!

00:02:01.712 --> 00:02:06.018
- Don't talk to me like this!
- We don't have time!

00:02:06.862 --> 00:02:08.623
C'mon, pigeon!

00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:11.323
Damn you!

00:02:12.975 --> 00:02:16.553
Pigeon! Get him!

00:02:24.664 --> 00:02:26.744
Easy, easy.

00:02:26.744 --> 00:02:29.814
I almost killed Manoel!

00:02:29.814 --> 00:02:34.867
- That's 4 reais, sir... - You have
to improve your service, mister.

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:41.793
- I'm sorry for...
- I'm the manager of...

00:02:41.793 --> 00:02:44.912
- My manager!
- Good lord!

00:02:44.912 --> 00:02:51.696
- My manager! - This is the
gentleman who didn't like your service!

00:02:51.696 --> 00:02:53.520
- Exatactly!
- Get him!

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.863
That's it, Manoel!

00:02:56.863 --> 00:03:00.546
A pigeon with a gun!

00:03:00.922 --> 00:03:05.495
- We have a bazooka here!
- He's got a bomb!

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:09.989
Oh, my God!
Let's go, boss!

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.629
Fire!

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.263
Very good, Manoel!

00:03:32.063 --> 00:03:35.902
The turtle-beetle was great...

00:03:35.902 --> 00:03:38.248
By the way, don't leave turtles
in a topsy-turvy position.

00:03:38.248 --> 00:03:42.845
Because its organs make pressure on
its lungs and they die asphyxiated!

00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:46.041
Good!

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.564
In that case it wouldn't be
topsy-turvy, but topsy-turtle.

00:03:54.365 --> 00:03:57.265

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:04.266
IMPROVÁVEL
Probably a good show.
