Hi Paul, welcome to the IT department at eBark.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.470
Now you can forget what you’ve heard about
bulls and bears or shark tanks; working in

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.910
the tech industry is a breed of its own.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.030
Now let me give you some pointers.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.029
When we’re working on a new project, it’s
very important to involve the business owners.

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.550
Our business analysts work directly with them
because sometimes, the tech folks don’t

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.780
always bark the same language and they don’t
want to be hounded later.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.100
Our development team is really top-notch.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.130
Jack here is developing a new mobile app,
Brenda's adding a new portal to our site and

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.010
Don’s just chasing his tail over this new
software integration.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.940
Looks like it’s time for the daily Scrum
meeting.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.390
Our ScrumMaster Greg makes sure the team’s
sprints are on track.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.260
Flexibility and speed are very important to
Greg and to eBark’s Agile process.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.689
Once we think our stuff is up to, well, code,
we move on to QA.

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:15.510
It’s a critical component to producing high-quality
products and spotting bugs; however, sometimes

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.700
the developers and testers fight like, well,
you know.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.810
One of the hardest working groups on our team
of course is our help desk and support service

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.490
professionals.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.490
Skilled in several areas, they help sniff
out the problem and fetch solutions quickly

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.950
so our business stays online.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.780
I hate to cut the tour short, but I have to
talk to Dana about putting out some kind of

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.780
fire.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.960
Welcome to IT, you’re gonna love it.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.990
In a competitive, sometimes even dog-eat-dog
environment, you need loyalty you can count

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.990
on.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:02:10.070
