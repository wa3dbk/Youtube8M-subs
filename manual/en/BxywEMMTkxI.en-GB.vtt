a different "Little Red Riding Hood" story

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.520
Once upon a time a small girl 
named little Little Red Riding Hood

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.940
was on her way to her ill
grandmothers house with cake and wine

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.140
She had to be careful because she had
to go through a dangerous forest

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.600
Good day
Little Red Riding Hood

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.880
