00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.500
Not many cartoon characters have ever had
sustained success in video games.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.740
I mean, there’s Mickey Mouse.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.030
He’s probably done the best, he’s had
a bunch of great games over the years.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.040
And the cartoon version of the Ninja Turtles,
too.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.620
Their beat ‘em ups were some of the best
ever.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.820
But what else?

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.559
I mean, maybe South Park or The Simpsons?

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.010
But then again, they’ve both had more bad
games than good ones.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.080
And that’s the point.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.670
Not many cartoons have ever been consistent
in video games.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.670
This one has been.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.370
The only problem is…it’s been consistently
bad.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.809
And this one stayed the course.

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:00.480
It’s Desert Demolition, for the SEGA Genesis.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:17.360
You know, I take no pleasure in saying this,
as the Road Runner and Coyote cartoons have

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.750
always been among my favorite, ever.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.900
But sometimes, you have to face the facts.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.330
And the facts are, the Road Runner and Coyote
have a fitting legacy of Acme-quality video

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.330
games.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.250
And look, it goes all the way back to the
eighties and the original Road Runner…which

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.540
sucked on the NES, the Commodore 64 and everything
in between.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.500
This continued in the nineties with Death
Valley Rally…a game not unlike having a

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.180
safe dropped on your head…as well as this
one.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.860
This is Desert Demolition, for the SEGA Genesis.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.530
Better than Death Valley Rally, worse than
Road Runner…

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.800
This one’s in the middle.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.830
It’s like a sandwich of bad gameplay.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:02.990
And sh*t.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.670
So obviously, when you’re given the opportunity
to make a game based on something as awesome

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.080
as the Road Runner and Coyote cartoons…what
you’re gonna do is not be creative.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.630
No, what you’re gonna do…is rip off whatever
happens to be popular at the time.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.640
In this case, Sonic The Hedgehog.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.220
They sat in a room, and somebody said, “Hey,
Sonic’s fast, so is the Road Runner.”

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.030
Literally, that was the entire creative process
behind this game.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.279
Fast thing must have the same game as other
fast thing.

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.489
That’s, just…speedism at its worst.

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.299
Anyway, Desert Demolition is an absolute clusterf*ck.

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.840
It’s one of the most unfocused, unclear
pieces of game design I’ve ever seen.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.519
So you can play as either character, but no
matter which one you pick, the objective’s

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:45.519
the same.

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.519
Run to the exit.

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.890
This is basically just Sonic The Coyote.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.220
Which could be okay, I mean, I’ll even give
it that.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.959
If you did this right, this could be okay.

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.730
It’s done so far from okay, it has to pay
extra for shipping.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.669
It’s basically the principles of Sonic…without
the design elements that make those principles

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:03.669
work.

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:08.000
It’s, like…you toss a box of dough and
a can of tomatoes in the oven, your house

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.629
burns down, the firemen pull you out, and
you’re like, “Wait, I have to check my

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:12.790
pizza.”

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.739
Desert Demolition thinks that’s pizza.

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:25.260
I mean, the levels are so tall, and so aimless…you
never really have any idea where you’re

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.349
supposed to be going.

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.359
Which is sort of the same thing in Sonic,
right?

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.950
But the difference is, in Sonic, you’re
given a direction.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.529
In Desert Demolition, you’re given a headache.

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:37.719
No joke, this game gave me a migraine…just
trying to figure out where the f*ck to go.

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:42.389
But then you find it, and you can’t even
do it, because it also tries to be a platformer.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.379
With controls built for speed.

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.330
Yeah, that’s perfect when you have to be
deliberate and precise.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.169
Hey, I have a tonsillectomy in 15 minutes.

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.379
Somebody get my hedge clippers.

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.760
I’m gonna slice this bastard up.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.109
So the controls always suck, the level design’s
always terrible…are there any differences

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.109
between the characters?

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.230
Oh, sure, in an academic sense.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.269
Road Runner has to run from the coyote, who
is a psychic in this game and can predict

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.599
your every move…and of course, the coyote
gets to use fun gadgets to catch the Road

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:11.599
Runner.

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.189
And that’s the way to go, to be honest…but
there’s just one problem.

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:16.670
Catching the Road Runner doesn’t even do
anything.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.970
You just get, like…extra stamps.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.940
Oh, hooray for the extra f*cking stamps, you
still have to make your way through these

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.940
levels.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.220
A migraine, for three hours.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.730
Go ahead, put a stamp on that.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:40.150
You know, I wish I had some stamps here.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.940
‘Cause I’d mail this thing to the desert.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.720
It’s six godawful levels of floaty, mediocre
gameplay.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.860
And that’s the thing—there are some cool
ideas here, but the execution is a total disaster.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.060
Even with the nice sprites, and solid music…you’re
always thinking, “Man, someone spent like,

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.139
a month on this game.

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.139
Tops.”

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.080
And you can do so much more with a month.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.669
The possibilities are endless.

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.770
But whatever you do…don’t play this.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.940
It’s Desert Demolition, for the SEGA Genesis.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.289
Thanks to our pal Gary from Ridgewood, New
Jersey, for sending it to the show.

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:18.170
Although, next time, Gary…send some ibuprofen,
too.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.180
And a return envelope.
