Hi! This is Julie with Beadaholique.com and today I'm going to show you how to use cup

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.139
chain ends

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.919
so when you have a length of cup chain you'll
notice that the end

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.900
is not finished

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.630
it comes to a blunt stop. You can't really
attach a jump ring. You can't do a

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.519
lot with it other than glue it or embed it in crystal clay which are both

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.439
great options or sometimes you want to
turn it into

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.570
a necklace or a bracelet. You want to have a
way of attaching a jump ring or a

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.110
clasp to it

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.850
and so that's when cup chain ends come in
handy and that's what these little guys

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.830
are

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.070
you can see that they have little prong
settings and you're going to

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.560
go ahead

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.880
fit the end of link of you're cup chain into
the cup chain ends

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.450
it's going to look

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.710
like this

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.050
what that allows you to do

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.920
is to those little end loops attach a
jump ring

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.420
and then attach a clasp

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.560
and make a finished piece of jewelry

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.530
so it's really easy to do this

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.970
and the first thing you're going to do is

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.950
figure out the size of your cup chain
and then the corresponding size of the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.850
cup chain end. So that's important to
figure out cuz you see they come

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.770
in different sizes, you wanna make sure you choose the appropriate size for your

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.500
cup chain and that's all listed on the beadaholique.com website

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.010
so once you've found the size that is
appropriate, take your cup chain

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.560
the last link

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.720
and you get a set it right down into the
cup chain end

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.200
and you can see there's a little notch right there

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.050
that allows for this little metal bridge to fit right in

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.370
there, it's actually

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.740
going to hold it

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.920
now fold over the side tabs

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.170
now what I like to do is take a pair of chain nose pliers

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.880
very carefully, you don't want to hurt the crystal and holding the cup chain end

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.230
by the loop

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.750
the chain is resting in there, it's pretty secure

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.099
depress

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:02.520
the side and let it folds over

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.020
do that on the other side

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.629
there you go

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.819
and now

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.299
that is in there, it's not going anywhere and
now you have a perfect loop to attach a

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.799
jump ring, a clasp or some other jewelry
component to it, than you can make a lot

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.489
of different jewelry styles

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.849
very simply now

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.999
by using these cup chain ends in correspondence with the cup chain. Go to www.beadaholique.com to purchase beading supplies and to get design ideas!
