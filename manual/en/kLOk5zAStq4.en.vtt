00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:13.646
The alligator snapping turtle is the largest freshwater turtle species in North America.

00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:20.720
Kevin Enge and Travis Thomas, biologists with the FWC Fish and Wildlife Research Institute

00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:25.110
are conducting a study that will determine the turtleâ€™s population status,

00:00:25.151 --> 00:00:28.730
movements, and home range size in the Suwannee River.

00:00:29.168 --> 00:00:34.968
A 2-year sonic telemetry study is being funded by the Nongame Wildlife Trust Fund

00:00:35.088 --> 00:00:38.131
in conjunction with a with a 2-year trapping study

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.256
funded through the Conserve Wildlife license plate.

00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:47.705
Information on habitat use, water depth, movements, and home range will be collected,

00:00:47.873 --> 00:00:53.218
as well as potential impacts of human activities on turtles' habitat structure.

00:00:53.706 --> 00:00:57.911
The alligator snapping turtles will be fitted with sonic transmitters

00:00:57.955 --> 00:01:02.070
and tracked in the Suwannee River using ultrasonic receivers.

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:07.523
This study will be the first telemetry study conducted on the alligator snapping turtle

00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:09.658
in the eastern part of its range,

00:01:09.698 --> 00:01:16.308
and it will be the first study of its kind in a large, free-flowing river system in the United States.

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:22.116
To estimate population size, biologists use a mark-recapture method.

00:01:22.678 --> 00:01:28.020
Turtles are "marked" by implanting microchip tags in their tails and then released.

00:01:28.841 --> 00:01:32.081
The proportion of marked turtles later recaptured

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.463
is used to estimate population size in different sections of the river.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.700
Alligator snapping turtles were historically used as food in the South.

00:01:42.028 --> 00:01:46.383
The peak harvest occurred in the 1960's and 1970's.

00:01:46.783 --> 00:01:50.701
In the 1970's, the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:54.048
began limiting the take of alligator snapping turtles.

00:01:54.418 --> 00:01:58.930
Today, it is illegal to take, possess, or sell these turtles.

00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:05.338
It could take decades for the alligator snapping turtle to recover from previous over-harvesting.

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:12.213
However, biologists have discovered that many turtles weigh over 100 pounds in the Suwannee River.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.228
This suggests that the population in this area was not over-harvested and should continue to thrive.
