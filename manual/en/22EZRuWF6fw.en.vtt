00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.970
Extra, extra!

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.560
“Papergirl promoted!”

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.150
Everyone’s impressed!

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.839
And her creepy boss, too.

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.119
Hot off the press!

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:33.649
It’s Paperboy 2, for the Super NES.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:44.620
You know, I’ve always had a thing for old-time
culture, especially the 1920s and 30s.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.769
Love the music, Annette Hanshaw had a voice
that’d make your eyes starry…and I love

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:49.879
the movies, too.

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.910
Nosferatu, Caligari…and see, that’s how
they sold papers, too.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.780
Speak in rhymes, earn those dimes, sell those
leads while the ink still bleeds…

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.489
Unfortunately, there’s none of that in Paperboy.

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.910
You just ride your bike around, and throw
papers… and deal with this guy, who probably

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.979
has…outstanding, warrants…

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.939
But hey, that’s a tough job, too.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.220
I mean, newsboys in the 20s didn’t have
to deal with dead people.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.799
Just newspaper magnates.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.920
Alright, that’s kind of the same thing.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.500
Anyway, so the job got easier over the years,
big deal.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.060
So maybe paperboys can’t rhyme like John
Keats anymore, but they throw like John freaking

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.060
Elway.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.670
They’re breaking windows, with newspapers.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.960
Stopping robberies, with newspapers.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.170
You know how hard it is to do that?

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.430
You ever tried to do that?

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.990
That’s next to impossible.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.990
Not for Paperboy.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.420
Or Papergirl, that’s actually one of the
cool things about the sequel.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.950
Paperboy 2 introduces Papergirl, and even
though she doesn’t play any different, she

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.560
does have a ponytail…

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.100
And apparently, a skin condition.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.290
Little Gold Bond, clear that right up.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.940
Probably a coupon in this week’s mailer.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.810
But they added more than just a severe case
of rosacea, they also tweaked the design.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.920
This time, you have to deliver to both sides
of the street, as well as a couple different

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.920
neighborhoods.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.550
You can also play with a friend, so business
is booming.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.170
Probably won’t last, though, and that’s
because you can also screw with both sides

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.170
of the street.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.170
And who’s not gonna do that?

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.459
You can do all kinds of fun stuff by throwing
your papers.

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.210
At people.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.740
Probably not so good for business.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.780
And don’t act like that’s messed up.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.220
This whole town is messed up.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.629
People throw baseballs at you.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:35.260
And all their friends have gargoyles for lawn
ornaments, and moats for sidewalks…

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.170
And MILFs for neighbors…

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.530
Alright, this town’s awesome.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.740
Game’s not quite as awesome, though.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.180
I mean, it’s good, it’s fine…but it’s
not considered as good as the original.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.590
Even though, to be honest…I think I kind
of prefer this one.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.290
It’s not quite as hard, it’s a little
easier to play…still pretty tough, though.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.760
In fact, it can be a little frustrating from
time to time.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.290
Cars are on you before you can even react,
there are some cheap shots…

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.959
And I think, for the Super Nintendo…you
kind of expect more from the presentation.

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.620
It’s not an especially good-looking game,
especially on the same system that had Mario

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.250
World, and Super Metroid, and Yoshi’s Island…

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.830
So I don’t know.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.110
I mean, don’t get me wrong, I definitely
had fun with this game, but I can also see

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.520
why some people consider it a disappointment,
as a sequel to this legendary arcade game.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.800
I think you tend to expect more, even if what
you got wasn’t bad, either.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.470
Paperboy 2 is fun.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.440
And apparently, it could also, tell the future.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.819
Extra, extra!

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.019
Hedgehog’s fate once foretold!

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:59.110
Read all about it after 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.159
the fold!

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:09.550
It’s Paperboy 2, for the Super NES.
