00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.009
Hey Guys, My name is Shubham and today, I
installed MIUI 7 on my Redmi Note 4g device.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.660
In this video, I will be giving my impressions
about the ROM and if you guys also want to

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.450
get the ROM, the link would be in the description.
Lets get started.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.720
CUT TO THE INTRO

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.970
Firstly I would like to clarify that still,
the device is running on Android Kitkat. But,

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.039
again, this is the BETA version of the ROM
and according to me the stable version would

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.900
definitely be running on android 5.0 lollipop.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.860
So, the company provided 4 pre installed themes
for the ROM which were the Black or the High

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.410
Life theme, Light Pink or the Pink Blush theme,
The dark pink or the Rose theme and the Blue

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.140
or the Ocean breeze theme.
I think that this upgrade from MIUI 6 has

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.190
made the phone a lot smoother. At even the
latest version of MIUI 6, I was seeing a lot

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.250
of stuttering here and there but with the
MIUI 7, the lagginess has been minimized.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.220
In the notification drawer, The icon style
has also changed and they have a small animation

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.220
now. Also, the brightness toggle has been
configured like what we have seen in Android

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.000
Lollipop and I quiet like it.
Another feature which has been added to the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.720
phone is the parental control. Through this
feature, a parent can configure which app

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.320
would be accessible to their children. Not
quiet useful for me, but can be useful for

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.110
some of you guys.
Also, the way apps open and terminate has

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.130
also changed. It is now more of a lollipop
style gesture and that again makes the device

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.580
look quiet snappier.
Though some things have been changed in the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.430
ROM, the camera UI is still not changed. But
this is not the final version and they may

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.320
release the new UI on 19th August in their
event in Delhi.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.650
If we talk about the gallery, it has got quiet
a drastic change. The gallery application

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.030
is now having a lighter theme and also, when
you open an image, it looks more like IOS.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.490
I didn�t quiet like this one because the
older UI was better in my opinion. But the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.270
video player has now changed a lot. The slider
has become more visible and now, there is

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.080
a settings option from where you can toggle
more options.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.520
The One Hand mode is still present and also,
now you have an option which confirms wether

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.230
you want to go to the One Handed mode to prevent
mistaken use.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.830
In the color and saturation settings under
display options, You now have a slider which

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.460
would help you choose between standard, warm
or Cool temperatures. Though,, Saturation

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:49.560
options are still the old ones. Also, the
text can be configured more convieniently.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.090
On the lockscreen, you still have the option
to slide left for opening camera, and also,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.730
now you can slide right to go to Xiaomi Assistant
which is in my opinion not coming out of china.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.550
I think that they would either replace the
assistant by dialer or would remove that feature.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.700
Another thing that has been changed a lot
is the File Explorer. You do have the Apps

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.950
section and Recents section now and also,
browsing through files has become more convenient.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.950
Another feature which might be staying in
china only is the swipe up from Home screen

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:19.950
gesture which would again take you to the
MI assistant. I find this quiet useful many

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:20.950
a times, but Xiaomi removed a similar type
of feature from global version of MIUI 6 and

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.950
I don�t think that they would be keeping
the feature for the global version of MIUI

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:22.950
7 too.
So guys, I think that is pretty much it for

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.820
now. I would be exploring the MIUi 7 a lot
and may post further videos on it too. Do

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.200
