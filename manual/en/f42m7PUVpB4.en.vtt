Hey, Stephanie with AmericanMuscle.com checking
out an impressive way to dress up the interior

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.760
of your '05 to '09 Mustang, thanks to this
Carbon Fiber Dash Overlay Kit available right

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.130
here at AmericanMuscle.com.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.760
The interiors of the '05 to '09 Mustang are
definitely an improvement over the previous

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.619
generation's interior, but some people, including
myself, still feel like there's a little something

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.619
missing.

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.179
This kit is a great way to add a subtle touch
of customization and improve the overall look

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.289
of your Mustang's interior all at the same
time.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.220
And if you're just a little nervous about
changing the entire appearance of your S-197's

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.500
interior, you can always head back to the
product page to check out some customer submitted

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.870
images of this kit installed on customer cars.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.190
And while you're there, read up on some customer
submitted reviews of the kit as well.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.830
This kit features about 15 different trim
pieces designed to fit different parts of

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.460
your Mustang's interior, from the center console
to the headlight switch and the door lock

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.460
trim.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.830
All of these pieces together ultimately make
for a radical changed to the interior.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.040
Each piece is individually cut for easy installation,
and all of the designs have been test fit

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.860
on our own fleet of Mustangs by our vinyl
techs so you can expect a perfect fit.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.219
So one of the biggest worries with vinyl is
air bubbles and wrinkles.

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.310
These two things can typically turn something
that looks classy into something that looks

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.310
sloppy.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.470
Luckily the vinyl in this kit has air release
technology so it actually has miniature air

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.670
channels on the adhesive side that allows
air to easily be squeezed out from underneath

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.249
the vinyl, making for a bubble free install
and smooth and wrinkle free surface.

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:30.170
And as always American Muscle graphics has
used only the highest quality wrapping cast

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.170
vinyl for this kit.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.119
Since this is an all in one kit, you do not
have to worry if your car is auto or manual

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.740
or even a Cooper convertible.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.090
The kit will give you everything you need,
and there are no optional extras to buy.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.070
As far as install goes, you're probably looking
at about an hour to get this entire kit installed,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.659
but I would recommend that you take your time
and not rush just to make sure you're doing

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.999
the best job possible.

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:53.899
Also, make sure that anywhere you're installing
the kit is perfectly clean.

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.420
This means no dash detail and product anywhere.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.039
It's probably best to use an alcohol prep
pad or something similar prior to laying any

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.250
vinyl just to make sure you get proper adhesion.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.119
If you guys have any questions about the kit
or the install, you can always reach out to

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.840
a Mustang expert by phone or email.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.459
So if you're looking for a dramatic and affordable
way to transform the interior of your Mustang,

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.110
then the Carbon Fiber Dash Overlay Kit for
the '05 to '09 S-197 is the perfect solution

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.110
