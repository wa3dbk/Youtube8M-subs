This video was made to introduce MY subscribers to a unique channel called "Carsandwater".   That's it!

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.450
Carsandwater does this thing
called a

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.299
RHNB and as I scratched my head I had
no idea what he's talking about

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.949
but I went the channel and checked it out
and what he does is

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.850
heats up a Nickel ball red hot,  or  even
white-hot

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.470
any drops it in like a cup of water or on
top of a giant gummy bear or

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.699
silly putty or crayons and it's like
it's very similar to some of  the stuff I do.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:32.509
My video is quite undramatic,  so I ask you to visit "carsandwater"  to see the amazing stuff he does.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.280
I juar wanted to illustrate what he does,  but I didn't want to "out-RHNB" him at the same time out of respect.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.649
A lot of people watching this video simply fail to understand that this video was made to promote another channel I like to watch.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.059
Sadly some people actually get angry with this video.   I think they are just envious that I chose to promote a channel that does unique videos

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.140
instead of promoting trolls that do nothing but complain what others post.    It's sad. Everyone has the ability to post their ideas on Youtube,   but many choose not to do that because they fear they will get the same vile comments THEY leave on other peoples' videos.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.780
We will heat up their ball as hot as
we can get it and drop it in there and

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.680
see what it will do

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.680
the

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.720
old

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.780
and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.780
ok

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.630
ok

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.630
I'm

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.750
of be sure to check out

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.460
CARSANDWATER  He specializes in this
stuff

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.590
I hope everyone understands the context of this video.  The smart people usually do.   
Thanks for watching.
