00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.430
Today on this 2009 Toyota RAV4 we are going
to be installing wiring harness part number

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.430
118412.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.870
We are going to start off in the rear cargo
area of the RAV4.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.860
The ports that we are looking for are located
inside the vehicle behind both the driver

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.769
and passenger side panels basically directly
behind the tail light assembly.

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.320
We are going to need to remove a few items
to gain access to these ports.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.670
We are going to start by removing the floor
board along with the cargo area and then we

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.880
will be able to pull back the panels and gain
access to the plugs.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.510
Next I am going to pull out the rear threshold
piece and to do that we are going to need

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.170
to release the mounting clips that are holding
it into place on the top side here.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.270
Use a basic rivet removal tool and pry it
up gently to release the clips.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.519
With those released we want to come to the
bottom of it and we are going to lift straight

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:48.750
up.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.769
00:48
Next we will move on to the interior panel

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.149
and there is a couple of fasteners that are
holding it into place as well as the clips

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:56.920
like we had on the rear threshold section.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.910
We have got the tie down bolt right here,
a second one here, a regular screw in this

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.299
recessed hole here, another hex head bolt
here, and then a Phillips head fastener here.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.250
You want to remove all of those and pull the
panel back.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:22.070
We will do that on both the driver and passenger
sides.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:41.540
With 
the fasteners removed we 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:02:13.860
are going to take the rivet tool and along
the rear edge release the clips.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:46.019
You can see we still 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:03:04.239
cannot 
get 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:40.840
to the panel fully off and that is because
of the seat release still 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:51.189
holding it 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.670
into position.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:05:00.120
We really just need 
it back enough so that 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:21.040
we 
can route the passenger side connector from

00:05:21.040 --> 00:06:10.460
this side over 
and across to 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:28.790
the passenger side connector.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:37.810
01:37
