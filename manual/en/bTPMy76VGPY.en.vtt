How to Grow a One-Pot Indoor Herb Garden.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.430
If you're a beginning indoor gardener, try
starting with a one-pot herb garden in your

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.740
kitchen or on any windowsill exposed to sunlight.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:24.180
You will need Nearby garden store Pot Baby
plant Potting soil Organic fertilizer and

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.700
plate or tray (optional).

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.700
Step 1.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.970
Go online to learn about cooking herbs that
are easy to grow indoors, if you're a beginning

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.340
gardener.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.550
Start with herbs that don't require much sunlight,
such as chives.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.550
Step 2.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.230
Go to a garden store.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.390
Buy a pot with drainage holes on the bottom.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.620
For growing an individual plant, a pot should
be no larger than 6 inches in diameter.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.220
Buy a plate or tray to prevent any water from
drainage holes from dripping on the floor.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.240
Step 3.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.040
Get a baby plant or seedling if you're a beginner.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.960
Growing from seeds can be a more complicated
process.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.860
Start with one type of herb per pot.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.640
Different types of herbs growing in the same
pot can have different growth patterns and

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.210
require different care.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.210
Step 4.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.620
Fill the pot with soil, three inches from
the top.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.610
Dig a small hole in the soil.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.000
Remove the seedling from the nursery container
and plant it.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.110
Pack soil over the roots.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.500
Don't use soil from outside because exposure
to outdoor elements can make it incompatible

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.670
with indoor growing conditions.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.670
Step 5.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.990
Locate the pot where it can get maximum sunlight,
especially in the winter.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.650
A window facing southwest is ideal.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.950
Step 6.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.280
Add organic fertilizer, like fish emulsion
or liquid seaweed, every two weeks.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.360
Too much fertilizing can negatively affect
the taste of herbs like basil.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.909
Step 7.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.370
Don't overwater, which can rot the roots.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.080
Routinely touch the soil and if it feels dry,
moisten the soil at the stem.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.520
Yellow leaves can indicate overwatering.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.360
Enjoy your indoor garden.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.979
Did you know Koalas adhere to a diet of eucalyptus
leaves, an herb that's poisonous to most other

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.159
animals.
