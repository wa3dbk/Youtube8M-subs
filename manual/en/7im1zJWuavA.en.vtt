00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.140
Hush, don't speak

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.000
When you spit your venom, keep it shut I hate it

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.820
When you hiss and preach

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.180
About your new messiah cause your theories catch fire

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.040
I can't find those silver linings

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.400
I don't mean to judge

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.760
But when you read your speech, it's tiring

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.960
Enough is enough

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.320
I'm covering my ears like a kid

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.880
When your words mean nothing
I go la la la

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.040
I'm turning off the volume when you speak

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.400
Cause if my heart can't stop it
I find a way to block it

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.280
I go
La la, la la la...
