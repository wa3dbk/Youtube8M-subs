Today I will be making aloo bread pakora.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.400
Bread stuffed with spicy potatoes coated with gram flour batter and deep fried.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.840
This is a delicious treat.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.820
Spicy hot aloo bread pakoras for me is a comfort food.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.600
This recipe will serve 4.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.460
To make aloo bread pakoras we will need:

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.120
We need

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.540
8 slices of bread.
Use firm bread and I have already trimmed the edges.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.480
For filling we need

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.880
3 medium potatoes boiled, peeled and finely chopped.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.240
This should make about 2 cups of chopped potatoes.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.260
1 tablespoon of oil

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.260

And about 2 tablespoons of finely chopped cilantro (hara dhania).

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.840
For batter we need

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.500
3/4 cup of besan (gram flour)

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.880

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.860

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.500
And about 3/4 cup of water.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.300
We also need oil to fry.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.720
So first I will make the batter.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.820
For that here is the besan.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.340
Asafoetida

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.700
And oil.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.220
Mix it well.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.320
Mix it well
so you are breaking all the lumps there are.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.480
Now add the water.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.200
We need to make smooth and thick batter.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.020
Batter is looking good.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.140
It has consistency of pancake batter.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.700
It's very smooth.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.340
Now just whip it for about a minute.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.380
So this gets light and fluffy.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.120
I have used about 3/4 cup of water to make the batter.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.020
Now we will make the filling.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.080
Heat is on, medium.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.780
So here is the oil.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.420
Oil should be moderately hot.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.480
Oil is ready.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.600
Lets put the cumin seed they should crack right away.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.420
Now potatoes.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.960
Just stir them.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.140
And add all the other spices except the cilantro.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.240
Turmeric

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.800

Ginger

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.680
Salt

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.020
And green chillies.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.980
And stir fry them for about 2 minutes.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.860
Filling is ready.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.700
It has been about 2 minutes.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.620
As you see potatoes have started catching some brown color.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.980
So turn off the heat.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.400
And add the cilantro.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.020
Mix it well.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.500
Cilantro gives them really nice color.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.320
Filling is ready.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.640
Filling has cooled off to room temperature.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.780
So I am ready to fill the bread for the pakoras.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.780
So first you wet your palm.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.020
And just press it.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.080
Bread should be moist not wet.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.280
So just make sure it's moist all around.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.700
And now just take about 1.5 tablespoons of potatoes.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.400
Put it in.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.340
And depends how big your bread is.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.420
And just fold it all around.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.300
Now let's take another one.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.500
Wet your palm.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.420
And just take the bread.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.840
Bread should be like as I said moist.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.800
So make sure it's moist.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.820
Both sides.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.600
You don't want this to be wet.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.680
Now take about 1.5 tablespoons of filling.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.440
Make it round.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.180
Put it in the center.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.140
And just go around and close it.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.520
Make sure it's closed nicely there is no holes.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.760
And just press it.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.060
This is looking good.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.140
And as you see it's all covered.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.640
I have stuffed all the bread.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.560
So now I am ready to fry the aloo bread pakoras.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.720
Heat is on, medium.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.180
So oil should be moderately hot.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.580
And frying pan should have about 1 inch of oil.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.680
So just dip the bread.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.500
Nicely all around coated in the batter.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.540
And drop it in slowly.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.240
And don't overcrowd it.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.540
I will fry them in two batches.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.480
You do have to turn them few times.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.120
They should be golden brown all around.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.060
And this should take about 4 minutes.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.920
So just lightly put the oil over.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.660
Oil shouldn't be too hot. They should get brown right away.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.720
It's time to turn them.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.840
They are looking really good.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.340
It has been about 4 minutes.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.640
And as you see they have nice light brown color.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.440
So we are ready.
We will take it out.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.600
And I always like to take them out over the paper

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.360
so this extra oil is absorbed.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.800
When you serve them
we will have to half them.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.220
Cut them in the center.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.820
Aloo bread pakoras are looking very appealing.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.120
They make very good snack with afternoon snack.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.920
Or serve aloo bread pakaras as an appetizer.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.900
I will be serving them with green cilantro chutney.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:29.900
Enjoy.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.720
Thank you.
