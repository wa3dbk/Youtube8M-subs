00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.150
Hyundai MB-910 Wristwatch phone.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.640
The Hyundai MB-910 is a full-blown wristwatch
phone, similar in concept to the upcoming

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.039
LG GD910 and it opens up the possibility of
a new battleground for manufacturers.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.300
Hyundai say that the MB-910 should be due
in the UK during the late second quarter of

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.830
2009.. and crucially, the estimated SIM-free
retail price of the MB-910 is going to be

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.300
around £200 (approximately €220) when it
hits the streets.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.671
The MB-910 is being pitched as a second phone
by Hyundai, and at this sort of price it is

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:48.180
easy to see the phone's appeal.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.240
If you ignore the cool packaging of the MB-910,
the underneath you will find that this is

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:02.020
a tri-band GSM phone with a 1.5" 132 x 176
pixel touch-sensitive display, Bluetooth,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:11.280
a multimedia player with 128MB of memory,
USB 2.0 connectivity, a WAP 2.0 browser, email

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.580
client and a set of personal information management
applications.. including a full-screen clock.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.250
Of course, what's really clever about the
Hyundai MB-910 is the fact that it can be

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.000
worn on the wrist, so it is basically just
like a wristwatch.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.740
We must say though that the MB-910 is a very
large wristwatch.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.630
Weighing 58 grams and measuring 58 x 44 x
16mm, the MB-910 is about twice as heavy as

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.750
a typical man's watch, and three times as
heavy as a woman's watch.. and of course it

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.479
is much bigger.

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.800
Think of the MB-910 as being around the same
size as a diver's watch and you might get

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.970
a feeling for just how large this is.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.560
The small 400 mAh battery can drive the MB-910
for up to 3 hours talktime and just under

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.280
3 days standby time.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.720
That may not seem like a long time, but really
the MB-910 is going to appeal to people who

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.340
will wear it for a few hours and then take
it off.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.120
It's hard to say if the MB-910 will be a success
as it isn't exactly a mainstream phone, but

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.140
then none of the recently announced Hyundai
handsets have been very mainstream.. and that's

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.980
a very good thing for consumer choice.
