00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:10.860
ANNE THOMPSON, anchor:

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:19.180
It is the highest mountain in all of Africa,
and one of the most iconic mountains in the

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.320
world. For decades, Mount Kilimanjaro has
attracted hikers, adventurers, and romantics

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.720
alike. Popular in books and movies, Ernest
Hemingway described it as "wide as all the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.680
world, great, high, and unbelievably white
in the sun."

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.140
GREGORY PECK (Film Clip: Snows of Kilimanjaro,
1952): Kilimanjaro is a snow-covered mountain,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.300
19,710 feet high.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.120
A. THOMPSON: When people talk about the snow
on Kilimanjaro, they're talking about its

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.680
glaciers: immense sheets of slowly moving
ice are formed from layer upon layer of compacted

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.830
snow accumulating for hundreds, or even thousands,
of years.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.200
Dr. LONNIE THOMPSON (Ohio State University):
To be a glacier ice has to move. Ice and motion,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.220
to have them move you have to have pressure
from accumulating snow on top.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.670
A. THOMPSON: And like other glaciers on Earth,
the ones on Kilimanjaro are in serious trouble.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.680
L. THOMPSON: We're losing glaciers around
the planet. It doesn't matter whether youre

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.100
in the tropics or the Andes in South America
or Kilimanjaro or any other glaciers in Africa,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.200
or over in Papua, Indonesia, the ice is disappearing.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.080
A. THOMPSON: For the past thirty years Dr.
Lonnie Thompson of Ohio State University has

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.440
been collecting ice core samples from glaciers
all over the globe. His ice core collection,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.080
stored in a freezer kept at 30 degrees below
zero, is one of the largest in the world.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.770
L. THOMPSON: The oldest records we have to
date are from the Guliya ice cap in Western

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:53.290
Kunlun Mountains in China. That record goes
back over 750,000 years, from a mountain range.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.970
One of our best records is what's recorded
in the ice as far as getting us a perspective

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.470
on many of variables that cause climate change.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.310
Off-Screen Voice: And this is the second core
to bedrock on Kilimanjaro.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.369
L. THOMPSON: We can look at the composition
of the world's atmosphere in the past looking

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.570
at the air trapped in the bubbles, so you
have little capsules of the air of the past.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.170
A. THOMPSON: Analyzing the ice cores can reveal
many things about Earth's climate from the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.439
past thousands of years.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:26.120
L. THOMPSON: So you can measure CO2, methane,
nitrous oxide. Everything we're concerned

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.500
about in today's world, only you can get these
long-term histories of these-- how they varied

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.500
in the past.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.379
A. THOMPSON: Through the many layers in the
ice cores, no layer has shown more impact

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.019
from climate change than the most recent years.

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:45.470
L. THOMPSON: There's really no analog in this
long archive of where we are today. And of

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.519
course, we're really concerned about where
we're going to be in less than a hundred years,

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:50.849
if we continue on our current path.

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.700
A. THOMPSON: If the ice and snow on Kilimanjaro
were to disappear, the economy of Tanzanian

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.120
communities that rely on the mountain for
tourism and natural resources could be in

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.719
serious jeopardy. Elsewhere in the world,
the disappearance of glaciers could have serious

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:11.450
impacts on communities that rely on them for
drinking water, hydroelectric power, irrigation,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.280
and many other needs. Scientists also worry
that the vanishing of glaciers worldwide is

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.669
a signal of other more drastic climate changes
to come.

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:27.499
L. THOMPSON: They are the canaries and the
coal mine for-- for ice and-- and I think

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:33.230
the fact that they are all telling us the
same story to me is what's really, uh, of

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.230
concern.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.090
A. THOMPSON: To better understand how climate
change is impacting the mechanics of glaciers,

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.260
it's important to look at how glaciers melt.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.889
L. THOMPSON: Most glaciers around the world
today are-- experience a negative mass balance

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.199
of the glacier as a whole.

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:53.120
A. THOMPSON: Dr. Douglas Hardy of UMass-Amherst
has been to Mt. Kilimanjaro a total of 13

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.150
times and continues to go once a year, measuring
the decline of its glaciers. From his camp

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.739
near the summit, Hardy sets up weather stations
at different points along the glaciers that

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.959
measure everything from air temperature to
solar reflection.

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.900
Dr. DOUGLAS HARDY (UMass-Amherst): Working
at 6,000 meters is very difficult. It's very

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.840
unpleasant much of the time. And it's exhausting
to spend an entire day-- chipping into the

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:24.349
ice or walking and drilling holes into the
glacier to reposition stakes on the glacier

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.750
and climbing the tower, it's exhausting.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.190
A. THOMPSON: At the summit, air temperatures
stay below freezing. But because the air is

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.270
so thin, the sun's solar radiation is more
intense, and that has a huge impact on the

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.270
ice.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.300
HARDY: We've got a tremendous amount of radiation
coming from the sun, energy coming from the

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.950
sun because we're at high altitude. We're
above much of the atmosphere.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.169
A. THOMPSON: As the solar radiation penetrates
the glaciers, it causes the ice to melt, thus

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:58.139
turning the solid ice into a liquid. In some
cases the radiation is so intense that the

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.770
ice is vaporized--a process called sublimation.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:09.090
HARDY: Sublimation is nothing more than evaporation
going in the case where we go from a solid

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.090
to a vapor.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.110
A. THOMPSON: Precipitation is one of the keys
to preventing these glaciers from melting

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.460
and sublimating. The more snow that falls
on the mountain, the more the glaciers are

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.970
protected from solar radiation, which reflects
off the white surface of the snow.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.379
HARDY: Kilimanjaro precipitation is always
in the form of snow and every time it snows

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:31.030
it brightens the surface of the glacier.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.910
A. THOMPSON: If there is less snow cover,
the glaciers are more exposed to solar radiation,

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:42.720
and thus, more subject to melting and sublimation.
Tanzania has been seeing a lack of precipitation,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.610
in the form of a drought--resulting in less
snow cover on Kilimanjaro. The drought, some

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:54.000
scientists believe, could be a result of climate
change over a much larger area: the Indian

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Ocean.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.800
HARDY: We know that the heat content of the
Indian Ocean has been increasing-- as a result

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.039
of warming of the atmosphere. We know that
the sea surface temperatures have been changing.

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:11.780
And we know that precipitation over much of
Tanzania, East Africa, has been decreasing.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.060
L. THOMPSON: Climate is everything-- I mean
it's temperatures, it's precipitation, it's

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.530
radiation, it's cloudiness. I mean all of
those variables are out there.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.770
A. THOMPSON: All of which are driving the
glaciers of Kilimanjaro and others around

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.750
the world to disappear, sometimes into thin
air.
