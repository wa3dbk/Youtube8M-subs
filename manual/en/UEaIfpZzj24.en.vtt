00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:10.799
Hello. This is Julie for Beadaholique.com.
I'm going to show you how to make a

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.259
scrabble tile pendant using epoxy
stickers.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.649
This is quite an easy process if you're
familiar with resin you'll see that

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:21.560
this is actually a lot easier and produces
a very similar result.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.169
So what you're going to need is
some chain. I like pairing

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.080
ball chain with the scrabble tiles. I
think it's kind of fun and funky.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.730
They seem to go together very well.
I have a stainless steel and a black

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.400
one here.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.960
I'll probably use the black one but I do want to
let you know that there are a lot

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.060
different finishes that the ball chain is
available in.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.910
I have some scrabble tile squares
right here.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.250
I have my square epoxy stickers right here
which are going to fit nicely

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.990
on top of the scrabble tiles.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.610
I have several different choices of
Aanraku bails.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.090
An aaraku bail is a
bail is a glue-on bail.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.740
So it's going to fit

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.670
just like that.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.670
and it's nice because it has this nice
loop up top. It also has a ridge which

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.310
is going to allow

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.870
the scrabble tile to fit in nicely and create a nice
clean result.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.760
I'm going to need a pair of scissors to cut out
my images,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.770
some glue, I've got some Nunn design glue right
here,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.410
and I'm going to need some E6000 to
attach the bail

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.100
to the tile itself

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.500
and then of course some images.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.969
So to begin I'm going to

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:29.900
takeoff

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.590
the clear

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.790
protective coating over my

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.820
epoxy stickers.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.640
and what I'm going to do is leave on the backing.
You don't wanna remove that

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.720
until you're ready to actually remove
the sticker.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.540
I'm going to cut out

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.299
one of my squares.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.290
So now they've got that I'm going to take one
of my image sheets.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.909
I have a bunch to choose from. You can see that
these are well loved. I've used them before.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.070
Just take a picture that you like. It can
be from a collage sheet. It could be from the

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.270
photograph, a

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.300
magazine, anything you like.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.110
I'm going to take my

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.629
little square and I'm going to move it
around my sheet.

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.279
That's going to help me decide what image I
want to choose. It's going to give me the size

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:16.719
so I can see what's gonna fit in there.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.219
Actually I like this little bird right here.

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.479
Before I actually cut out

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.289
the image I'm going to take

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:26.659
the sticker

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.249
off of the backing,

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:32.939
being careful not to touch the stick-em
part because you will leave a fingerprint.

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.749
If your hands are dirty that's going to
be picked up on the sticky side.

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.439
I'm going to very carefully line this up

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:46.129
over many image

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.930
press into place.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.989
Now that's actually permanently adhere to
that so I'm going to go ahead

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.879
and cut that out.

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.619
I'm just going to rough cut it just to
begin with.

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:05.409
Now I'm going to cut on the edge and
the sticker making sure not to cut the

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:12.409
sticker itself.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.389
We've got our image.

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.319
So I'm gonna take one of my tiles

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.699
and I want to be able to see the actual
letter and number so I

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.499
want that to show on the back side. I'm going to
turn the tile over.

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.689
So now I'm going to take my white glue.

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:35.169
YOu can use a paint brush if you want but I'm
actually just going to dip my finger into

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.789
the glue bottle.

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:41.649
I want to coat the entire back side of the
image.

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:46.959
Make sure you go around all the edges.

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.239
Carefully

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.599
flip image over.

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.859
Now I'm just going to center it onto the
scrabble tile. Make sure that your

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.649
letter is facing the right direction.

00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:01.099
What's so nice about the stickers as
it's going to leave a little wood

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.599
border

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.360
which is a nice decorative touch.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.360
Gives it a real finished look.

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:15.269
Once I have that centered

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.879
I'm going to press into the place.

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:21.069
I'm gonna hold for a few minutes. I
want to create a strong bond between the

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:24.370
glue and the scrabble tile.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.300
Once that's on and

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.429
your glue is dry, we're going to ahead and
attach the bail.

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:32.980
We're not going to use the white glue.
It's not going to create a strong enough bond.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.780
We want to use E6000 which is a
industrial strength adhesive.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.970
I have several different aaraku bails
to choose from.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.409
I have a heart's, a cute little dog paw
which would you be great if you're doing

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.120
animal images but I don't think that's gonna be
quite right for the bird though

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.169
so I'm going to go with the little leaf pattern.

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.620
I'm going to open up

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.669
my glue.

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:03.159
I have a little piece of scrap wire I'm going to use
as an applicator.

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.060
I'm going to put a little bit on the tip.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.819
I'm going to put the glue directly onto
that flat glue-on surface of the bail

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:14.470
spread around

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.559
flip over

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:20.489
my pendant and

00:05:20.489 --> 00:05:27.489
press in the place.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.749
Set that aside.

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:33.789
Let it dry and then all I need to do is
thread on my ball chain

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.319
through the little hoop at the top of
the aanraku bail and my scrabble tile

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.169
pendant will be done.

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.590
Our pendant bail is now all dry
and I've chose a stainless steel ball

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.919
chain to put on

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.419
to my scrabble tile pendant. You're just going
to

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:55.610
thread the chain through the top hoop of
your bail.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.979
If you're not familiar with how a ball chain
works we've got this great little connector

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:00.119
clasp.

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:02.469
You just put the last ball

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:05.039
through the little opening

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:06.660
and pull until it clicks

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.909
and it's snugly in place.

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:13.080
Now you have created a scrabble tile
pendant using a epoxy sticker.

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:18.080
