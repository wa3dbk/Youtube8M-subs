00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.109
also one of the great combinations and
worldwide they make a lot of dishes where

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.610

of coriander to give a nice flavor to

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.789
our green curry first we're going to
blanch the spinach just don't chop or

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.030
anything just the whole leaf just put
it in hot water

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.949
once the water comes to a boil just
switch off the flame and remove all of

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.170
this spinach and keep it aside now in a
pan add some oil, add just pieces of

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.360

is there in the pan, spinach mint and

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.380

this mushroom curry i'm going to use
some oil in this we're going to add some

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.860
onions to make it easy

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.590
add some salt that will bring out the
moisture from this and slowly cook till

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.630
the onions are golden in color

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.130
the onions are slightly golden we're
going to add some turmeric and ginger

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.170
garlic paste cook this ginger garlic
paste also till this is nicely cooked

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.939
and all the raw flavor is gone now the
onions and the ginger garlic paste is

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.740
nicely cooked in this

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.719
add finely chopped tomatoes and in this
we're going to add some masalas one

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.489
teaspoon of coriander powder, half a teaspoon of cumin powder and chili

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.190
powder depends on how

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.200
like it i'm going to use one teaspoon of
chili powder you know put the lid on and let

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.460
it cook on a slow heat so that the
tomatoes get nicely mashed now look at

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.000
this

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.740
the tomatoes are totally mashed and
even the onions will be good to become

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.270
a nice gravy and add some water in this
wow in this we're going to add our

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.590
chaman gravy and you know in no time
this will turn nice green and thick; cook

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.650
on a slow flame till it comes to a nice
simmer now look at this this has come to

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.320
a nice boil in this we're going to add
some mushroom wow this is good and

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.310
you know the mushroom needs to get
cooked for at least two minutes and

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.260
they will slightly shrink mushroom will ooze out nice juices and give a very nice flavor

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.330
to this gravy you know even though this
is a nice fantastic chaman gravy the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.040
ingredients what you add specially
mushroom garlic extra garlic or anything

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.930
you add the flavor gets nicely infused and taste becomes really really nice

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.570
become more thicker than what I wanted
so you can always adjust with by adding

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.709
some water i'm going to let this simmer
for another 2 minutes and this will be

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:31.459
done; need to add some salt in this, this
very less salt in this wow and look at

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.220
this slowly simmering and the taste is
also improved so much haha

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.610
fantastic wow it is not always necessary
in the restaurants what they do you

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.800
always put a lot of butter and cream but
it is not always necessary especially in

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.750
the rustic flavors like the mushroom
once then the spinach you don't want

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.489
that any cream because the real flavor
of this you will enjoy it without cream

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.920
and butter so look at this

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.870
wow wow you know this is super and very
very flavorful
