00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:14.980
Okay, so through that corner, I did a little
bit of braking with my back wheel to sort

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.380
of brake my back end loose and make the radius
of the corner a little bit smaller. So, I

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.360
did a lot of braking before I got to the corner,
after I went over those big roots in the entrance.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.080
There's a nice patch of dirt there; real buff
and smooth and clean with no pebbles. So I

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.500
did a lot of braking there with both my front
brake and my rear brake. Then, when I got

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.390
in the corner, to really make it zoom into
the corner, I had to do some back braking

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.620
into the corner. I had to kick out my back
end a little bit so I got a better angle on

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.771
the front tire to make it all the way through.
So, this corner down here, I'm going to do

00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:58.300
all my braking before I get to the corner,
and then I'm going to just really focus on

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:16.820
angulating down through it. So if you saw
it from the back, you probably saw that it

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.280
looks pretty similar to what I was doing before
but there wasn't any dirt coming up and you

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.780
see the ground is not that disturbed. If I
was braking over there in those leaves. And

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.100
as I ride through this section again, and
you see me coming from the front, you'll see

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.330
that all of my braking is happening before
there and I'm not even touching my brakes

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:57.060
as I go through this section.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.840
So, I'm making sure I'm clipped in. I'm looking
nice and far ahead, starting my braking now,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:12.310
then just leaning over and I'm off the brakes.
So, I mean, because of how far ahead we're

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.120
trying to look when we ride, even though I
was twenty yards away, up that hill, I was

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.529
still looking through the corner. If you could
see my face, as soon as I was off the brakes,

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:29.541
I was looking all the way down there. So we
do our braking in our straight lines so that

00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:36.609
our tires can do what they are designed to
do the most when we are cornering. So that's

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.780
two different types of corners, and two different
ways of braking.
