00:00:00.094 --> 00:00:03.718
In this game we will have Dani,
Andy and Mari, stand up, please.

00:00:03.718 --> 00:00:07.995
And in "Sap Button" they will
have to create a scene

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:10.507
in regular portuguese,
and when I ring the bell,

00:00:10.507 --> 00:00:13.982
it's like when you press the
SAP button on your remote,

00:00:13.982 --> 00:00:18.917
they change the language immediately.

00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:24.832
This language will be selected from
someone who shouts a suggestion...

00:00:26.807 --> 00:00:29.074
Tupi-guarani, what else?

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:31.283
French...

00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:36.684
We will do a fancy, pretty,
sincere language,

00:00:36.684 --> 00:00:39.586
which someone said here, the french.

00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:44.345
And the title of our scene is...

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:49.357
'I hunger for a beef cut'

00:00:49.604 --> 00:00:55.828
'I hunger for a beef cut'
is our french movie...

00:00:55.828 --> 00:00:57.500
Go!

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.939
Hey, waiter!
Hey waitress!

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:04.708
May I help you, sir?

00:01:04.708 --> 00:01:06.626
I want some be...

00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:14.548
With a lot of garlic!

00:01:14.797 --> 00:01:16.803
Got it! I'll have it sent from...

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.866
- For you!
- Deal!

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:25.977
Hey, Jorjão!

00:01:25.977 --> 00:01:27.709
Howdy, girl.

00:01:27.774 --> 00:01:30.884
Jorjão, the guy from table 12
is asking for a beef...

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.978
I'll bring it to him.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.805
Howdy, partner.
Want some beef?

00:01:43.805 --> 00:01:45.636
I want a piece...

00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:54.027
Lot of garlic!

00:01:54.027 --> 00:01:55.686
I forgot the garlic!

00:02:01.594 --> 00:02:03.496
I'll be damned,
he wants some garlic!

00:02:03.496 --> 00:02:06.472
- Holy...
- No more garlic? Anything?

00:02:06.472 --> 00:02:07.720
I think we ran out of garlic!

00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:18.997
I'll talk to him.

00:02:18.997 --> 00:02:21.264
You talk to him, girl!

00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:22.498
Excuse me, sir...

00:02:23.298 --> 00:02:24.270
We are...

00:02:29.327 --> 00:02:31.466
And a 'Coke'!

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:33.750
Girl! See if he wants some...

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:52.071
Chicken breast?

00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:01.574
Oh, ladies and gentlemen!

00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:05.932
That's really chicken breast,
right, Mari?

00:03:07.345 --> 00:03:10.694
- Mari, kick his ass!
- Are they real? I'm not sure...

00:03:10.694 --> 00:03:15.146
They are! I'm not dumb enough
to buy that stuff in this size!

00:03:16.047 --> 00:03:19.147
CIA. BARBIXAS DE HUMOR
presented

00:03:21.448 --> 00:03:27.148
IMPROVÁVEL
Probably a good show.
