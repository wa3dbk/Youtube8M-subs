00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.460
I need to know everything you know

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.824
about the Winter Hill Gang

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.660
and specifically what you know about

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.660
your former boss, and now fugitive

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:15.475
James "Whitey" Bulger.

00:00:18.145 --> 00:00:19.345
Well let's start.

00:00:23.308 --> 00:00:24.668
In the beginning...

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:26.665
Jim was a small town player.

00:00:27.848 --> 00:00:28.968
He's a very smart

00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:30.228
disciplined man.

00:00:30.623 --> 00:00:31.663
Take your shot.

00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:33.152
But make it your best,

00:00:33.152 --> 00:00:34.703
cause I get up, I eatcha.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.120
Then the next thing you know he's a damn kingpin!

00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:39.621
You know why?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.640
Because the FBI let it happen.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.640
I grew up with Jimmy

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.460
and his brother Billy, the senator.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.780
And that is a bond that doesn't get broken.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.746
Your brother is wading into some very dark waters...

00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:52.042
Jimmy's business, is Jimmy's business.

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:53.193
We all need friends.

00:00:53.883 --> 00:00:54.683
Even Jimmy.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.060
Even you.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:00.486
I can help you.

00:01:00.568 --> 00:01:02.328
Jimmy, and you can help me.

00:01:02.454 --> 00:01:03.654
It's an alliance.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.880
We'll get the FBI to fight our wars.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.479
And we do whatever we wanna do!

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:12.759
To success.

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:16.159
Just gettin' started.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.820
Boom!

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:30.639
Bulger's playing us.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.580
Makin' a fool of the bureau...

00:01:32.786 --> 00:01:33.986
We're in too deep!

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.960
And he knows it!

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.280
God help us.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.760
How come no one has nailed Whitey Bulger?

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.656
He seems to be involved in every crime in the city

00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:46.672
and yet the Bureau keeps sayin' he's clean.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:47.977
Well, what's Bulger DONE?

00:01:48.592 --> 00:01:49.632
What's he done?

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.660
Everything!

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.990
You cannot say that to me!

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.220
You're changin', John.

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.759
If he gives me his word?

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.080
He will keep it.
