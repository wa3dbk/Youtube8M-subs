00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
[Mike] Hello, I'm Mike and welcome to my flat.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.080
[Jamie] Alright?

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.580
[Jamie] Oh, come on!

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.360
[Mike] We are Barry, Ben, Jamie and Mike,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.760
[Mike] the guys from Sorted Food.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.740
[Mike] When it comes to cooking, everyone likes different things,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.000
[Mike] so today, join us in one of our homes to see what we love to eat and why.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.400
[Mike] Get ready, 'cos we're making it personal.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.320
[Mike] One of the requirements for building muscle is to eat a lot of protein.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.080
[Mike] Now, I find the only way I can do this is by having protein bars or shakes

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.800
[Mike] between meals and protein bars are really expensive,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.280
[Mike] and I find them sickly so we've come up with an amazing alternative.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.820
[Ben] Which is our own homemade version.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.720
[Mike] Yep.
[Ben] They're not too sickly,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.320
[Ben] they're  not nearly as expensive,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.400
[Ben] still do all the right things, and they're so simple to make.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.720
[Ben] To start with we need to melt down some good quality chocolate.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.100
[Ben] Now this is 85% cocoa.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.680
[Mike] That is decent!
[Ben]  It hasn't got all the extra added fat in there,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.560
[Ben] but it's amazing. It's quite bitter.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.880
[Mike] It is carbohydrates but it adds really important flavour,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.900
[Mike] and it's not many, so it's alright.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.340
[Ben]  And next, onto the bar itself,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.340
[Ben] and that starts with ground almonds so all those can go into the bowl,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.580
[Ben] along with, porridge oats.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.480
[Ben] So, a slow release of energy as well, but this is essentially the body,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.560
[Ben] to our bars.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.640
[Mike] It's what you need; if you're gonna have one of these for breakfast,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.480
[Mike] it's slow carbohydrates

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.860
[Mike] they're low G.I. index,

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.840
[Mike] oats are great.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.800
[Ben] You're not really a very morning person, are you?

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.160
[Mike] No, I'm certainly not.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.700
[Mike] So it's 6:30 in the morning.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.820
[Mike] I'm supposed to be getting up to go to the gym.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.180
[Mike] Gonna go tomorrow.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.960
[Ben] More dry ingredients and this is whey protein,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.800
[Mike] Yep.
[Ben] so that's all going to go in there as well.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.640
[Ben] Now for the flavour, okay so we've added the unflavoured stuff in there,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.600
[Ben] now we've got all sorts of crunch and textures.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.720
[Mike] Pumpkin seeds, high in zinc;

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.740
[Mike] uhh, and we've got some sesame seeds there.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.400
[Mike] Good texture. I love the flavour of sesame seeds actually, absolutely love em.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.780
[Ben] Yeah, texture, flavour, and colour.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.800
[Ben] Notice it's pecans and pumpkins, they're different colours, different textures,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.660
[Ben]  they do different jobs,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.820
[Ben] but they're all good in some way or other.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.360
[Ben] Next up, the final dry ingredient is sugar.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.440
[Ben] Not a lot, like literally like a heaped tablespoon.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.800
[Mike] Now that might look a lot to you here,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.780
[Mike] but bear in mind we're making eight bars,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.120
[Mike] so you know, that's hardly any.
[Ben] Not even a pinch of sugar.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.740
[Ben] So mix all the dry ingredients up,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.040
[Ben] and then in with the wet,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.800
[Ben] the first of which is big flavour as well:

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.580
[Ben] peanut butter.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.580
[Mike] Yeah, I was absolutely over the moon we were able to use peanut butter.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.680
[Mike] Used to eat it out of the pot.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.480
[Ben] You still do. He edits fridgecam in the office with one hand,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.960
[Ben] and eat peanut butter out of a jar in the other.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.440
[Mike] And do you know why? This is why these protein bars are gonna solve a lot of problems,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.540
[Mike] because, you know, that's really high in fat,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.660
[Mike] peanut butter, and it's unhealthy for me to eat that amount

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.580
[Mike] however, it's got such good protein,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.120
[Mike] that I find it's too easy not to do.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.340
[Mike] So these protein bars are gonna solve that problem probably,

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.160
[Ben] Control the amount of peanut butter.
[Mike] put another ten years on my life!

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.020
[Ben] Control the amount of peanut butter you eat.
[Mike] Yeah.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.660
[Ben] Actually you're just a fan of nuts in general, aren't you?

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.820
[Mike] Yeah, I am. I've got, um, nuts all over the house so I'll remember to eat them.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.160
[Ben] He's not joking.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.140
[Ben] Next up, a couple of shots of coconut oil.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.640
[Mike] You know some good facts about coconut oil, don't you?

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.320
[Ben] So I've been told, great for mineral absorption,

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.040
[Ben] so all those minerals we've put in with the nuts,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.140
[Ben] zinc and stuff like that,

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.600
[Ben] this is gonna help them get absorbed,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.140
[Ben] and, one for you,

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.000
[Ben] help protect the liver against alcohol poisoning.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.220
[Ben] With your penchant for whiskey, I think that's...

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.400
[Mike] What are you saying?
[Ben] I told you, these are personal to you, Mike,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.800
[Ben] these recipes.
[Mike] I eat sensibly and healthily in moderation.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.020
[Ben] Little bit of vanilla; more flavour. Nothing synthesised, it's nice vanilla extract,

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.260
[Ben] not essence.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.520
[Ben] And finally, milk,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.320
[Ben] and this is where it will start to get really sticky,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.140
[Ben] but the whole lot goes in,

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.080
[Mike] Okay, go for it mate.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.820
[Ben] and then you just need to squelch it together until you get one dough,

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.940
[Ben] and it should be a bit like Play Doh,

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.380
[Ben] or like a um, a pastry - when you roll out like a shortcrust pastry.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.900
[Mike] Yep.
[Ben] Just a little bit tacky, but still malleable,

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.860
[Ben] almost be able to roll it.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.560
[Mike] Right,

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.760
[Mike] this is sticky.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.420
[Ben] It is sticky.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.420
[Mike] Hey! I've suddenly acquired

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.240
[Ben] I might have brought this with me to Mike's flat.
[Mike] silicon bakeware!

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.360
[Ben] Mike doesn't have silicon bakeware in his flat.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.460
[Ben] I brought that with me but it's really easy for making this in,

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.660
[Ben] cos it's easier sort of getting them out once they've set up.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.780
[Ben] So push that in, push it in to all the corners.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.360
[Ben] The final bit, if you've got really sticky fingers,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.720
[Ben] just a clean wet hand,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.400
[Ben] and already that looks good.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.560
[Ben] Last thing is our chocolate,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.720
[Ben] and just dribble that all the way over the top,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.240
[Ben] spread it right to the edges,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.880
[Ben] and job done. You just let the whole thing set up.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.200
[Ben] There we go. They've had a couple of hours to set up in the fridge.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.280
[Ben] We've sliced them up into eight, which you said you wanted;

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.900
[Ben] quite chunky.
[Mike] You need a lot of protein in each bar,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.640
[Mike]  so yeah, definitely. I'm behind that.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.100
[Ben] Perfect. So there we go, our version of protein bars.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.100
[Ben] Not too sickly, definitely not too expensive,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.220
[Ben] hopefully damn tasty...

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.540
[Ben] Sorted.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.400
[Ben] I've said they taste good, now you gotta prove it.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.800
[Mike]  Perfect.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.180
[Mike]  Absolutely perfect.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.480
[Mike] The thing I like about those,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.460
[Mike] they don't overwhelm you with  sweetness,

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.660
[Mike] there's no caramel, there's no sugar in there,

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.860
[Mike]  there's just the dark chocolate.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.860
[Mike]  They're perfect.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.860
[Ben] Which is exactly the idea, very very personal to you.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.260
[Ben] You asked for them, we delivered.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.060
[Mike] You sure did.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.240
[Ben] What we wanna know now, is what would you guys consider your most personal food;

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.240
[Ben] the thing that's most suitable to you.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.500
[Ben] Comment below, and perhaps we can get on to making it.
