00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:16.199
When I have to choose a topic on my own,
I go ahead and I look at current events.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.100
I see what’s a more popular trending topic
at the time.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.366
And if there’s something in there
that really interests me,
then I’ll go ahead and pick one of those.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.700
I usually will find the thing,
something that interests me the most.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.100
And then I’ll find something that has
the most resources available.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:37.333
I usually pick something that uh...
that I want to learn about.

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:44.132
I always start in Google.
You know, the general idea.
And you can narrow it down from there.

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:47.533
Or, start with the article databases online.

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:54.132
And you have your general idea.
Then you can start
to narrow it down to the specifics.

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.566
I just think for a little while
and daydream. And whatever is

00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:01.399
the most interesting thing that comes up;
that’s what I go for.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.400
I try to um, write on topics that
are actually, genuinely interesting to me.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.066
Not just the things that have
the most information about ‘em, 

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.532
because...everybody 
has already discussed that.

00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:18.432
If your instructor does not give you
a list of topics to choose from, um...

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:26.466
then I would come to the library
and talk to a reference librarian
to talk about possible topics.

00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:30.266
Or even the Learning Center
is a good resource for that.

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:34.133
Without a topic to choose from,
I do have a harder time. 

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:38.633
I usually like to talk to my instructor
about it anyway.

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:43.699
And just kind a play off of each other.
See what we can kind of figure out
that I might be interested in.

00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:51.266
Look at the broad topic
and then, I would try to find which subtopic
has the most information on it.

00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:52.932
And then, I would go off of that.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.100
Do something that you’re interested in.
You put more effort into it

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.800
and your results
typically are a little bit better.
