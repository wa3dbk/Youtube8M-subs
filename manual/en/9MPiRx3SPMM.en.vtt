00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.570
I'm Dave Micklos of the Dolan DNA Learning Center of Cold Spring Laboratory. 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.710
Transposable elements, or transposons, are the so-called jumping genes   

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.820
that can move from one chromosome spot to another. 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.490
First discovered here in the 1950s by Barbara McClintock,   

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.000
transposable elements are now known to be the most common feature

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.640
of plant and animal chromosomes. 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.160
Scientists have long wondered about the effect all of this jumping around. 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.810
 However, it has been very difficult to catch transposons in the act of jumping. 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.530
Most are, in fact, molecular fossils - meaning that they jumped to 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.760
their present positions millions of year ago and are no longer active. 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.050
Working in rice, scientists in United States and Japan   

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.810
now have had the good luck of catching a transposon in a burst of activity   

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.200
that produces about 40 new jumps per plant. 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.420
And the surprising result of all of this jumping - very little harm to the plant,   

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.850
because the transposon seems to be programmed to avoid 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.850
jumping into active genes. 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.370
In fact, frequent landings nearby to genes often increased their activity or 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.170
potentially made the genes responsive to stressful conditions,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.170
such salt and cold. 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.340
I talked with Sue Wessler of the University of Georgia about what this all means. 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.580
There are some plants like normal plants like lilies or irises -   

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.950
98% of their DNAs  derive from transposable elements. 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.990
So, what is their function? 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.240
I mean I think now, with some of our most recent results   

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and some results from other labs,   

00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:42.930
they clearly have a role in diversifying the genetic material   

00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:49.000
whether that sort of just a by-product and it probably is,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.320
I mean, it is not like their purpose. 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.190
Their purpose is to survive, is to get through and get to the next generation, 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.000
and the way they do that is they have to keep their host alive

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:02.420
to live and reproduce,  

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.920
so a good element is one that does not harm its host,   

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.700
so that is the fun, that is the fun part about studying element   

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.240
because what we are studying are successful elements 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.440
and successful elements act in very subtle ways.  

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.800
So transposable elements are almost perfect genetic parasites -   

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.450
silently using the chromosomes of other organisms to perpertuate their kind. 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.240
As a byproduct of the jumping,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.000
it appears that transposons may even help their hosts 

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.980
and themselves to survive tough times.
