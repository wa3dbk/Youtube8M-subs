00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.248
The Sioux mod - there are tipis and Buffalo
resources - get ready to re-write history

00:00:03.248 --> 00:00:05.008
Salt plains - a ooo ooo!

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:07.937
I know, I know, I know, how can you lose?

00:00:07.937 --> 00:00:12.477
This area is perfect for living-in - bring
in more Citizens

00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:15.348
Southern jungles are dark and foreboding

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:18.208
Eastern sand dunes are enticing

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:19.978
Suddenly M-town

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:23.808
And Rome is below - why must Rome be below

00:00:23.808 --> 00:00:26.368
Roman cities appear with each turn

00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:28.678
Chances are Augustus will attack

00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:30.248
Hello religion!

00:00:30.248 --> 00:00:32.097
Bulk up to Hulk up

00:00:32.097 --> 00:00:35.707
And Settle away from the coast to defend from
Roman boats of terror

00:00:35.707 --> 00:00:39.548
I’m just trying to get some land before
Rome takes it all!

00:00:39.548 --> 00:00:40.878
You don’t understand

00:00:40.878 --> 00:00:43.847
We need Yankton - and they need food

00:00:43.847 --> 00:00:46.768
The Roman empire exists within the Sioux’s

00:00:46.768 --> 00:00:49.687
Machu Picchu makes everything better

00:00:49.687 --> 00:00:53.108
And this guy has ideas for a Church of Happiness

00:00:53.108 --> 00:00:54.427
The herd is moving!

00:00:54.427 --> 00:00:56.257
Spread the population

00:00:56.257 --> 00:00:58.667
That Engineer gets his time to shine

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:01.427
Glad to be not at war with the Purple People

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:03.198
The mountains keep us safe!

00:01:03.198 --> 00:01:05.698
The ocean is dangerous and scary

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:08.717
These Missionaries are for the other guy’s
religion

00:01:08.717 --> 00:01:10.878
It took 30 turns to get the Grand Temple started

00:01:10.878 --> 00:01:14.427
Marble’s now available to be quarried

00:01:14.427 --> 00:01:15.688
Anything to make ‘em smile

00:01:15.688 --> 00:01:18.088
Rome, everywhere

00:01:18.088 --> 00:01:21.588
And a Strong Heart in one turn - he’ll be
put through a lot

00:01:21.588 --> 00:01:25.338
His first task: disconnect the Roman empire

00:01:25.338 --> 00:01:27.238
City-Connections are for the Sioux only

00:01:27.238 --> 00:01:32.448
The Stock Exchange is almost done - likelihood
of war increases

00:01:32.448 --> 00:01:33.798
Trade while we can!

00:01:33.798 --> 00:01:35.978
Erect a tower of Science

00:01:35.978 --> 00:01:38.168
Gotta dig for our lives

00:01:38.168 --> 00:01:40.128
And write about the good ol’ days

00:01:40.128 --> 00:01:42.368
Two writers are better than one

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:45.707
Pretty sure that Isaacs guy will die of Malaria
in 1895 - very sad

00:01:45.707 --> 00:01:49.518
By then there’ll be more votes

00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:52.298
I don’t want your support, dude

00:01:52.298 --> 00:01:54.768
Opera Houses for that Hermitage thing

00:01:54.768 --> 00:01:57.137
Keep a Great General on the back-burner

00:01:57.137 --> 00:01:58.647
Adopt Order

00:01:58.647 --> 00:02:01.418
Go for the Castle of Mad Happiness

00:02:01.418 --> 00:02:02.788
See how mad he is?

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:06.867
Augustus is like “I’ll give you Open Borders”
so I say ok

00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:12.447
Ethiopia is like Embargo Rome - so I say ok
ok ok ok ok

00:02:12.447 --> 00:02:15.518
The Kremlin can be sped-up with a Great Engineer

00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:18.358
If only there could be Kremlins 2: The New
Batch

00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:21.768
Thinkin’ about finishing Rationalism

00:02:21.768 --> 00:02:25.678
And an Eiffel Tower - it’s good to not be
fighting Rome

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:26.898
Everywhere you look is Rome

00:02:26.898 --> 00:02:29.068
I have to say no to him

00:02:29.068 --> 00:02:31.268
We say yes to Science

00:02:31.268 --> 00:02:33.818
And Hotels - nothing bad happens at hotels

00:02:33.818 --> 00:02:37.507
Yay - a thriving empire during a Golden Age

00:02:37.507 --> 00:02:41.397
Nothing can go wrong when you build up, not
out

00:02:41.397 --> 00:02:43.268
But - there was thriving

00:02:43.268 --> 00:02:46.598
Dear Augustus: please go to war with Ethiopia

00:02:46.598 --> 00:02:48.828
Divert resources to warfare

00:02:48.828 --> 00:02:52.727
The wild west won’t be won just yet - well,
maybe by Rome

00:02:52.727 --> 00:02:54.028
He has bigger problems

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:56.557
We’ll have big ballistics

00:02:56.557 --> 00:02:58.378
Supplant the host!

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:02.128
Borrow some Uranium - knew that Great General
would be useful

00:03:02.128 --> 00:03:05.108
Now all we gotta do is not be overthrown by
the Romans

00:03:05.108 --> 00:03:07.648
They - have a navy

00:03:07.648 --> 00:03:09.908
We have a lighthouse

00:03:09.908 --> 00:03:11.458
And a Hubble due to faith

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:14.787
It’s the 70’s and they don’t know we
have The Bomb yet

00:03:14.787 --> 00:03:17.048
Be very afraid!

00:03:17.048 --> 00:03:18.048
Even Rome

00:03:18.048 --> 00:03:20.178
What do they have to be scared of?

00:03:20.178 --> 00:03:22.477
360 degrees of Rome

00:03:22.477 --> 00:03:26.757
The Internet plus a National Visitor Center
means Tourism goes up

00:03:26.757 --> 00:03:29.427
International Space Station is attempted

00:03:29.427 --> 00:03:31.837
Not even half the hammers Rome put in

00:03:31.837 --> 00:03:34.468
Luckily he fears The Bomb

00:03:34.468 --> 00:03:35.628
And our majestic Castles

00:03:35.628 --> 00:03:38.028
Can’t attack a Castle!

00:03:38.028 --> 00:03:40.458
What on Earth is going on down there?

00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:42.837
Seems to be a tad radioactive

00:03:42.837 --> 00:03:44.197
Fallout for all!

00:03:44.197 --> 00:03:47.358
The thing is - peace isn’t forever

00:03:47.358 --> 00:03:50.397
We need to focus on fighting Ethiopia

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:51.608
So sell Rome a city

00:03:51.608 --> 00:03:55.507
Ethiopia’s navy is rendered useless

00:03:55.507 --> 00:03:57.708
And he knows we have nukes

00:03:57.708 --> 00:03:59.667
And Giant Death Robots

00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:02.078
So ya - time to just march into Ethiopia

00:04:02.078 --> 00:04:04.828
Claim it in the name of our forefathers

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.798
It’s not a scary place at all

00:04:06.798 --> 00:04:10.638
It’s got Whales - they’ve seen better
days though

00:04:10.638 --> 00:04:11.778
The war doesn’t stop

00:04:11.778 --> 00:04:14.478
And XCOMs put up a fight

00:04:14.478 --> 00:04:16.827
But no cities are taken

00:04:16.827 --> 00:04:19.658
Rome wears our jeans - must be under the robe

00:04:19.658 --> 00:04:23.958
Ethiopia will be too, in just over 1700 turns

00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.267
Speed that up with more XCOMs

00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:28.588
Whatever the fox says can’t be said anymore

00:04:28.588 --> 00:04:29.808
Oy!

00:04:29.808 --> 00:04:31.267
Rome went to space

00:04:31.267 --> 00:04:33.797
Hola Esteban - do the concert thing

00:04:33.797 --> 00:04:37.107
It’d be great if Ethiopia was weak

00:04:37.107 --> 00:04:40.948
They have Culture-creation that defends against
Tourists

00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:42.688
But things are calm!

00:04:42.688 --> 00:04:46.357
Making money to fund the effort - then more
war

00:04:46.357 --> 00:04:47.848
Everything gets violent

00:04:47.848 --> 00:04:50.607
Giant Death Robots cause a bit of death

00:04:50.607 --> 00:04:51.848
Not enough though

00:04:51.848 --> 00:04:53.918
Rome seems to have the right amount of men

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:55.818
Feel good about intimidation

00:04:55.818 --> 00:04:59.898
How do I… deal with attacking Rome, or being
attacked?

00:04:59.898 --> 00:05:03.808
I’d like to live to see Influential numbers
- too much to ask?

00:05:03.808 --> 00:05:07.528
Seems the screenshot occurred at the wrong
time, we’ll say it was Cher

00:05:07.528 --> 00:05:11.387
Roman workers head to what used to be Ethiopia
to clean things up

00:05:11.387 --> 00:05:13.038
Like ants

00:05:13.038 --> 00:05:15.408
But ants are actually organized

00:05:15.408 --> 00:05:17.667
Rome is very - haphazard

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:19.758
Carthage has Big Ben!

00:05:19.758 --> 00:05:21.128
2078 AD

00:05:21.128 --> 00:05:23.208
Someone tripped and fell on the launch button

00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:25.188
Purple looks best with orange

00:05:25.188 --> 00:05:28.148
XCOMs can land and ruin the tiles

00:05:28.148 --> 00:05:30.797
The improvements don’t stand a chance

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:32.827
Ahhhh retaliation!

00:05:32.827 --> 00:05:34.978
Goodbye Polder - it’s been nice

00:05:34.978 --> 00:05:36.998
This is definitely not paradise

00:05:36.998 --> 00:05:39.987
Be unreasonably reasonable and distribute
fear equally

00:05:39.987 --> 00:05:43.568
Someone’s been selling cities to Carthage

00:05:43.568 --> 00:05:47.017
A sneaky tactic but prevents Rome from taking
EVERYTHING

00:05:47.017 --> 00:05:50.478
Ignore the red arrow of destruction and check
out those deer!

00:05:50.478 --> 00:05:53.447
I hope they don’t develop super powers

00:05:53.447 --> 00:05:57.878
Too late - they have, and from three separate
universes, no less

00:05:57.878 --> 00:06:00.528
This red arrow of destruction is trouble for
anything nearby

00:06:00.528 --> 00:06:02.468
Kabloowy

00:06:02.468 --> 00:06:05.398
Goodbye Sioux - it’s been nice!

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:07.408
Every “Next Turn” is tense

00:06:07.408 --> 00:06:08.848
And the game kept on playing…

00:06:08.848 --> 00:06:09.848
Game Over

00:06:09.848 --> 00:06:11.358
I hope Enzo and Bob find a way out.
