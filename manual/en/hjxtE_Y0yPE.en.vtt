How To Overcome Adversity
This video on how to overcome adversity is

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.700
the next segment of a series of trainings
for coaches to learn how to teach mental toughness

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.450
to their athletes.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.760
Resilience is being able to bounce back from
adversity.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.810
This is huge.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:36.020
Here’s the thing, when kids think of their
screw ups, their failures, it’s a direct

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.370
shock to their identity.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.699
They think it is the end of the world when
they don’t perform well.

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.579
Think about this…Have you ever lost a job
or involuntary, for whatever reason, had to

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.949
leave a job?

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:59.100
Think about that and your house getting repossessed
all in the same day.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.309
Multiply that times five and that is what
kids are feeling throughout the day most of

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:04.699
the time when they make mistakes.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.400
So how do we help them get back?

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.659
I call it, Get Some Height.

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:19.060
Basically, it comes down to helping an athlete
see a bigger perspective or a longer term

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.180
perspective.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.540
This is where us adults are really good because
we got 30, 40, 50 years behind us.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.009
We are able to look back with perspective
and realize it’s not what happens to you,

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:39.170
it’s how you react to what happens to you
that is important.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.020
As a coach, you guys are like gods to your
athletes.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.829
I think most coaches underestimate the power
they have over kids.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:55.369
I have listened to many adults who will tell
me the most powerful thing that ever happened

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.340
to them was when a coach back in their high
school or junior high said x, y, z to them

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.340
and how it made a big difference.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.840
I hear this over and over.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.999
So it is important to say things like, “I
believe in you.

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:13.380
You know, okay, this meet didn’t go so well
for you this weekend.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.570
I get that.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.570
I hear you.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.300
What do you need to get out and improve next
time?

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.300
I believe in you.”

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.569
You can go on to say, “Now… let’s take
a look at what this means in the bigger picture,

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.680
in the longer term.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.650
I see you learning from this, building yourself
back up from your learning, redoubling the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.040
drills we worked on.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.150
I’ll help you, work through this.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.540
You might need to really focus on your mental
game.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.200
I see you then taking this and running with
it.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.480
I see you going to the college level because
of this.”
