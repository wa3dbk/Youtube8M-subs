Hello, This is the Home Screen Camera,
the spy camera for android phones.

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:17.529
As you can see this looks like some kind
of normal home screen, but this is a

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.899
Virtual home screen.

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.279
Here the gallery icon works as the view-
finder of digital camera.

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.360
And if you tap on home screen anywhere,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.220
It takes picture with no sound, no flash
lights.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.940
And it has more features like swiping screen
like real home screen.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:50.860
If you swipe to left, view-finder would be hidden,
and swiping to right, the black screen mode comes on.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.680
Tap on the screen any where and take a picture,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.590
and the photos would be saved into the gallery.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.650
It works in same way on hiding view-finder mode

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.260
and black screen mode.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:19.969
Tap anywhere and take a picture with no sound,
no flash lights.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.780
It's time to go back to real home screen.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.040
Let's see pictures in our gallery.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.630
Here is pictures we've taken.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.720
Let's see.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.009
Ok.

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:12.009
Let's go back to Home Screen Camera.

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:14.999
Wellãƒ»

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.049
Here is fake facebook widget,

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:23.269
but doesn't work.

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:34.659
and the G-mail icon works as sending feedback
to us, and the market icon works as showing our apps on android market.

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.430
our team is working for adding

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.399
the calling screen mode

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:51.089
and web browser screen mode.

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:58.319
thank you for watching this, home screen camera.
