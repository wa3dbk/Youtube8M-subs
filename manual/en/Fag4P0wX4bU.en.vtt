00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.680
Lammas may be the first UK ecovillage

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.760
setting up with planning permission

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.760
but some people have been doing this

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.760
for years.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.800
We've come here to Tinkers Bubble in Somerset

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.800
to do some research.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.080
Tinkers Bubble is a low impact project

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.040
which has some things in common

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.040
with what we are trying to do

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.500
in Pembrokeshire.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.040
My name is Mary Dearling

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.040
and I live at Tinkers Bubble

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.500
in south Somerset, and that's here.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.000
It's a 40 acre site

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.880
Two thirds of it are woodland

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.220
and also on the land, there are orchards,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.360
mostly Bramley orchards now,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.800
and pasture and gardens.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.720
There's a spring on the land

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.560
and the spring flows down through

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.560
the beautiful broad leaf woodland

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.560
and it comes out by the road.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.200
And there's a little waterfall there.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.320
And that's where the name Tinkers Bubble comes from

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.320
because it's where the gypsies used to bring

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.680
their horses to water them.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.000
And the gypsy word for a spring or a waterfall

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
is a bubble, sometimes,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.440
so that became Tinkers Bubble.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.880
We produce quite a few tings here at the Bubble.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.520
There's the timber, there's the apples.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.600
Vegetables - Pete, in particular and now Dean.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.640
They grow vegetables and we sell those

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.760
at farmers' markets

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.800
or to a local vegetable wholesaler.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.800
And they distribute them on.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.280
Dave makes chairs, very fine chairs,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.720
and sells those.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.000
There's the cows.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.680
With the milk from Millie

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.680
mostly we get through it ourselves,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.000
either as milk, yoghurt, cheese.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.280
Sometimes we make butter,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.280
but it's a but of a palaver.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.640
Time for breakfast.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.000
I make medicinal herbal products,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and sell those.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Balms and slaves and tinctures.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I also am very into elderflowers

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.800
and the whole elder tree.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.840
And I make elderflower cordial

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.840
and elderflower champagne.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.600
When everybody first came here,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.600
the locals were extremely worried

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.600
and I think their fears were very understandable.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.600
And when we said we want

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.600
a  low impact farming settlement

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.500
they couldn't understand.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.640
Obviously, they knew about farming

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.600
they didn't know what low impact meant,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.040
I don't even know if the phrase had been coined then.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.720
And the idea of a group of people

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.120
running it together - it was unknown.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.600
There were a few local people -

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.200
they must have been fairly visionary-

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.500
they could imagine

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500
what this was going to be about.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.680
And they said "Give us a chance".

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.680
We held in there.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.840
The numbers went down to about

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.840
8 or so people at that stage.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.040
that really intended to stay here

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.040
and work the land.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.640
And then time just proved

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.000
what we were about.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.040
Time and a huge amount of hard work.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.960
And now, I think they're quite proud of us.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.200
I think some of them think we're a bit nutty.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.200
That's ok.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.840
They're probably right.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.120
I think they quite like having us here.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.120
And we are now a real part

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.120
of the local community,
