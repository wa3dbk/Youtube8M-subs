00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.460
On Monday, April 28 2014, the seventh grade of Laugalækjarskóli went,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.580
along with the seventh grade of Ölduselsskóli, on a trip to the Reykjaskóli School Camp.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.180
After giving it a lot of thought, I decided to go with the kids

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.180
but decided that I should record a documentary on the trip,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.300
to help others decide for themselves whether they want to go there.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.900
When we arrived, most of our time went to getting everything set up

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.860
so there isn't a lot to show from the first day.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.860
However, there are recordings of the kvöldvaka (evening program).

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.260
There is a kvöldvaka (an evening program) daily at Reykjaskóli.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.500
During it people perform, play games and more.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.140
In the beginning of every kvöldvaka, the School Camp Song is sung.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.340
On Tuesday we visited the Folk Museum.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.340
It shows how people lived in the old farmer community at Reykir

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.980
and also tackles shark hunting.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.180
After that we had natural science class.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.980
We went to the coast and got some conches, seaweed and more.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.780
After that we went inside and examined everything we brought from the coast.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.580
The kvöldvaka was similar to the last one,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.060
more games and fun performances.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.260
On Wednesday we, amongst other things, played a game

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.300
in which we had to answer questions on certain stations to get to the next ones.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.580
Sadly, this was not recorded, however the kvöldvaka was.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.220
On Thursday, the next to last day, we could do pretty much what we wanted almost all day.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.500
In the afternoon, however, the weekly Boy's Hairstyling Competition was held.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.060
In that competition, girls style the hair of the boys who participate.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.580
but it turned out to be a lot more than just a hair styling competition.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.740
The participants then competed in a fashion show.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.500
This time the kvöldvaka was different, it was a discothèque.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.580
But darkness doesn't suit cameras very well.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.500
On Friday we packed up all our stuff, because we were leaving.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.500
At noon we headed to Reykjavík and arrived at Laugalækjarskóli at two o'clock.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.020
Most, if not all the kids were very happy with the trip to the Reykir School Camp.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.780
Thanks for a good time.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.380
