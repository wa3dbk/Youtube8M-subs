00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
A highlight at the EMO 2011 at SCHUNK...

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
... is the new VERO-S mini.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
NSE mini the world's flattest Quick-Change Pallet System...

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
... with a height of 20 mm. The unit is suitable for small... 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
...machines, and light metal cutting tasks.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Due to the compact design, and the patented concept...

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
...it is excellently suitable for direct workpiece clamping.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Workpieces can be flexibly adjusted at the machining table...

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
...via direct clamping modules.
00:59:00,00:01:02
All-sided maching is possible.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
There are no interfering contours of the chuck jaw or similar.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The NSE mini also complements the SCHUNK modular system.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
A particularity: the 2-way clamping station.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
With 2 clamping modules and a gauge for bore holes of 100 mm...

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
...the clamping station can be extended as often as desired.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Every clamping station has an integrated turbo function.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Clamping of the pallets is done self-locking via spring force. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Due to the combination of standard components...

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
...from the modular system, NSE mini can be quickly...

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
...and flexibly adjusted to its clamping task. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
No matter if centric clamping vice or empty claming pallet...

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
...NSE mini offers the flexible clamping solution ...

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
...for light cutting tasks on small machine tools.
