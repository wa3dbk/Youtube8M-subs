00:00:09.568 --> 00:00:11.628
Hey everyone!

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.100
Jaystepher with Snowman by Lego Creator.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.760
Set number 30197.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.480
Contains 60 pieces.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.360
Recommended building ages are 6 through 12.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.580
So it looks like we get to make an awesome snowman.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.940
The set is packaged in a polybag.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.400
Let's open up the package.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.520
The parts are packed loose.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.740
One folded instruction manual

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.480
and several elements.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.640
So it looks like we got some snow here to build the snowman.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.860
Let's see what it looks like all assembled.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.320
This is one nice snowman.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.300
First thing we're going to notice is the orange nose cone

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.160
that represents a carrot for his nose.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.960
The eyes are printed.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.240
Yes!

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.940
Those elements are printed.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.900
He's got some buttons

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.900
and a hat.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.000
I like the broom.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.260
It's just a simple aerial on a jumper plate

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.760
with a profile brick.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.760
Nice contour for the body.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.380
Here's the rear.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.220
Nothing exciting going on.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.600
I like how the hat flops off to the side.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.840
Really clever.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.360
The arms do move.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.960
Really clever design.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.760
In addition, there are five extra elements.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.340
So we get one extra eye,

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.480
two studs,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.080
a 1 by 1 plate,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.080
and an extra arm.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.160
These pieces my come in handy for other projects.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.140
So this conclude the review for the Snowman by Lego Creator.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.360
