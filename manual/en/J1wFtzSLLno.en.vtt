description down below

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.789
so guys today WWE pay back

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.289
we got Seth Rollins worse Roman reigns
was de niro's was Randy Orton

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.380
form the I'll

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.430
world WWE World Heavyweight Championship
now

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.350
let's be honest here I know the
stipulation is

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.450
15 I if Cain I

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.780
doesn't let set rollins win if he
doesn't help him win

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.450
then basically it's going to come down
to the fact that Cain is going to be

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.440
fired as director of operations as per
triple

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.960
H and that's what's going to happen but

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.539
I don't know like it it's pay-back so I

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.020
don't know if they're gonna change hands
with the title I mean

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.049
I such rawlins is have the title since

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.600
WrestleMania I couldn't really see them
switching the title but you know what

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.250
sometimes it's better to be surprised to
be perfectly honest but

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.229
I'm gonna go ahead and make a prediction
saying that shit Rollins is still going

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.439
to retain the title

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.100
but I don't know we're definitely gonna
see it came face turned very very soon

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.020
are to say the very least but we're
gonna sing

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.600
we'll see what happens at this guy's
I'll arm I'm really

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.479
I'm really think in that we're gonna see
something interesting in this match

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.520
Lee some being hopeful about it so

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.770

below who you think is gonna win this

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.189
