00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.240
Colorado Northwestern Community College has an aviation maintenance program that

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.500
will help you in airframe and the powerplant area.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.849
The program at CNCC is a two year program

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.400
for airframe and powerplant. We offer

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.480
a couple of different options for students. One would be

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.470
just a straight FAA certificate for an airframe and powerplant,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.070
and we also offer a degree.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.320
It's an associate of applied science. It's

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.680
15 hours of General Studies beyond the

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.930
airframe and powerplant curriculum.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.400
The way the program is set up is that it's very well set up. It's actually broken down into

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.829
what you need. So if you only want to do

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.359
part of your program you can actually do just the program.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:08.750
It's also set up so that if you're going for a degree like an associates degree

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.570
you can actually do that in this part of the program also. A lot of other places - they kind of mix

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.570
things up sooner,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.750
and you're not really done with the chunk until you're done with all of it, so it's a little less convenient that way.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.190
Since we are an FAA certified school,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.649
we need to offer courses in three areas: general

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.410
courses are for any mechanic. It's the basics. It's

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.860
math. Its basic electricity and things like that.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.069
Once you have those down, then we go to

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.700
airframe, and in airframe we start off with structures, so you'll be working with sheet metal.

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:50.910
We do have a welding course. We have a woods course.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.509
Once you are finished with the structures, then we move into

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.789
the system, so you'll be working with the electrical systems, the navigation systems,

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.789
all the various systems on the aircraft.

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.140
At that point, you will be finished with airframe, and you can test

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.050
and get your airframe certificate.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.010
The second year, the first semester of

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.270
powerplant, is piston powerplant. So

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.569
they're your low-crawling engine, and in the second semester,

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:30.100
you'll be working on terms. That sequence seems to work really well, and

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.570
you actually get finished twice - once airframe and once powerplant.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.170
There's a lot of one-on-one time with the instructors, and instructors

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.200
are a lot of fun. They're pretty laid back. They're all very approachable.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.769
They are all very knowledgeable.
There are two instructions for the program

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.510
and they're very small classes.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.000
I talk with both of my teachers on a daily basis with anything I am having issues with.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.109
The instructors there are very knowledgeable. They are

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:06.100
ready, willing to help you, give the extra time, be here on a weekend if you need a little help

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.560
if you're struggling with something,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.790
and that's what you need. Our graduates are qualified to work on

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.930
any aircraft in the United States but

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.200
the ANP license or the airframe and powerplant license is a license to learn.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.560
So you go out and

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.000
learn more about what the business is and you can then specialize.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.770
I've heard everything from

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.280
wind turbine powerplants to

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.600
actually working on planes to working on carnival rides. There's

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.040
a lot of different variety. I've had students go to

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.530
helicopter operations, both as mechanics and as pilots,

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.060
working their way into that scene. They go the

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.090
commuter airlines, and some of them work on

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.830
into the major airlines. Many of them also go to small

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.010
fixed-base-operators (FBOs), and

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.050
at an FBO you'll be working on anything comes in that door.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.390
It's a great variety. If you're looking for an

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.540
economical way to get an education, I think Rangely is the place to be.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.680
We encourage you to come and visit the college,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.320
sit down, talk to financial aid, look at what funding opportunities are available,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.320
and check out the facilities where you may be spending the next two years of your life.
