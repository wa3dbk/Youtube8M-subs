00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.300
Each and every year,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.960
the Office of Admissions hosts approximately
70,000 visitors

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.350
from across the country and around the world.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.550
And the Admissions Reception is the front
door to the university.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.530
We wanted a first-rate facility

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.160
in order to welcome prospective students into the BU family.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.789
Well, I think the biggest need that this facility provides is space.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.160
We have an opportunity now

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.590
to showcase what BU has to offer for the families.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.870
As you're sitting in the meeting area,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.320
you get a northerly view of the river and
the DeWolfe Boathouse.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.350
You can look west and see the law school.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.770
You can also take a look at Bay State Road.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.840
So it gives you a sense of what BU is right
in the heart of campus.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.660
Additionally, it gives us an opportunity to
have media,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.250
which is something that wasn't always possible before.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.300
One of the really cool things that guests
have here

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.000
is the multimedia available to them.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.649
From the very beginning,

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.390
they get to touch different computers that
access rich videos

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.110
of students on campus,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.760
how they live their daily lives,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.449
what is it like going to classes.

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.110
So it's ways for students to engage

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.450
in things that we can't necessarily show on
a tour,

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.319
if it's a program abroad or in a research
lab.

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:14.639
And as part of our presentation,

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:18.759
we have included BU fun facts, history, trivia

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.590
as well as two videos that help students envision themselves at BU.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.409
Without a doubt, we are using technology,

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:27.539
but personal connections

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.920
and interaction with staff

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.920
and with our students, ambassadors

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.819
still matters greatly to us.

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:35.599
I mean, we've moved up the street,

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:37.479
but at the same time, our mission is the same.

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.950
It's to help welcome everyone to our university

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.170
and help the students feel like they could
belong here,

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.909
they could be a student at BU.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.380
The campus visit experience is the number
one tool

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.139
that students use to decide if a college is
a good fit.

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:50.999
And I think coming down here,

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:53.630
taking advantage of the program that we offer in this space,

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.859
will help students understand what BU could really offer them.
