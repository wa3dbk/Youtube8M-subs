00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.700
Ideal for ounce counting through hikers, adventure
racers, ultra marathoners or any outdoor enthusiast

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.009
looking for streamlined performance, Black
Diamond Distance Carbon Z Poles are lightweight

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.350
and incredibly collapsible.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.980
Let’s take a closer look at these innovative
trekking poles.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.310
The Distance Carbon Z Trekking Poles differ
from traditional trekking poles in that they

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.120
don’t have a telescoping design where the
shaft sections collapse inside the shaft section

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.120
above it.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.110
Instead it is more of a folding, collapsible
design.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.920
There is cording that connects all of the
shaft sections.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.489
By extending that grip and clicking that into
place you have got a rigid, but fixed length

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:49.489
trekking pole.

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.870
So you don’t have any range of adjustability.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.570
Because of that, you have got incredibly light
weight poles.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.670
But it does mean you have got to select the
fixed length that will fit you best.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:09.470
Black Diamond does give you options there,
so you have got 100, 110, 120 or 130 centimeter

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.790
fixed length options to choose from.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.750
I have got the 120 centimeter poles here.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.470
They weigh just 10 ounces for the pair and
when collapsed they are only 16 inches in

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.110
length, so significantly lighter, significantly
smaller when collapsed than traditional trekking

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.450
poles.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.530
The poles are equipped with EVA foam grips.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.850
You can see that there are some cutaways here.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.000
It actually gives it a little bit of texture
and some ergonomics, so it feels that much

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.870
better in the hand, but it also helps to cut
down on weight.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.820
So, again, you have got that streamlined,
weight saving, thought process in every construction

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.390
feature on these trekking poles.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.230
There is a slight extension of the foam here
below the standard grip.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.990
It let’s you grab the pole at a slightly
different height, depending, again, on how

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.580
you are traveling, a side hill or up and down
slopes.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.950
You have got fixed length poles.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.610
You don’t have that adjustability.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.360
But you can change a little bit where you
are grabbing the poles to find it a little

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.850
more comfortable on varying grades or on changes
in the severity of slopes.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.530
You do also have, again, very lightweight
wrist straps here on the end of the grip.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.892
So it helps to take some of the strain off
your wrists on long days on the trail or if

00:02:31.892 --> 00:02:36.030
you are using these for running, you know,
as you are pounding away.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.850
This helps to alleviate some of the repetitive
stress on your wrists.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:49.290
There is some adjustability built in, a small
Velcro tab there that lets you make some modifications

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.810
to the fit of that so it is most comfortable
for you.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.530
At the other end of the poles is where you
will find Flex Tech tips, the Z pole Flex

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.530
Tech tips.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.319
There is a small diameter basket here.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.740
If you are in slightly softer surfaces the
poles may want to sink in a little bit into

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.740
the ground.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.520
That slows their progress so you can spring
off of the poles and be on your way before

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.870
they sink too deeply.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.170
Standard with the poles you have got in play
a rubber tip on the end here.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.250
That this best on rock or on improved surfaces,
but it is a threaded design.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.480
You can actually remove that and put in its
place the carbide tip which is also included.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.959
So, again, threads right into place, confidently
stays where you need it to.

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.660
This would give you better purchase on trails
or on dirt.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.130
Again, you have got the versatility with both
of those tip ends included and the ability

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.319
to swap them out.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.709
With Black Diamond Distance Carbon Z Trekking
Poles you have got that great combination

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.980
of collapsibility and light weight construction.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.420
It makes it a nice option for through hikers,
ounce counting adventure racers or ultra marathoners.
