"My name is Paul Sandberg.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm an actor, teacher and singer in the New
York City area.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.589
For more information, please visit my website
at paulsandberg.net.

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:15.429
""O come all ye faithful

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.020
Joyful and triumphant

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:28.050
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.900
Come and behold Him

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.460
Born the King of angels

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.989
O come, let us adore Him

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.489
O come, let us adore Him

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:48.829
O come, let us adore Him

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:56.720
Christ, the Lord""

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.280
That was ""Come all ye faithful"", a beautiful
song that can be broken down into surprisingly

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.350
four main chords.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:14.980
Those chords being G, A-minor, C and D. Now,
you can play those chords straight out with

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:28.070
the look like, G, A-minor, C and D. You can
also make your life a little bit easier by

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.930
playing the roots of those chores in your
left hand.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.710
Now, that would look like, starting with your
pinky on the G, your ring finger on the A,

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:46.030
uh let's go for index finger on the C, ending
with the thumb on the D. Now, with this hand

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.800
right there, you're ready to add in the melody.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.840
But before we add in the melody, I would like
to point out one lyric that always catches

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.159
my ear, and that's at, ""O come, let us adore
Him.""

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.980
It's so easy to accidentally say, ""O come
let us"", as in like, ""The green leafy vegetable.""

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.530
In order to avoid saying, ""O come, let us
adore Him"", we have to add a little what's

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.790
called a glottis stop on the us'.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.580
A glottis stop is just uh' literally, your
glottis, your vocal chords are stopping.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.920
Input to practice, it sounds like this,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.250
""O come, let us adore Him

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.220
O come, let us adore Him

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.600
O come, let us adore Him

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.230
Christ, the Lord"""
