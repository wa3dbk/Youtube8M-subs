00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.230
by JBL of course you can see I'm here in
the packaging

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.469
nice hanger package um

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.619
standard really nice looking package on
the back it has a feature set you can

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.010
see the share me feature which is kind
of interesting

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.560
we'll get into that later and has a
built-in microphone 16 hour battery and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.410
wired and wireless capabilities so
inside the packaging you can see we have

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.969
this little box up here

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.800
that contains our manuals and whatnot

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.520
inside we have the headphones. Here they are right here. You can see they are

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.109
the plastic headband on the top and a
decent-looking drivers on the side

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:08.460
let's open up the manual container in
there we have our quick start manual to

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.830
that and tables and first get this how
the way it's the the warranty

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.820
information

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.890
so you've got two cables get this first
plug but it has the mini 2 and a half

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.630
millimeter plug and a standard
three-and-a-half millimeter plug that

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.540
would go for your wired or wired mode if
you wanted to listen to something that

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.189
doesn't have bluetooth works for those
side and here is the charging adapter it

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.170
has a USB plug on one said and a two and
a half millimeter plug on the other side

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.490
that's used for charging bluetooth so
it's so we're and we'll get down to

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:06.460
business with the the headphones so all
right so these are the geo synchronous

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:15.130
e-40 be teased and really nice-looking
headphones you can see there on the ear

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:23.380
style they would go on back your head
and flip up on and you can see the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.100
headphones or the the strap is more or
less a plastic the soft cushion case

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:38.500
here the the head . adjustment part
portion i found to be pretty loose when

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.200
I went off but for me it seemed to stay
put when I went to stretched it out in

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.090
order to fit around my head

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.170
it does it seem to fit well it held
tight and securely

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.130
we have the flexible flexibility of
bending it that way and then you can

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.620
fold it this way and wonder for easy
transportation and storage they fit

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.760
pretty flat

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.920
so you can open those back up and on the
left ear cup is where everything is

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.480
we have

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.569
have your volume up volume down and this
is a multifunction button which a double

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.370
tap or single tap controls your phone or
your playback and whatnot and this is

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:28.230
the share with me feature with you have
another 40 or 50

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.420
you can use that in order to share with
your companion

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.930
whatever you're listening to so if
you're watching a movie on a long flight

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.560
you can share share that and watch the
same tablet and then back here is the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.910
Bluetooth button press it once it will
flash red white like that is searching

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.540
to pair and as soon as it finds it will
go flashing to white solid red means

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.970
battery is low and a constant flashing
like this is it's looking to be repaired

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.819
so pressing it

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:12.840
well shut off the this is an on the ear
style so means that your ear will be on

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.030
there on the pad itself

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.609
i'm generally more they over the year
style because I'll listen to music for

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:27.240
upwards of eight to ten hours a day but
while at work in order to drown out some

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.010
of the other competing noises at work
but what I found about these is they are

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.720
really quiet

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.979
I didn't hear any noises from people
around me or anything like that say they

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.000
actually worked very well at keeping out
the noise which I was really pleased

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
with sound wise they sounded really good

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:57.090
highs were nice and high the mids were
very full and rich and the otherwise I

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.180
would not also say the there weren't any
at all

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:07.169
like some high or cheaper knockoff brand
headphones are now that they sounded

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.810
really clear symbols and high hats were
very crystal clear you know the if I'm

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.250
listening to techno that the high end of
the keyboard was really really clear and

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.259
crisp the low end

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:24.960
on the other hand was was definitely
there is very present but it's not a

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.780
booming booming bass

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.750
so you wouldn't feel it in your your
skull moving or anything like that but

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.050
you know what I really grew to love
these things

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.440
I listen to all sorts of music and I
don't think there was a type of music

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:51.150
that they didn't work out very well for
so yeah overall I like these headphones

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.800
I think they work really well and they
would definitely keep keep noise out if

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.560
you're working in a louder environment
environment and are tired of chords all

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.250
the time

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.930
so give it a shot check it out and I
think you'll think you'll be impressed
