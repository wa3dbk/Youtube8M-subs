00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.360
Ok, I just wanted to show a few things here

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.790
This slider assembly right here

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.840
That is the entire bucket seat slider assembly

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.280
That’s the top half that bolts to the seat

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.820
And the lower half that bolts to the floor

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.840
This here, is the slider mechanism off of
the bucket seats

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.730
The Suburban bucket seats

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.460
And it’s again, the top halt that bolts
to the seat

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.380
And the lower half that bolts to the floor

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.460
Down here, and here’s proof of concept

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.760
I got it to work

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:48.190
This is the upper half of the Suburban slider
mechanism

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.149
With the lower half of the bench seat slider
mechanism

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.709
And I’ll just show you here, let me get
it unlocked

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.390
It works just as well as all the other ones

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.740
So, we’ve just got a little bit of work
here to do

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.670
And I’ll show you how I’m going to fix
a couple of things

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.500
Alright, there’s a couple of things I had
to do to get the slider out

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.470
And I’m actually gonna back up here in a
little bit

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.670
I’m going to show you some footage that
I filmed yesterday

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.470
When I was actually taking this stuff apart

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.110
But, there’s 2 rivets…

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.260
And basically this upper portion, this is
the part that bolts to the bucket seats

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.770
I didn’t want to do as much drilling and
grinding

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.490
On this piece as I did on the same part on
the bucket

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.700
If that makes sense

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.189
So, let me just show you

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.450
There’s a rivet here that needs to be removed

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.920
It’s just like this one

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.000
And basically I ground the head off, drilled
it out

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.430
Almost drilled it out completely

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.030
But once I got a lot of material out of there
I was

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.759
Able to just use a little brass punch and
just pop it through

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.079
So I had to drill a rivet out there

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.989
Same here on the front

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.939
It’s kind of in the shadow, let me move
it

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.860
This, again this piece right here

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.880
This is the lower slider piece off of the
bench seat

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:26.560
That is now inside of the upper track piece
that is part of the bucket seats

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.980
So on this one I also had to drill out one
rivet on this side

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.819
I had to completely drill this out cause

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.900
There’s just not enough room here to get
a grinder in there

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.260
But these rivets are important, OK

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.590
They prevent the little slider balls in there

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.410
There’s little slider balls that you’ll
see here in a minute

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.739
Inside this mechanism

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.480
And they’re in between these areas

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.849
So these rivets act as stops

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.810
So that the slider mechanism doesn’t over
extend

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.980
And same here on the bottom

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.200
You’ll see in the upcoming little videos

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.300
These little indentions are also stops

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.730
They’re… on the inside it’s a raised
area

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.720
And the little slider ball mechanism

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.319
Which I don’t know if you can see real well

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.370
Is right about there

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.170
It cannot go past these points

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.880
So, we have to replace these rivets that we
drilled out

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.310
And when I was looking at these things trying
to figure them out

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.860
I was trying to figure out what this hole
is for

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.450
And really, it’s a window

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.640
And if I move it, there you can see, there’s
that rivet that we had to drill out

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.690
So, my solution, I went to the hardware store

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:51.030
And got some… these are 1/4” diameter
socket cap screws

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.230
They’re 3/4” long

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.700
And what I’ll do, is I’ll just stick them
down in there

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.360
Hold that in place

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.870
There you can see, the screw

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.160
Come in here… I’m using… I like to use
Nylock nuts like this

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.510
But you can use a nut

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.699
I would definitely recommend using some type
of thread locker on there

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.469
We just come in here, we’ve got that window

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:26.489
On this side that we can stick out allen key
tool in there

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.819
And just tighten them down

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:32.189
And so we’ve basically replaced those rivets

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:39.080
And now, the little roller ball can’t go
past the head of this bolt

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.100
So, I’m going to do the same thing on this
end

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.159
There’s also a large hole, it’s basically
a big window

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.210
You can see straight through there

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.210
That’s the hole that we need to fill up

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.289
Same thing, just put another 1/4” socket
cap screw in there

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:55.449
Tighten it down

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.229
And this piece is ready to go, it’s ready
to be bolted back on the seat

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.029
And try it out in the truck

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:03.960
So anyway, I’m going to post up some footage

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.830
Of me disassembling the track system off the
bucket seats

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.010
And you can kind of see how I did it

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.439
I was learning as I went

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:16.319
I didn’t know how to do it

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:17.869
So I was trying to figure it out as I went

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:22.309
So, just hang out, we’ll show you that footage

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:24.789
And then we’ll continue on with this project
