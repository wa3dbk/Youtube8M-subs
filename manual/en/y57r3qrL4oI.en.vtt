00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.600
The Nuts and Bolts of Tanks: Running Gear

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.900
Running gear.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.450
As you know, tanks are not afraid to get dirty.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.850
They are also not afraid of hills, mud, small trees and light buildings.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.750
Their high cross-country mobility is provided by their track assembly,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.750
known as the “caterpillar track”.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.300
It can be traced back to the beginning of the 20th century, even before World War I.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.200
Compared to wheeled vehicles, tracked vehicles are much better at crossing rough ground and mud.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.550
The running gear of the first British tank was based on tracked farm vehicles;

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.650
specifically, the Holt tractor.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.200
The British rhombic tank design featured wheels anchored on the hull,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.200
and tracks all around the perimeter.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.550
This gave good cross-country mobility,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.500
but the absence of any shock absorbers meant that the crew was badly buffeted

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.400
whenever the tank met rough ground or an obstacle.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.800
After the first World War, there were some more attempts to build tanks with tractor running gear.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.000
By the early 1920s, it became quite clear that such simple running gear was inadequate.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.950
Engineers started designing suspensions specifically for tanks.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.850
The resulting designs can be divided into three groups:

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.300
dependent, independent, and semi-dependent.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.000
A dependent suspension consisted of bogies which held several wheels.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.850
Shock absorbers could be mounted onto the bogies only, or onto both the bogies and wheels.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.700
The dependent suspension was used in the Vickers 6-Ton, the Sherman, T-28, and many others.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.800
Among the advantages of the dependent suspension were soft ride at moderate speeds,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.700
ease of maintenance, and ease of manufacture.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.350
There were disadvantages, too: the suspension elements were poorly protected,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.400
and it was impossible to attain high speed.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.750
In an independent suspension, every wheel had independent shock absorbers.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.000
Designers used leaf springs, coil springs and, later, torsion bars.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.200
Among the earlier types of independent suspension was the Christie suspension,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.200
invented and developed by American engineer J. Walter Christie in the 1920s and ‘30s.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.000
With this suspension, a vehicle could use either tracks or wheels.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.100
The Soviet BT light tanks could run on its wheels on-road, or mount its tracks for off-road travel.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.800
Eventually the idea of the wheeled tanks was abandoned.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.500
The tracked version of the Christie suspension was used in a range of British tanks,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.300
including the Cromwell and Comet, as well as the most famous Soviet tank of World War II, the T-34.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.100
The Christie suspension used coil springs as shock absorbers.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.250
The independent suspension with leaf springs was used in the Pz. II German tank.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.150
This vehicle had five wheels on each side, with every wheel attached to a separate spring.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.150
The torsion bar suspension was invented in the late 1930s.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.400
The torsion bars are metal bars that can twist in response to the motion of the wheels.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.350
The advantages of torsion bar suspension are resistance to battlefield damage,

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.150
compact size and ride comfort.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.750
Nowadays, torsion bar suspension is used in most of tanks.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.500
Pneumatic and hydro-pneumatic suspensions are also very promising.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.500
In these designs, shock absorption is carried out using compressed air or compressed liquid.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.100
Pneumatic suspension was first used in the British Tetrarch.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.950
It’s still used nowadays in some tanks—for example, the British Challenger.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.000
But overall, it is not widely used.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:55.000
In the next episode, we’ll tell you about the engine and transmission—the components that put tanks in motion.
