00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:15.000
Welcome to the League of Legends Champion Spotlight featuring Singed, the Mad Chemist

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.500
Singed is a mobile tanky fighter who excels at disrupting his enemies and dealing constant damage throughout a fight.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:29.000
One of Singed’s defining traits is his ability to kite enemy champions, winning fights almost exclusively by running around.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Singed’s passive is Empowered Bulwark. A percentage of Singed’s maximum mana is added to his maximum health.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Basically, if you buy items that give mana, you’ll become more durable.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Poison Trail is a toggled ability. While toggled on, it leaves behind a trail of poison.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Enemies who walk through the Poison Trail become poisoned and take damage over a short time.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.500
Mega Adhesive creates an area on the ground that slows the movement speed of all enemies inside it.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.000
Fling damages and tosses target enemy over your shoulder, landing behind you.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Insanity Potion empowers Singed for a few seconds, granting him increased health and mana regeneration, movement speed, armor, and magic resist while reducing the duration of all crowd control effects on Singed.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.500
Singed is an extremely strong laner starting at level 6. I’m playing aggressively against Riven, pushing to her turret.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.500
Master Yi shows up to gank as I run. First I stay in the brush, which gives me more time before being attacked.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.000
I turn on Poison Trail and make a run to my turret. Once he attacks, I use Mega Adhesive directly in front of myself, which would stop most champions.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
After Alpha Strike I have one more trick up my sleeve: When he gets into range, I Fling him directly into my turret.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.500
Knowing he will run, I land an attack or two, picking up the kill.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:52.000
Then I run as Riven chases me, but I’ve created enough distance that she drops to the turret and Poison Trail, giving me a double kill almost exclusively from running away.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Once you’ve built an advantage, you should definitely press it and dominate your lane.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Note that the play style here is buying as much time as possible for Poison Trail. Turn on Poison Trail and then Insanity Potion.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I aim Mega Adhesive in the only route Riven can take to retreat. Once she Flashes away, I use Fling to place her back into Mega Adhesive.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Finally Poison Trail ticks down the rest of her health and I get the kill.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.500
While running around with Swain and Riven, I get jumped by Master Yi.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.000
I keep on Poison Trail and try to use Fling to escape him. I bait him into the brush, then turn around, Flinging him over the wall.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Xin Zhao comes to help me and Swain is already low from Poison Trail.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
After his first kill, I lend aid with Mega Adhesive, helping him pick up Master Yi as he dives underneath the turret.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Your mid-game play style is all about building a huge gold and level advantage while distracting the enemy team.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Once you’ve completed Rod of Ages, constantly push down minion waves with Poison Trail, then look for nearby fights.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.500
Eventually enemy champions will try to gank you, but with Insanity Potion, Ghost, and Mega Adhesive, you can escape most of the smaller fights.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.000
One quick note on playing Singed: You should bind “Laugh” to something easily reached on your keyboard.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.500
Whenever you have downtime in lane, you should laugh at your opponents. It hurts your opponents’ morale or something.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.500
Now let’s look at a game where it doesn’t start so well. At low levels, basic attacks and other abilities can out-damage Poison Trail, so you want to be defensive.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.500
Here you can see Jarvan playing aggressively, knocking me up in a minion wave and taking over half my health.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.000
Thankfully I barely survive, but this is obviously not a great start.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.500
This trend actually continues for a while and I start the game 1/5/2. However, after finishing Rod of Ages, I feel confident and have mana to spare.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.500
I run through Jarvan’s minion wave with Poison Trail and Fling him for damage. I keep fighting him until Riven shows up.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:47.000
I start to run, using Mega Adhesive to get them off my back. Poison Trail keeps damaging them so I run back in, using Fling to damage Riven some more.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.500
Basically, as long as Insanity Potion is running, I like fighting. However, I can’t dive into the enemy turret, so I hang out around the middle of the lane.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.500
Finally they turn to pressure me, so I Fling Riven away from Jarvan and separate them with Mega Adhesive.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.500
Now you can see Riven is about to die while Jarvan is powerless to help her.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:11.000
Mega Adhesive and Poison Trail cause Riven to die and I push into Jarvan. I let my minions tank the turret and run in for a Fling, hoping to kill him.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I take a little bit too much damage from the turret, dropping to 50 health as Jarvan falls to Poison Trail.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Once you catch up, use your tankiness and utility to win fights for your team.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Here the total score is 22-19 and I make a big play to win us a fight. Mega Adhesive separates Annie from her team.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.500
As Xin Zhao chases, I Fling him into my allies, picking up that kill before his friends can hurt us.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:42.000
As our opponents pile in, I turn to fight Annie and Caitlyn. Though I get Exhausted, I try to stay on top of Caitlyn, finally killing her with Fling.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Now at only 500 health, I run with Insanity Potion plus Ghost.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I’ve bought enough time that Annie falls to Poison Trail with some help from Talon, causing their last two surviving members to run away.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.500
Rule of thumb when fighting Singed: Don’t case Singed.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.500
Also note that Fling can help or hurt your teammates if they have area of effect abilities.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.500
Here we dive into Jarvan and Fling causes Brand’s Pillar of Flame to miss.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.500
In a different fight, using Fling actually places Caitlyn in Nunu’s Absolute Zero, granting us an easy kill.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.000
Always be aware that Fling can totally backfire. 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.000
For runes I take magic penetration marks, dodge seals, flat magic resist glyphs, and movement speed quintessences.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.000
This setup is aimed at giving me a little bit of early game durability and primarily focuses on strong kiting late-game with the dodge seals feeding Nimbleness.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.500
My masteries are 0/14/16, making absolutely certain to take Nimbleness and three points in Strength of Spirit in defense.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.000
In utility you want to grab increased experience gain, maximum mana, and movement speed.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
I also take Teleport and Ghost, mastering both.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Take a point in Fling at level 1 and leave it there. Then max Poison Trail as soon as possible with Mega Adhesive right after.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000
This skill build is aimed at dealing the most damage with Poison Trail and increasing your utility for the team with the slow from Mega Adhesive.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
You can max Fling over Mega Adhesive if you want to deal more damage, but I prefer the consistency of the slow.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.500
For items I open with a Sapphire Crystal and two Health Potions. After, I have two extremely important buys:

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.000
An early Catalyst, and upgraded boots, either Mercury Treads or Ninja Tabi, depending on the enemy team.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.500
If I’m getting enough gold my first major buys are Rod of Ages and Rylai’s Crystal Scepter.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:29.000
If I’m dealing with a bunch of physical damage, I’ll add Sunfire Cape, Randuin’s Omen, Guardian Angel, Thornmail, or Frozen Heart.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.500
If I’m worried about magic damage, I’ll turn my early Catalyst into Banshee’s Veil and add Force of Nature, Spirit Visage, or Abyssal Scepter.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:45.000
