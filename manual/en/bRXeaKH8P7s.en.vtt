Hello! Cookaka here

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.540
Are you also a fan for FIFA World Cup?

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.860
Eating and Watching the match at the same time, could that be a better way to do it?

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.960
Today's recipe is Deep-fried Shrimp Toast

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.480
Hope you like it

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.040
Shrimp = 150g

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.460
Breadcrumb - 30g
Bread - 2 slices

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.400
Black pepper - As appropriate
Egg yolk - 1pc
Sesame oil - As appropriate

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.100
Sugar - ½ teaspoon
Salt - ½ teaspoon
Plain Flour - 1 teaspoon
Egg White - ⅓ pc

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
First, clean the shrimp nicely.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.240
Fresh shrimp isn't necessary for this dish

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.040
It'll be kinda waste for fresh shrimp, as we gonna deep-fry them later on

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.420
Most importantly, they are way cheaper

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.380
Peel off their shell

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.180
Remember to pick those with decent size

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.660
A clean shinny head and body intact

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.200
Cut off the head, and clean up the inner organs

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.580
You'll see after you slice it through the back of the shrimp

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.080
Pull it out gently

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.060
Dry them thoroughly after washing them

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.640
Press and dice them into small pieces

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.400
Mince them afterwards

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.320
To the most interesting part

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.520
Hit them hard into the bowl until it sets

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.100
Add in all the seasonings

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.220
Last but not least, sesame oil

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.280
Cut the bread diagonally, with your preferred size

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.360
I rather like them in smaller pieces

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.340
Place some shrimp mixture with a touch of egg yolk

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.740
Place it into the Breadcrumbs

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.100
And off to the Frying pan

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.180
Not too much oil is needed, 
just enough to cover the toast would be fine

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.740
Heat the oil with medium heat

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.900
Test the oil temperature with a chopstick

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.200
You can add in the Toasts when you see bubbles appeared

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.960
Shrimp side down

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.300
Flip them over once it changes golden

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.780
Take them off the heat when both sides changed colour

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.720
And voila! It's done!

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.700
This is very delicious

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.240
And very crispy
