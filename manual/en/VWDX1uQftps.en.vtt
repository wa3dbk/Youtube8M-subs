00:00:03.497 --> 00:00:08.118
(fun instrumental music)

00:00:08.118 --> 00:00:09.998
- Rome is famous for it's food,

00:00:09.998 --> 00:00:12.367
so today I'm going on the Rome Food Walking Tour

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:14.967
^where I'm gonna get to go to the famous Testaccio market

00:00:14.967 --> 00:00:16.894
^and try some of this stuff.

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:19.705
- Hi, welcome everybody,

00:00:19.705 --> 00:00:22.119
to the famous Testaccio Covered Market.

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.221
And there might be no bigger celebrity

00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:26.437
than Carmelo, right over there with the vest.

00:00:26.437 --> 00:00:29.127
Or a lot of people call him the tomato poet.

00:00:29.127 --> 00:00:30.753
- They were so sweet.

00:00:30.753 --> 00:00:32.796
I've never had a tomato that's that sweet.

00:00:32.796 --> 00:00:34.230
I love this market.

00:00:36.883 --> 00:00:39.553
I have never seen as many meats, cheeses,

00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:43.059
pastas, olive oils in such a small space.

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.426
This right here is the Rolls Royce of meat,

00:00:46.426 --> 00:00:49.364
it melts in your mouth, this is so delicious.

00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:52.904
- So now it's time to give your sweet tooth a little love,

00:00:52.904 --> 00:00:55.411
and there's no better place than here at Barberini.

00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:57.315
- And now for the tiramisu which are served

00:00:57.315 --> 00:00:59.572
in a chocolate little teacup.

00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:03.064
Just went in my shirt, but I found it.

00:01:04.986 --> 00:01:06.588
Turns out, this is more than just a food tour,

00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:10.016
it's actually a food and history and culture tour.

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:12.059
This pyramid behind me is from 14 B.C.,

00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:14.265
^and not only is it really beautiful,

00:01:14.265 --> 00:01:17.254
^there's also capers growing up on the side of it.

00:01:18.305 --> 00:01:20.371
- Well, it was very unique, I would say,

00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:22.252
met my expectations, definitely.

00:01:22.252 --> 00:01:24.272
- I found it a quite fun, fascinating,

00:01:24.272 --> 00:01:27.012
and real experience of Italian food.

00:01:27.012 --> 00:01:29.659
- And I just learned there are 600 kinds of pasta,

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.563
or different shapes of pasta.

00:01:31.563 --> 00:01:34.738
This one's so neat, I think it's my favorite.

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:37.460
- We had the best cheeses, the best meat,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.689
it was just, oh my god, the gelato,

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.643
you know the difference between gelato and ice cream, I do.

00:01:42.643 --> 00:01:46.702
Amarena, wild cherry, mandorla, which is almond.

00:01:46.702 --> 00:01:47.375
- Grazie.

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:50.995
- Grazie, I ordered strawberry and chocolate,

00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:52.507
it couldn't be better than this.

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:54.441
This tour has been phenomenal,

00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:57.668
because they have taken us to probably the best places,

00:01:57.668 --> 00:02:00.547
the markets, restaurants, gelaterias,

00:02:00.547 --> 00:02:03.636
we've basically been able to eat like a local.

00:02:03.636 --> 00:02:04.806
- Goodbye.

00:02:04.806 --> 00:02:08.687
(fun instrumental music)
