00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.030
KAKUMA: This isn't a soccer game, it's a massacre!
But still, the winners are...

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.900
ZEUS JUNIOR!

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.840
MUKATA PURPLE: Hah, Zeus Junior again. Those
guys are interesting players.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.190
MUKATA PINK: Ja. But they need to raise their
game if they want to beat us.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.690
MUKATA GREEN: There's no way they'll be able
to stop us.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.560
ALL: Ja.
PINK: That's right. But there's someone we

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.740
need to take down before that.
PURPLE: Ja. Axel stinking Blaze.
0:00:25.740,0:00:29.070
PINK: I can't believe he's hanging around
with that crappy team, calling himself their

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.029
ace striker.
GREEN: We're going to crush him!

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:35.090
ALL: The Murdock brothers...

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.780
will never be beaten!

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.839
GOUENJI: Soccer is soccer, after all.

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.769
ENDOU: You said it, Axel. And soccer will
always be soccer.

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.019
SOMEOKA: That was just awesome, guys!
DOMON: It was all thanks to Erik. He's got

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:48.999
amazing ball control.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.769
ICHINOSE: Thanks, Bobby.

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.769
AKI: It's making me into a jealous [inaudible]

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:54.899
ENDOU: Yeah I'm likin' it!

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.929
I feel like a kid in a candy store.
Oh wait, I am.

00:00:58.029 --> 00:01:02.699
KIDOU: This store is ancient. I didn't think
places like this. Still existed anymore.

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.529
GOUENJI: They won't, if the corporate thieves
get their way.

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:11.130
KIDOU: He's so honest, and such a simple guy.
That explains why he's head over heels in

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.519
love with soccer!
GOUENJI: Yeah.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.609
KFC KIDS: You can't do that, it's mean!

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.039
GREEN: Shut up, midget!

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.460
ENDOU: What are you doing? This is a CANDY
store!

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.719
PINK: That's right, the [fight in?] the candy
store!

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:26.009
GREEN: And there's three of us, and only one
of you, munchkin!

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.299
Axel Blaze? It's been a long time...since
you turned your back and ran, chicken boy.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.859
ALL: We're the Murdocks!
PURPLE: I am Marvin!

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.240
PINK: I'M THOMAS!
GREEN: I'm Tyler!

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.270
ALL: And together we are...

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.130
the unbeatable Murdocks!

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.130
PURPLE: So. You squirts. Are the losers from
Raimon we get to play next, are you?

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.579
That. My little friends. Will be a piece of
cake.

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.039
PINK: We came to make an announcement.
ALL: We are going to totally destroy you,

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.749
Axel Blaze!

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:58.409
PINK: We thought we were on our way to glory,
but instead...

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.889
instead... you--you--you--

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:04.029
ALL: You didn't show up at the game, you traitor!

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:07.969
PURPLE: We thought you were a hero, but you
couldn't take the pressure, and you ran away

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.620
like a big fat baby!
ENDOU: That's not true! Axel would never run

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.130
away from a challenge!
That day, he was--

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.280
GOUENJI: NO!

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:16.640
ENDOU: But Axel!
GOUENJI: It's all in the past!

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.369
We can't turn back the clock.

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.200
PURPLE: Let's see how much you've improved
since we last saw you play, Mr. Chicken Hair.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.750
GOUENJI: I don't think so!
I'm not in the mood!

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.000
ENDOU: If Axel doesn't want to, I'll take
you on!

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.370
GOUENJI: But Mark!

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.120
PINK: What ARE you saying?
PURPLE: I'm afraid I'm finding all this talk

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.010
more than a little confusing.
ENDOU: You clowns of strikers, don't you want

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.659
to see the keeper's strength as well?
[whoever]: I don't know, I guess!

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.780
PURPLE: Oh, boy! This one's got the fire in
his belly, he's from the old school.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.250
ALL: So, little man, if you're ready to start
up, we'll show you how strong we are! Ja!

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.180
PURPLE: Awesome, looks like I scored on you,
shrimpy. Ha ha, we win.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.370
SHISHIDO: But I heard you! You were talkin'
about fightin' 'em, and saying "Bring it on!",

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.470
and bein' all aggressive and stuff, dude!
ENDOU: I was talking tough as usual, what's

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.170
the big deal?
SHISHIDO: Uh... I just thought that...

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.409
AKI: Idiot! You scared us all for nothing!
PURPLE: What, what, what? That time it was

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.500
just one ball and you couldn't stop it.
GREEN: How 'bout that.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.060
PINK: Ja, I think we just proved ourselves
to you, don't you?

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.780
ALL: That was Triangle Z!
PURPLE: Yes it was!

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.540
NISHIGAKI: Yeah, well I thought you were dead!
What is this?

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.340
Huh? Bobby? And Sylvia? What's happening?
Is this some kind of crazy time warp?

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.159
ICHINOSE: Yeah, that's right. Mark Evans is
the most fantastic guy.

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.700
DOMON: You know, I think it's all pretty amazing.
We all got separated in the States, and now

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.700
here we are.
We're all back together again.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.750
ALL: [laughing]

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.240
GOUENJI: Those moronic triplets were right.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.759
KIDOU: Why so confident?

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.790
ENDOU: Because I'm gonna practice like cuckoo.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.329
KIDOU: You really are a simple guy, aren't
you.

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.719
ENDOU: Starting tomorrow, we'll practice like
it's 1999!

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.659
Yeah! Gimme more, I want more balls!

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.020
That's not enough! I need more, darn it!

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.349
SHISHIDO: Are you crazy? That's impossible,
Captain!

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:20.549
ENDOU: Maybe so! But if we don't get past
the impossible, we're never going to do it!

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.930
SHISHIDO: You're CRAY-ZEE!

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.820
GOUENJI: Let's just play the game fair and
square, all right?

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.670
Please?
PURPLE: Fine, if you know how to play like

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.450
that, that is, which I doubt.
GREEN: I'm sure we'll spend most of the game

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.970
watching you cry on the bench like a little
girl.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.760
PURPLE: Oh, and Mr. Soccer Nerd: You'd better
hope you don't get blown away by our Triangle

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.040
Z again, 'cause you will.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.040
Oh, buddy, you're gonna wish you'd never been
born, watch this!

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.940
ALL: [laughing]

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.060
ENDOU: This game is off the hook!
