00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.520
- I'm John White, today we are gonna

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.440
take a few questions from the mailbag

00:00:04.448 --> 00:00:08.670
and we are gonna talk about
turf grasses and lawn care today

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.960
and the first one is from
John here in Las Cruces

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.620
and wants to know about
starting a lawn at home

00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:18.583
and he is worried about allergies

00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:20.129
and he has heard that Bermuda grass

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:23.784
does have a lot of allergy
problems associated with it.

00:00:23.784 --> 00:00:26.506
With me today is Doctor
Arden Baltensperger.

00:00:26.506 --> 00:00:27.339
- Hi John.

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:28.287
- Good morning Doctor Baltensperger.

00:00:28.287 --> 00:00:29.426
- Nice to see you.

00:00:29.426 --> 00:00:33.607
- Doctor Baltensperger is a
retired turf grass researcher

00:00:33.607 --> 00:00:35.856
and Professor here at New Mexico State

00:00:35.856 --> 00:00:38.209
and Arden is an expert on helping

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:40.360
answer some of these questions.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.820
So Arden, the question was about
allergies in Bermuda grass.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.417
Can you give us a little,
shed a little light on that?

00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:49.461
- Some people are
allergic to Bermuda grass

00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:52.546
and if they are it's not
the grass you should plant.

00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:56.520
They'll, if they are quite allergic to it,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.670
they will even show symptoms
when the kids roll in the grass

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.513
and I have grandkids that
are allergic to Bermuda grass

00:01:03.513 --> 00:01:05.868
and it's not the grass
to have in your yard.

00:01:05.868 --> 00:01:06.701
- Okay.

00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:07.961
- There are other alternatives you know.

00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:09.625
- So when we are starting to have some,

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:12.832
some seed head formation on the grass,

00:01:12.832 --> 00:01:14.784
is that the main source of the allergen?

00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:18.926
- Yeah, the seed heads
are, produce a lot of it,

00:01:18.926 --> 00:01:22.579
but even if it doesn't
have seed heads or pollen,

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.224
the pollen is most, most troublesome,

00:01:25.224 --> 00:01:27.217
but even if it doesn't have that,

00:01:27.217 --> 00:01:29.448
if your kids roll around in the grass

00:01:29.448 --> 00:01:32.044
and they are allergic, it will show.

00:01:32.044 --> 00:01:33.788
They should plant another grass.

00:01:33.788 --> 00:01:37.483
- So you can still possibly
have some problems.

00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:40.658
- Yes, but less with the, less
with the vegetating varieties

00:01:40.658 --> 00:01:43.385
than the seeded varieties, like this one.

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:47.385
- Okay, okay, another
question we have Arden is,

00:01:48.385 --> 00:01:51.231
this is from Robert in Carlsbad

00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:56.147
and he's asking about the water
schedule on Bermuda grasses,

00:01:56.147 --> 00:01:58.991
he has heard that they are
pretty drought tolerant

00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:02.484
and what would be a good
watering scheduling on Bermuda?

00:02:02.484 --> 00:02:03.866
- And that's from where?

00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:04.699
- Carlsbad.

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:08.530
- Carlsbad, ah, Bermuda grass
is quite drought tolerant.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.012
It rates up with buffalo grass,

00:02:11.012 --> 00:02:14.300
but as you all know here
in June we still need

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.630
a lot of water on Bermuda
grass to keep it green

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.818
and there are different
ways that you can water,

00:02:21.818 --> 00:02:24.573
we probably gotta talk to
Doctor Lionart about this,

00:02:24.573 --> 00:02:28.740
but I like on my home lawn
to water only once a week,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.886
I have quite fine textured soil

00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:35.298
and I water heavy once a
week about two inches of,

00:02:35.298 --> 00:02:38.100
about two inches of water per watering.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.226
But whatever you do I
think this time of year,

00:02:41.226 --> 00:02:44.026
you need to put on almost
two inches of water

00:02:44.026 --> 00:02:47.560
sometime during the week to
keep Bermuda grass looking good.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.393
- Okay.

00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:50.606
- One nice thing about
Bermuda grass though is

00:02:50.606 --> 00:02:53.778
if you are terribly short of water,

00:02:53.778 --> 00:02:57.397
you can shut the water
off and let it turn brown

00:02:57.397 --> 00:03:00.391
if you can stand that
and then it will recover,

00:03:00.391 --> 00:03:03.037
it will recover after a
month of severe drought.

00:03:03.037 --> 00:03:06.570
It's very tolerant to that sort of thing.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.560
- Okay, our third question
is from Rebecca in Hobbs

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.960
and she has a problem
with her Bermuda grass

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.869
showing a blueish-gray cast

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:21.077
and the nurseries have
told her that's a fungus,

00:03:21.077 --> 00:03:22.320
another people have told her

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.924
that's a drought symptom in grass.

00:03:24.924 --> 00:03:27.563
- That would be hard for me
to answer without seeing it,

00:03:27.563 --> 00:03:32.820
but it sounds like it might
be somewhat variety related,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.640
and it almost sounds to me
like it might be short of water

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.120
it does tend to get blue-gray
when it gets short of water.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.312
- Okay, so good technique for her

00:03:44.312 --> 00:03:46.508
would be to actually sample an area

00:03:46.508 --> 00:03:49.353
- And visit her local county agent [laughing]

00:03:49.353 --> 00:03:51.752
and see whether it's truly a disease.

00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:53.905
- Get some more information on that.

00:03:53.905 --> 00:03:57.605
Arden, as far as Bermuda
grasses in general,

00:03:57.605 --> 00:04:00.644
they are good for the
southern part of the state.

00:04:00.644 --> 00:04:03.154
- Very well adapted to
this part of the state.

00:04:03.154 --> 00:04:07.092
- Do you have some cultural
techniques to pass on here?

00:04:07.092 --> 00:04:10.788
- Oh, I, my feeling is with Bermuda grass,

00:04:10.788 --> 00:04:12.780
make sure it gets enough nitrogen,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.403
about two pounds of nitrogen
per month or that equivalent

00:04:17.403 --> 00:04:21.780
and water you know heavy, not too often

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.940
and it tends to take care
of itself pretty well.

00:04:25.944 --> 00:04:28.140
- Okay, how about moving heights?

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.987
- That depends on what
you are gonna use it for,

00:04:30.987 --> 00:04:35.052
I think a home lawn,
three-fourth to an inch is good,

00:04:35.052 --> 00:04:37.042
fairways, they generally go

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:39.314
with three-fourth of an inch or less

00:04:39.314 --> 00:04:41.791
and if you want a real nice looking lawn,

00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:45.414
this variety here would mow
down to a quarter of an inch

00:04:45.414 --> 00:04:48.138
if you wanted to, two, three times a week

00:04:48.138 --> 00:04:49.683
if you wanted to mow it that much

00:04:49.683 --> 00:04:51.352
and have almost a putting surface.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.120
- Okay, so with adequate
fertilizer and good watering

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.960
and a good varietal selection,

00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:01.206
you should end up with a
pretty good Bermuda grass.

00:05:01.206 --> 00:05:03.154
- And you can get by
with very few pesticides

00:05:03.154 --> 00:05:04.830
if you treat the Bermuda grass right.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.495
- Keep it in good shape,
keep the weeds out, okay,

00:05:09.495 --> 00:05:12.737
well Arden thank you very much
for being our guest today,

00:05:12.737 --> 00:05:16.108
again our guest has been
Doctor Arden Baltensperger,

00:05:16.108 --> 00:05:20.110
retired turf grass specialist
here at New Mexico State,

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.610
thank you.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.160
[Happy music]
