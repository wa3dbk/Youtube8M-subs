00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.266
After dealing with tropical moisture over the weekend, it appears that more is headed our way! This will result in the potential for heavy 

00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:00.399
rain over primarily southern and eastern Utah on Wednesday. By Thursday, the moisture, and thus the threat for heavy rain, will move across 

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:00.466
the entire state. This will cause an elevated risk of flash flooding, particularly over high risk areas like slot canyons and burn scars. Because of 

00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:00.499
this, if you have outdoor activities planned for the middle part of the week, be prepared for wet weather and monitor our forecasts for the latest 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:00.566
information. 

00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.099
Let’s take a quick look at the big picture and talk about what’s coming our way. This low pressure system currently off the California 

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.366
coast will track eastward through the Great Basin over the next couple of days. As it does so, it will interact with moisture from the 

00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:01.499
remnants of Hurricane Blanca in the eastern Pacific. These factors will combine to make conditions favorable for showers and 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:01.666
thunderstorms with the potential for heavy rain. 

00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:02.066
So, with this in mind, we’ll see tropical moisture make its way into southern Utah this evening and overnight, with scattered showers and 

00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:02.266
thunderstorms developing. These showers and thunderstorms will become more numerous over southern and eastern Utah Wednesday 

00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:02.366
afternoon through the early evening. We’ll see the greatest potential for heavy rain, and thus flash flooding, during this time. We’ll also see 

00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:02.499
scattered showers and thunderstorms over northern Utah during this time. 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:02.666
Because of the elevated potential for heavy rain, there is a flash flood watch in effect from early Wednesday through Wednesday night for the 

00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:02.766
areas highlighted in green on the map. A watch means that these areas have the greatest potential to see flash flooding due to heavy rain 

00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:02.866
from the tropical moisture. 

00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:02.999
By Thursday, tropical moisture will have spread across the entire state. We’ll see numerous showers and thunderstorms over much of the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.066
state by Thursday afternoon, which will again have the potential to produce heavy rain. Though the main storm system will exit by Friday, 

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:03.166
lingering moisture will keep at least some threat of showers and thunderstorms over the area into the weekend. 

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:03.332
In summary, tropical moisture will interact with an approaching Pacific storm system to bring a period of wet weather to Utah Wednesday and 

00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:03.399
Thursday. The storms that develop will have the potential to produce heavy rain. This could cause flash flooding, particularly in high risk 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:03.433
areas such as burn scars and slot canyons. If you’re planning outdoor activities over the next few days, be prepared for wet weather! If you’re 

00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:03.466
in southern Utah or plan to travel there, check out our Flash Flood Potential Forecasts for the area national parks at the URL listed on the
