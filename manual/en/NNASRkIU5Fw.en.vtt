Hi. It's Mr. Andersen and in
this podcast I'm going to talk about nucleic

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.110
acids. When I talk to students about nucleic
acids, they're confused. They don't know what

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.550
they do and they don't usually know what they're
made up of. They do know that they're DNA

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.189
and RNA but let's start with what they do.
And so the biggest job the DNA and RNA have

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.619
is making the proteins. The proteins inside
the cell. And so when you look at me, you're

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.500
looking at the proteins, but where are the
directions to make those proteins? Those are

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.970
found in the DNA. And how do they get to the
proteins? Well they're shuttled out by RNA.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.510
And RNA is more of a worker that's making
these proteins inside the ribosome. And so

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.730
the first job they have is making proteins.
What's the second thing they do? Well they

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.080
make up our genes. And so that's what we pass
on to the next generation. And so this is

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.900
my son. He contains half of the DNA that I
do. So I gave him a random half of my DNA.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.900
And my wife did the same. So he's a combination
of me and my wife. And life has just passed

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.920
DNA down generation after generation after
generation. We've never found life on our

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.610
planet that doesn't have DNA. That means that
we're all connected through this single thread

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.060
back to that first universal common ancestor.
But what are they made up of? Those are nucleotides.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.400
And so these are the building blocks of DNA
and the building blocks of RNA. So let's look

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.159
specifically at one. So this is one nucleotide
right here. A nucleotide is made up of three

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.190
parts. We've got a phosphate group, that's
going to be pictured right here. It's a phosphorus

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.840
in the middle and then oxygen around the outside.
Phosphate groups are really famous in biology.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.909
So they're the phosphates that are found in
phospholipids that make the cell membranes

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.820
of all life. And it's the same phosphate that
we're going to find in ATP, adenosine triphosphate.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.049
It's the energy source. And in fact the adenosine
triphosphate is exactly the same adenosine

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.820
triphosphate that we add to make DNA. We'll
get to that in just a second. What else do

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.629
we have? Well, we have a pentosugar. Pentosugar
means we have a five carbon sugar. In DNA

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.349
that's going to be a deoxyribo sugar and then
in RNA it's going to be a ribosugar. And then

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.430
the most interesting part of a nucleotide
is going to be the nitrogenous base. And it's

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.829
called a nitrogenous base because it has nitrogen.
And so most things in life are made up of

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:28.730
carbon but there's going to be a lot of nitrogen
here in the base of this nucleotide. And this

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.819
is going to be different in each nucleotide.
And so let's take a look at the nucleotides

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.480
found in DNA. And so basically you have adenine,
cytosine, guanine and thymine. And so we have

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.340
four different bases and therefore we have
four different nucleotides. And you can just

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.620
see looking at them the size is going to be
a little different on all four of these. In

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.400
RNA they don't have thymine, you might notice.
But they have uracil. It's going to look a

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.139
lot like thymine but it's not going to be
thymine. If we were to now look at all of

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.709
those nucleotides together, so A, C, G, and
T. And that's where the names come from. In

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.169
DNA we're talking about these nitrogenous
bases or these nucleotides. Now we've got

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:15.779
uracil. Basically if we put them in order
by their size we've got two major groups.

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:20.200
We have these ones that have two rings and
we call these purines. So this is adenine

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.939
and this is going to be guanine. And then
we have the pyrimidines and there just going

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:29.180
to have one ring. So cytosine, thymine and
uracil are all going to have one ring. So

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.459
they're going to be smaller. And that'll become
really important when we start bonding them

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.219
together. So let's talk about bonding. How
do you connect them together? Well when we

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.329
talked about carbohydrates there's really
only one way to connect carbohydrates. Or

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.819
when we talk about amino acids, there's really
only one way to connect them, but especially

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.279
when we get to DNA you can connect nucleotides
in two ways. So let's start with way one.

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:53.989
Way one, we could put this one right underneath
it so we've got an adenine and a guanine and

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.569
then through a dehydration reaction we could
lose a H2O right here and we could form a

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.079
covalent bond between two nucleotides. And
so if we were to add another one, we would

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.019
add another nucleotide here, we'd lose a water
and we're going to make another covalent bond.

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.629
And so we can attach them together like that.
And so that's what RNA is. RNA is a number

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.979
of nucleotides simply in a row and they're
connected with covalent bonds between each

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.090
one. There's another way however when we get
to DNA that we can bond them. And so let's

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.220
say we have these two nucleotides, adenine
and guanine, how could I attach this thymine

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.340
right here? Well basically I can turn it upside
down and it's going to form hydrogen bonds

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.310
here between the adenine and thymine. And
you've probably heard this before that adenine

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:43.250
will always bond to thymine and guanine will
always bond to cytosine. And that's why. There's

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.960
going to be interactions between the oxygen,
nitrogen and the hydrogen and make these hydrogen

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.370
bonds that are connected with the two. And
so when you're looking at DNA, let's kind

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.590
of switch to this next slide. When you're
looking at DNA, that's what's being connected

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.699
right here in the middle. So that's going
to be the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:08.430
bases on either side. And so why do we have
DNA? Well we think life started with RNA because

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.590
it contains a message, but overtime we kind
of had two RNAs wrap around each other and

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.370
we eventually had DNA. There's more to it
that that, but DNA is going to be a more stable

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.150
structure. We're going to have those hydrogen
bonds here and then we're going to have covalent

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.479
bonds between different backbones of the DNA
as well. And so what are the backbone of DNA

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.819
really made up of? It's just a sugar attached
to phosphate to a sugar to a phosphate to

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:37.389
a sugar. And so what are some differences
between DNA on the right and RNA on the left?

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.610
Well the first one would be the uracil versus
the thymine. So that's going to be a different

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.199
nitrogenous base. DNA is going to be a double
helix and RNA is going to be a single helix.

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.699
And then in life DNA is going to be found
in the nucleus and RNA is going to be found

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:56.069
pretty much everywhere that we need it. So
if you're confused on how we go from DNA to

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:00.050
proteins, or if you're really interested in
the whole secret of life I'll put a little

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.139
link to a video I made that kind of talks
you through how we go from DNA to proteins.

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.120
But the last thing I wanted to leave you with
is how important they are. If you're interested

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.219
in RNA and if you're interested in science
and video games, then you may want to check

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:18.650
this out. This is eterna. Eterna is a video
game. I think it's centered at Stanford University

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.000
and basically what they're doing is they're
letting people on the internet build sections

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.060
of RNA. And so basically you build sections
of RNA. They have competitions each week and

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.319
basically the winners each week, they will
make your RNA. So they'll actually synthesize

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.330
and make your section of RNA and then they'll
see how it does. And so I'm going to launch

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.840
the video game and talk you through the first
level. And if you're interested in RNA or

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.689
making things real in biochemistry you may
want to give this a shot. So here's level

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:53.169
one. Basically it's a tutorial so I can click
on next and it will talk me through what I'm

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:56.680
going to do. So you're going to build your
own RNA. Let me click on the next one. The

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.050
RNA is made up of four bases. Hopefully you
know what that means now. Yellow base is adenine.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:09.050
Guanine, uracil and cytosine. And so as a
warm up drill let's convert all the bases

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:13.840
to guanine. So let me click here to start.
So basically what you can do is go down here.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.219
I'm going to get my mutate and I'm going to
mutate this to guanine. I love the music in

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:26.219
here or the little sounds effects. Nice. So
I cleared level 1. And then you can go to

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.590
the next puzzle and we can just, going through,
and so basically on this one what you can

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:36.439
do is they will attract each other. So for
example they're going to say that adenine

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:40.870
and uracil are going to come together and
that guanine and cytosine are going to come

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.620
together. And so basically what you do is
you get to play around with pairing these.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.120
And so I'm going to stop playing the video
game in front of you, but give it a look.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.969
It's a really cool idea. People competing
to make RNA and then they're actually building

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:58.449
it in the real world. And so that's nucleic
acid. It's incredibly important and I hope

00:07:58.449 --> 00:07:58.860
that's helpful.
