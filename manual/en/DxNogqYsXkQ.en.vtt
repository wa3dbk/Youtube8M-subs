Hello there, it's Ruth Sherman, CEO and Celebrity
Speech and Media Coach, but you don't have

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.929
to be famous to work with me!

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:14.040
And, no, I am not, uh, trying to be a ballerina.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.730
No way.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:25.360
And I am also not trying to show off my beautiful,
expensive, new, black leather, over the knee

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.970
Frye boots that I just received from Zappos
and that I have been coveting for at least

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.339
two years.

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:34.339
Uh-uh.

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:38.210
The reason that I bought them on Zappos in
large part was due to a video.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.289
Now, if you shop on Zappos, you know that
they have very good images of many of them,

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:46.079
of all of them, really.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.230
And for a few of the styles, not for all of
them, and for many of fhe styles, they also

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.539
have a video and the interesting thing about
the Zappos videos is that they're done by

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.019
staff members.

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.879
So these people are not professional video
people.

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.979
They're not professional actors.They're actually
the Zappos staff and they have a recording

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:13.049
studio, a video studio and the staff walk
in, and in their very easy-going, casual way

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.369
they wear the shoes.

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.600
They put them on, they walk around in them.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.110
They take them off and they show you what
they look like and there are close-ups and

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.549
that is one of the ways that they sell!

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.969
So here are some statistics that I got actually
through a colleague by the name of Steven

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.640
Washer.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.310
Apparently in 2009, Zappos shot 2,000 videos.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.420
In 2012, last year, just last year, they shot
200,000 videos.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.670
That is about 400 videos per day and they
keep going with it.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.510
Here's the thing: They have shown that their
conversion rate from shoppers to buyers increases

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.219
by 8 to 30 per cent when a shoe has a video.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:03.390
So I would ask you, if you're not doing videos
for your business, why?

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.009
What is stopping you?

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.020
Start getting to the bottom of that and start
doing videos because if we follow great marketers

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.090
like Zappos, they make it very clear how powerful
they are.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.069
I am so glad that Zappos had this video and
it didn't hurt that they were on sale and

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.370
there was exactly one size 6 and a half left.
