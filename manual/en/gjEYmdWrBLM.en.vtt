00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.470
Weekly Update 7

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.470
Hey there.

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.470
Tomas Michaud here.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.390
I've got a few things for you today.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.700
The first I want to start off with I've had
a few people asked me about my new course

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.250
and what's the difference from the course
that I have up now Real Guitar Awesomeness

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.699
so let me go ahead and explain to everybody
in case some other people are wondering as

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:20.699
well.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.029
I'm working on a new course it's called New
Flamenco Spanish Guitar.

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.220
It's a stylistic course specific to the style
of music that I'm best known for.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.870
You might think Gipsy Kings, Ottmar Liebert
it's a Spanish style guitar.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.960
It's not a beginning course.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.460
I'm not going for something really, really
advance but I do wanna be authentic.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.440
I wanna show you the techniques and give you
the tools to play the kind of music that's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.650
the real thing not just some watered down
version so you know, I'm balancing sticking

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.330
to things that are accessible but at the same
time our real stuff.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.080
I'm creating a series of tunes and then showing
you some techniques and then applying them

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.670
to the tune and then going out to the next
tune.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.100
I think it's gonna be really great by the
way.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.680
My Real Guitar Awesomeness course is out now.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.260
It's a fundamental chords with starting from
very scratch, basic chords, strums, how to

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.670
get from one to the other and moving on to
very advance stuff bar chords, more advance

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.110
progression, songs to demonstrate everything,
how to do more advance strums.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.650
A lot of theory, note reading and a lot of
explanation how to practice and how to think.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.250
I really conclude the foundation for any style
of music that you wanna so I hope that helps.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.380
You can check out my Real Guitar Awesomeness
Course.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.960
I put a link below to some more information.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.970
My New Flamenco Spanish Guitar Course, I'm
trying to get it done in time for Christmas,

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.190
we'll see.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.890
It is very time consuming but it's a lot of
fun too.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.409
I've had a request for a reggae type strum
and that's the strum that I do use often and

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.100
I go ahead and taught in this week's update.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.420
I've created a video on how to do a basic
reggae strum.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.820
You can find the link below.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.540
I think, you'll have fun with it.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.310
It's a short video but I get to the point
pretty quick also I have a new song for you

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.440
for those of you who like to learn songs and
it's a pretty easy song it's called House

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:33.020
of the Rising Sun, originally Eric Burdon
I'm recognized mostly but it is an old tune

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.980
that I don't know the original author of it,
old blues tune but it's very fun to play because

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.620
of the chord progression and I'm sure if you
check some tips make it interesting.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.620
I have a link for that below also so that's
it for this week.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.860
I've put links below to everything we talked
about here in this video also I would love

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.210
to read your comments this week.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.920
Leave me some comments below especially if
you have some ideas or requests or things

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.240
you'd like to see in my lessons or in my updates.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.310
I hope you have a great rest of the day if
you're watching this in the morning.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.640
See you next week.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.630
Bye for now.
