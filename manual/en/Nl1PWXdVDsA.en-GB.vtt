00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.500
In this episode of Blue Byte Backstage, we're visiting the Development
Team of „The Settlers Online“

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:12.500
and taking a look behind the scenes of the upcoming updates.

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:14.500
So what's the new content all about?

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:19.500
Let’s check it out right now and get the inside scoop directly from the developers.

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:26.500
One new feature we have is the mountain buff, it's an item you can use on 
rocks and mountains on your island.

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:33.500
If you apply it, it needs a little bit to prepare and when it's done you can
click on the mountain and it will explode.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.500
Of course, when the mountains are gone you have a lot of space for

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:41.500
buildings, and other stuff, and deco buildings, what you want to place there.

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.500
We know that the players need a lot of space on their islands

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:48.500
and we are working on several ways to give the players more space.

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:55.500
The mountain buff is now the first version we release, but more ways
will come to get more space.

00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:58.500
Now that we learned more about the demolition expert,

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.500
we want to turn our focus toward the new Scenarios in the game.

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:03.500
Let’s discover now what they're all about.

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:09.500
The Scenarios, well, they're basically new content we added to the game.

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:13.500
A lot of players actually wished for a more economical challenge

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:17.500
besides expeditions and military adventures.

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:21.500
So we decided to bring the Scenarios, which are basically small stories

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:27.500
in which the player needs to use the economical power to
solve these little stories and conflicts.

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:30.500
As a player, when you visit one of those Scenario islands

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:34.500
usually the first thing you need to do is you need to collect some items

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:36.500
and then you can bring back these items to your kingdom

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:43.500
and in your Provision house, combining this with other resources 
from your island, you can produce buffs.

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:47.500
Then you take these buffs, bring them back to the Scenario 
and you can solve the story.

00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:51.500
On top of that, there's this added factor of, let's say a time challenge.

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:55.500
So depending on the difficulty of the scenario you're playing,

00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:57.500
there might be a harder time challenge for you.

00:01:58.001 --> 00:01:59.500
As you play, you also need to keep an eye out.

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.500
Of course, a lot has been going on in the Settlers Community.

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:09.500
BB_Graubart will get you up to speed with all the news, highlights 
and Settlers stories from the last months.

00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:19.500
Hi, everyone! Although 2015 just started, 2014 was an amazing year with
a very active Settlers Online Community.

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:23.500
Amongst others, we had a very successful prediction league

00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:27.500
during the football World Championship with more than 40000 participants.

00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:31.500
In total the French player Al_Chapone won our prediction league,

00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:36.500
but we had more than 120 players who won nice prizes for their
game account.

00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:43.500
Furthermore in 2014 we were at gamescom in Cologne, so the games fair trade,

00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:50.500
and we had hundreds of visitors who participated in our Q&amp;A sessions with Game Design and Community Team, 

00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:56.500
or just played our game and won some prizes for their game accounts 
or grabed some loot.

00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:00.500
In 2014 we also received dozens of really nice Forum Spotlight contributions.

00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:07.500
As you know, if you post something in our forums, maybe a poem, 
a picture, a painting, whatsoever,

00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:13.500
our community team will pick something and we really had some very
nice contributions.

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:18.500
So we're looking foward to 2015 to see more of your creativity.

00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:25.500
Last but not least, I really want to thank our moderators,
who help on a daily basis all players and the team 

00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:29.500
to create a nice and decent, calm environment in chats and forums,

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.500
and this has some really lovely side effects.

00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:37.500
In 2013 a German couple informed us that they met in TSO.

00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:43.500
Despite the distance of 700 KM, they fell in love, met each other 
and even got married.

00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:47.500
So thank you very much for sharing this story!

00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:57.500
In 2014 a Polish couple contacted us, that they're expecting
a tiny Settlers baby. So all the best for your new family!

00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:05.500
And although 2015 just started, we have another nice love story,
this time coming from the French instance.

00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:07.500
So all the best to both of you!

00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:11.500
And if you also have a nice story connected to The Settlers Online,

00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:14.500

00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:18.500
or just drop a line to our Customer Support who will forward your message.

00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:21.500
Thank you very much for 2014

00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:26.500
and we are looking forward to 2015 and see you in Settlers Online!

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:32.500
On top of all this, the Development Team is also working on a completely new event for you.

00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:34.500
But what exactly is coming up here?

00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:37.500
We've got all the details for you.

00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:41.500
Like every year, we will also have a new Easter Event this year.

00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:44.500
Let's talk about all the new stuff we have in.

00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:46.000
There's really a lot.

00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:50.500
First of all there will be a new event resource, which is called Stripy eggs.

00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:56.500
Don't worry, your old Easter eggs will still be worth something, Paula will tell you all about it in a second.

00:04:57.001 --> 00:05:03.500
But what is very important, we will have one event resource per event
and it will ony be valid for this event.

00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:09.500
This will be the same for all events in the future. Also, what's with the Level 6 upgrade this year, Paula?

00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:20.500
We decided that we want to take the iron chain, so this means the
Iron mine, the Iron smelter and the Iron weaponsmith can be upgraded to level 6 now.

00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:28.500
Another very very new feature and very exciting feature we think is the new Achievement building you can get during the Easter Event.

00:05:29.001 --> 00:05:39.500
This is a building, which will only be available during Easter. You can
upgrade the building by collecting achievement points from achievements, which are specifically designed for Easter.

00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:44.500
They are only available then, and the more points you gather, the bigger will be your Achievement building.

00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:52.500
The Achievement building itself is a residence, and it can inhabit up to 180 Settlers, if you do well on the achievement front.

00:05:53.001 --> 00:06:00.500
In the Easter category, you can find, for Stripy eggs, a new Scenario, which is called "Where do the Easter eggs come from?"

00:06:01.001 --> 00:06:10.500
You can go there on an island and you will recognise that the Easter eggs are in danger, so help to save the next Easter event.

00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:18.500
Also this year, we have a lot of exciting new rewards for you: there's a new general, the Master of Defense and there is a new supplier for PvP.

00:06:19.001 --> 00:06:28.500
Also because he was very popular and you asked for it a lot really on the testservers, we decided that we will give all of you the chance to get another Master of Martial Arts.

00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:30.500
in this year's Easter Event.

00:06:31.001 --> 00:06:35.500
And that brings us directly to the next point, what do you do with all the old
Easter eggs?

00:06:36.001 --> 00:06:42.500
Later this year, we will make a small event, where we open all the old event Shops.

00:06:43.001 --> 00:06:52.500
This means you can use all the old event resources, you collected,
you traded, you have in your stock, and use it for something useful.

00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:59.500
About the limits, we can not make sure that we can open all the limits, but we will investigate in this.

00:07:00.001 --> 00:07:05.500
More information will come, please check our forums, webpage, Facebook,
and twitter.

00:07:06.001 --> 00:07:10.500
We hope you enjoyed the look behind the scenes on what’s to come in “The Settlers Online”

00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:13.500
and we can’t wait to share more in the future

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:16.500
and are looking forward to sharing more awesome Community news.

00:07:17.001 --> 00:08:16.500
