00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:04.890
Hey there, BassResource.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.180
If you remember, you saw us last time at ICAST
2012; where we had the Pro Angler 12 on display.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.250
This is one of our boats that's been rigged
up for a tournament.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.980
The Hobie Fishing World, which was held in
Austin, Texas this year.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.520
So I showed you some of the cool features
last time, but now I want to show you this

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.530
boat's big brother, the Pro Angler 14.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.520
This boat's got an extra 100 pounds of capacity.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.609
It's 2 feet longer and 2 inches wider, so,
600 pounds of capacity.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.620
A great kayak for standing up.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.109
This is one of our cool accessories, the H
Bar.

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:42.059
And what it's designed for is to pull yourself
out of the seat, lean up against it, and make

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.359
some casts when you're standing up.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.289
But it also folds up away really nicely, so
it's out of your way for when you don't want

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.480
to use it.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.639
A couple more cool features about the Pro
Angler 14 are this nice, giant front hatch,

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:00.600
which opens up so you can store all kinds
of stuff in here.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.899
Once again, this boat's powered by our MirageDrive.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.270
So, peddle power, freeing up your hands, and
that just pops right into this well.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.689
You have uh, 6 horizontal rod holders, 3 on
either side of you.

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.070
So you can slide rods in and out really easily.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.880
Underneath the boat, we've integrated the
Lowrance Ready System.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.130
You can't see it, but there's a cavity under
the boat that this plate fits into, that just

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.079
bolts your transducer in there.

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.040
That's a pretty much plug and play deal.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.100
Nice little center hatch right here with tackle
management, you can keep your lures handy

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.159
right in those tackle boxes; as well as some
under seat storage.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.570
You can keep a few more boxes underneath there.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.270
The vantage seat, this thing's ultra-comfortable.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.439
It's the same one you saw in the Pro Angler
12, but it's fully adjustable.

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:58.380
It's got the lumbar support in the back, so
you can spend long hours out on the water

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.380
in this thing.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.920
It's got a high position and a low position,
so you pick your comfort on the water.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.320
The sky's the limit on this thing, you can
rig out all the mounting boards with extra

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.260
rod holders, add a live well, add lights for
visibility, night fishing.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.840
And that's pretty much it.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.959
The Pro Angler 14.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.239
A great fishing boat.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.459
