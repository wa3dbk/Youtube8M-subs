00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
Scientists have determined the pressures produced when penguins pooh -

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.260
and let's just say, they're pretty impressive.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.980
Welcome to the Journal Club: real papers by real scientists.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.600
Today from 'Polar Biology': Pressures when penguin pooh.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.540
It's certainly not easy to determine penguins' poop pressures - in a scientifically accurate way.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.300
as you can probably imagine:

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.300
Hey penguin, it's me, scientist!

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.720
I wanted to ask you something about your stool.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.500
You might have noticed - I've been watching you poop through an HD camera.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.800
and it seems like you're generating pretty impressive pressures -

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.220
I'd like to scientifically quantify these pressures.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.020
If you're free, me and my team could drop by.. say, next Wednesday?

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.980
You know, set up some manometers, viscosimeters...

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.140
....    You are aware, that you must not approach us closer than 5 m - unless you hold a special permit.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Do you hold a special permit?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.180
No...

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.620
That's what I thought. Creep.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.780
It's true, you're not allowed to approach wildlife penguins closer then 5m.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.360
which must be the reason I've never seen a wildlife penguin up close

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.280
This makes it impossible to conduct any poop-related measurements.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.440
But of course this won't discourage a real scientist,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.540
because you can also just calculate the pressures:

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.360
Here's a schematic - I swear, this isn't fake - this is a legit schematic from a legit paper.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.900
The scientists have of course considered every detail:

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:45.540
For example, for pooping, the penguins moves to the edge of the nest, which lies higher than the rest.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:55.080
Equally important, the diameter of the penguin's butthole - which can differ significantly among different kinds of penguins.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.340
So based on those parameters, they derived this formula:

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.660
This is the pressure, considering the poop as an ideal fluid with no loss of energy

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.220
Also, this second formula, considering the poop as a viscous fluid.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:20.180
The calculated pressures are summed up in this graph - different pooh-pressures for different kinds of penguins.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.080
Turns out, pooping penguins can generate pressures up to 60 kPa.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.300
In comparison, constipated humans only produce pressures of around 13 kPa.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.940
For us, high pressures during pooping wouldn't be a big advantage, anyway, because we have toilets.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.060
Actually, it would be quite uncomfortable.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.880
Penguins, however, want to expel their feces as far away from the nest as possible.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.700
There's a remark on this in the conclusions,

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.540
saying penguin could be even more effective in flinging their poop away from the nest,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.300
if they would expel their projectiles in an 45° angle upwards.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.860
But of course, penguins can't do that, because unlike other birds,

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.620
because of their ... straight... box-like.. shape.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.680
I mean, how would that even work? ...

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.220
45° is not going to happen for penguins.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:27.520
And finally, I wanna share my 3 favorite text excerpts:

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.100
This was an excerpt from the introduction.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.760
reminding us of this work's relevance.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.060
Because apparently, anyone who has ever watched a penguin pooh has thought to themselves:

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.200
Gosh I wonder if there's scientific data...

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.200
#2...

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:17.180
Whether streaks or blobs of poop are produced, is not only scientifically replicable, but definitely worth mentioning.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.940
And finally, actually, the whole ending of this paper:

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.040
To sum it up: Today we've learned that our obsession with penguins is out of control.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.680
Read the whole paper, the link is in the description.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.860
Tune in for the next Journal Club!
