00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.759
hello everyone, this is a short review
of a smartphone

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.630
Chinese smartphone, dual sim
it's called Walsun S1

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.049
I just recently bought it on pandawill
for

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.359
120 bucks, nice sum of money for a nicely looking

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.539
powerful smartphone running on top

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.800
of the android version 4.2.1

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.970
you see the headset, it isn't very good in
terms of build quality

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.020
however its quite decent in terms of

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.420
the speaker and mic quality

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.430
USB cable very short

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.680
two batteries included into the package, each one is

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.570
2800mAh

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.570
seem to be quite capacious ones

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.380
here is the usb charger, as you see
it consists of

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.520
two parts, not very convenient actually

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.490
there is also a white case included into the package

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.490
I think there is no major problems with
it whatsoever

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.090
there are two slots for sim cards as
well as

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.220
one slot for micro SD

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.060
memory stick... the speaker sound

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.240
is sufficient, not yelling but

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.240
it's loud enough

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.369
the phone itself feels hard and solid

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:04.369
seems to be of a good assembly quality

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.700
it runs on top of a quad-core CPU

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.400
and a powerful video-chip with already
established

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.200
reputation, but unfortunately I didn't
have an opportunity to

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.200
double check its gaming experience.
The screen is kind of

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.250
bright as you can see, however I don't
think

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.450
this phone has any ambient light
sensor so

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.550
the brightness isn't auto
adjustable

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.579
you have to change it manually every
time

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.969
the screen seems to be based on the IPS
technology

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.310
judging from the viewing angles it actually managed to demonstrate

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.310
its resolution is 960 to 540

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.040
it's kind of an easy-peasy workload

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.400
for the powerful platform underneath. 
For voice calls

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.060
you can choose among different
strategies

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.239
for using 2 sim cards, for instance you

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.260
can just let the device ask you

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.569
every time before each call which card
is to be used

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.950
or you can just once select the main
SIM card

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.269
which will be used for all the future
calls

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.060
automatically

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.140
the device's quite fluid, everything is

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.230
smooth and lag-free

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.709
You see the standard browser doesn't showcase any difficulties

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.160
great experience in my personal opinion

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.370
nonetheless please take into the account
this device has just

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.620
half a gigabyte of RAM

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.980
in some situations that could make a
difference

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.220
regarding assisted GPS, there is no such a module in this device

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.020
so it's... as far as I understand it tries
to determine the current location

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.850
just basing on the mobile networks
available. In this particular case it

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.350
found itself

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.310
quite precisely. But I don't think
this device actually could be used

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:21.080
as a car navigation system

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.620
here I'm just trying to show

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.600
that the device is fast indeed, I think
it's

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.810
quite sufficient for any typical user
like myself

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.070
and you see here is a side-bar, left
hand side

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.100
it could actually be disabled but for
some people I believe it

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.020
could come in handy

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.580
as you probably understand the device
wasn't used

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.580
for any prolonged period of time so
I have no comments on

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.680
its durability, on the screen glass quality, etc

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.260
on the internet you can find some Antutu
benchmark results

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.680
for this device. According to them it got
13,500

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.220
I just wanted to double check this
results

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:30.220
for myself, just to make sure that my
device has got something very similar

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.500
and as you see the result is decent indeed

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.500
that is it, thank you for

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.190
watching and thank you for listening
