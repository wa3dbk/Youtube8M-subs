00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.470
My report is all about giving parents the
power to be parents. What they’ve told us

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.980
in the course of the last six months is that
they want to be given that role of parents.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.020
They don’t really want lots and lots of
legislation round them. They want us, however,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.320
to take away some of the barriers that stop
them being good parents.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.929
One thing that parents told us was that they
were really concerned about some of the advertising

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:29.599
that’s in public space, by that I mean on
the sides of buses, bus shelters, and in posters

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.210
and the like. Parents were very unhappy at
some of the imagery used in them. So what

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.239
we’re recommending is the ASA, the Advertising
Standards Authority, take action to ensure

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.769
that sexualised imagery is really not in areas
where there are large numbers of children

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:47.989
who will visit that area.

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.829
Parents have told us that they have traditional
regulations around things called the watershed

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.410
so that at – or before 9 o’clock, there
are very clear rules about what can and can’t

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.479
be shown on television, both terrestrial and
satellite television. But some parents feel

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.630
that that’s now gone away. In fact it hasn’t.
It just seems that parents’ views have not

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.090
really had the weighting that they deserve
there. My recommendation is that the voice

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.220
of parents is given rather more weight when
er, the, when the research that normally takes

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.790
place around views of the general public,
that parents voices are heard, that they’re

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.960
given more weight if you like.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.950
A primary concern that parents came up to
us with was the availability of very adult material

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.700
on internet enable devices, whether it be
mobile phones, laptops, computers, or even

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.390
games consoles. What we’re actually saying
is that people actually need to make a definitive

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.329
choice that they will access that material,
so rather than just simply a terms and conditions

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.450
box coming up, which we all tend to tick to
get onto the next screen, there are very definite

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.890
questions that says ‘Do you want to access
adult material?’

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.899
What they wanted was to make it a lot easier
to know that they were accessing that material

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.579
or not. They wanted it much clearer. Most
of us, when we turn things on, leave things

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.899
on default settings and we’re saying that
actually it should be a very distinctive choice

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.690
you make whether you access this material
or not.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.530
One of the comments that parents made most
often was that they were concerned about the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:23.940
content and wording of music videos. Many
of them were quite surprised and shocked at

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.590
how demeaning they were to girls and how they gave
boys very unrealistic expectations about girls.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.780
And they are at the moment exempt from
the Video Recordings Act. That’s not a deliberate

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.730
thing. That’s simply something that’s
happened over time because at the time that

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.599
Act was produced, there weren’t such a thing
as music videos. We believe that they should

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:50.300
become within that scope of that Act and so
they should be age-rated. What that will mean

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.110
is not a huge number of changes for the number
of videos that are bought because actually

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.760
they are relatively small, but we think it
sends a very, very clear signal out to broadcasters

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.760
and the industry that says we don’t really
accept that very sexually explicit videos,

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.519
or words that are very sexually explicit,
really should be encompassed into general

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.549
viewing.

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.760
One of the things that became very clear was
that actually we all live in a very sexualised

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.379
environment. I don’t know why that’s happened
but it just simply has. And it affects all

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.510
of us, whether we’re adults or children.
And the point is we barely notice anymore;

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.769
it’s almost become the wallpaper of our
lives. But it is a slow drift if you like

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.730
into a much more sexualised environment. So
anything this review does really want to address

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.769
that issue of do we really wants to just drift
into this ever-more sexualised environment

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.090
that we live in. So it affects all of us as
responsible adults as well as children.
