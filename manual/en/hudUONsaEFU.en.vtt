00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:01.989
Hi.

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:07.919
I want to show you how to populate a simple
job in SAS Data Integration Studio.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.009
In the process, I'll add a transformation,
a source table, and a target table to an empty

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:20.710
job.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.660
As you can see, my empty job has already been
opened on the desktop.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.290
The job will be populated in the Diagram tab
that is located in the Job Editor window.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.500
First, I’ll select the Sort transformation
from the Data folder in the Transformation

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.500
tree.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:50.700
Then, I’ll drag and drop the transformation
onto the Diagram tab.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.010
The next step is to locate the Source table
in the Inventory tree.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.750
Now that I’ve found the source table, which
is named ALL_EMP,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.310
I can drag and drop it on to the diagram tab
in front of the Sort transformation.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.130
Do you see the blue icon that I’ve moved
the mouse over?

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.810
The tooltip indicates that the source table
is a SAS database table.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.850
There are similar icons for the other kinds
of tables.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.250
Now I’ll connect a data flow line between
the source table and the Sort transformation.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.280
I’m simply mousing over the right side of
the source table and drawing a line between

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.750
the output port of the source table and the
input port of the transformation.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.399
It’s time to add a target table to the job.

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.299
Right-click the temporary output table that
is attached to the Sort transformation.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:59.639
Then, click the Replace option in the pop-menu.

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:03.159
The Replace option displays the Table Selector
window.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:10.300
I’ll click the Inventory tab and open the
Tables folder to see all of my tables.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.530
Because I have so many of them, I’ll type
the first few letters of my target table,

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.500
which is EMP_SORT, to populate it in the Selected
table field.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.640
Once I click OK, I’ll see the target table
on the Diagram tab.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.170
Note that I don’t have to connect the target
table to the Sort transformation.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.520
That’s a nice bonus from using the Replace
option.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.190
By the way, the Replace and Register table
options are generally better than deleting

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.620
the temporary table and dragging in an existing
permanent table.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.620
This is because the existing mappings are
preserved when you use these options.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.290
Finally, I want to clean up the flow.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.550
First, I’ll straighten the lines between
the objects in the flow and pull the objects

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.930
closer together.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.930
Then, I’ll select the entire flow and move
it to a different position on the Diagram

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.260
tab.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.040
These changes will be saved the next time
that I save the job.
