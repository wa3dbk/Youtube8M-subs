00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.920
Alan's birthday is next Saturday.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.620
Really? I don't think so.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.780
Yeppers. He's gonna be 40.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.880
Wow...

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.280
That is so weird.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.180
My baby brother is going to be 40.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.440
How old are you?
- 39.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.300
So... So, it's just us, right?

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.020
Of course it's just us. Who else would it be?

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.880
Oh, I don't know. My friends, family...

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.180
A close-up magician.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.340
Oh, darn. What gave it away?

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.860
Well, when I left the house, Jake was taking a shower, Charlie had on long pants

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.520
and Berta said she had to quit early because she was going to some loser's birthday party.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.260
Oh, good. I had her down as a maybe.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.320
Promise you'll act surprised.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.320
This is so nice.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.740
A private, intimate dinner for just the two of us-

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.480
Oh my god, you guys...

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.240
There's nobody here.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.020
I don't understand it, I told them to be here an hour ago.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.820
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do...

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.240
My family are a bunch of thoughtless, selfish butt wipes.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.820
Surprise.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.840
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.660
I want to thank you all for coming to celebrate this wonderful occasion.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.280
I thought it was Alan's birthday.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.140
Now it's time to say a few words about the guest of honor.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.000
I can think of a few words.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.740
Not only is he a terrific doctor and a fantastic boss...

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.720
He is also good and kind and smart and funny...

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.780
And...

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.660
A really swell kisser.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.520
I can still hear you.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.340
Alright, well, now that we're all here

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.340
why don't we take turns saying something about Alan

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.580
and how much he means to us.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.200
Oh, okay Jake, you wanna start?

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.120
No, I've got to go make room for cake.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.760
Alright.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
Eh, Berta! Why don't you get the ball rolling?

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.020
Sure.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.260
What the hell.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.420
Zippy...

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.500
I've got to tell you. When you first moved in, I didn't really care for you.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.460
You were a persnickety, self-righteous, smug son of a bitch.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.640
And now, here we are, six years later.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.020
Thank you.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.940
Hear, hear!

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.080
O- Okay. Anyone else?

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.860
Alan, darling.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.280
You were always the good son.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.980
Of course, your brother didn't set the bar very high.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.540
Hear- Wait a minute!

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.460
Charlie, do you want to say anything?

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.960
Alright.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.600
Alan.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.380
You're my little brother.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.380
And I know, over the years I've tormented you.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.120
I've embarrassed you in public.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.520
I've tied you to street lights, car bumpers...

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.520
the occasional angry animal.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.440
Oh, and remember that Fourth of July when I used your ass as a launch pad for my bottle rockets?

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.820
Anyway. I guess, what I'm trying to say is...

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.120
Thanks for the memories.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.780
That's... That's it?

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.600
That's all you have to say?

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.660
I suppose I could talk about his bed-wetting.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.240
You people are horrible.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.240
No, honey, it's okay.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.020
No, no, no, no. It's not okay.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.880
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.180
This is a warm and wonderful human being and he deserves more. Especially from his family.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.180
I don't even know why you guys showed up tonight.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.440
Well, I can't speak for anybody else, but I'm getting overtime.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.420
Come on, Alan. We're leaving.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.880
Really? Before the cake?

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.920
You don't need people who don't appreciate you.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.600
Eh, well, no, but I do kinda need Charlie's house.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.980
No, you don't. You'll come live with me and Mom.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.820
Right, Mom?

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.480
You know, I did spend a summer in Yosemite doing shrooms

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.840
so maybe I wasn't an official forest ranger.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.300
Let's go. Mom, we're leaving.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.380
Okay.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.440
I'm sorry, this is the best bread I ever had.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.620
Who likes magic?

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.160
I shaved for this?
