Hi I'm Melody on behalf of Expert Village
today I'm going to show you how to make a

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:13.650
deep fry snickers bar. Alright our ingredients
are 3 eggs ours look a little smaller because

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:23.510
we are just making a smaller portion. 2 cups
of milk, 4 cups of flour, a 1/3 cup of sugar

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:31.070
which I have already put in there and a little
bit of salt say about a 1/4 of a tablespoon,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:38.230
a little bit of baking powder. It depends
on how many you are making so if you need

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:46.520
to get a exact receipt you are just going
to have to count and add to it. Alright I'm

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:57.770
mixing all of my dry ingredients and I'm mixing
my egg with my milk and I will stirring both

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:33.090
combinations and then putting them together
to make a batter.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:43.700
Alright I just because I'm pretty picky about
how my batter is I think what I'm going to

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:53.390
do put this in slowly to make sure that I
have not got it to thin. Depending on your

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.880
temperature, your altitude, how much humidity
is in the air it really does change the texture

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:12.030
of your batter.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.260
This is going to take you a few minutes to
make sure that it is blended really well.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:27.420
Sort of like the consistency of pancake batter
when you are finish. Alright is the batter

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:35.480
it looks really nice it would stick to the
snicker bar. And you could use your hands,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:46.520
your tongs jsut do be careful your dealing
with hot oil. I'm just going to do this one.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.349
Alright this is a frozen snickers now covered
in batter and I'm goign to get ready here

00:02:52.349 --> 00:03:04.319
to stick it to the deep fryer and see what
happens. Getting the basket to drop slowly

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.989
and I'm making sure that it does not stick
to the bottom. And I will take it in just

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.850
a few minutes keep a eye on it and make sure
that it doesn't melt. Alright we are going

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.860
to take it out now it has been in there for
2 1/2 minutes and it is kicking out alot of

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:33.741
noise in there but I waited to it got golden
brown and the batter is now coating all of

00:03:33.741 --> 00:03:42.270
that nice snicker. There you go deep fry snickers.
Next segment stick around we are going to

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.240
show you deep fry onion rings.
