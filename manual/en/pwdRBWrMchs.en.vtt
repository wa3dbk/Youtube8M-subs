Style Advice Older Man

00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:02.269
Hi!

00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:04.140
I'm Antonio Centeno, the founder of Real Men
Real Style.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.960
Today I'm going to be answering the question,
"How should an older man dress?"

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.290
Basically, I received an email from a gentleman.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.900
He's in his 60s and he's asking me, "Antonio,
how should I dress?"

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.290
Now, I want to let you know that this is brought
to you by Kirby over at the Hanger Project.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.360
Kirby runs his company at Dallas, Texas.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.640
It's a great company.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.760
In fact, what Kirby does is he scours the
globe looking for the best products in menswear

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.760
to bring you.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.060
So he's got some amazing socks coming out
of Italy, ties coming out of Italy.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.980
He makes some amazing hangers.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.140
In fact, he's got a really great story.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.400
A University of Texas alum realized that there
are not great hangers out there for the suits

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.800
and trousers out there that men are spending
thousands of dollars on.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.690
So he went off and he started a company.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.410
I really admire what Kirby is doing.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.100
If you haven't checked out his company, just
go check it out because you'll be amazed at

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.242
the quality of products that are out there.

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:59.469
If you get tired of going to places like Target
and Walmart and just seeing really the disposable

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.239
stuff that they try to sell, go check out
what Kirby has.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.570
You will be amazed.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.759
He's got things there which you'll pass on
to your son that will last you a lifetime.

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.530
The question that came in to me is, "Antonio,
I noticed that all the clothing out there

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.740
is for young men.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.240
I'm a 60-year-old man.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.329
How should I dress?

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.860
I want to go out and enjoy a night on the
town.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.789
What do you suggest that I wear?"

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.619
So a gentleman sent me that question.

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.670
I really want to address but first let me
talk about some of the problems.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.770
A lot of older guys in their 50s and 60s are
getting laid off and they're finding -- they're

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.020
out there and it's hard.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.939
They're competing against guys who are half
their age, who will take half the salary.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:41.939
It's a tough world.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.140
In addition, there are guys that worked 25
to 30 years, Master Sergeant, First Sergeant,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.009
gets out of the army and he finds it -- he's
worked 25, 30 years of his life away.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.459
He's still single because the army didn't
issue him a wife.

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.419
Okay, that was supposed to be funny.

00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:01.979
But in any case, they're finding they're at
this age, they're out there competing with

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.609
younger men, how should they dress?

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:04.609
How should they present themselves?

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.619
Well, I'm going to give them a number of things.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.931
I'm going to take about five things in particular
which I would recommend for an older man.

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:12.931
1.

00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:13.931
Do Not Try To Dress Like A Young Man

00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:16.290
The number one thing is, do not try to dress
like a 20-year-old.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.250
Do not try to dress like a teenager.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.160
A lot of guys, especially I hear this from
guys getting out of the military.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.440
They're in their late 40s and they find that
they have the same clothing that they wore

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440
when they entered.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.861
They have that REO Speedwagon shirt, yup,
they still got that because they picked it

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.910
up at the concert back in 1988.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.580
Okay, guys, if that's the case, you really
want to upgrade and you don't want to, yeah,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.660
you don't want to dress like a 20 or 30-year-old.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.780
Do not wear the torn up jeans.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.810
If you're in your 30s, you probably shouldn't
be wearing torn up True Religion jeans.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.740
You want to be wearing age-appropriate clothing.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.740
What is that?

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.140
Let me get in to number two.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.140
2.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.310
Find Brands That Suit You

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.310
Find brands that suit you.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.950
If you're in your 60s, your body is starting
to change.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.320
The levels of testosterone are starting to
go down a little.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.790
If you're working out, eating red meat, taking
care of yourself, they could remain up.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.400
But you're probably finding that your body
is shifting.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.150
You want pants that suit you, perhaps have
a little bit higher rise.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.290
Go see my friend, Casey Golden.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.570
She's over at The Butt Therapist and she's
going to recommend you in the interview we

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.570
did.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.570
She talked about Zegna jeans.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.440
You can do a quick search on jeans for the
older men.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.440
I talked about this.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.819
But you want to find brands which suit your
age.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.620
So go to the finer menswear stores.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.620
Talk to them.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.770
You don't have to buy from them.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.160
Talk to them and learn from these guys.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.880
That was number two, find brands.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.069
Number one, don't dress like a teenager.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.069
3.

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.069
Be Aware: Society Has Expectations

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.800
The other one and number three is understand
that society has expectations and that society

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.370
stereotypes you.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.270
People look at you and they make this quick
decision.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.440
As an older man, they're looking to you for
leadership.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.890
They're looking -- you have a place in society
and don't try to fight that.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.790
Use it to your advantage.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.970
Women are attracted to older men.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.390
I know I married one.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.990
No, I married a younger woman, not an older
man.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.389
Okay, guys, that came out wrong.

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:19.389
That was number three.

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.389
Let's go to number four.

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.389
4.

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.949
Own The Latest Technology

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.039
Own the latest technology.

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.360
Why is it important for you to have the latest
iPhone or the latest Android or to be sporting

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.729
a pretty good laptop?

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:38.110
Because you -- there is a stereotype out there
that older men aren't able to keep up on technology.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:49.229
So if you're talking about that Facebook thing
or that YouTube thingamajig or the Twitter,

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.889
you want to understand that technology.

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.120
So spend some time, understand the technology.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.740
Carry a nice new phone.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.320
You don't have to use everything on it.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.979
The reason you want to do that is you want
to, if you go into a meeting and you're surrounded

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.639
by a bunch of 20-year-olds, you want to be
able to put your phone on the table or your

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.770
iPad and for them to understand, yes, without
saying a word, you say that "I am up on technology.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.509
I have the latest gear.

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:18.590
You don't have to try to school me on it.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.590
Let's get to business."

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.590
5.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.590
Experiment With The Classics

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.259
The final thing, tip number five gentlemen,
is experiment with the classics.

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.189
I know you're not in your 20's anymore.

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:34.150
You're not getting a mohawk, not coloring
your hair but what you can do is you can introduce

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.780
a Panama hat.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.599
You can look at a Guayabera.

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.300
You can start to wear gray flannel trousers.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:46.090
Those have been around for 50, 75, 100 years
and they're going to continue to be around.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.509
They looked great on your father and your
grandfather.

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.779
I don't know if your father wore them but
your grandfather probably rocked them.

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:55.020
So don't be afraid to experiment with the
classics.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.729
All right, those are my five tips for a gentleman
over the age of 60, if you're in your 50s,

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.710
for the older gentleman to dress sharp.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.080
Hope you enjoyed them and definitely go check
out the Hanger Project and say hi to Kirby

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.360
when you go visit him.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.360
Take care.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.360
I see you guys in the next video.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.361
Bye-bye.
