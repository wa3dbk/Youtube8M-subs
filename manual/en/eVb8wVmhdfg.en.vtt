Hi, everybody. Channel Beauty Ksu is again with you.

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:07.730
As always I check all recipes of beauty on myself.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.110
And today I want to check the next mask - hair lamination at home.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.369
There are two variants of lamination on my channel already,

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.199
and today I want to check the third one.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.199
You may choose any of three options.

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.230
At the end of this video you can choose and watch the first and second lamination.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.489
For the 3-rd lamination we need: gelatin (without it you cannot do),

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.300
any oil, for example olive, burdock, castor, oil solution of vitamin E and hair balm.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.690
We take 1 tbsp. of gelatin and dilute it with 2 tablespoons of boiled water,

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:57.600
then stir to make a homogeneous mixture and leave it to cool down.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.890
When gelatin cools down, it will look as jelly.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.860
Then we take 1 tablespoon of olive oil,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.659
we warm it up, and add in it the oil solution of vitamin E - 1 tsp. and 2 tablespoons of usual hair balm.

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:31.450
It is possible to add unnecessary balm.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:47.320
We apply the mask on dry dirty hair

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.909
because after procedure we will wash hair anyway as the mask contains

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.149
a lot of oil and it won't be washed up without shampoo.

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.860
It's very important to know that all masks with gelatin

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.969
need to be washed away with cool water because in hot water gelatin is dissolved.

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.470
We mix all components and we add gelatin to the composition.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:18.310
As for me I didn't manage to stir it well therefore

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.280
it is possible to melt gelatin in a microwave for a little.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.430
The composition should be a little bit liquid.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:41.960
We apply the mask from the roots and on the whole length.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:56.810
You should stay with this mask for an hour.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:06.120
Apply the mask on each strand of hair separately.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.060
Gelatin has to seal the split ends,

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.970
make hair more elastic and brilliant.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.460
The effect from gelatinous masks keeps on hair about a month.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:29.530
If you often wash the head, or use the hair dryer and the iron often,

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.670
the duration of the mask effect decreases.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:42.230
During application gelatin stiffens at once,

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:51.460
the hair turns into such "icicle".

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.680
After application of the mask we put on a polyethylene hat,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.490
I wrap up the head with the towel.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:11.290
And once again I remind - we wash away the mask with cool water.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.030
As for effect. I am very happy.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:32.070
From all three recipes most of all I liked this recipe.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.910
Hair became heavier and easier to cope with, there came a volume and gloss.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.910
The whipped tips are almost invisible.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.120
Hair took the accurate form. I am happy.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.720
And you may try all three variants, choose a mask which will be pleasant for you, and will suit your hair.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.690
Try it.
