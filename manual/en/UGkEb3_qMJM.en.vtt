00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.560
Your success story starts here.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.685
Get involved in as
many things as you can.

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:16.059
It's not just
about your degree--

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.380
it's about what differentiates
you from other students.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.670
Nottingham Trent
University encourages

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.450
students, like Ayodeji,
to fulfil his ambitions.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.450
You're encouraged to
use your initiative

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.550
and to create your
own opportunities.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.840
It's a great confidence
boost and a good start

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.466
to your career.

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:41.930
We develop students, like
Sophie, who are resourceful

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.140
and want to succeed.

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:49.050
You've got to put the
work in at the beginning,

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.175
and then you're going to
reap the rewards later on.

00:00:51.175 --> 00:00:53.510
So just work as hard as
you can but still have fun.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.960
We support those, like Carl, who
have the inspiration and flare

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.810
to innovate.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.637
To be able to do what I love
on the side of my studies

00:01:06.637 --> 00:01:07.470
has been incredible.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.570
It's a real honour to represent
the uni for equestrian riding

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.740
events.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.050
We inspire students,
like Marina,

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.020
to develop a competitive edge.

00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:24.250
I've been volunteer work,
and I've been studying hard

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.395
at university, and it's
helping me piece together

00:01:26.395 --> 00:01:28.360
the things I'm going
to need to help

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.880
with my career in the future.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.960
We nurture the
public-spirited, like Ashley,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.906
to achieve their career goals.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.740
The academics and
the technicians

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.870
have a great body of
knowledge and have just

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.890
given me the confidence
to be a theatre designer.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.000
We stimulate the creativity
and success of award winners,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.670
like Dorrie.

00:02:04.502 --> 00:02:07.800
Any student coming
to NTU should be

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.780
prepared to meet an
inspirational learning

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.950
environment.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.640
We enhance the expertise
and leadership qualities

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.170
of students like Abdul.

00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.860
It's been amazing
to meet students

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.080
from different countries,
different cultures,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.500
and making a sort of new family.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.050
We're always here to make
sure students, like Shraddha,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:41.330
feel at home

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.040
There's endless
opportunities here,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.480
and the key thing is just to get
involved and be a part of it.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.650
And we try to be
ambition and success

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.160
of students like Russell.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.830
Create your own success story.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.680
