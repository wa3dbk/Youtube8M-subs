00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.059
&gt;&gt;ANCHORS: RIT hockey has become a big deal
in town. The games at Ritter Arena are always

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:10.740
sold out. So what is it like to watch the
Tigers play? Our sports crew got a chance

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.199
to take you inside RIT hockey this week. Sports
director Mike Catalana is here with an all-access

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.640
look.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.780
&gt;&gt;REPORTER: Yeah, Doug and Ginny, RIT hockey
at Ritter is a unique sports experience in

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.520
Rochester. The place is packed, the fans are
loud, the band plays and the team wins. If

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.470
you've been, you know what we're talking about.
If you haven't, this all-access pass to Tigers

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.009
hockey should give you an idea.

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:38.609
&gt;&gt;BAND LEADER: 1-2, 1-2-3!

00:00:38.609 --> 00:01:02.909
&gt;&gt;[band plays]

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.909
&gt;&gt;TV COMMENTATOR: Feel great! Big broadcast,
big game!

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.059
&gt;&gt;[locker room music]

00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:18.059
&gt;&gt;FANS: Give me a "E!" E! Give me an "R!"
R! Give me an "S!" S! What's that spell? Tigers!

00:01:18.059 --> 00:01:26.670
I can't hear you! Tigers! They can't hear
you! Tigers! Where are they from? R-I-T! R-I-T!

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.670
&gt;&gt;COACH: Play with an attitude here! We've
got to get that attitude back. We're the aggressors,

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.400
we're bringing it, we're not waiting for anything
to happen. We're making things happen here.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.370
&gt;&gt;ANNOUNCER: Here are your R-I-T Tigers!

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.620
&gt;&gt;[horn blows, cheering]

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
&gt;&gt;COACH: Hit the net!

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:56.969
&gt;&gt;[fans cheer, horn blows]

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.319
&gt;&gt;BIG GOON: Let's go Tigers! Tigers, let's
go!

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.569
&gt;&gt;[ref's whistle blows]

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:18.120
&gt;&gt;COACH: Everyone onboard! Good third period.
They came back on Union and scored three.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.120
They've come back before. We've got to put
the pedal down and put them away. Be a third

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.000
period team now!

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.560
&gt;&gt;[fans clapping]

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.779
&gt;&gt;COACH: Smitty, you've got Max. Jenda, you've
got Box.

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:40.480
&gt;&gt;FANS: Ohhh! Ohhh!

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.290
&gt;&gt;FANS: Yeah!

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.090
&gt;&gt;[horn blows]

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.799
&gt;&gt;[ref's whistle blows]

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.409
&gt;&gt;REFEREE: Aww! [whistle blows]

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.409
&gt;&gt;LINESMAN: Where'd you get it, man? Where
did you get it?

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.000
&gt;&gt;REFEREE: In the gut.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.269
&gt;&gt;COACH: Let's just go! Drop and play.

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.879
&gt;&gt;[buzzer sounds, fans cheer]

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.620
&gt;&gt;COACH: Real good effort. We had to grind
out at the beginning, but it's important that

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.430
we finish off what we're starting here. We've
won three of our last four? Three of our last

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.650
four. Let's make it four out of five here.
Okay? League play. Let's start getting on

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.189
a streak here, start moving up the ladder
on the thing. We've got a lot of hard work.

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.540
&gt;&gt;FANS: R-I-T! R-I-T!

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.849
&gt;&gt;REPORTER: Our Chuck Wade did the editing
on that piece. He along with Toby Monteka

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.230
and Mark Schuman did the shooting. There's
an extended version of the story on 13WHAM.com.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.249
The Tigers in Niagara tonight. The next home
game a week from tonight. I wanted to emphasize

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:50.450
&gt;&gt;ANCHOR: Ginny and I want to know how's the
ref?

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.859
&gt;&gt;REPORTER: No referees were injured in the
making of that piece. No, he took a shot.

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:54.900
&gt;&gt;ANCHOR: Yeah, you heard that.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.790
&gt;&gt;REPORTER: That's a tough guy, and he got
up and joked about it. Some of the things,

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.419
while he was on microphone, we couldn't repeat
that he had said, but we appreciate everybody

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.129
at RIT letting us inside a little bit.

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.680
&gt;&gt;ANCHOR: Very cool look inside. Thanks Mike!
