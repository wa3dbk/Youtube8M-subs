00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.850
Hey hows it going guys, Kris here and in this
video, ill show you all the different weapon

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.969
sights youll be able to attach onto your guns
in battlefield hardline and how they look

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.390
whist theyre being used.
Ill go over all of the close ranged optics

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.070
to begin with
So first up is the iron sights, use the weapons

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.380
built in iron sights, every gun pretty much
has these and come built into them so you

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.369
wont have to buy these, though they will look
different on each gun, some are a bit more

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.530
obstructive than others.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.510
Next is the reflex, red dot sight with a bright
aiming point and clear sight picture for rapid

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.530
target acquisition and tracking, now although
it says its red dot sight, it actually lies,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.290
and its more like a yellow triangle sight,
the triangle is quite big so it could be a

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.320
bit harder to be more accurate at range.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.040
Then theres the kobra, Russian reflex sight
with a t bar reticle designed for CQB that

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.430
keeps the point of aim clear, now this is
a fan favourite from other battlefield games

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.230
that makes a return to hardline, the way the
lines are positioned on the sight make it

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.950
clear to see and enables you to line up some
better shots at different ranges.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.380
The holo sight, a holographic open sight for
up to mid-range engagements. The reticle features

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.250
a .65 MOA ring with a 1 MOA dot. Its Similar
to the red dot sights though the holo zooms

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.561
in slightly, and has a ring around its dot.
This might help guide some people though it

00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:26.350
may be more of an obstruction for others.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.819
Next up is the Comp M4S, a modern close combat
optic, the comp M4S has a battery compartment

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:38.119
located low on one side to power the red dot
reticle, this sight I find is one of the clearest

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.530
sights for close to medium range, if youre
a fan of the coyote sight from battlefield

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.509
4, give this a try, I find it to be quite
good at most ranges.

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.030
The micro t1, a lightweight rugged red dot
sight, the micro t1 is a great choice for

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.829
a short range optic. This sight is similar
to the last one though its smaller and gives

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.369
you less vision around your reticle, this
might be better in cqc to help eliminate any

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.590
distraction when aiming but I find that the
extra vision is usually more helpful.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.190
The SRS 02 is a sealed reflex sight that takes
up little rail space and has a green 1.75

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.250
MOA dot for aiming. This is basically a green
dot sight, similar to the others but with

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.230
a different colour.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.170
Next is the PK-AS, a Russian unmagnified holographic
sight with excellent light gathering capabilities

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.640
and a clear field of view, this sight is quite
easy to see through and it also zooms a tiny

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.290
bit in ads like the holo does.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.459
The IRNV, infrared night vision scope that
makes heat signatures visible in low light,

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.220
vulnerable to blinding effects. Now the range
is actually fairly decent with the irnv, targets

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.909
glow an orangey-yellow colour and are quite
easy to spot, though you have a lower field

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.560
of view as you cant see around the edges of
the sight.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.530
The FLIR is a thermal sight with white hot
on cold black view mode and 2x magnification,

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.570
very vulnerable to blinding effects. This
is a bit like the IRNV but targets glow white

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.760
on a dark background, it also zooms in twice
as much as a standard sight.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.090
So thats all the close quarters sight, next
wel take a look at the medium range optics,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.239
First is the M145, this is a fixed power 3.4x
Machine gun optic designed for medium to long

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.349
range engagements, this is quite clear, it
has a similar 3 line style to the kobra sight

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:28.160
but zooms in by 3.4x, though it does has quite
a few marking that might be distracting to

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.060
some users.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.930
Next is the PO sight, a 3.5x scope with a
circle-and-dot reticle designed for medium

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.599
to long range engagements, it has a similar
zoom distance to the M145 sight but looks

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.099
more like the holo in terms of its circle
and dot markings, its also quite clear to

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.719
see through.

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:51.689
The ACOG sight is a fixed-power 4x advanced
combat optic gunsight for use in broght to

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.590
low light at medium range, this has a little
red circle in the centre of the sight without

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.030
many other markings, so its quite clear to
see through and fairly easy to track targets.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.380
And lastly we have the PSO-1 sight, its a
fixed 4x advanced combat optic gunsight for

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.690
use in bright to low light at medium range,
the PSO has an arrow for its reticle, its

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.470
quite easy to see though but there is a few
markings that might be distracting for some

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.470
users.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.040
Now im gonna go over the long range sights
that youll be able to equip in Hardline, these

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.040
will mainly be for snipers.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:30.500
First is the TA 648, this is a 6x magnification
self-luminous tactical rifle sight with ballistic

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.530
drop compensator incorporated in the reticle,
this is the least magnified long range sight,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.450
it also has a red dot for its reticle.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:44.240
Next is the PKS-07, a 7x magnification Russian
marksman daylight scope for engaging targets

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.350
over long distances. It feature the upwards
pointing arrows that a lot of the russion

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.939
sights have and gives you a little bit more
zoom than the TA 648 scope.

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.720
Then theres the rifle scope, a US-made 8x
magnification rifle scope with ballistic drop

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.650
compensator to aid in long range fire. This
is the most expensive of the long range scopes

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.120
and has a cross like crosshair making it easy
to see and hit enemies far away.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.620
And last is the hunter, a high magnification
14x scope for accurate shooting in long range

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.389
situations. These optics has the most zoom
from all the long range scopes and is best

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.050
for shooting targets from very long distances
more accurately.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.569
Now thats pretty much all the optics for most
guns though theres a couple more for pistols

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:30.450
and small guns and secondary weapons.
The first is the improved iron sights, replaces

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.270
the standard iron sights with a set of rapid
acquisition improved iron sights for a clear

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.389
picture, these basically just take away any
obstructive iron sights and changes them with

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.169
a simple looking green line and dot which
you can line up with enemy players more easily.

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:49.190
Then theres the mini RDS, the ruggedized miniature
reflex sight is designed to be mounted on

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.050
pistols. It allows for fast target acquisition
and easy tracking. This is just a red dot

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.240
sight for the pistol or small weapon.
And last of all is the delta sight, this is

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.610
a compact 3.5 MOA red dot sight for handguns
featuring a triangular reticle, its similar

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.010
to the red dor sight but has a triangle instead
of a dot, the sight also has a slightly different

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.830
shape to its design.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.070
So thats pretty much all the main sights and
optics youll be able to buy and equip on you

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.960
weapons in Battlefield Hardline, and hopefully
this guide might give you a heads up into

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.259
what youre actually buying before you do so.
