Hi, I am Nipa Banerjee from Art Space India
talking on behalf of Expert Village. Now,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:16.760
I am going to show you another design of making
flower pot. First, we need to clear the wheel

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:28.190
plate and keep it in the proper position.
Clean the dried mud from the wheel plate,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.540
center the dough and switch on the wheel.
Now, let us start. By pressing thumbs you

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:53.379
have to try to give a shape. Pull the dough.
See the way you should pull. Wet your hand

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:20.950
as frequently as possible. It will ease your
job. You can, also, give shape by pressing

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:51.180
your fingers. See, how to keep motion of your
fingers. Now, by pressing your thumbs, try

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:08.179
to form a shape. It is a very delicate issue
and requires skill. Here we are keeping the

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:19.689
mouth round, you can also do that. Our job
is over. Now, we have to detach the flower

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:33.040
vase with the thin wire from the wheel and
keep it aside to make it leather hard. Thank

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.140
you.
