A flatlock is something that you can do in
the middle of your fabric instead of cutting

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.770
off the edge.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.250
You can combine two pieces of fabric, it can
be decorative, you can use this side, or you

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.750
could use this side, which sometimes people
will weave some ribbon through here and get

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.410
a really neat look.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.430
Notice this is yellow so this is the needle
thread.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.570
If you wanted to show a certain ladder-like
stitch, then put that color of thread in your

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.570
needle.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.100
The thing is, we have a wide 3 thread.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.059
We're using the left needle, and we'll take
our tension and change it all the way to 0.

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.829
That's what's going to make it open up.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.079
Remember, we don't want it when that is a
construction seam; we want it nice and tight.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.859
With this, we peal it open, which I'll show
when we're done, and that is why we need the

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.500
tension to 0.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.870
We also have a spare thread that's not going
to be seen.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.819
When we tighten up that lower looper, the
blue one, you'll see what I'm talking about.

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:57.800
You're just going to go ahead and fold the
fabric.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.420
You can cut it or not cut it.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.940
You might need to adjust your knife adjustment
based on what type of fabric you're working

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.040
with.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.710
We have this real fun edge here; it's very
loose on the back.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.549
See how you don't see any of the lower looper?

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.730
That was blue; it's kind of hiding right along
the edge here.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.110
What we do - it's almost like magic - you
just pull and it flattens out the seam.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.630
You pull all the way down; this is what it
looks like as it's peeling open on the back

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.820
side, and then you can just take your fingers
and flatten it out.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.469
That is how cool- This is a great way to add
laces to the edge of a hem, or just lace to

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:42.469
lace.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.420
That's a great way; you can have a nice delicate
look.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.460
You can do this as a wide flatlock with the
left needle.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.499
You could also do it as a narrow flatlock
with the right needle.

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:54.479
You just use one or the other; you don't ever
use both.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.710
We need it to be able to pull open.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.950
Isn't that fun?

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.770
This was the side you wanted to see, then
your decorative thread, a larger, heavier,

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.570
decorative thread would be put in the upper
looper where the green is showing.
