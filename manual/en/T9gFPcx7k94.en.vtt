00:00:00.813 --> 00:00:05.328
Petr, you had a fantastic round and the spectators 
 were very supportive. The classic question: 

00:00:05.328 --> 00:00:08.661
how did you feel about your ride and how do you feel now?

00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:14.327
I am satisfied to the utmost. I was able 
 to succeed in everything I wanted to show

00:00:14.327 --> 00:00:18.506
and I actually wasn’t nervous, I simply had an excellent round.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.436
We would like to know if you have any 
 ritual before the race, something that brings luck?

00:00:24.738 --> 00:00:32.308
My mascots are three animals: a turtle, a hippo 
 and a bunny and I talk to them.

00:00:32.308 --> 00:00:34.001
What did they say today?

00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:38.452
They do not communicate much, it’s me who does the talking. 

00:00:38.452 --> 00:00:42.460
I ask them to keep their fingers crossed and wish me luck.

00:00:43.128 --> 00:00:47.215
You will turn sixteen next week, so it is a nice birthday present. 

00:00:47.215 --> 00:00:49.505
What are your plans for your future career?

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:52.967
I am now preparing for the World Championship in South Korea.

00:00:53.067 --> 00:00:58.561
A week ago I won the National Championships 
 and was nominated to compete in Korea.

00:00:58.779 --> 00:01:00.836
What is your goal in life?

00:01:01.036 --> 00:01:04.226
I would like to win the Olympic Games.

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:05.920
Thank you very much.

00:01:06.827 --> 00:01:08.374
What is it like to coach young Petr?

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:13.268
It is sometimes hard, but all in all 
 he is a nice boy and hard-working.

00:01:13.468 --> 00:01:18.348
We are gradually improving and getting better results. I think he proved 

00:01:18.948 --> 00:01:24.460
that hard work bears fruit and he was able 
 to convert his efforts into a medal.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.827
What are your aims for Petr’s future career?

00:01:28.027 --> 00:01:34.389
This is a great experience for us and we fly 
 to Korea next for the World Junior Championships.

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:39.405
We would like to succeed in the qualification 
 and finish in a decent position. 

00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:44.470
We are slowly approaching senior category. Petr already competes in some senior races

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:50.360
and he should take part in some junior grand prix next year.

00:01:51.047 --> 00:01:55.540
Have you any idea how you or Petr will celebrate this fantastic victory?

00:01:55.844 --> 00:02:01.090
Well, Petr will have some juice and I will have something different.
