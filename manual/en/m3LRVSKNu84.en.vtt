They called this town bloody at one time in its life.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Just because that the simple man would not give up without a fight.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
My mamma, she raised me and taught me wrong from right.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Daddy was a no count dog, done nothing but steal, cheat and lie.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Ain't it funny how destiny works out thins in life like how I became a Law man.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Some people call me reckless but I dont give a damn.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
They just see that im the law and forget ima Harlan man.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
There was a time I worked down in the mine.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I got caluses on my hands.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Most people dont like my way----they just dont understand.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So if you got a problem - with the way i live my life.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I can help you close your eyes.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I think thats Justified

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:40.000
[Intrumental Break]

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So before you cross that county line and break the law in my town.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Theres a few things you might wanna know before the deal goes down.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
You may be in a hollar where you think you cant be found.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But dont you ever doubt it son cause ill always be around.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I wear a star on my chest- and a 6 gun on my side.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Look out boy you just might be staring, down the barrel of a 45.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Theres not a judge in this town that'll help you now.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And I think thats Justified
