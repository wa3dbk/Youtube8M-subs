00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we going to turn the mouse by 180 degrees in game while the mouse going to make 25cm on the mouse pad

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:18.100
first mouse is Microsoft WMO 1.1A armed with 400cpi 9000fps intellieye sensor

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.200
WMO is the slowest mouse in this benchmark

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:32.300
and because WMO have also negative acceleration the way mouse making on the pad while my hand starts to move really fast

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:32.300
increase up to 30cm

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:41.400
u can clearly see the turn is not fully 180* because expected 25cm on the mouse pad is not enough to make it

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.500
hand moves faster and faster to the moment when WMO can't keep up with a speed of the hand

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'll repeat the same procedure couple of times

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.100
from long slow hand move, where mouse behaves good

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:12.200
trough mid hand speed, where u can observe the negative acceleration

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:20.300
to the moment when hand moves to fast for the mouse, and mouse start to skip

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
time for the second mouse Creative Fatal1ty 1010 with 1600cpi 6500fps ADNS-3080 sensor

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.100
1010 is set to 400cpi in this test

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.200
1010 is faster than WMO was and have no negative acceleration

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:49.300
u can see the speed of the hand increased and in game turn is quite fast now

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.400
also the move of crosshair is exactly as expected

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the same procedure like in case of WMO, from the slow hand move to the fastest where mouse losses traction

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:25.100
to kill the doubts I need to point out that there is no any positive acceleration set in quake3

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:25.100
or by the drivers also the enhanced precision mode in windows is turned off

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.200
and the mouse needs to make 25cm on the pad to turn 180 degrees in game

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and finally the last and fastest mouse a4tech AK-47 with 800cpi 6500fps ADNS-3060 sensor

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:07.100
like previous mouse this one is also set in the test to 400cpi

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.200
no negative or positive acceleration

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
AK-47 is insane fast....

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:28.200
hand speed increased a lot... the average speed of the hand is around 2.5m/s

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:37.300
in a peak the speed of the hand should be bigger than 2.5m/s but I have no possibility to measure the peak

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:11.500
to force this mouse to skip u need to be insane fast, or be lucky and have dirty pad ;)

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:11.500
in normal gameplay this mouse will never loss the traction

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:21.600
wanted to see if the sensor is not dirty, because the mouse never before loosed the traction

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:41.100
discovered later that the pad was dirty and while AK-47 loosed traction at insane speed

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:41.100
the Razer DeathAdder was even worse than WMO was on this pad ;)

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:12.000
for this test I used "Corepad Eyepad" later repeated everything on Razer Destructor mouse pad

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and on the Destructor all three mouses performance increased a lot and the DeathAdder works on Destructor same fast as AK-47

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:12.000
so keep in mind to clean the cloth pad before testing anything ;)
