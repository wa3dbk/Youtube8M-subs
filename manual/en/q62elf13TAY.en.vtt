00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.740
Today Ratatouille and I want to talk about

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.269
rat feed.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.769
The truth is that feeding a rat is very easy, because rats eat

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.960
anything. Humans and rats are very alike. In fact, did you

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.849
know that in the large cities, you can hear and see

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.320
rats eating rubbish  from the waste bins that humans throw away.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.460
This is something that you must not do at home

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.740
because, even if its true that rats eat our

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.520
remains,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.380
it is also true that street rats have many parasites and

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.350
can transmit many illnesses because their health has no type of control whatsoever.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.790
Pet rats, must be animals very well

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.300
dewormed,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.060
controlled and also fed with a correct and balanced feed,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.140
just like us.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.890
Here I show you a small example of what a rat must eat.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.390
Here you have a mix of feed which consists in pellet, leaves, flowers and extruded

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.710
feed.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.170
Feed must be given together with hay. You can find hay in different ways

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.380
and for rats it has a double function, on one side it it like a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.359
hiding place for the animal, because they can build a small nest with the hay,

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.579
and also it can be used as feed, which is an important matter for the dental wear

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.180
in mammals.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.700
Hay can be placed inside bags, so the animal has a tough

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.330
job to reach it, and also we have

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.179
these small pieces of wood,

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.090
or also tunnels so they can feel safe and hide inside.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.240
As prizes

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.310
we can give them a supplement with home made food. As I have said before, these are

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.280
omnÃ­vorous, in other words, they not only eat food from vetegal origin, but also

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.120
eat feed from animal origin.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.310
Like boiled egg

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.310
or little pieces of turkey without salt or chicken, which is also a good idea. Fresh cheese

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.920
is also good for them. Remember that any food you give them must not contain

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.819
salt. For house pets, salt is generally not good for them.

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.329
Here I show you a few prizes we can give them.

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.169
We basically use the prizes for chinchilla and

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.749
hamster, as these are the ones that are most appropriate

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:27.219
nutritionally for rats.

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:31.499
Here I show you a bag of their food.

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.790
Surely when achieving the rat, you have been told whyat type of feed is the most recommended.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.229
And simply

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:40.989
tell you am bit about the composition. It is made with wheat,

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.939
barley, flour, corn.

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.659
It also has extruded cereal shell, dehydrated

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.959
fruit, beetroot,

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.900
apple, dehydrated banana, carob

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.659
a lot of legumes, dehydrated fruits that

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.449
makes the feed have a great variety

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:03.669
of rich food.

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.899
So, with this information, I hope you have learned a loot about rat

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:09.059
food. Say goodbye,

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:10.139
See you soon friends.
