00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.560
Hey guys! I just learned about a dog named
Chaser. Chaser is a border collie who has

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.180
a vocabulary of more than 1,000 words, that’s
like the same as a 4-year-old child. What

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.960
makes Chaser even more special is that he
can even separate nouns from verbs.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.800
"take lips. Do it girl!"
"Good girl, good girl."

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.800
"Paw lamb, paw lamb, Chaser"
"Good girl, good girl"

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.920
"Nose ABC, nose ABC."
"Good girl, good girl!"

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.120
This is Oliver. Oliver, you think you're smarter
than Chaser? What do you say?

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.500
Yeah, let's go find out. Come on!

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.280
Get your ball. Where's your ball?

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.220
Get your bone. Where's your bone? Nope, that's

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.620
your ball.
Where's your bone? Bone. Bone. Nope.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.460
Find your bone? Where's your bone?
Okay, so maybe Oliver's not that good at this

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.220
particular test, but the fact that we even
try to communicate with dogs, and that they

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.410
communicate back with us, means that the human-dog
relationship is truly something special.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.980
"Who's the best boy? (baby talk)"

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.700
I… have been known to talk to dogs a little.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.740
(baby talk)
(baby talk)

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.180
Or a lot.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.160
(baby talk)

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.960
It’s hard to know if they’re responding
to the words, or just the emotion in my voice.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.970
Or the fact that I sound ridiculous. One recent
study suggests it’s both. Or all three.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.720
Researchers at the University of Sussex played
sounds out of speakers on both sides of a

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.920
dog. When dogs heard commands stripped of
their emotional context, they turned their

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.690
head to the right, suggesting they process
verbal meaning in their left hemisphere. And

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.600
when they heard the emotional sounds in the
voice, but the words were jumbled, they turned

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.290
to the left, suggesting they process emotional
sounds on the right.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.709
These experiments show that dogs can definitely
separate the meaning of words from the emotion

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.959
attached. But how much information do they
take from each?

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.390
When I ask my dogs “Do you want to go for
a walk?” they aren’t processing the real

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.980
meaning of that sentence the way we do, like
“Hmm, lemme see, do I want to go for a walk

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.970
right now? Get some exercise? Maybe I’m
just not feeling it today? I mean, I’m a

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.150
dog, what does it even mean to WANT something?”

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.030
As good as dogs are with words, in many of
our interactions there’s probably a good

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.020
amount of Clever Hans at play. In the early
1900’s a horse named Hans was said to be

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.020
able to solve simple math problems by tapping
his hoof to represent numbers. 2 + 3?

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.660
Smart horse! It was later found, though, that
Hans couldn’t do math at all. He was just

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.580
responding to tiny cues from his handlers,
maybe their facial expressions would tense

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.510
as he got close to the right answer, or they
would exhale when he tapped the right number.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.569
Clever Hans demonstrates that while we might
think of language as something we experience

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.950
mainly through our ears, we communicate meaning
using more than just sound frequencies.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.380
In his book "The Expression of the Emotions
in Man and Animals", Charles Darwin argued

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.440
that the way that we outwardly express and
interpret emotions evolved from animals, and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.980
that our ability to recognize fear, happiness,
sadness, even across species, is universal,

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.790
and innate. It’s something that we’re
born with.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.410
Today, scientists are still debating whether
Darwin was right, but recent research suggests

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.650
that we do share one special bit of emotional
intuition with our canine companions.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.660
Dogs are the only non-primate animals that
seek out eye contact with humans. Their wolf

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.910
ancestors, even tame ones, although they’re
close enough genetically to interbreed with

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.360
dogs, won’t look us in the eye… which
is why you can never, ever trust a wolf.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.310
"How am I doing?"

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.610
When reading emotions in other people we tend
to look disproportionately and unconsciously

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.959
to the right side of their face.
Dogs share this so-called left-gaze bias,

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.819
but only when looking at human faces, not
when they look at other dogs. It seems like

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.919
they genuinely want to understand what we’re
telling them and what it means.

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.979
We seem to understand them too, or at least
we think we do. Researchers in Hungary tested

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.249
people’s ability to interpret the meaning
of recorded dog barks, and found that many

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.150
people really can speak dog.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.770
What do you think this bark means?
[barking]

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.770
[barking]
Okay, that dog's angry. That's pretty easy.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.180
What about this one?
[barking]

00:04:53.199 --> 00:05:01.419
[barking]
Okay, that dog wants to go for a walk. One

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:08.259
more.
[strange noises]

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.420
I have no idea what that means.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.150
If you think about it, this dog-human language
connection makes a lot of sense. We've co-evolved

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.240
with these creatures for the past 10,000 years
or so. We've molded them from wolves into

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.650
puppies with our hands and our brains, and
our voices.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.729
Even if we don't always understand each other,
well, they're always there to listen, and

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.449
that's the real meaning of a best friend.
Isn't it buddy?

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.249
[phone ringing]

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:36.920
Wait a second. Sorry.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.540
Hello? Um, yeah, sure. It's for you.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.880
"Hello? This is Oliver."
"Hello. This is dog."

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.380
"Oh, hey Luna!"
"Have you seen Vanessa? She's been out for

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.400
hours! I miss her."
"Ruh roh!"

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.180
Um, thanks Luna! If you want to find out more
about dog behavior head on over to BrainCraft

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:06.129
and find out if they really miss us when we're
gone. Stay curious.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.520
Good boy. Oh, and special thanks to Oliver.
