00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.940
- [Man] So, ever since I've been involved
with mountain biking I've seen handlebars

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.520
evolve a lot. From sort of mid-to-late 90s
when I was riding, people tended to ride

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.030
very narrow bars right up to now,
where people tend to ride, I can't even

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.040
comprehend how wide their bars are. I
do have a vivid memory of growing up,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.170
of seeing Neil racing in the late 90s,
going extremely fast with narrow bars.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.731
Would you like to talk about that?

00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:31.440
- [Neil] Yeah, it's funny. I look at
old photos now, and I cringe.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.390
They must have been probably, you know,
smaller than 700 mil, but I used to ride a

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.518
BMX a lot, and I sort of used really
narrow bars for that. So I thought it

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:41.397
was cool to use them on the downhill bike.

00:00:43.486 --> 00:00:47.110
- Okay, wide bars. What are the
pros of using wide bars? Well,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.845
I think the biggest thing for me is you
have that nice, big, wide bar, and it

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:56.630
makes the bike feel really planted, really
stable. You've got a lot more leverage in

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.790
the corners, and you really feel
like you are in control of that,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.050
and it's confidence-inspiring.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.900
- Yeah. A big thing I notice, if I go too
wide with my bars, which actually I've got

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.320
a new bike. It's come with 780 mil on
there and that's much wider than I

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.874
normally use. I feel that riding in the
woods where I normally ride, I'm getting

00:01:15.874 --> 00:01:20.411
really close to those trees and having to
slow down to get through them. So yeah,

00:01:20.411 --> 00:01:23.700
definitely smacking your hands
on trees is a big disadvantage,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.690
but also it feels a bit sluggish, not
quite as nimble in the woods.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.744
So, personally I run 740's, and that's
still relatively wide, but I'm not up

00:01:31.744 --> 00:01:34.400
there with the big, downhill
800 mil-wide bars.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.400
♪ [music] ♪

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.340
So, why use narrow bars? It's fair to say
narrow bars suit a longer stem because

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.900
it's bringing your weight further forward
with a longer stem. If you're then running

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.270
wide bars, it's really bringing you chest
down and forward. So longer stem,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.290
narrower bars, definitely better for
cross-country. Also, going back to

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.360
something you see with road guys, when
they're climbing they bring their hands

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.600
right on the tops, really close to the
stem, and it can open your chest up a

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
little bit better for
breathing on climbing.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.470
- They're all valid points, Neil, but I
just want to talk about some of the cons

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.280
of running narrow bars, you know,
especially at higher speeds,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.330
you know, like I get up to. The bike might
feel a little bit twitchy underneath you,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.350
perhaps haven't got quite the control
that you would have with a wider set.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.010
In the turns, you haven't got that same
leverage and that same sort of

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.850
confidence-inspiring, sort of getting the
weight through the bike to get that grip.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.150
It just doesn't do it for me.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.030
- No, and it is definitely something we're
even seeing with the cross-country guys

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.370
and girls, they are starting to
go a bit wider with their bars.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.800
So, how do you choose
the right bars for you?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.800
♪ [music] ♪

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.920
So, doing a press-up this is my natural
position, hands slightly wider than my

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.190
shoulders. Feels really nice and
strong, nice and stable as well.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.900
If I try and go out too wide, okay, it's
going to be much harder work,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.250
definitely pretty tiring. But also, going
back to the middle feels pretty strong

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.550
now, I could do a press-up. Again, that's
quite hard work compared to my comfortable

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.460
position but also, obviously, I'm less
stable. So, trying to find that

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.180
comfortable position, hands slightly
wider than shoulders, nice and strong.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:30.160
So, it's fair to say that the narrower
bars suit a longer stem for cross-country,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.620
where you're going to need to keep some
weight on the front tire to stop that

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.730
front wheel from wheeling
on the really steep climbs.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.700
- And also, there's similar issues
with the wider bar. If you have,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.550
say, a longer stem, something like
70 mils, and you put a wider bar on,

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.960
you're going to have this effect of, like
you're driving a big London bus or

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.070
something. So, the steering would
be even slower with that long stem.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.960
So if you are looking to run a wider bar,
we tend to mate it with a shorter stem,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.070
therefore you have that nimble steering
but then the stability when you're up to

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.420
speed.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.681
- Yeah, so, It's fair to say that, you
know, the bar set-up really comes

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:10.038
down to the trails you ride
and what you like to ride.

00:04:10.038 --> 00:04:13.000
♪ [music] ♪

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.263
So the other thing to talk
about the handlebars is

00:04:15.263 --> 00:04:20.530
rise and sweep. We've got
two sets of downhill bars here.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.100
Sweep is that measurement of how far the
way you grip on the bar actually comes

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.400
back and also up. There's two
measurements to sweep, back and up.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.110
You see on these bars, this part of the
bar's much higher off the table than these

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.680
so there's more sweep-back on these bars.
Tends to be more of a personal preference

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.090
thing I think, although you tend to find
downhill bars have more sweep than

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.881
cross-country bars.

00:04:43.881 --> 00:04:47.900
- Yeah. I think that's a fair point
and, as you say, I think there'd be

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.650
certain...you could give me a
set of bars, and I'd be like, "Oh,

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.860
that's horrible," and you would be, "Oh
no, I really like that." I think it's just

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.620
the way your shoulders are set and
how it kind of fits to your body.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.750
Rise, on the other hand, so, rise
is what we're looking at here,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.970
is if this was zero, and then it's how
much rise up to here. So in this case,

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.890
it is 20 mils from here to the top of
there. So, there's all different rises

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:20.360
that you can get. Downhill bikes,
as a rule, tend to have a bigger rise,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.546
and then a cross-country would
have zero-rise handlebars.

00:05:24.546 --> 00:05:29.071
- All right. So, there's
handlebars explained. I run 740s.

00:05:29.071 --> 00:05:30.901
- I'm running 750.
