00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:06.829
Two Foolish People

00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:16.053
Once upon a time, a man called "Gaeddongi"
worked very hard and made a lot of money.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.039
But he was uneasy about keeping his money
in his house.

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.730
'What shall I do with this money?

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:32.130
Okay, I'll bury it in a mountain.
But I'm afraid someone may dig and take it...'

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.420
he said to himself.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.049
Gaeddongi went up a mountain and 
buried his money.

00:00:39.074 --> 00:00:43.574
He put up a sign saying

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.649
'I didn't bury my money here - Gaeddongi.'

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:53.074
'Ha ha ha! I'm so relieved!'

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.539
Gaeddongi dusted his hands and 
came down from the mountain.

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:08.039
But another man called "Soiddongi!" lived
in the same village.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.330
He went up the mountain to gather firewood
and saw the sign put up by Gaeddongi.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.330
'Well, I'll dig and see whether
there is some money buried here.'

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:30.140
As Soiddongi did some digging, 
some money appeared.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.750
'Foolish Gaeddongi!
He buried his money but wrote he hadn't.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.050
I'll teach him a lesson.'

00:01:42.075 --> 00:01:45.049
While walking down the mountain with the money,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:52.050
Soiddongi thought he might be suspected of
having stolen it.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:01.490
So he also put up a sign now.
The sign said,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.900
'I didn't take the money buried here 
- Soiddongi.'

00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:12.625
Next day Gaeddongi went up the mountain.

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.990
But to his surprise, the ground was dug open.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.560
So he quickly dug it deeply 
but failed to find his money.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.269
Gaeddongi flopped down on the ground and 
cried bitterly.

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:31.869
While crying, he noticed the sign 
put up by Soiddongi.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:40.200
"What? He didn't take the money?
All right, I can see the truth."

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:49.759
Gaeddongi quickly went down to the village and shouted,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:03:00.340
"Hey! Bad thieves who stole my money!
All come out except Soiddongi!"
