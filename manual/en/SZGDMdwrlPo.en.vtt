00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.020
Today we're going to discuss how to clean
a violin bow. Something I've here, a lot of

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.890
people ask me about, they want to do it at
home, sometimes it's okay idea, sometimes

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.820
not a great idea. A lot of times you get a
kid and the potato chips, way too deep all

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.400
over this bow hair, so it's crazy, it's sleek,
you got to do something before the big recital

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.820
that night; I understand. But, in order to
cut that, you're going to need something more

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.190
than soap and water; I hear people talking
about soap and water. It's fine for some dirt,

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.820
but when you get greasy stuff on the bow hair,
it's just totally nullifies the rosin; you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.289
need to get something that's going to cut.
If you have a fiber glass bow or a graphite

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.949
composite bow, some of these modern bows like
that, really, this is a safe method to try

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:54.729
at home if you're careful. And it's using
denatured alcohol; Home Depot, Lowe's, wherever

00:00:54.729 --> 00:01:00.730
you shop, hardware stores have it; SLX or
denatured alcohol. Just a little bit in the

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.340
bottom of little cereal bowl, it's all you
need. And this is where it gets tricky, be

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:17.689
careful not to twist the frog as you remove
the

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:24.760
frog from the bow. First we take the button,
counterclockwise 'till it comes off, and you

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.900
got to be careful not to get this wrapped
around within itself, so keep this from twisting

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.020
and turning when its off of there. Now what
I'm going to do, I'm going to lay the tip

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.869
of this bow on the edge of the cereal bowl
and I'm going to totally dilute the hair.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.390
So, you know, this is where, if you have a
wooden bow with varnish and you're cleaning

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.939
the hair and the alcohol slaps a little bit
on the tip of the bow, the varnish is gone,

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.700
you're down to bare wood; just not a good
idea to try this. Shops can do it, I do it

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:05.270
on wooden bows very carefully. So you know,
work the area where the greasy substance might

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.390
be, that's causing the problem in general
and then when you take this out of here, that's

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.950
what it's going to look like. Now I just squeeze
it like this and get the bow covered out and

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:26.140
then just take a paper towel and slowly work
your way down, dry the hair. It doesn't take

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.140
long. Now you still, you can wet this down,
but don't just drop it and let it flop around

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.770
because you're just asking for trouble there.
Keep the hair nice and even, don't let it

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.220
wrap around itself. So once you've dried it
as much as you can and this is air-drying

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.411
very fast. This alcohol will dissipate in
thirty seconds, a minute the most. You can

00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:54.430
put this back together and you've got, basically,
you've got a bow that has no rosin whatsoever

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.180
or anything else, which is good and you can
have to rosin like the daylights if you don't

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.530
have some powdered rosin mixed up. In the
shop here we have ground up rosin that we

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.900
use to get it started with, our little rug,
a little rosin, wipe it in to get it started.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.150
It's a good way to get the immediate rosin
into the hair. You can cake rosin it enough

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.200
and it'll eventually be find. So once again,
you got perfectly clean hair, no rosin on

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.230
it, no dirt, no grease, it's great. You can't
do that too many times 'cause it ultimately

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.680
it'll dry out the hair if you soak in alcohol
over and over. But, just a good way in emergency

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.060
to save a re-hair, if it's plenty of hair
and it's relatively fresh still. Just remember,

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.500
I don't recommend this with wooden bows. Let
somebody else do that for you.
