hey whats up i'm gonna show you how to convert
a Fat32 disk drive to an NTFS first go to

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:23.919
start then run then type in "CMD".

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:41.739
And that's going to open up the command line.
and then type in "convert c: /fs:ntfs and

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.909
then hit enter".

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:59.249
And then it's going to ask you the volume
of your drive so go to my computer and then

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:06.620
go to your c drive and whatever you have your
c drive saved as, which mine is acer and thats

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:21.400
the volume of your drive so I would type in
"Acer" and then hit enter. and now it's saying

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:30.369
that i need to dismount so i'm gonna say yes
put "y" for yes if you have that and then

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:39.090
it's saying that i have the option to do the
formatting when it restarts so hit yes some

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.969
people might be able to do this right from
this screen so it's prompting me this now

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:51.689
so say yes and then now its saying that its
gonna take place automatically next time the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:02:08.560
system restarts so i'm gonna go ahead and
restart that.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.670
okay now this is the screen that you will
come to when after your computer restarts

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:24.360
and the conversion of your drive to NTFS and
it's going to take a little while so you have

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:34.290
to be patient and then your computer will
restart afterwards 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.650
okay now that your computer has restarted
and you're back on the main screen i'm gonna

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.040
show you two ways to make sure that your conversion
completed properly.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:51.610
First go to start then go to my computer highlight
your c drive and in the corner it should say

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:02.080
NTFS or you can right click your c drive go
to properties and right there it should say

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.420
NTFS if it still says Fat32 that means there
was a problem a failure somehow and you might

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.550
need to redo your conversion if you have any
questions please feel free to comment, rate,
