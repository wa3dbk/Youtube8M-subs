My name is Courtney Hester on behalf of Expert
Village. In this clip we're going to be discussing

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.199
how to set up restrictions on your child's
internet account. The first thing we'll want

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:19.350
to do is make sure that we have blocked pop
ups. Pop ups many times lead to sites that

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.509
are not child friendly, they also can contain
virus's and spyware, which you don't want

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:31.089
on your computer. One thing that you can do
is download the google toolbar to your computer,

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.850
it automatically blocks pop ups for you. You
can do a search for google toolbar and it

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.760
will lead you to this site and you can download
the google toolbar for free and you can just

00:00:42.760 --> 00:01:06.680
save that to your computer and then run it.
Okay, it is now installing the toolbar and

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.999
we want to enable the page rank. The page
rank will sometimes collect information for

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:17.010
you for google purposes and since this is
on our child's account, we don't want it to

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:25.850
do that, so we're going to enable the page
rank and finish. Now that has been downloaded

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.819
onto your computer. There's some other things
you can do as well and it will vary again,

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:37.770
a little bit depending on your internet provider,
but online if we go to tools, we can pop down

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.319
and it says pop up blocker. As you can see
our pop up blocker is enabled, so our internet

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:55.380
provider also provides us the safe guard.
Another thing we can do is go to online protection

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.959
and this shows us that we have, we can use
antivirus' on, our pop up blocker is on and

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.310
we can turn on our parental controls, it shows
us that they're currently off but we can turn

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:20.739
those on and our mail protection is also on.
We can go down to internet options and again

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:28.510
on this privacy and you can up this to block
cookies, which sometimes enable spyware and

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:36.300
collect information from your internet. So
we can make that and we hit apply. The next

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.001
thing I would like to do is set our homepage
to something more child friendly. I don't

00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:45.310
necessarily want all the news and things to
pop up when my child gets on the internet.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.230
So again we can go to tools, we go to internet
options again and this is where you can type

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.910
in what your homepage is. I have a page in
mind that's very child friendly, so I'm going

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:08.730
to go ahead and type that in and then hit
apply. For now on when you log onto the internet

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.480
under your child's account this new page will
come up.
