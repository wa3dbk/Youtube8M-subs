You may have heard the mechanic at your local
bike talk about bleeding brakes. What someone

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.280
means when they say bleeding something when
it's a hydraulic system, whether it's your

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.230
suspension fork or your disc brake, is that
you are getting all of the air out of the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.900
system so that all you have is fluid. Most
disc brakes on the market use disc fluid,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.310
or dot fluid, which is the same fluid you
use in a car or a motorcycle. Different manufactures

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:38.150
specify different types of fluid to use to
bleed things. The two disc brake manufacturers

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.059
that I'm most familiar with, Hayes, who have
a product that looks like this. You've got

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.850
a master cylinder that comes off the handle
like this, a little bit chunkier, more industrial

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.920
looking. They recommend using dot 3 fluid.
The other manufacturer that I ofter work with

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.559
is avid. They have a little bit sleeker of
a master cylinder. They like dot 3 or dot

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.650
4.1 fluid. Let me show you roughly how to
bleed both of these systems, because they

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:18.550
are a little bit different. I will start off
with the Avid brakes first. Avid has their

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.700
own proprietary bleed kit that comes with
a bottle of fluid. It comes with some nice

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.690
syringes that you fill with fluid. So you
push fluid through one, and you start down

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.310
here at the caliper. There's a little torx
head here, a torx head screw. You unscrew

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.780
that and screw in a bleed fitting, and your
syringe is full of fluid. And you can see

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:53.660
up here at the brake lever there's another
one of those fittings where you screw in another

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:03.780
syringe. The Avid brake bleed kit comes with
great instructions, and they even have great

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.780
instructions on their website at sram.com.
You can go there and search for all the specifications,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.170
on how to do that. And the main thing to remember
is to be patient. Make sure you remove anything

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.840
that can be harmed by brake fluid, because
brake fluid is really caustic. You probably

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.220
want to wear eye protection as well as some
gloves, because if you get it on your skin

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.140
it kind of burns, and if you get it in your
eyes, it really stings and could do a lot

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.400
more damage than just sting.
