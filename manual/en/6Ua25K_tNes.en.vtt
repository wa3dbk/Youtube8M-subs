In the U.S. you can always  pretty much  find a sale, 
 you walk into a store and there's a sales section right there

00:00:10.937 --> 00:00:17.043
you always see sale in the window store
In France, 
 there's really only 2 major sales periods

00:00:17.043 --> 00:00:25.101
one at the end of the year, and right now, the winter 
 sales. And because they're so limited in sales, it's game time.

00:00:25.101 --> 00:00:32.206
So around noon and 6pm there's usually a bunch of people that 
 are just trying to finish up what they're doing, and then

00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:42.062
sneak out with out saying anything...
Hey, did you finish that 
 report we have to send  -- tomorrow? Uh...

00:00:43.654 --> 00:00:49.435
Personally, I hate when you get there and there's always that one table 
 with a ton of stuff thrown all over like Easter eggs

00:00:49.435 --> 00:00:57.110
and everybody's going at it like a pack of hyenas. But hey, it's 
 $5
Mine! Get out of the way this is my $5 shirt

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.589
and I have waited 5 hours for this so there is no way you're 
 getting this, alright? So you're just gonna have to go to the back

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.829
of the line, look through all the other ones and just 
 figure it out
And depending on where you go there are

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:12.260
miles of lines of people waiting to try stuff on, and I never 
 understood why they don't let you just try stuff on looking at

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.273
a mirror that's right there.. Ma'am --

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:28.770
 you should go into a fitting room to try on underwear

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.900
And the lines to pay? These people only go shopping twice a year. 
 Forget about it. There's only one way to get through those

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.630
Lady with a baby coming through. Alright, move it or lose it folks. 
 Move it or lose it. Ma'am --your tag is sticking out

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:52.720
It's a girl! Which is why this year I've decided to do all 
 my sales shopping online. It's easier, and far less time consuming

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:03.250
Hey -- aren't you going to bed anytime? I'm coming! I just 
 -- found scooter socks, hon. Scooter socks! Hon, scooter socks!

00:02:03.252 --> 00:02:10.010
Socks with scooters on them. Scooters. Scooter. Like Yamaha socks. 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.910
But I always get fed up with guys, I mean they just take it 
 so nonchalantly, like it's not a big deal, it's like a non-event.

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:21.920
Hey, I'm gonna go shopping. 
Where are you 
 going? Do you have your mace? What?

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.650
Do you have your plan of attack? I'll just... go 
 somewhere else if it's crowded, like everybody else..

00:02:29.653 --> 00:02:34.950
I'm getting men's clothes next year. 

00:02:34.947 --> 00:02:41.970
Just don't die going sales shopping, OK? Alright. See you next 
 Monday. Find me on the Facebook page. Like and subscribe.

00:02:41.974 --> 00:02:45.400
Whatever. Just don't die.
