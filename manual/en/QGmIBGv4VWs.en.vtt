00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.580
I will show you my pedal board next.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:16.960
I have few pedal boards.
For sessions, tours and for my band. 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.280
I think I have about 3~4 different ones.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:26.710
All my boards basically have the
same main pedals.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.640
Today, I brought what I use for the tours.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:41.360
First, we have the Ernie Ball volume pedal.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.360
It's parallelld to the tuner.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.760
After the volume pedal is
Fodera's compressor. 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.960
This is my current choice of compressor. 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.120
 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.600
Then into the PEC-2.
I use this to program other effects.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.000
Basically, compressor is on everything.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:21.240
And this is on all my board. 
MXR Bass d.i.+.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:31.200
I have 2 on this board so I can
have different settings.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.560
For my main sound, I have it distorted.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.240
As you can see, gain setting is different. 
One is at zero, other is around 6.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:52.960
One is distorted and other not so much.
 I use different one depending on the tune.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.800
This is the main sound.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.600
And this is the other sound.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.640
This is more distorted.
Tone is basically the same.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.960
I use the other one for ballade.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.640
By using 2 that are programmed differently,
I can prevent drastic change in tone.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.400
Also for when I'm missing some Mid range,
I have the EQ on the front.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.270
I have around the 1K pushed up. 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.610
You can pop out clear
distorted sound this way.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.750
As you can hear, it sounds very clear. 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.980
This is how I use this EQ.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And for my bass solo,
when I want some distortion... 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.040
I use Zoom multi-effects.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:35.890
I mostly just use this for the distortion.  

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:43.670
I can use this for extreme distortion and
also add some delay for ambience.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.840
Even with lots of distortion,
it doesn't add any noise. 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.920
I like that it has a built in noise gate.
 Let me show you.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.560
 It doesn't add any noise...
and you can distort quite a bit.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.800
 So I use this Zoom for my bass solos.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.360
And this is sort of a "secret weapon",
Robotalk.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.850
It's an auto-wow and envelope filter.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.310
I use Robotalk quite a bit.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:52.290
I have it programmed with MXR.
This channel has distortion and Robotalk.  

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.760
I'll play some.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.760
So this is how I use it as an envelope filter.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.680
Here's another cool feature on Robotalk.
It has 2 channels.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:51.040
As you can see, it's set up differently.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.560
It brings out the attack on the slap sound.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:25.200
I use it a lot for the slap-solos.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:33.620
And with this Blend, I can mix the
dry sound with the wet effect sound.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.600
So I can keep the dry sound with
the wet sound.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.880
This keeps the sound from thinning out.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:07:02.480
Since you can keep the dry sound
it's good for backing and solos.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.160
 It's very useful.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.000
You can also have both channels on.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.100
You can use both channels at the same time.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.040
You can get many different sound
from this one pedal.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:41.180
From simple auto-wah sound to
pretty flashy sound.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.360
It's invaluable to me.
