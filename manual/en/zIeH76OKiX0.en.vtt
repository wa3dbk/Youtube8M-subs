Waddup Food Tuber's. Jamie Oliver here. We are gonna make

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.610
the best South American style brunch. It's very healthful, it's very colorful

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.120
it perfect for the summer when you look
beautiful fresh ingredients

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.670
I'm gonna be hero-ing this ingredient
here. Quinoa. 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.050
This is from Bolivia, Peru. This

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.130
is one of the earliest cultivated grains
on the planet and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.050
it's kind of how you cook it, getting the textures right, and how you dress it.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.290
And then you can use it generically from
sweet to savoury.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.430
as a side dish and a salad. As a kind of
complementary part of any dish.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.820
You're gonna love it. So let me show you
this brunch. Very, very nice.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.980
Let's start with the Quinoa. We're
going to cover it in some water.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.000
We're gonna boil it sort of

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.199
fairly hard. The seed will sort of 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.660
swell and then like a little kind of shoot
will kind of cook out of it.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.300
It would take about 15-20 minutes to
cook. Moving on.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.570
black beans I wanna go to kinda crispy. I wanna kinda puffy 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.570
crack it and puff it up. So we're gonna go into a hot pan with a little olive oil

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.479
I'm just gonna put a pinch of cumin, but
little pinch that's what I love about

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:11.390
cooking man.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.340
The tiniest pinch in the world right is
gonna make all the difference

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.960
And just put enough flat beans in there to fry.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.060
Would you like me to clean you?

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.380
Come here. 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.820
So let these beans fry a little bit, a little pinch of salt.  

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.210
As soon as they get crispy we're gonna turn that heat off. See how nice and light, they're almost like 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.020
little peanuts.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.369
Ok. Once they have got crispy just put them to one side.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.780
Like that. You can see the Quinoa boiling away.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.390
and that's fine takes about 15-20
minutes to cook. Okay chillies.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.409
You can just chop them up by all means.
Pop them into a little ball,

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.860
so a really nice pinch of salt, and I'm
gonna cover that

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.750
with a little bit of sugar. Just to sweeten it lightly
and a little bit

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.969
of vinegar. I'm just gonna scrunch that
around. Don't worry about the seeds.

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.090
You can even remove those or just go
with it I'm literally just gonna toss that up.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.849
Also it makes fabulous Chile vinegar, so you don't have to throw any of it away.

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.349
Oh, by the way. Lets talk about Quinoa. It is basically

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.920
low in fat, it's incredibly nutritious, high in iron, 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.970
it's also high in zync, it's gluten-free

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.440
so really, really good thing. In actual fact you should really all try it.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.440
So the Quinoa had about 20 minutes to cook. You know it's cooked when you just nip

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.019
a bit,

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.440
taste a bit, it should be soft and delicious

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.599
you can see it's kind of plumped up, we're
gonna drain that now.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.880
The residual heat, the steam,

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.700
will also help to fluffen it up. Have a
little look at it,  you can see is really plumped

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.129
up

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.469
I'm going to lay that out. 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.020
On a tray. 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.940
Look at that. As it steams it'll start to kind of get fluffier,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.300
it'll become lighter so it's
nice and delicate.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.310
Olive oil. Just a little little squeeze of
lemon juice.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.340
Little pinch of salt, and that's a really good
basic Quinoa

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.440
Can use it sweet or savoury. Erm, you can use it

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.900
as a side dish, as a salad.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:19.120
So, pan on a low heat, couple of fried eggs. I like the way that it's kinda crispy on the bottom

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.569
and just soft and silky on the top

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.659
Gonna get that beautiful nice little
pile there you can see

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:33.340
how lovely and light that is. Look at that.
Very beautiful.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.590
Just on the side like that, and of course
I'm gonna just give it a little

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.510
poke. A nice little pile of the crispy black beans here.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.790
Half an avocado. We've got some beautiful tomatoes here.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.890
So have a look down the market's see
what you've got available.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.799
Mint and coriander. Nice little wodge like that.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.540
These chiles, we'll take some of that. 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.860
and this little vinegar here is gold
dust

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.959
so we'll just put that over the avocado. 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.850
Some spring onions do help the story

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.670
So there you go guys. A beautiful brunch of Quinoa, crispy black beans all those

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.380
wonderful summery things like tomatoes, spring onions, jalapenos, the avocado

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.020
really really nice and of course because
we haven't got enough chilli in this story

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.450
already

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.740
just a little bit of chilli sauce as
well

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.990
as a little drizzle of olive oil

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.280
There you go. Absolutely gorgeous.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.870
Something a bit different,

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.100
and a little homage to our South American
Mexican brothers and sisters

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.960
Beautiful. You've never tried it

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.830
