00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.550
it supports keyboard and mice like
nobody's business for example

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.500
you could click and drag and you could do
right mouse click and that works no

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.479
problem the scroll button

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:17.479
feels like you're scrolling when
you're in front of the computer itself

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.869
hello everyone Michael here from 
the daily note 2 youtube channel and last

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.550
last time I reviewed the app flashtop 
it was an excellent solution

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.179
to connect to your home computer
remotely

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.190
but if you're looking to do that

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.030
for your work computer because you use
windows computers at work

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.340
or if you're IT industry and you
manage windows servers for a living

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.670
definitely remote desktop

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.410
is the best app for that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.040
let me do a quick connection here

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.390
and I'll do this over

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.750
LTE

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.080
for starters the reason why
it's better is that we could see it

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.690
only

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.670
is using about

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.680
20 maybe 20 to 40

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.080
kilobytes a second or as you see
splash

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.140
desktop or splashtop

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.620
uses about 450

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.740
even if you're not doing anything with
all the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.820
all the background and
animations enabled.. it is still

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.320
using about eight times more data and
you'll find that

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.230
to be the case in most of these apps so

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.500
definitely I think that is
probably the biggest selling point

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.840
now before I cover all the positive of this app
I wanna go over the

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.840
drawbacks

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.450
one is that in order for you to use this

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.029
you need to have a professional
version of windows

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:48.670
for example

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.080
if you

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.110
if you have a home computer most likely
you have like a windows 7

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.430
home edition or windows

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.460
windows xp home edition

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.490
but

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.750
if you're at work most likely you have a
professional addition and it is because

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.759
they put in capabilities like this and

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.769
you need to have what's called 
remote settings

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.079
in here and in here

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:19.619
there's a remote desktop option and 
you won't have this option on the home

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:20.749
addition

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.699
and another point of this app is

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:25.679
it is

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.599
15 dollars right now the

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.019
Xtalogic remote desktop app 
I think it's a good deal

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.119
you probably will make that up

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:36.829
probably the first month 
that you use.. just

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.629
for the data savings

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.919
or you will make it up in a couple of months
I bought it for

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.380
25 dollars

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.140
2 years ago and I thought it was a
create purchase unlike splash desk top

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.879
which only requires your

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.489
user name and password

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.559
this app will take a little bit more for you
to get it working for example

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:01.239
if you want to access to your

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.490
work computer you probably need to connect
to a vpn first or

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.029
you need to ask your IT admin 
if you're not the IT admin

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:12.889
to add it to the remote desktop gateway

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.989
and then after you make that vpn connection 
you could

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.069
connect to the computer

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.869
it's a little bit more complicated
but after you get it down the first time

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:23.809
it shouldn't be a problem

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.120
let's go over the good things 
about this app

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.569
this might be negative or positive

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.119
when you connect

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:38.109
with this app.. for example
I'm connected to my

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.249
computer

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.749
to my laptop in front of me
for this demo

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:47.019
and if i look at the monitor of my laptop 
it is in this lock

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.079
screen.. where you see the icon
and if you click on it to login

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.819
it locks the screen and 
you cannot

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.429
have this screen displayed here
and screen displayed on your

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:04.639
computer monitor at the same time 
it's just not how it's designed

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.790
and it is probably a good security
feature but

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.339
probably works

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:13.229
little bit differently than you expected
if you see it for the first time

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:16.159
another thing is that 
you'll see that

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:19.879
the cpu usage 
if you remembere the splash

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:21.299
top

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.409
I pointed out that the cps usage was
always at 50 percent

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:30.300
it's basically using 0 percent
of the cpu.. I think it

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.849
must be using the gpu somehow to

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.029
calculate which

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:39.089
which parts of the image to
send over and it's doing it very

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:43.919
efficiently so I wanna point it out again
because it is so important

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.690
the data savings

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.809
imagine if you were to connect your
work computer

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:52.340
and put together like a powerpoint
presentation

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.899
or work on something

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:58.889
you could do that literally for 8 times longer 
you could do it 8 hours

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.550
instead of 1 hour

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.539
flashtop

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:06.599
it requires this little service and 
if you're not logged into the computer

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.409
or if the computer is locked you'll
find that you cannot connect your

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:11.479
computer

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.179
and it's sometimes
that might be

00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:19.969
like show stopper..you forgot to 
log in and it's not running it

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.379
it just can't connect to the computer

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:28.020
definitely not an issue with this app
because it's using

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.580
windows service

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.440
which of

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.219
it's a part of the operating system

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.839
all you need to do is have the
computer on and you should be able to

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:38.639
connect to it

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.889
one last thing for people who are
looking to use this app to connect to

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.459
their work computer and get a lot of
work done

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:46.949
when they're outside

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:52.080
it supports keyboard and mice 
like nobody's business for example

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.639
you could click and drag and you could do a right 
mouse click and that works no problem the

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.030
scroll button

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.629
feels like you're scrolling when
you're in front of the computer itself

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.129
they make these buttons correctly and 
I can't say the same thing for other

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:13.449
remote desktop or splashtop

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:15.150
type apps out there
even though it

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.160
does it most of the times.. I feel like
sometimes I press on some of the buttons

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.430
and it doesn't register properly 
on the other apps

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.080
or this app seems lock solid

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.699
for the

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.889
IT people who are looking to use this

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.180
to manage servers

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.330
let me show you

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.370
couple option in here that
you'll find interesting

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.800
before I do that I wanna show you
one important thing

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.479
enable compression

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:48.900
that's the part of where it uses
one eighth the data

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.539
it really doesn't seem to impact the
performance at all.. it doesn't use any

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:58.909
it might use like 5 percent more the cpu
it's like negligible

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:02.679
make sure this is always checked
whatever you do.. it seems to

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:06.080
not affect anything and 
it's always good

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.889
and

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:10.939
couple of other things is for you
admins out there.. this will be important

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:13.270
there is connect to console

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.529
one last thing i wanna mention is that

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:21.369
it has this touch mode 
just like flashtop has

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.550
it registers as click

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.020
but it does not do airview
unfortunately and hopefully they'll

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.810
get incorporate in the future
there's little bit loss of functionality but I

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:32.259
think

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:34.339
once again for the date of savings

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:36.809
that roles all

00:07:36.809 --> 00:07:41.970
that's the end of this video so

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.939

thank you for watching
