00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.150
Alright today on this 2005 GMC Sierra, we
are going to install part number 90885, the

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:14.670
Prodigy P2 brake controller and part number
3015-P, the brake controller adapter.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.910
First step that we need to do is to remove
this cover for access to the port that is

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.910
behind here.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:26.020
So we will undo this nut and pop the cover
off.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:36.539
We will take our cord and just plug it into
place.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:51.069
Moving on, we will reinstall the cover and
then put the nut back into place.

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:53.932
Alright next we will go ahead and install
our brake controller bracket and we are going

00:00:53.932 --> 00:00:56.229
to do that on a sheet metal at the bottom
of the dash here.

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:58.000
We will take the bracket.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.329
We will wind it up; with the sheet metal we
will use a clamp to hold it into place.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.800
Alright and we will use some soft tapping
screws to attach the bracket to the sheet

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.299
metal.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:25.840
Let us go ahead and attach our dash according
to the brake controller.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:41.149
OK, that is good that we have got power, good.

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:51.259
We will attach our brake controller to the
bracket.
