hi it's AlaskaGranny

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.910
I am with one of my favorite tools which is the Masterbuilt Electric Smoker

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.320
I love it for how easy it is to use

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.480
set it an forget it

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.820
occasionally it needs a little boost like when I am making jerky

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:28.389
if you want to cook below 200 degrees   say 180  or  190

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:32.149
the Masterbuilt Electric Smoker doesn't always produce  the smoke I need

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.649
I can add the cold smoker which is an add  on

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.730
which makes my products

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.060
have the smoky aroma I enjoy

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.100
the cold smoker is even easier to use than the Masterbuilt

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.060
it only has three components has

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.760
main box

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.850
take the chimney  put it in here

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.920
open this  that is where you add your chips

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.210
add this box on the side  where the ashes fall

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.420
you just take this part

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.799
insert it straight into the Masterbuilt

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.170
once you are ready to use it  pull out the chip loading tray   set it aside

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.330
insert the cold smoker right into that hole

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.639
you plug it  in

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:26.999
fill it up with chips   hit the  on switch

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:30.889
smoke is going in there directly without affecting the temperature at all

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:34.349
it works great the cold smoker add on unit

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.180
is a perfect way to get your meat

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.689
smoked low and slow

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.670
any time you want to cook below 200  use a cold smoker

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.170
it makes your meat have the smokey flavor that you love

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.970
even if it's not the most traditional way it works   it's fabulous  it's one of my favorites

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:15.300
