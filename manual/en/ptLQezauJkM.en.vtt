Hey there, Chipp Marshal here.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:08.290
In this video I am going to show you a fantastic
technique for getting rid of ants quickly

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.980
and naturally.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.860
If you found this video, then you probably
already know how much of a nuisance that ants

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.900
can be.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.029
However, what most people don't realize is
that ants can actually pose a significant

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.300
health risk by contaminating your food with
dangerous pathogens.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.929
So the quicker you can get rid of them, the
better.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.620
Before we get started, I would just like to
ask that if you find this information to be

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.460
helpful, please do me a huge favor and hit
the like button on this video and/or subscribe

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.199
to my YouTube channel.

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.440
Your support allows me to continue doing what
I love and making videos like this to help

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.360
people solve their pest control problems.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.179
The good news is that getting rid of ants
will not require an exterminator.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.690
It won't even require any insecticides or
harsh chemicals.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.600
All you need to eliminate ants from your home
is cayenne pepper, tea tree oil, peppermint

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.730
oil and water.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:13.640
This is a simple but powerful recipe for killing
insects in your house (especially ants).

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.230
Just remember that these essential oils are
not all created equal.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.860
You want to make sure that you are buying
a 100%, undiluted, therapeutic grade oil.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.810
And if you need help with that, I just posted
a great page on my blog with quick information

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.740
about how to get rid of ants naturally using
this recipe.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.540
I'll show you where to get the best quality
essential oil, at the lowest prices.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.370
On that page, I also posted step by step instructions
on how to use these ingredients to get rid

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.110
ants inside and even outside of your home.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.730
I'll show you how to take the fight straight
to the nest so you can get rid of them for

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.980
the entire season.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.340
I am extremely excited about how well these
techniques work but don't look for your exterminators

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.490
endorsement anytime soon.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.319
They would be happy to keep charging you a
few hundred bucks a year to pump your house

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.450
full of harsh chemicals.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.400
My research has proven that his method is
just as effective as theirs.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.910
In addition to killing ants, this natural
solution will also control spiders, silverfish,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.590
stink bugs and many other household insects.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.430
So with a few precautions, a little bit of
cleaning and about $15-$20 dollars, you can

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.740
permanently protect your home from ants.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.879
