00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.660
I'm John Steichen, I'm a Senior
Research Fellow in Dupont Qualicon, and I

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:11.139
specialize in the detection and characterization
of microbes through molecular devices. The

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.490
award-winning BAX System from Dupont Qualicon
is the essential tool for fast and reliable

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.539
pathogen detection in food. The food
industry is different today than it was 50

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.539
years ago. Today, we have food moving in vast
quantities across international boundaries.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.810
We have more people consuming food that they're
unfamiliar with. We have the issue also of

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.810
microbes which are morphing into new types,
new versions, new strains, new subtypes.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.890
The BAX System is very simple to use, it has
wonderful sensitivity, selectivity, inclusivity,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.010
and exclusivity. That is, it identifies the
target and it doesn't detect other

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.930
organisms that are closely allied but not
pathogenic. They range from food processors,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.850
service labs, government regulators around
the world, along with pharmaceutical companies

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.030
and public health institutes. Growing demand
for international foods, heightened awareness

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.650
for food safety, and increasing regulatory
requirements have put increasing pressure

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.340
on these companies to deliver fresh, high-quality
products that are pathogen-free to avoid recalls

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.790
and enhance consumer confidence and their
brand recognition. The BAX System is

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.380
much more precise and detects only the target
organism and all of the targets that exist

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.370
within one cluster. The BAX System currently
can detect salmonella, Campylobacter, E. Coli

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:53.370
0157:H7, Listeria Monocytogenes, genus Listeria,
Staphylococcus Aureus, yeast and mold, Vibrio,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.370
and E. Sakazakii, or Chronobacter. The
BAX System helps customers through quick,

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:11.370
simple, high-quality detection of pathogens.
A global challenge that exists today is providing

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.480
food to the growing societies which are demanding
better and more nutritious and wholesome food

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.190
than exists today.
