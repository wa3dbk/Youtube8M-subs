00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
about two and a half years ago I wanted
someone to help with the art side of my

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.259
webcomic because i had no idea where to
start

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.969
I started looking at other people's art
in my school, until I saw one girl's

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.070
drawings, and I was absolutely ~a m a z e d~

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.110
(SHE'S THE ONEEEEEE)

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.880
I basically told her: you're my friend now!!

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.250
she probably didn't realize what she was
getting herself into

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.990
we're still friends to this day, but
still, I am an annoying friend

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.689
seriously this one time at lunch i
randomly asked her

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.400
"will you say fo' shizzle?"

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.540
(because she's blaaaaaaaaaaaaack)

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.380
she said "no" (aw)

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.070
"what if I get a hundred people to sign a
petition?"

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.620
"ok", she said thinking I wouldn't spend
the rest of lunch going to random tables

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.829
having them sign a piece of paper and
then having everyone in my English and

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.110
drama class sign it

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.470
I got a hundred signatures in one day
(get on my level) and she being true to

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.190
her word said it and I taped it too. I asked her if I could show the video and she

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.390
said no.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.200
"what if I get a hundred people to sign-"
"NO" so sorry guys

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.560
here's the audio ;)

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.420
okay so there's already captions for this now

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.200
so I can take a break

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.460
wooooooh

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.260
I heard Rogue One was pretty good

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.100
I tried to make french subtitles for the fanfiction video

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.440
(i don't know french)

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.980
I know Chinese tho

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.500
(asiiiiiaaaaaannnnnnn)

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.500
mission report december 16 1991

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.060
pokÃ©mon sun and moon seems to be pretty good so far

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.380
oh frick i gotta go now bye guys

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.340
and I'm also friends with this ginger kid
and to protect his identity we'll call

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.080
him Nick Jiggly

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.590
that was a nickname I gave him because
his real name was Nick Jernigan and

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.970
what really sparked our friendship was
our love for dating women (james is a player) I'm just

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.680
kidding we played magic: the gathering
and he was /slightly/ better than me but

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.369
only because he bought the most
expensive cards so whenever he would be

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.299
beating me

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.299
I would get back at him emotionally by
insulting his red hair

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.830
"I attack with my Reaper from the abyss-"
SAYS THE GINGER &gt;:(

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.620
he would always laugh about it (but I secretly meant it)

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.640
so this one time my boy scout troop took a trip

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.459
to a lake and there was one spot where you go cliff diving and I wasn't on the

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.780
young side anymore

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.709
I was more in the middle and everyone
was having a fun times

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.010
swimming and jumping and this one kid
named Harris

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.040
(he was one of the young ones) he came up
to us and said "my mom told me I can't go

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.040
cliff diving" and in my mind I was
thinking

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.760
"mkay harris YOUR MOM'S NOT HERE" but I didn't really care too much. a couple

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.500
hours passed and everyone just started
talking on top of the cliff and I spot

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.100
Harris sitting by himself and I get an idea &gt;:) (I'm so evil heheheh)

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.470
I said hey Harris why don't you come sit
with us

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.400
(I hope you know where I'm going with this) Harris joined the group

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.430
still it's quiet though and I wanted to
push him off the cliff

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.070
I started to think of ways i can get
him close to the edge but the dude was

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.340
already standing near the edge back turned probably being of something emotional

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.990
tell me if you were in my position you
wouldn't push him off the edge and I

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.620
scream,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.710
"YOUR MOM'S NOT HERE!" as I push him off

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.350
he was fiiiiine I jumped off there plenty of
times. we should have seen his face

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.500
he flailed his arms a lot but was dead silent

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.209
he probably thought he was going to die
hey Harris was a quiet kid he didn't

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.320
have any friends either

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.530
so after I pushed him people talked to him
for like five minutes

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.700
so Harris, if you're watching this, you're
welcome ;)
