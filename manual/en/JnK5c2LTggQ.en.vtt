00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:05.567
No one knows exactly when

00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:07.667
the technique of
fusing glass began.

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:09.667
There is evidence that
the Egyptians knew

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:12.933
how to fuse glass
as early as 2,000 BCE,

00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.300
but some argue
that the Romans

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.233
were better glassworkers.

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:18.133
Glass has always
had great appeal,

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.300
but what if you were to
combine the hardness of glass

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.900
with the
receptiveness of clay?

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.200
This piece of glass was
allowed to melt

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.133
into a one of a
kind clay carving.

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.433
Isn't it amazing how the glass
picks up the texture

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:31.967
of the clay?

00:00:31.967 --> 00:00:33.367
In textural glass slumping,

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.900
a clay texture mat is
carved out of soft clay

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.167
in the student's design,

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:39.967
and then used as a
mold to slump glass into.

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:42.900
And, the mold can be
used again and again.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.500
We'll be working with a
piece of glass that is 3 by 6,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.167
so I've cut a slab of Amaco's
Raku Clay into a piece

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:52.333
that is 3 1/2 by 6 1/2

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.733
because the clay
will shrink about 10%.

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:58.533
This tile has been allowed to
dry to a leather hard state.

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.933
Now I will begin my carving.

00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.867
Any design can be
carved into the clay.

00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:04.000
If you like,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.667
you can transfer a drawn image
into the tile by placing it

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:13.033
on top and using a pencil to
transfer the lines to the clay.

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:13.867
When carving,

00:01:13.867 --> 00:01:16.233
I like to use the whole tool
so that the texture will be

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:17.467
very evident.

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:19.733
The only caution I can mention
in the carving step

00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.800
is to avoid under cuts.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.600
An under cut might happen
if the carving is so deep

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.400
that it leaves a portion
of the clay at the top

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.900
that is hanging over.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.033
As long as the tool
doesn't go down too deeply,

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:31.867
this won't happen.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.233
When the carving is complete,
carefully flip over the tile

00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:46.667
and poke a few holes
in the back with a needle tool

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:52.467
to allow steam to escape
during the firing.

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:54.100
When the carving
is completely dry,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.500
it should be bisque
fired to cone two,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.400
and then two thin coats of
kiln wash would need to be

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.933
applied to the bisqued tile.

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:02.767
This keeps the glass from
sticking to the clay

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:04.133
during slumping.

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:10.500
Next we'll need to cut the 6 by
6 glass piece exactly in half.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.567
I've made a mark on the
glass to use as a guide

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:15.167
when cutting.

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:16.567
Using a class cutter,

00:02:16.567 --> 00:02:18.767
I will score
firmly across the class.

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:21.200
Listen for that satisfying
sound to let you know

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.867
that you've applied
enough pressure.

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:24.533
Then, flip the glass over,

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:27.100
strike it a few times with
the other side of the cutter,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.433
and it should easily
break along the scored line.

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:34.967
Place both pieces of glass
directly over the clay mold.

00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:36.900
Clear class really
shows off the texture,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.667
but you could also use a
coloured transparent glass.

00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:41.200
If you want even more colour,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.433
strategic placement of
glass stringers or chunks

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:45.933
add interest.

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:49.700
A drop of glue will
hold them in place.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.133
Now you're ready to place it
in a programable ceramic

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:53.567
or glass kiln.

00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:55.467

this project
