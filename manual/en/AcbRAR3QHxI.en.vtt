keurig rivo single serve espresso machine it got lavazza technology in it

uh... which is going to ensure that we
get a really nice shot of espresso

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.160
and one of many users awesome machine to
do is to show you guys the two ways

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.609
you can make a cafe machiavelli's

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.979
with that said let's try again and talk
about these two recipes for capping maki

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:32.600
idle

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.640
with the q wreak rego single service
prescription

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.790
okay so what you're going to need it for
this recipe no matter what uh... is paid

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.610
cop or market sometimes and usually
you're going to be ok with something a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.340
little bit smaller got these nights

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.240
abode of double walled

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.490
uh... cops here this is an espresso
shock cup

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.030
and and this was just a little bit baker
for slightly larger beverage that you

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.700
need a good cop and documents too big

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.150
do not gonna be making a whole lot of
effort here

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.890
then you're going to need to be revoked
pack these are specific to the curie

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.120
revoke easier expresso packs

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.200
to go in east makers press of course

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.560
and that you will need some milk some
nice cold milk have got some here in my

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.870
state was still picked up at your this
is just cow's milk

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.030
you can use prematurely type of milk
that you would want at to used by

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.340
amnesties record house no today

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.280
and of course finally immediately
recreate though which is going to bring

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.760
your stress so and it's also going to
take care

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.470
frothing your milk so it's not going to
talk about how this is done now

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.470
first waited make a mock yet and i'm
going to show you is going to be the

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.049
american way of making a mafia now

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.200
the american machiavelli's a little bit
different from the italian mafia no

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.299
because typically has a little bit more
milk to it now baaki out of literally

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.630
means

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.569
and there's a machine telling us it's
ready to markets of milk

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.650
uh... but what the state what this means
is literally two mark

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.860
and what this was usually used words by
uh... barristers would use this

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.679
two oh i didn't waiters

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.490
knowledge by looking at a beverage of
was just breast so drink had milk units

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.399
because espresso usually one ml canon so
they would bark the espresso

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.199
with a little bit of milk

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.790
now the first and going to do isn't
going to place my espresso cup

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.680
and i'm going to open up the revolt
among the placement repo pack

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.279
now i'm ready to start growing i'm going
to do a short shouted espresso just a

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.719
single shot

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.260
machines gonna start brewing premature
most immediately which is great moves

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.949
very quickly and gives you that shocked
of espresso

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:39.569
of course as i was saying the whole
purpose here is tune

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.909
your espresso with some mail this is the
american way of doing it by the way so

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.859
we're going to do is we're actually
going to mark

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.509
the espresso with some of our milk

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:53.189
so when i'm going to do is i'm going to
take my milk picture out lama espresso

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.650
as being brewed

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.290
i'm going to add some not now i'm just
gonna go out and go to about the max the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.389
line today because of the century two
ways to do this and i want some extra

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:03.169
milk

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.519
for what we're doing

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.709
place are milk kichu back into the reno
whom we hear that beat we know that the

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.199
machine is ready to go

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:14.849
now i'm gonna go ahead and just gruesome
cappuccino phone

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.510
and uh... on you do is pressed the
cappuccino box in here

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.479
on the top uh... roebuck sins which is
the profit margins on the machine

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:27.409
now of course when the machine is all
done frothing up are melted

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.579
which we can see it's all done in only
took a look

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.680
medicator taken up to that

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.510
uh... it's going to give us a lot of
nice frost pharma to use park for a

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.259
beverage

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:40.489
and that's because we have that frothing
west that's connected to the lead right

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.379
here

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.509
so now we're going to do is we're just
gonna mark that's just a tiny bit wanna

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:48.109
markers press so with a little bit of
mail

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.719
moment last mover rain here

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:53.299
who's going to mark this just a little
bit

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.599
just a little bit of mail

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.079
not too much

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.419
and i'm really just going to take kind
of a dollop of foam

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:02.700
and place this

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.249
onto

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:07.119
nice present

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:08.669
so that right there

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.969
is pretty much the way that you

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:15.959
would expect for maki either to usually
be made in most american coffee shops

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.229
it's got a lot more espresso very little
milk but it's just marks just a tiny

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.999
full day on the top of all over the
phone

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:26.379
and you could of course a justice based
on how much milk you want to have in

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:29.430
your beverage but this is the way that i
think he would usually see animals

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.959
coffee shops now

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:33.499
was how about doing this the italian
weight is the way that i was used to

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:36.369
doing it most the time working in a
coffee shop

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:40.610
men open up every vote ganem going to
take a second revoke pack

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.469
place it into the machine

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:47.499
so i'm going to mark my milk with
espresso so i'm going to do

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:49.340
man had a little bit of milk

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.789
it on to do too much

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.400
give yourself some foam

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:59.219
again you can adjust this based on your
liking

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:03.189
depending on how much from you like
again you convey regards

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:05.090
i find i like a good amount of time

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.210
now which is going to add this and we're
going to actually marker milk using our

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.430
sponsors so again

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.190
i'm going to use the single shot to
express and i recollect the turned

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.080
itself off all the time her

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.659
so you need to turn it back on when he
read double b_ x-rated star brewing

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:25.660
i mean do again a short shot to the
spurs

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.180
now usually if you were to do this or
get this in a coffee shop and have it

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.110
done in this fashion

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.990
the especially brewed separately into a
small espresso picture of some kind and

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.789
then it would be poured it into your
milk in your cup

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.460
literally marking the mail

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.960
with the espresso shot now the reason
you would use that espresso pictures

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.989
that would let you

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:48.679
essentially get better pain that you get
i'm much more distinct mark in the top

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:49.970
of the mill but

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.439
because we like doing things in one fell
swoop here in a rum cup dot com we

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:56.240
thought well will just use the machine
to mark the mall

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.180
so right there you can see now have a
nice little market on the top showing my

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.270
espresso

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.360
and i've got some nice wearing going on
as well

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.389
now this is sort of like a lot a but
it's gonna be a little bit stronger

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:10.740
usually watches have a lot more milk in
it

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.060
then you can vary this based on the
recipe however it is that you were to

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.059
have your drink taste

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:19.119
this is about the typical way that i
would usually make machiavelli

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:22.959
pretty simple recipe eldest overview
that three guys one more time all you

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:24.870
need to do this is of course a milk

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.060
his regular cow's milk you can use
sorely almond whichever type of milk

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.240
email like knee-jerk eureka reva machine
of course and then you need to revoke

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.999
pack

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:35.419
through your spread so

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.870
do you know and then just decide which
fashion and you would like to make your

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:39.999
machiavellian

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:43.129
