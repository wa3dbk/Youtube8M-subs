00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.100
Welcome to a new design chat video. Now the
topic of today's video is one that I'm often

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.990
asked about in comments, tweets and emails
from people who are looking to get started

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.121
in design and that's 'do I have to go to design
school or college university whatever you

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:24.130
want to call it, in order to be a designer'.
The short answer is no you don't, but the

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.079
longer, probably more accurate response is
that there isn't really a one-size-fits all

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:34.280
answer to the question. To be a good designer
you do need to learn design. It's not something

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.730
that anyone is just born with I don't think,
I think everyone has to do some learning.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.830
You need to know about design principles and
typography and composition and colour theory.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.400
You need to learn how to talk about your work,
how to present to clients. It helps to have

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.750
some sort of background in graphic design
history so you can understand where the rules

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.330
of design came from before you play around
with breaking them in a clever way. And you

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.330
need to learn about creativity and design
thinking and all that good stuff. How you

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.920
learn those things though depends on the kind
of person you are.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.220
Design is one of those skills that you can
learn without a formal education with the

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.180
help of online tutorials and books, and by
talking to people in the industry. I really

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.149
like that about my profession, because people
learn in different ways and I don't think

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.789
it's fair for tests and grades to be a measure
of someone's skill level when that's not really

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.729
a situation they thrive in. With that said,
as you many know, I did go to design school

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.929
and I'm really glad I did. You have to be
super disciplined and passionate to be able

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.290
to teach yourself design and at 18, when I
started my course, I just wouldn't have had

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.159
the first clue how to go about learning the
things that I did at university on my own.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.590
I really enjoyed the structure that design
school gave me. I think I would have found

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.639
it really hard to challenge myself as much
if I were setting myself briefs, so doing

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:53.219
assignments, even though at many times I absolutely
hated them, was really good for me. I think

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.750
you can't become a good designer without feedback,
and design school has that built in. You're

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.999
surrounded by tutors and other students who
can give you feedback all the time so you

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:05.189
can learn from what they say. And those feedback
sessions in design school really helped me

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.740
learn how to talk about my work, how to present
it and also how to give feedback to other

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.110
people. How to critique others work. I have
done a whole other video about critiquing

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.930
if you're interested in that it will be linked
below because that is a really important skill

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.410
for designers to learn.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.370
I think a very common misconception about
learning design is that it's about learning

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.360
software like photoshop or illustrator. Yes
learning software is big part of being a designer

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.480
and mastering software and knowing all the
shortkeys and things like that can make you

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.040
really efficient which is great. But the software
is just really a means to an end. It's a way

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.970
of visualising your ideas. It's not going
to do the creative thinking and problem solving

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.720
for you, you have to do that yourself as the
designer. So you can't expect to just learn

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.340
photoshop and suddenly expect to be a really
good designer. I hope that's not too harsh

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.340
to say.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.550
I think the design degree that I did in particular,
which was a bachelor of design at Massey University

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.860
in Wellington (it was a four year course)
was a reallu good one because it didn't put

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.590
much focus on learning the software, it was
more teaching us how to think creatively and

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.220
how to think like designers, we were expected
to learn the software mostly on our own. So

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.650
yeah it was focussed on design thinking and
how to respond to a brief in a way that means

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.860
the client will get the result they want.
Normally it was a fake client but still. It

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.270
was learning by doing and learning by getting
feedback along the way.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.930
That design thinking, I reckon, is much harder
to learn on your own or from a course online.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.810
I think you need to surround yourself with
designers and start getting a glimpse, as

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.090
much as you can, into their process. Don't
just look at their finished work and try to

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.680
emulate it, you need to understand the process
that went in behind it cos that's where you're

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.190
gonna learn. Design meetups are great for
that sort of thing I guess, anywhere where

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.530
you can just talk to another designer. And
I guess follow people on Twitter who share

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.010
a lot of their process would help as well.
You just need to get yourself immersed in

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.090
that world so you can start thinking like
a designer as well.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.900
I think I'm getting off track but to sum up,
if you're wondering if you should go to design

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.580
school or not, you need to think about what
sort of learning will suit YOU best and pick

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.700
that. One option isn't any easier than the
other. They're just different ways of going

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.570
about it. You have to learn the same stuff
in the end. I personally, like I said, would

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.030
have found it really hard to learn design
by myself. I really enjoyed going to university

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.470
and having that formal education. I don't
think that I would have been challenged enough

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.799
if I was trying to teach myself, but like
I said, that's just me and you might be different.

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.500
Something to be aware of if you choose the
self-taught route is that often job listings

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.720
will say that they require a design degree
or the equivalent experience so you really

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.760
have to hustle to get that experience to prove
yourself. And even if you do have a degree

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.820
you still have to hustle and get experience
anyway because people always want to see real

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.580
world examples in your portfolio. they want
to see that you've worked with actual clients

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.260
before. So either way, try and get out there
and build up your portfolio with some freelance

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.260
jobs.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.750
Perhaps getting a job at a big corporate advertising
firm might be out of the question if you choose

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.320
the self-taught route because they tend to
value things like degrees, but that's okay

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.040
there's plenty of other different types of
companies out there who, like i said, will

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.290
take experience as well as a degree so, you
don't have to worry.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.220
I've rambled enough so I'm going to leave
it there but Im really curious to know what

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.350
you think of this topic, so let me know in
the comments what you think about going to

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.290
university to learn design vs teaching yourself.
Hope you enjoyed hearing my thoughts on the

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.060
matter. I'm always available in the comments
or on twitter if you want to discuss further.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.430
