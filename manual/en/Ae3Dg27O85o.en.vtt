00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.280
This is a video for an origami ninja star.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.870
As you can see this is actually going to use
two different sheets of paper.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.000
So go ahead and pick out your two sheets of
paper and we're going to do the same thing

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.830
to both sheets of paper for a couple of the
steps.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.980
So the first thing start with the white side
and we're going to do a book fold.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.960
So this is going to be from the bottom side,
we're going to fold it up and make sure it's

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.430
nice and lined up, so there's no white showing,
and squish it down just like that.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.580
We're going to do that on both sheets, now
we're going to open those up, and now we're

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.580
going to do a cupboard fold.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.650
So we're going to take the bottom and the
top and we're going to fold both of those

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.970
exactly into the middle line that we just
created, and it'll sort of look a bit like

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.870
a cupboard or a cabinet, the way the doors
open up like that.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:09.620
We're going to do that on both sheets of paper
at the top and the bottom.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.040
Next we're going to fold this in half.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.290
So use that first crease that we already had,
that we already make, go ahead and fold those

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.070
both in half.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.970
That'll give us our two bars just like this.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.500
Now from here they're going to diverge.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.140
They're going to be a little different steps
on each one, so make sure you pay really close

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.140
attention.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.140
What we're going to do is the same folds,
but they're going to be on the opposite on

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.140
both sides.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.310
So make sure you pay really close attention.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.200
I'm going to fold the top left over on the
left hand side, and the top right on the right

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.140
hand side, so they will be the same folds,
but you see how they're going in opposite

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.430
directions like that.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.170
So right there at the top and I'm going to
do the same thing at the bottom, but this

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.659
time I'm going to go the bottom right on the
left hand side, and the bottom left on the

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.580
right hand side just like that.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.850
Now if you were to put the two of them together,
you sort of see how it looks a little bit

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.070
like a rocket ship just like that.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.130
What we're going to do is we're going to split
the rocket ship in half and line up the two

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.480
bottom points.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.099
So that makes a little bit of a V just like
this.

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.790
Go ahead and take one finger and hold that
V in place.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.239
Now I'm going to take this flap, the one on
the left hand side, and I'm going to fold

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.769
it down like this.

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.370
What's going to happen is this edge right
here is going to line up along this edge.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.810
So as I bring this down it lines right up
along there, and then the same thing on the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.140
other side, where this edge right here is
going to line up along this edge.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.300
So it's going to come down and it's going
to fold towards the bottom right like that.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.739
That makes a little bit like an M shape.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:59.959
Next we're going to flip the two over, give
it a bit of the W. Now once we have them this

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.150
way, we're going to do the same fold again.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.159
We're going to take this flap, we're going
to fold it down to the bottom corner, again,

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:13.049
using this edge to line up with this edge
just like this, like that.

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:19.049
And the same thing over here, this edge right
here is going to line up right along that

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.689
center line.

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:26.560
Great, so these two are the same types of
folds, but they're opposites of each other.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.980
They're mirror images.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:36.059
So now flip them over, so now you see how
this side has two triangles and this shape

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:38.689
in the middle right there.

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:42.849
What's going to happen, and I'll show you
how to do it on this one right here first.

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.239
We're going to take this triangle that's right
here, and we're going to fold it all the over,

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.730
we're going to fold it over the entire model.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.049
So this is the line that's going to be the
crease, so this edge is going to come up against

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.519
this edge, fold it all the over.

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.760
The same thing on the bottom, this edge up
to here just like that.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.909
Now I'm going to do the same thing on this
one.

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.370
Make sure that you push really hard on these,
you want to get these nice and flat.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.260
They're going to want to pop up like that,
but that's okay.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.389
Same thing over here, I'm going to fold this
edge over and this edge over, so again it's

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:26.900
the same folds, but they look a little different,
because they're mirror images.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.530
Now what we've got here are two units that
if you look at them like this, they kind of

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.450
have a little bit of a C shape to them.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.070
What's going to happen is we're going to try
and interlock these two together.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.760
The way that works, take one of them and put
it down on the table.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.560
This one for me is going to be the purple
one.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.160
And make sure that the way you have it is
with the triangle on this side, and the triangle

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.190
here and then the shape in the middle, so
there are three shapes on this that are pointed

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.190
up.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.230
If you flip it over and look at it, this is
just two triangles, so it looks different.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.920
But just have it where it looks this side
up.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.590
And now I'm going to take the other piece,
I'm going to flip it over so that just the

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:17.980
two triangles are showing, and I'm going to
put it on top, as a plus sign just like this.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.530
Now we've got everything lined up and once
you have it right here, these folds that we

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.690
already made, do you see how they're all happy
to go that way, because we've already creased

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.690
them down?

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.340
Go ahead and fold that one down, but when
you do we're going to weave it underneath

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:38.110
this big blue triangle, so you see how it
comes down and it's now underneath that blue

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.110
triangle.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.300
So you can sort of weave it under this way.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.190
We'll just pick the triangle up and put it
under.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:50.030
And then the same thing here, we're going
to fold this one over, but fit it underneath

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.030
that blue triangle.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.680
You see how it makes a nice weaving pattern
right there?

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.530
And it's holding together pretty well at this
point, it should get a little more stable.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.240
Make sure that you're trying to get them where
these two are always at a 90 degree or perpendicular

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.020
angle as much as you can.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.360
So we've got this, and now we're going to
flip the entire model over, and we have the

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.150
last two steps are the same thing.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.430
We're going to use these flaps that come over
and what we're going to do is we're going

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.610
to weave them underneath those panels.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:24.900
So you see how this blue one fit underneath
the purple flap right there, it fits right

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.900
underneath.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.210
Then we've got the last one here, we're going
to fold that one up.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:36.950
And now I'm going to weave it underneath the
purple one there just like that.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:47.080
And once you've done that on both sides, that
is the completed origami ninja star.
