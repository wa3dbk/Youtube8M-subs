00:00:15.068 --> 00:00:15.568
Self.

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:16.572
Society.

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:20.300
Where does each of us fall in this cycle, and why?

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.000
Friendly.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.682
Rude.

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:22.182
Loud.

00:00:22.182 --> 00:00:22.682
And quiet.

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:24.001
These mind-boggling possibilities

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:25.800
all point towards one theory.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.700
That of personality.

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:28.889
Meet Extravert.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.700
She thrives in social situations,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.300
and draws energy from interactions. 

00:00:32.904 --> 00:00:33.544
Parties,

00:00:33.544 --> 00:00:34.044
group activities, 

00:00:34.044 --> 00:00:34.611
gatherings.

00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:35.700
You name it.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.000
Now, meet Introvert. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Ever-present in body,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.700
travelling in spirit.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.800
She finds reward in spending time alone.

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:42.482
Reading.

00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:42.982
Writing.

00:00:42.982 --> 00:00:44.900
Analysing the materials read or written, 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.000
reflecting on the analysis made, 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.400
then reviewing these reflections!

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.000
You get the idea.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Popularised by Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Gustav Jung, 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
these two types are considered to be the central feature of human personality.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.500
Eastern cultures are thought to be introvert-oriented, 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.000
but contrary to popular belief, 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.500
our culture, like most others in the world,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.000
clearly celebrates extraversion. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.200
Here, extraversion is a norm.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.800
A desired necessity. 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.400
Growing up, have you ever been referred to as a "laata" or a laati" just because you didn't talk much?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.000
Well, get this.

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.000
You're OK.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.200
Just a little misunderstood. 

00:01:19.776 --> 00:01:20.276
So.

00:01:20.276 --> 00:01:23.000
What do we know about introverts?

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.000
Introverts are shy.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.301
No!

00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:29.000
We're just as loud and crazy as the next person. 

00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:30.207
At times. 

00:01:30.207 --> 00:01:33.200
Introverts are bad leaders. 

00:01:33.525 --> 00:01:34.025
Wrong.

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:34.525
By believing this,

00:01:35.025 --> 00:01:37.000
you will be denouncing the legacies of leaders like

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.128
Mark Zuckerberg, 

00:01:38.128 --> 00:01:38.915
Steve Jobs, 

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:39.905
Einstein, 

00:01:42.595 --> 00:01:43.900
and Bill Gates.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.300
The key to our existence is to accept the fact that 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.000
we all fluctuate in our behaviours, 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and that's OK.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:52.752
So, come. 

00:01:52.752 --> 00:01:54.500
Let us embrace the symmetry, 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.900
and celebrate this fascinating continuum.
