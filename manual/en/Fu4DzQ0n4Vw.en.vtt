00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.350
We are going to replace this old timber frame
door and window with this aluminium frame.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.220
Now that involves moving this brick section
here.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.020
That's right and we are going to do it using
this brilliant WA made saw, it cuts through

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.510
the brick like you wouldn't believe.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.510
You ready Dene?

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.259
Absolutely, I'll just move this across.

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.630
We begin by marking the cut.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.550
It's really important when using any power
equipment that you have the right safety gear.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.590
Gloves, masks for dust, all important glasses
because you don't wanna affect your eyes and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.670
ear plugs.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.410
You got those in Dene?

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.410
Dene?

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.600
They work.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.510
Why don't you start.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.510
Yeah.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.510
Ok.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.899
It's a good idea to lay a ground sheet to
protect the wooden deck from the mess we will

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.109
undoubtedly create.

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.539
The all-saw, with the wood cutting blade is
perfect for cutting through the old wooden

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.539
frame.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.670
Then out comes the small window and the remaining
frame.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.519
So now what we are going to do is cut down
the wall using our all-saw and get rid of

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.519
it.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.519
You right Dene?

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:08.470
Let's go.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.380
We remove the old brick sill.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.150
It comes away fairly easily with just a few
taps from our trusty sledge hammer.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.700
Our WA made all-saw is perfect for this job.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.120
It gives a good straight cut with relatively
little effort and unlike angle grinders doesnâ€™t

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.790
throw out much dust.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.790
Should be fairly loose.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.950
We have cut right through the first leaf and
the bricks break away leaving a very clean

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.950
finish.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.600
We then cut the inner leaf.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:51.950
The brilliant cutting action of the all-saw
makes the job very easy.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.430
The remaining bricks come out with just a
few taps and we end up with a very clean cut

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.470
on the inner and outer walls.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.570
Beautiful, clean cut Dene.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.679
We then remove the rest of the door frame
and add some concrete to extend the old sill

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.610
so that it runs the full length of the new
frame.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.530
We drive some treated pine mounting blocks
into the wall cavity.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.950
These will provide secure mounting positions
for the frame screws.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:30.340
When installing this kind of window, it's
important to follow the manufactures instructions.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.480
We then fit the fixed glass panel into position
and screw in the locator plugs at the bottom

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.380
and top.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.170
Yep, runs beautifully.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.380
Well there it is, all we got to do is finish
of the trim inside and put the handle on.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.030
And it looks fantastic and it was pretty simple
too.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.030
It was.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.030
Cuppa tea time.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.760
Good Idea.
