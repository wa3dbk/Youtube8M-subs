Hey guys Maxine here at AccessoryGeeks.com
and I have in front of me the Gogroove

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.380
Panda Pal Portable Speaker System.
It's a tongue twister.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.720
These portable speaker systems are
compatible with any device using

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.040
a standard 3.5 mm headphone Jack and it runs
on 3 triple A batteries sadly those aren't

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.100
included but it does come with a USB core
which you can run through to your computer

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.790
to play the speakers as well.
So these are fantastic.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.220
I'll be doing a speaker test in just
a second, but real quick I want to go over

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.410
to the basic components
of the speaker itself.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.100
As you can see here speakers are located
where the Panda's eyes would be and as you

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.370
can see this is the on button and this
is where you would keep your batteries.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.230
I already have some installed for convenience
but once you turn the speaker on you get

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.640
a nice blue glow at the front.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.050
Now as you could see here the 3.5 mm jack
chord is very discrete and it wraps around

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:09.410
the Panda so you can get up to a good foot
of wire to go from speaker to device.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.950
Now I'm going to go ahead and do an audio
test for you guys so you can check out the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.640
quality of the speaker and then we're going
to graduate the volumes so here we go.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.500
Let me know if you recognize the song.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.940
So as you can see great volume, sounds 
fantastic and there's a lot of base in the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:46.420
song so not bad at all, it sounded 
really clear, no real fuzz so not bad for

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.790
a portable speaker system, you can find
these at accessory geeks.com for $19.99

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.540
