Hi I'm Tim Gipson and I want to talk to you
about how to loosen an unstuck screw. Now

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.640
what I've done is I've just put some screws
here in this wood block just so we can demonstrate

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.510
some things but you have different reasons
that screws have stuck. Now you may have where

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.330
the heads have gotten stripped out, or you
may run into a situation where you've got

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.730
a bolt or a screw that it in metal parts and
those tend to rust. Now first if it is just

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.670
rust that you are dealing with a screw that
is stuck then you want to use something like

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:42.179
WD40. WD40 will actually penetrate down into
a screw and many times will loosen up that

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:46.829
rust and allow you to get that stuck screw
out and simply you just want to spray down

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.230
at the base and I'll just demonstrate for
you now. Now if the screw still does not come

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.600
out after you spray then what you want to
do is you want to take your screwdriver and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.309
in this case it is a Phillip's Head and just
give a couple gentle taps with a hammer and

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.851
a lot of times what that will do is that will
loosen that rust up. Now also important to

00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:14.470
consider when you deal with a screw that has
a Phillip's Head such as this which is that

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.210
cross pattern you want to make sure you use
the right size. This is a #1 Phillip's Head

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.640
and this is a #2 so this is for really small
screw heads so try to get loosen up a stuck

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.160
screw. Make sure you are using the right size
head and that will help you out. Now if tapping

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.950
doesn't work and you've still got a stuck
screw you can also take a file such as this

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.280
and you can file each side of the screw so
that you have a flat surface on both sides

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.890
of the screw and then you can take a pair
of vice grips and they'll very easily clamp

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.140
or if you don't have vice grips and you've
got those flat sides you can take just a regular

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.320
set of pliers and with those flat surfaces
it will act just like a bolt where you can

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.490
now rotate this out. The next thing you can
do is you can take either a file or a hack

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:15.319
saw and you can actually cut a slot in the
top of the screw and then just use a regular

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:22.480
tipped screw driver to now get that out. Then
also in the store you can actually buy sets

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.689
or you can buy screw removers where in that
case you would want to use a little oil to

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.340
put in the top. You would drill down into
the top of the screw and then you would use

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.459
an extractor like this to remove that. I'm
Tim Gipson and that's some tips on how to

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.319
remove a stuck screw.
