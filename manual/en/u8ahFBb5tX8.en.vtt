00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.759
Sealing like a professional is not impossibly
difficult.

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.939
With professional guidance and by taking the
necessary care, you can do a lot yourself.

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.939
Careful preparation, high-quality materials
and the right tools will help you.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.649
Before you apply the silicone, clean the joint
with an acetone-based cleaning agent to remove

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.839
grease and other contamination.

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.460
Apply the cleaning agent to a fresh cloth
and thoroughly clean the joint and surface.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.460
It's advisable to wear gloves while doing
this to protect the skin.

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.129
For deep joints, it's important to insert
a backer rod.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.100
This will give the subsequently applied silicone
grip and ensure that it doesn't run into the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.729
cracks.

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.990
This is because the silicone is only supposed
to adhere to two sides, so that any movement

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.680
can be optimally and elastically absorbed,
and so prevent damage.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.229
Cut open the silicone cartridge with a cutter
or sharp knife...

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.289
... and screw on the nozzle applicator provided.

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.280
Cut off the top of the nozzle applicator diagonally.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.280
The right tools reduce the risk of injury.
The opening of the nozzle should match the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.520
width of the joint.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.579
Insert the silicone cartridge into the sealant
gun and stabilize it with the plunger.

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.850
The cartridge should hold firmly.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.119
Press the silicone out of the cartridge as
far as the tip of the nozzle.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.569
Apply to the joint with a steady hand at a
forty-five degree angle and draw along the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.870
joint evenly.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.870
Try to find a happy medium -- apply neither
too much nor too little silicone to the joint.

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:34.579
Use a wood or sealant tool to remove any excess
silicone at a forty-five degree angle.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.150
Make sure to work away from your body and
catch the excess silicone with your hand to

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.120
avoid unnecessary mess.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.439
Please remove excess silicone from the spatula.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:56.439
If there are further, smaller silicone residues,
remove them with a smaller spatula.

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:05.269
Now wet one or more fingers with diluted sealant
tooling agent and gently wipe down the joint.

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.540
Please wash your hands afterward and use hand
cream.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.030
If you were careful with your work, you should
now have a triangular joint.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.799
Depending on the climate, it takes up to twenty-four
hours for the joint to reach its full performance.

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:27.799
First, a skin forms. Then the silicone crosslinks
and cures under atmospheric humidity.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.549
Why do you have to clean the joint?

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.329
This is necessary to optimize the silicone's
adhesion.

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:50.599
Contaminants such as dust or grease will interfere.

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:57.599
Using masking tape around the joint can help
the less experienced user to work more neatly.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.090
The cured silicone can stick to the masking
tape so it should be removed immediately after

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.700
tooling.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.060
What is a sealant tooling agent? And how is
it different to a detergent?

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.930
The diluted tooling agent later ensures that
the silicone does not adhere to the sealing

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.470
tools too much and significantly simplifies
sealing.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.630
To make life easier for yourself, you could
immerse your work materials in the tooling

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.260
agent before sealing.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.950
Good tooling agents are chosen to match the
sealant.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.200
Detergent can be aggressive and lead to staining.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.770
There are two types of backer rods used as
backing material for wide joints.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.440
The gray round cord is more expensive and
made of polyethylene.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.680
It's used in sanitary applications, for joints
that come in contact with water and in outdoor

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.080
applications.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.080
The yellow round cord is made of less expensive
polyurethane and is used in dry indoor applications,

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.890
such as for door cases or expansion joints.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:13.890
Here, you can see the different application
of silicone on three tiles.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.780
On the right, the optimum amount is used.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.780
In the middle, too little is applied.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.810
And on the left, too much silicone is put
in the joint.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.810
The direct comparison clearly illustrates
the differences.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.780
As an alternative to the hardwood spatula,
you can also use plastic sealant tools from

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.450
specialist stores.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.460
The important thing is that you have a triangular
joint after peeling off and tooling.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.580
It combines optimum durability and elastic
performance.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.610
Thanks to the two-sided adhesion, the silicone
can fully retain its elasticity even under

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.180
load.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:10.270
In the case of three-sided adhesion, the material
tears quicker, because it does not stay as

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.520
flexible.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.720
Mirrors can also be bonded easily and quickly.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:24.330
Correctly apply GENIOSIL N45 in serpentine
lines to the back and then firmly press the

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:29.500
mirror to the wall in the desired position.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:36.500
For large mirrors, apply the beads in vertical,
parallel lines.
