00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.220
This video is based on the 12 Principles of Animation, as described by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.960
Alright, so the next principle is called Slow In and Slow Out.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.640
This principle refers to the way pretty much all movement starts slowly, builds speed and finishes slowly.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.480
This is one of the most important principles to achieving lifelike motion.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.380
Without Slow In and Slow Out, things feel mechanical.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.880
That's because robots are one of the
only things that actually move their parts at a constant speed.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.300
To use this principle in 2D animation,
you take your extreme poses,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.120
draw a single in-between, and then draw in between those,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.920
then only in between the drawings closest to the extremes,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.650
until you're satisfied with the amount
of Slow In and Slow Out.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.860
With 3D animation and motion graphics,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.190
adding Slow In and Slow Out is a matter of changing the motion curves 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.379
from "linear" to "spline" by adjusting the bezier handles.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.050
As time progresses, the object starts slow, gets fast, and ends slowly.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.030
Use it wisely. 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.030
For example, you wouldn't
add a slow out to a bouncing ball as its colliding with the ground,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.990
but you would add it as it's bouncing
back up.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.359
You wouldn't add it to a bullet coming out of a gun

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.359
but you would add it as the gun comes up
due to whiplash.

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.639
Using this principle can allow you to
only have to draw one in-between if the motion is quick enough.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.760
Draw one in-between, and then add another frame on either either end,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.820
with the drawing slightly skewed in the
correct direction, and then it's done.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.620
Sometimes you don't even have to add the one in-between. 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.660
This kind of motion can be achieved in 3D with very extreme curves.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.860
Many people starting out with animation get impatient

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.369
and draw the next frame very far away from the beginning. 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.400
It's very unrealistic for a character to go from completely still to super fast,

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.129
so adding a few drawings to ease into it
will fix the problem.

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:37.740
A good way to fix a choppy animation is to analyze the space between the drawings.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.260
They should be evenly spaced with
drawings closer together at the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.479
beginning of the action and at the end of
the action,

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.539
and drawings farther apart in the middle.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.920
So that's it for Slow In and Slow Out, the next principle is called Arcs.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.180
Thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next video!
