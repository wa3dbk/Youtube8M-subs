NERONE RICE WITH VEGETABLES

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:20.000
I will cook today a side dish of exotic black rice Nerone and vegetables.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.570
For this recipe we will need: 1 cup rice, 2 eggplant, 2 sweet peppers, 3-4 tomatoes and leeks.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:43.099
I pre-soaked rice for 1.5 hours. Then rinse well rice, because it strongly stains the water.

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:53.719
Intersperse the rice in the saucepan - we will boil it.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:10.000
The rice cover with water.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.740
Water should be above the rice on thickness a finger.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:30.710
Close with the lid and cook on low heat until the termokontroller`s arrow reaches the middle of the green sector.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:43.710
While cooking the rice, we prepare vegetables.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.940
All vegetables should be peeled and cut into cubes.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:02:00.710
I'll start with the eggplant. Instead eggplants you can use zucchini.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:15.320
Eggplant cut into cubes. Sprinkle them with salt, so they gave out the juice and bitterness.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:37.059
In a pan pour a little oil and put on medium heat.

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:47.369
Leek cut into rings. You can use onion.

00:02:51.369 --> 00:03:00.289
Fry leek until transparent, stirring occasionally.

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:06.499
While frying the leeks, we cut sweet peppers into cubes.

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:14.669
Leeks are browned. The arrow on the pan with the rice reached the middle of the green sector.

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:22.169
Turning off the heat and leave the rice with closed lid for 15 minutes.

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:29.719
Add the sweet peppers to the leek.

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:37.919
Reduce the heat to a minimum.

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:44.779
We cut the tomatoes into cubes.

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:55.779
Squeeze the juice from the eggplants and add it in the pan.

00:03:55.779 --> 00:04:03.779
Juice stood out not much.

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:17.430
Add the tomatoes.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:39.249
You can add a little salt and pepper.

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:51.200
I cooked a lot of vegetables. The lid can not be closed.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:59.240
Cover with the bowl.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:13.809
Unscrew the termokontroller from the cover, remove the retaining ring and put on the bowl.

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:20.439
Cook until the termokontroller`s arrow reaches the middle of the green sector. Cooking on low heat.

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:29.680
Arrow of termokontroller reached the middle of the green sector. Turning off the heat and leave the lid closed for 10 minutes.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:42.999
Black rice and vegetables are cooked. Remove the lid, stir the vegetables.

00:05:51.999 --> 00:06:01.289
I feel pleasant scent of summer.

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:15.209
Nerone is unpolished rice, so it contains a lot of nutrients.

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:24.379
We spread the rice on a plate, can be on the leaves of lettuce.

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:39.990
On the top - the vegetables.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:48.029
The side dish is ready! Eat with pleasure and enjoy!

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.000
