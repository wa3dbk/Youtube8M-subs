00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:27.390
It’s awesome for several reasons, but to
me, the most significant is that...this game

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.949
is basically Ikari Warriors mixed with Turtles
In Time and a freaking ankylosaurus.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.649
Those are all good things on their own, but
combine them, and you end up with magic.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:46.199
You end up with Time Soldiers.

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:57.109
Now this game was originally released in 1987
as Battle Field.

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.809
It first hit arcades before SNK brought it
to a ton of platforms—the SEGA Master System,

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.080
the Amiga, the freaking Commodore 64.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.320
Fast forward more than three decades into
the future, and this game about fast forwarding

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.680
into the future is now available on the PlayStation
Network.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.630
This particular release is actually a PlayStation
Mini, so you can play it on both your PlayStation

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.549
3 and PSP.

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.820
Now, disclaimer—I played this on a PS3,
not a PSP.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.990
So I can only speak to how it plays on the
big console...but playing this thing on a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.700
DualShock was not a very comfortable experience.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.670
So obviously, Time Soldiers is a top-down,
run-and-gun shooter.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.040
And it’s actually an awesome one.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.780
But the problem I had with this particular
release is that...aiming feels very awkward.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.469
You move with the left analog stick, but rather
than shooting with the right stick, you shoot

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.000
with X...and you aim with the shoulder buttons.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.400
Rather than just aim and shoot simultaneously,
it’s actually a two-part process.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.579
The shoulder buttons to aim, then the X button
to shoot.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.000
And compared to similar games, that’s a
bit cumbersome.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.610
Now, it doesn’t ruin the experience, you
do get used to the controls...but they’re

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.260
just not ideal, that’s all.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.130
The game itself is fully awesome, though.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.299
You’re a badass gunman traveling through
different eras of time to save your pals.

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.900
You go through the dinosaur-infested Primitive
Age, the toga-covered Age of Rome...there

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.410
are portals scattered through each stage,
and you bounce through them one-by-one on

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.980
a rescue mission through time.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.080
As you’d expect, the game is ridiculously
hard.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.190
But fortunately, you can adjust the difficulty
level, which I did.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.690
Nonetheless, the game was praised back in
its day, and even after traveling into our

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.030
time, it still holds up.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.250
If you’re looking for a fun retro shooter
with a great look, awesome weapons and robotic

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.720
freaking dinosaurs, plug in your Flux Capacitor
and set the time coordinates to BADASS with

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.909
Time Warriors.
