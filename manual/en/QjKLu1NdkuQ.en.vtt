Scenes from our playroon

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:11.000
Anna and Kristoff are at the doctors office in Arendelle

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.160
Anna, you're holding on to me so tight

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.700
let go 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.200
I'm sorry Kristoff.  I'm just so scared to go see the doctor

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.240
I mean, what if I'm really sick

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.340
I mean, what if when he says

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.040
I have laughing cow disease

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.000
Uh...

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.510
What?!?  there's no such thing as laughing
cow disease

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.530
isn't that like a food or something?

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.660
what?  Oh, I don't know Kristoff

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.620
I'm just so nervous.  Just hold me Kristoff

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.020
Princess Anna, we're ready to see you now

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.790
come on back just wait right here

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.710
the doctor will be here to see you in
just a few minutes

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.820
Anna it's probably nothing. I bet you just have a little old cold

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.539
nothing big

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.450
Well, the cold never bothered me anyway but
you know

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.509
I don't think it's a cold I mean

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.549
when I wake up, I can't even open my eyes

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.829
I've got all this gunky mucus 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.549
all in my eyes

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.440
Then, when I get my eyes open my eyes are bright red

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.460
That's right, bright red

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:52.689
I know that's not right.  I'm not okay.  I need help.  What if..  What if...

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.820
Oh, Anna

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.100
calm down I'm sure it's nothing serious

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.840
I mean, just look at this place.  It's so

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.490
