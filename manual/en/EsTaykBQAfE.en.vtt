00:00:01.715 --> 00:00:04.298
(upbeat music)

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:08.004
(light music)

00:00:10.197 --> 00:00:11.030
(foreign speaker)

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.190
- [Translator] We're at the Ciao Marina,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.930
the touristic harbor that is
situated only five minutes

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.740
from downtown Miami, the business area.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.429
It only takes a quick trip
to get here and jump onboard,

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:24.660
and navigate one of the most
beautiful locations in America.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.990
Today we are going to
do just that and test

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.480
one of the newest 40 foot motorboats,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.615
the Deep Impact 399.

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:34.115
(light music)

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.132
The boat is 12.13 centimeters
long and 3.62 meters wide.

00:00:42.132 --> 00:00:45.280
The Deep Impact shipyard
doesn't produce a large number

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.310
of boats, as they prefer to
construct a few models that are

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.079
custom made for the owner.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.579
(light music)

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.965
It is an open spot fisherman
boat that is exclusively

00:00:56.965 --> 00:01:00.163
dedicated to fishing with
tanks for the bait and catch

00:01:00.163 --> 00:01:04.030
and plenty of stowage space
for all the equipment.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.224
Nonetheless, it can also
be used as a cruiser

00:01:06.224 --> 00:01:09.420
because at the bow, there
is enough space to sunbathe,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.780
and in front of the cockpit,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.660
there are two comfortable seats.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.093
At the stern, however, everything
is dedicated to fishing.

00:01:16.093 --> 00:01:18.593
(light music)

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.980
The hard top roof is essential

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.210
in protecting you from
the sun and it has a very

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.750
bold design just like
the rest of the boat.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.139
The aluminum was varnished
in black to give it an even

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:30.843
more aggressive look.

00:01:31.868 --> 00:01:34.368
(light music)

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.300
The sides of the bridge are
particularly high and well

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.070
padded to protect the pilot.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.140
It has handlebars, handrails,
and fishing rod holders

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.040
that are integrated along the
whole perimeter of the boat.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.831
But as I mentioned before,
the owner can decide

00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:51.365
which particular accessories
can be included or not.

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:53.865
(light music)

00:01:57.011 --> 00:01:58.530
(foreign speaking)

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.760
- [Translator] The model
we are testing today

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.180
is powered by three engines

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.280
of 300 horse power each,
but it can also be modified

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.730
to fit four engines of
350 horse power each

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.830
for a total of 1,400 horse power.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.400
Is this particular engine
adapted to the boat?

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.223
We'll find out today during our test.

00:02:16.223 --> 00:02:18.806
(upbeat music)

00:02:20.286 --> 00:02:22.140
(foreign speaking)

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.570
- [Translator] This location is fantastic

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.242
not only for the catch you can find here

00:02:25.242 --> 00:02:28.300
but also for the amount of
accessories that sport fisherman

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.060
can find in the specialized
stores around Miami

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.230
and Miami Beach.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.937
(upbeat music)

00:02:34.937 --> 00:02:35.890
(foreign speaking)

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.020
- [Translator] Miami is the
link between North America

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.308
and Central and South America
for historical, linguistic,

00:02:40.308 --> 00:02:44.400
ethnic and cultural
reasons, and it is defined

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.213
as the Capital of the Americas.

00:02:48.186 --> 00:02:51.279
(upbeat music)

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:53.020
Let's continue our navigation

00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:56.988
with Deep Impact and discover
the performance of this boat.

00:02:56.988 --> 00:02:59.571
(upbeat music)

00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:03.071
(foreign speaking)

00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:05.810
- [Translator] American
sport fisherman really enjoy

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.080
going fast, and for this
reason: to pilot a boat in

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.520
the best way possible, you
need to have a comfortable

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.840
driving position with armrests
that flow along the sides,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.600
that allow you to feel the
sideward motion of the boat,

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.188
that makes it easier to
control the direction.

00:03:20.188 --> 00:03:22.771
(upbeat music)

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.750
There are two large 15 inch screens that

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.760
allow you to observe the
area of navigation on one,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.168
and the depth on the other.

00:03:32.168 --> 00:03:34.680
The instruments are
displayed in the middle,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.950
along with the control
panels of the engines

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.840
and I can see that the fuel
tanks are full, so we're really

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.292
going to push this boat to
its maximum potential today.

00:03:43.292 --> 00:03:46.470
(boat engine)

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.870
Now it's time to test the
performance and power of the

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.020
900 horse power we have at
our disposal, and to see how

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.680
easily the boat reaches
its cruising speed.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.890
Let's give it some throttle
and check out the wake

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.360
it produces at the stern.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.543
Two seconds, and we're already planing.

00:04:02.086 --> 00:04:04.003
(wind)

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.840
At 4,000 revs per minute,
the engines are running

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.670
comfortably; they have no
trouble sustaining our velocity,

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.940
and neither do we.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.269
We are cruising along at 40 miles an hour.

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.186
(wind)

00:04:17.128 --> 00:04:21.257
This boat has two very
important characteristics.

00:04:21.257 --> 00:04:24.800
The first is a deep, V-shaped
hull that has a dihedral angle

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.280
of 24 degrees to the transom,
which allows us to be very

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.240
precise with the direction
of our route, and it absorbs

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.290
the impact of the waves more efficiently.

00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:38.120
The other characteristic is its speed.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.800
The boat glides over the water
because it has a stepped hull

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.970
here, just below the cockpit,
that provides ventilation

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.570
for the aft section of the boat.

00:04:47.434 --> 00:04:48.700
(wind)

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.326
This allows it to glide along
on a cushion of air and water

00:04:51.326 --> 00:04:53.945
and it's the most efficient
way to reduce water friction

00:04:53.945 --> 00:04:56.551
and go even faster.

00:04:56.551 --> 00:04:58.468
(wind)

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.980
The ocean awaits us; we will
set route to the Bahamas.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.737
I quite fancy reaching this
sail, but it will probably take

00:05:07.737 --> 00:05:10.970
awhile to get there, so instead,
let's test the performance

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.478
of this vessel.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:15.180
(foreign speaking)

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.710
- [Translator] A bit of
throttle, and we are already

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.610
at 55 miles an hour.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.780
At this point, I need to use
the trim to find the best

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.069
inclination of the outboard
engines to gain more speed.

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:29.030
58, 58.5...

00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:31.470
58.8...

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.820
59...

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.263
60 miles an hour.

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:37.892
(upbeat music)

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.650
(foreign speaking)

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.482
- [Translator] It is important
to be able to try out

00:06:08.482 --> 00:06:10.450
many different boats to
understand the characteristics of

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.749
each and every one so
that you can compare them.

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:16.940
The Deep Impact 399 has
satisfied my expectations.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.420
It is an excellent sport fishing boat

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.183
with a lot of power behind it.

00:06:22.136 --> 00:06:24.719
(upbeat music)
