00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.360
-Definitely the best
thing about university

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.836
is meeting people from
all over the world.

00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:24.210
I've made some fantastic
friends from all over the place,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.851
and from different
cultures, different beliefs.

00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:28.350
And it's just been
fantastic meeting

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.349
all these different people,
having a great time,

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.159
going out meeting more.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.160
-There's so much of a
wide variety of things

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.280
you can get involved in.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.210
There is 150 societies
and over 50 sports

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.330
available at the university.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.930
I'm heavily involved
in sport at university.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.970
I was Secretary of the
rugby club this year.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.090
And next year, I'm
going to be President.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.490
-I've had a number of benefits
studying at university.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.710
And one of the main ones
is becoming so much more

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.260
independent.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.310
You no longer have your mom
there washing or cooking

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.290
for you.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.110
And even something
as simple as you

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.360
get cleaners in your first
year, and when you move out

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.380
of your house in
your first year,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.660
you don't have a cleaner coming
in replenishing the toilet

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.150
roll.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.900
You have to go out and
find that yourself,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.810
sometimes at the worst
possible moments.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.720
And it's just that
whole independence

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.740
of cooking for yourself, and
also having the responsibility

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.110
of choosing when you
come home on a night out,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.360
knowing that you've got a
9:15 lecture in the morning.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.290
Should I say out?

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.030
I could stay out.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.620
I haven't got my mom
telling me to stay in.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.869
And it's just working on
finding that balance of being

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.480
responsible, having fun,
and having a good time.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.969
-University can help
students in a number of ways

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:34.510
when they're thinking
about what they

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.790
want to do when they
leave university.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.870
So here, we have the career
service-- where I work,

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.530
and various other people work.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.520
And our whole job is based
around helping students

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.830
think about their future
and make themselves

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.180
more employable
whilst they're here.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.750
-So we have careers
advisers, like myself,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.800
who you can talk to
about your career plans.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.670
If you don't have
any career plans,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.210
you don't have any
firm career ideas,

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.602
then we can help you to try
and generate some ideas,

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:04.310
and talk you through
the sorts of options

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.777
that might be open to you.

00:02:05.777 --> 00:02:07.610
Although at the end of
the day, the decision

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.509
as to what you're actually
going to do is yours.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.070
-We also have the Student
Internship Bureau,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.040
where we set up internships
in the local area-- which

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.210
are paid-- and that's a great
chance to get work experience

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.810
and help you decide what you
want to do in the future.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.620
We do volunteering.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.000
We do projects in schools.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.970
So there's lots of
different opportunities

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.990
to get involved in
different activities that's

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.170
run by the career
service to help

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.532
students think about the future.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.030
-Some employers prefer
graduates, quite a lot

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.100
nowadays.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.170
And the reason they do that
is because of the skills

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.850
and attributes a good
degree can give you.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.590
And certainly, what
they're looking for

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.345
is people not just
with a degree,

00:02:52.345 --> 00:02:55.670
but somebody who's actually used
the full university experience

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.970
to their advantage.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.740
-If you enjoy sport, join
one of the sports clubs.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.680
Maybe look at getting
onto the committee,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.170
or taking on a role
of responsibility.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.630
If you're interested
in the media,

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.740
then join the student
newspaper or magazine.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.090
Get involved in things because
you'll develop a lot of skills

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.520
that you might not have the
chance to on your degree.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.377
-You can also do an
industry, if that's something

00:03:18.377 --> 00:03:19.710
that you're interested in doing.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.520
So you could take a year
out of your degree program

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.320
and actually go and
get a job, perhaps

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.840
get a bit of money as well, and
also a lot of work experience.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.620
And you can do years abroad too.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.480
So you can go out and spend
a year in a different country

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.840
and learn about different
cultures and things like that

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.349
as well.

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.390
-A really good program at
York as well of course,

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.470
is the York Award,
which enable students

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.000
to be recognized for all of
the contributions they've

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.770
made outside of their
decree throughout their time

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.900
at university.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.450
And again, this is
a really good way

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.120
of consolidating lots of
activities students have been

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.792
involved in and getting
accredited for it in a way

00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:54.000
that employers can recognize.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.414
-I think university is a
great learning experience.

00:04:00.414 --> 00:04:02.580
Obviously, there's a lot
more than just your degree.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.255
It's just the whole experience.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.320
I would require an
open mind about it.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.736
So I think that's
quite important.

00:04:10.736 --> 00:04:13.186
And just being prepared
to get stuck into things,

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:14.310
throw yourself into things.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.890
And there's so
many opportunities

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.940
to do so many things.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.398
And that's fantastic
about [? U, ?]

00:04:18.398 --> 00:04:20.160
and you've just got
to be aware of that.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.040
-I wish that when I'd come to
university, somebody had said,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.960
just throw yourself into as many
societies as you possibly can.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.200
I don't think ever again
in your life will you just

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.060
have all those opportunities
available to you in one place.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.190
That would be my advice.
