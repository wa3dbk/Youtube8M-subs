This is Orellia, my buddy here.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.120
This is LT. I adopted him in 2007. 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.195
Luna was the cutest one in the box!

00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:13.415
I've had people yell out their cars at me to ask me what kind of dog she is and give her compliments.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:20.000
Zoe is the best one. I tell her that all the time. She's the best one, just period.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.380
Blue Buffalo is proud to be a partnered with the Helen Woodward Animal Center

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.580
on finding a forever home for millions of dogs or cats that need one

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.480
We met Mike Arms and his team and we just fell in love with the people and ideas that they had

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.340
about finding forever home for millions of dogs and cats

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.000
We want to bring attention to these orphaned pets

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.680
We know that more pets go into American households during the holiday season.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.200
And we would like to fill those lovely homes with orphaned pets

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.740
The pets that need a chance to live and to be fed

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.140
You heard 'em.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.980
A lot of time you can tell immediately which dog or cat is going to go home with them

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.420
She was the first dog we saw and, um, she jumped up on the cage

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.300
We thought that was a sign as she sort of picked us.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.160
She became part of the family.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.220
We started this program in 1999

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.760
and we invited all 14 organizations in San Diego

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.440
We wanted to bring the media in and show them all of these orphaned pets and our facilities

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.080
and ask the public "Is this really where you want them to spend their holidays?"

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.600
That year, collectively, we adopted about 2,563 pets.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.800
and now that program has grown

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.984
This year we have close to 4,000 organizations registered in home for the holidays.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.300
Set a goal for ourselves to do no less than a million adoptions in a year 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.020
I think we are going to come closer to doing a million and a half

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.140
There's so many animals that need homes

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.673
especially ones in shelters and there's no better time than the holidays to think about adopting one.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.740
I just love it when a grandma comes in a finds that little dog who's ganna sleep on her feet

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.960
and whose ganna watch the house, and I think thats the most touching

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.060
We always see that shelter animals seem to be the most grateful for there homes ....so ..... (lick)

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.375
We're so proud to be partnered with the Helen Woodward Animal center

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:13.774
and to be part of the Blue Buffalo home for the Holidays program.

00:02:13.774 --> 00:02:15.595
We share the same values and we think its just  such a great fit.

00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:19.523
But, we certainly can beat what Mike and his teams started years ago.

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:25.869
and hopefully with our help, we'll take this program to a whole 'nother level of adopting animals.

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:32.329
We're their only voice and our voice is much stronger when we have a company like Blue Buffalo partnered.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.660
Help us reach our goal of adopting one million pets this holiday season

00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:40.466
 and give a dog or cat a loving, forever home.

00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:44.466
