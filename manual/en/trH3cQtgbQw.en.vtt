00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.620
Borealis.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.719
A modular solar home nestled within the Boreal
Forest of Alberta, Canada.

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.779
Resource industries found in Western Canada
include forestry, mining and energy.

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.980
This development has put pressure on existing
infrastructure and local communities, resulting

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.140
in housing shortages and higher costs.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.940
Borealis provides sustainable living and the
comforts of home for remote working populations.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.540
These populations include knowledge-based
professionals such asÅ¯ Engineers, biologists,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.460
geophysicists and project managers.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.359
Borealis is a prefabricated modular home composed
of three pieces designed to address comfort,

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.100
privacy and sustainability.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.670
The components are designed to be easily transported
to remote locations by truck, while a steel

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.120
substructure provides a solid foundation for
the well-insulated R-40 walls.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:16.110
There is a core service module with two residential
modules mirrored on either side.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.550
Designed to be net zero, this energy efficient
home utilizes a 10 kilowatt photovoltaic array

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.610
and solar thermal tubes to collect energy,
and provide comfort for its inhabitants.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.200
With two living areas, each resident has direct
access to their own living module which includes

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.980
space for relaxing, socializing or working.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.500
There is a shared central module that can
be closed off for privacy with sliding doors.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.130
This shared space contains the kitchen, dining
area, bathroom, laundry room, and mechanical

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.130
room.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.530
A unique feature of the bathroom is the living
wall which naturally detoxifies the air and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.890
is sustained by the light brought into the
interior.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.800
The mechanical room is accessed from outside
the house.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.750
It contains the fully automated control system
that uses multiple zones to maintain temperature

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.530
throughout the house.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.209
This one room collects and distributes all
of the energy required for the home.

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.269
An innovative feature of this home is the
energy recovery system which stores waste

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.340
heat to use for dehumidification and heating.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.209
High velocity ventilation ensures comfort
while maintaining efficient cooling and heating

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.450
of the home.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.640
The east module shares the same floor plan
as its western counterpart.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.019
But here the living area has been reconfigured
to be used as an office to adapt to the needs

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.069
of the residents.

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:54.060
The fully outfitted kitchen contains a cooktop,
oven, dishwasher and refrigerator with plenty

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.959
of counter space for meal preparation.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.940
With capacity for up to 8 people, the integrated
kitchen table can be a place to entertain,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.239
work or meet.

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.779
The remarkable natural beauty of the northern
lights is captured as it reflects off the

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:19.620
strong geometric design; the perfect backdrop
for a beacon of comfort, sustainability and

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.349
harmony.

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.280
This is Borealis, this is home away from home.
