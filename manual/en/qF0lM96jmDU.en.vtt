00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.170
but uh... are away just average america
wages have completely stagnated as

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.900
robert reich is going to show you former
labor secretary for president clinton

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.400
he's now professor u_c_-berkeley and
uh...

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.759
did you know that but just one little
fact before i go to the video

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.229
did you know that in nineteen eighty
eight

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:28.369
ever since two thousand eight that have
risen erica more creek

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.709
actually lost

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:32.200
four hundred dollars

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.710
with today's money

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.490
so if you just for inflation with a four
hundred dollars

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.830
last in two thousand eight and we did in
nineteen

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.920
twenty years and we lost ground

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.810
how good are economy double

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.360
and we lose ground well robert righteous
can explain it in about two minutes

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.590
that's what

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.950
what's the problem with the economy

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.150
let me connect the dots and show you the
big picture in less than two minutes

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.850
fifteen seconds

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.200
dot one

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.200
since nineteen he d the american economy
has doubled in size

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.450
but adjusting for inflation most
people's wages have barely increased

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.420
second dot

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.900
when it all that money go

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.110
almost all the games have gone to the
super-rich

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.540
the top one percent used to take home
about ten percent of total income now it

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.049
takes some more than twenty percent

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.630
and the super-rich up forty percent the
nation's entire wealth

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.910
the third up

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.390
all this money at the top is given the
super-rich lots of political power

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.320
especially power to lower their tax
rates

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.370
before nineteen eighty the top tax rate
was over seventy percent now it's down

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.080
to thirty five percent

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.710
and much of their income as capital
gains subject only a fifteen percent tax

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.190
according to the i_r_s_ the richest four
hundred americans take only seventeen

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.320
percent

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.010
this means huge budget deficits

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.890
tax revenues are down to less than
fifteen percent of the total economy the

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.190
lowest in sixty years so public services
have been cut have all levels of

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.969
government

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.469
her kids are being crowded into
classrooms with more and more other

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:20.449
children

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:26.769
wounds bridges levees healthcare safety
nets they're all being sacrificed dot

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.219
instead of joining together for better
wages and jobs many people are so scared

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.809
that they're competing with other
working people for the scraps that are

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:35.159
left behind

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.319
so we get union verses nine public
employees burst of private native-born

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.849
purses immigrants

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.329
final go

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.709
the vast middle class unable to borrow
as it could be four no longer has the

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.149
purchasing power needed to get the
economy growing again which means

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:57.989
continued high unemployment and an
anemic recovery

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.679
cc the big picture

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.179
the only way we can have a strong
economy

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:06.419
hit with a strong middle class

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.479
that is only one hundred percent correct

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:14.089
and uh... i'll add something stuart know
our tax rates go down twice in the tax

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:17.919
risk for the rich go down as he pointed
out so we have less money but it's not

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:22.529
just that it gets redistributed the
taxes to since nineteen fifty the share

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:26.949
of corporate taxes uh... that are paid
has gone down dramatically as a share of

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.829
the federal revenue payroll taxes have
gone up dramatically as a share of the

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.089
federal revenue what does that mean that
means for the costs are being

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:37.979
redistributed from corporate america to
us

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:42.329
why is that happening it's because
corporations are very very rich and they

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.229
could by politicians who passed laws
that get them lower tax rates bigger

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:51.359
advantages bigger monopolies bigger
government contracts they literally take

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.469
or money and they finally through those
government contracts to those connected

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:59.609
to other companies and they circulate
that money back into the politicians and

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:04.289
by the more what is it do as robert
ratio neither decreased huge deficits

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:07.619
and then one more dot was they have
those them since they say well what can

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:11.919
we do we had to cut spending on the
middle class again

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.409
and then we had even less of a
middle-class what does that do increase

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.350
at best filed for the economy because
nobody can buy anything

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.000
and so in the end the rich don't wind up
benefiting either they do in the short

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.590
run no question about that

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.770
to the tune of millions and sometimes
billions of dollars but in the long run

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.150
would become a third world country and
right now

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.460
we are in terms of income inequality
right between cameroon in jamaica

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.349
that is a disastrous place we find
ourselves

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.020
that is not how you build a healthy com
