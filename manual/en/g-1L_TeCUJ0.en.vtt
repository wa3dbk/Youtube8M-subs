00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.330
how to update WordPress manually

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.570
the first rule, in updating any content management system like Word Press

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.619
is to have a backup of your website and
database

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.509
to do this you have two choices the
first is to make a backup with the third

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.730
part utility

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.170
like a plugin or you can go to the cpanel of your website

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.840
and there you have the ability to backup
your site in fact

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.890
this second choice is the best way to
interact with your website

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.199
because is where you find everything
related to your website

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.239
is the web hosting Control Panel but

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.739
if you prefer go with the plugin follow
this procedure

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.199
from the dashboard of the WordPress go
to plugins

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.320
add new

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.960
now to search for

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.010
plugins based with this criteria type
the word

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.650
backup

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.270
choose one from the available plugins
like the online backup for WordPress

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.110
click to install now

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.240
then activate plugin

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.090
next in the plugins page 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.700
go to the online backup for
WordPress plugin

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.780
and click on View dashboard

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.840
and go to backup to create a new fresh
backup

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.930
set the backup type 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.060
to local database and file system

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.920
and start the manual backup

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.060
now just wait until the backup completes and then you can download the backup files to your

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.440
machine

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.440
also much easier if you go to your 
cpanel of your website hosting service

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.440
search for the files section and click
on backups

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.409
and then you can generate a new fresh

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.999
backup

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.940
and provide them available to download

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.940
dowload

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.630
next we need to download the last version of

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.630
WordPress go to WordPress .org and get a
last version

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.990
next prepare to upload

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.890
delete wp-content folder

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.599
unzip and open the wordpress.zip file

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.600
and delete the wp-content

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.840
and delete the wp-content

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.680
next uploading and updating WordPress

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.680
first from cPanel (hosting Control Panel) go to
File Manager

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.319
type your credentials username and password

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.160
now go to public html folder

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.330
go to where you install your WordPress
in my case

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.810
a subdirectory called home next

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.550
delete all files and folders except wp-content folder

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.440
and wp-config.php file

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.120
click to delete and confirm

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.990
click to delete and confirm

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.370
remember that we can do this from a local file
manager

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.920
now if you go to your website and
refresh (F5, Command-R) the page

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.490
you realize that all files have been
deleted

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.970
now what we need to do is uploading the
new files

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.720
but first we can see on how we can make
all of this from a local file manager

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.810
I'm using coda but you can choose others

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.170
like Cyberduck for Mac FileZilla

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.739
or smart FTP for Windows for FTP logins
and upload details

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.970
go to your host control panel and there
you find all details needed

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.860
to add into your local file manager

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.060
after that you just have to connect into
the server where your site is hosted

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.100
and navigate to the public folder to
delete

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:28.100
and uploading files

00:04:30.739 --> 00:04:33.569
now with all files deleted we need to

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.330
make the upload go to

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.550
where you previously unzip the Wordpress folder

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.270
and upload all files to the server
except the wp-content folder

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.470
into public_html and the
subdirectory

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.770
in this case to public_html/home

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.850
with all files in place you may have
to delete some default.php file

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.610
if in any case you go to your website
address and find a page like this one

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.460
all you have to do is to return to your
file manager

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:14.460
and under public_html folder delete this
default.php file

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.930
next return to your side and refresh

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.030
next return to your side and refresh

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.720
enter to where you installed Word Press

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.440
enter to where you installed Word Press

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.160
refresh again

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.740
or click where says to update

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.249
now update wordpress database

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:35.490
now update wordpress database

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.980
your WordPress database was successfully
updated

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.040
and this is how you update your site
with the new content management system

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.120
like Wordpress

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.580
