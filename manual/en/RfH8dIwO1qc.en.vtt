This is Martin Shervington and

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.910
I'd like to introduce you to Google
express.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.820
Now if you've been using Google+
for a little while you'll know that you can

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.449
have a Google+ profile, which is a person,

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.009
or you can have a Google+ page.

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.899
And sometimes that page is going to be
connected directly to a business that

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.550
has a physical location. If this is the
case then you may well want to have a look at

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.930
Google Express as a solution.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.830
It’s very straightforward to set up and it will 
enable people

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:46.940
who are

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.569
looking for a particular product or service
or business

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:51.279
from within

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:55.799
an area that surrounds that
business - it actually tracks where that 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:57.230
inquiry is coming from.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.770
If you've got the nature of business
that would be handy to have people

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.970
just turning up on your doorstep, or that
you’re generally targeting a local audience,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.470
then this could be a good solution for you.
Let me just show you a quick example of

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.650
how to do this with one that I’ve set up
for a client.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.409
If you scroll down you’ll see there’s a box that
will say

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.140
promote your Google+ page. Now as it
happens, after you’ve set it up, it will turn

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.090
into check on your promotion.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.119
But it will be on the right hand side. Once
you've clicked it, 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.479
it will take you into a dashboard. The
first thing you’re going to do when you set up your

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.740
Google adwords campaign

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.550
is decide how far you want to
throw the net.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.030
You can change the radius in which
people will see the ads

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.060
when they search 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.630
from 25km through to 65 km.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.250
So it really depends upon the business
that you have

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.040
as to what's appropriate to be
advertising. So for instance, if it’s a sandwich

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.840
shop you may not want to throw it out to 
65km, but if it was

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.670
warehousing and distribution and that
was appropriate then maybe you would

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.360
want to have that broader reach. Then
you choose the language and you also 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.200
then  put in a category for your 
business and click next.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.360
From here you’re going to create an ad. Now there’s 
quite a lot of skill to crafting a really good 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.309
Google adwords ad. 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:17.009
In essence you want to do something
that grabs the attention from that person

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:18.969
who's looking for what you've got.

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.820
So when you’ve done that, you simply
decide do you want

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.540
when people click the ad to go to a
Google+ page or to your website and

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.350
you choose one of the options there. 
I choose the website and then click next on this

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.779
occasion.

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:37.680
Next thing we do is we decide on a
budget. So I’m going to stick with the middle budget

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.840
and them and go from there, but this really
depends upon obviously the nature of the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.099
business and potentially running trial
to start with as well.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.979
next you can see the types of ads that 
will be shown.

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:52.760
The first one is the search ad, and as you
see not only have we got the location, the pin,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.669
but we’ve also got the reviews. Now this is
really important to get.

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:57.949
The Google

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.049
local information

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.059
is all going to get tied back into these
ads, so the more you build your 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:07.639
following, the more you build up reviews, 
the better your ads potentially are 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:08.979
going to look.

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:09.939
The next one

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.919
is the mobile search ad.

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.329
And you see you have the telephone number so
people can call directly from their phones

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:16.540
as well.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.829
Then we have Google Maps ad, and we have 
the location there so people can feel,

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.349
trust that they know it's in South Wales
where they want to be.

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.729
And they also have to Google display
network ad.

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:31.759
Now this takes an image from your Google+
page

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:36.389
and brings it into the ad. So the image
really matters, and the more you can draw

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.440
people in and cater to them

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.159
and appeal to their senses

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.349
the more likely they are to click the ad
and to get in touch. You can also see here

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.309
the number of clicks that are
estimated.

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:49.989
When I’m ready, I click on next.

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.269
The next step will be just to put in your
billing information.

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.150
But if you’re already link, already used 
Google adwords,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.029
then you’re probably not going to have to do this.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.839
So if you've got a promotion code and it's
the first time you’re using it, then 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.879
otherwise you’re just going to press finish
and you will be done. When your ads

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:07.840
are up and running

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.140
it’s really like having a marketing person who’s out there  
all the time, and you just want to make sure

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.350
that they are working for you. So go and
click on check on your promotion. And your

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.700
promotions will come up into a dashboard
and you’ll see how effective they are.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.060
And if you measure

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.460
how much it’s costing you to acquire a new
customer using this method then you’re really

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.080
starting to get used to the whole

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.110
mentality

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.150
of Google adwords, which is 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.529
about spending in order to get a 
definitive return on your investment.

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:43.279
Google Express then is going to be a great asset
for local businesses. When people are searching

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:47.199
and you have the solution and
it's in their locality then

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.080
that's going to be great. You’re going to be matching
the customers up with your products and

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.289
services.

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:56.219
It is a stepping stone as well towards
Google adwords, the full

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:57.199
campaigns.

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.220
And there’s not everything you can do in
Google Express that you can do in

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.630
Google adwords. In fact there’s 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.020
a tremendous amount extra that you can do.
So it is for some going to be a stepping

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.940
stone, but nonetheless it’s going to be a 
phenomenal tool, particularly when you’re look at

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.710
that Google+ page and a business that
has a physical location

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.559
starting to promote themselves even more.
And then those +1s

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:21.169
and Google local reviews

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.199
and everything else that is Google+

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.759
will start to come together for them as
well.
