[music] Narrator: When you take a look at Mars,

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.350
you probably wouldn't think that it looks like a very nice place to live. It's dry,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.420
it's dusty, and there's practically no atmosphere. But some scientists think that Mars

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.480
may have once looked like a much nicer place to live, with a thicker atmosphere, cloudy

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.530
skies, and possibly even liquid water flowing over the surface. So how do you go from

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.560
something like this...to something like this? NASA's

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.580
MAVEN spacecraft will give us a clearer idea of how Mars lost its atmosphere, and scientists

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.600
think that several processes have had an impact. One of these processes is called

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.670
"sputtering," where atoms are knocked away from the atmosphere due to impacts from energetic particles.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.750
In our solar system, the Sun constantly emits high-energy photons.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.820
When one of these photons enters the atmosphere of a planet, it can crash into a molecule,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.870
knocking loose an electron and turning it into an ion. Ions by themselves don't do much,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.910
but when a magnetic field is nearby, they'll spin around the field, spiraling in the field's

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.950
direction. Conveniently, the Sun generates a giant magnetic field that is

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.990
carried by the solar wind. The part of the field that just grazes the planet can easily

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.020
pick up a bunch of ions and launch them out into space. If the field happens to be in just the right

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.030
place, however, it might pick up ions and fling them right into the atmosphere at up to a

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.120
thousand kilometers per second. The ions can then crash into other molecules and fling atoms

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.240
everywhere like a cue ball in a game of pool. Some of these atoms can be knocked--

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.320
or "sputtered"--into space, causing atmospheric loss. And over billions of years,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.390
this could have caused quite a bit of change, especially since the solar wind may have been more intense

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.450
early in our solar system's history. Scientists think that all of this may have caused Mars

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.500
to gradually transform from what may have been a very nice place to live into the dry, dusty

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.540
world we know today...and MAVEN will study this process and tell us how it really works.
