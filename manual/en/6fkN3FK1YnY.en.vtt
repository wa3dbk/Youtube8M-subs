00:00:01.461 --> 00:00:03.680
JESSICA: My name is
Jessica Munoz.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.070
I am from northern New Jersey.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.010
I'm a make-up artist.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.040
OLGA: She's messy, she's
disorganized.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.410
You know, that's terrible
over here.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.340
JESSICA: Everything is
full of my stuff.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.490
And I need help organizing,
fixing it,

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.230
making it look nice.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.560
I am the youngest one, but at
the same time, I think she's

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.236
ready to give me the boot
and say, hey, you got

00:00:26.236 --> 00:00:26.950
to get out of here.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.440
OLGA: Jessica Munoz, I'm 29
years old, and I live at home

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.690
with my mom.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.250
JESSICA: OK.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.222
So before I leave to work, I
have to tell you something.

00:00:38.222 --> 00:00:41.520
You know I've been here for a
long time, and I definitely

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.510
need help to get organized
downstairs.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.430
I have no room for nothing.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.550
My shoes are all over,
clothes all over, and

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.710
you know I need help.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.660
So I've asked a fabulous
designer named Tracy Metro to

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.360
come over and help me out.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.180
OLGA: Wow.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.840
Nice.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.710
JESSICA: What do you think?

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.960
OLGA: Who's Tracy?

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.320
TRACY: I am happy that there's
a place for me to sit on the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.490
couch with all of
your clothing.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.140
What the hell?

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.633
JESSICA: My wardrobe.

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:20.380
TRACY: (LAUGHING) Wait,
did you really

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.960
just call this wardrobe?

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.710
JESSICA: I did.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.600
Well, that's my pashmina--

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.350
TRACY: It's beautiful,
actually.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.620
JESSICA: That I wear
occasionally--

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.750
thank you.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.380
I mean, some of my wardrobe,
some of what's left of it.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.770
Other stuff is just thrown in
the room, in the laundry room,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.600
it's just all over the place.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.280
TRACY: Really?

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.730
Why?

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.940
JESSICA: Because I have nowhere
to put it, Tracy.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.490
TRACY: Are there really
no closets down there?

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.790
JESSICA: No--

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.370
I mean, I have a
half a closet.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.560
This is just full of bins
because there's nowhere for me

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.010
to hang anything up.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.020
TRACY: Obviously, you're
a makeup artist.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.140
And your makeup is beautiful.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.820
JESSICA: Thank you.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.060
Thank you.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.420
TRACY: I should have
had you do mine.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.890
I mean, you obviously have
to have a lot of makeup.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.060
JESSICA: Yes.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.050
Yes.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.470
I have tons and tons
of makeup.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.720
TRACY: You have people
come here?

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.890
You have a lot of your clients
come to your house to do

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.530
makeup, I guess?

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.025
JESSICA: Yes.

00:02:03.025 --> 00:02:03.520
Yes.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.850
TRACY: And I'm gonna say, if I
were coming to you to get my

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.740
makeup done, I wouldn't
really feel that

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.575
comfortable, sitting--

00:02:08.575 --> 00:02:08.677
JESSICA: No.

00:02:08.677 --> 00:02:08.830
Of course not.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.560
TRACY: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.110
Let me just move.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.180
Wait, let me move this.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.330
JESSICA: Yeah, let's just
move the blouse over.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.395
Yeah.

00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:13.920
Who cares?

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.310
TRACY: Wait a minute.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.040
Here we go.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.890
Are there challenges
down here for you?

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.900
JESSICA: I have no type
of lighting in here.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.490
I have these tiny windows.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.150
No light comes in
through there.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.800
TRACY: Colors.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.580
Tell me what your favorite
color is.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.130
JESSICA: I like the
purple hues, the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.220
lavenders, the deep purples.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.610
I'm very into--

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.440
like anything that's
pastel-y or rich.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.855
TRACY: So let's call
this the studio.

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:37.940
JESSICA: The studio.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.800
OK.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.540
The glam studio.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.430
TRACY: The glam studio.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.240
I love it.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.630
But there's also a bedroom
right there.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.200
JESSICA: Yes.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.150
TRACY: Can you take me into the
bedroom and show me what

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.030
the issues are in there?

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.450
JESSICA: Definitely.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.570
You can come on over.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.820
TRACY: Thanks a lot.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.690
OK.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.350
So I see the insanity.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.725
Tell me about the whole
bed/sleeping situation.

00:02:59.725 --> 00:03:01.660
Do you like where the
bed is oriented when

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.850
you walk in the room?

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.650
JESSICA: I don't.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.574
So I just shoved the bed in
this corner and shove that

00:03:09.574 --> 00:03:10.398
over there, and just--

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:11.690
TRACY: Sounds like there's
a lot of shoving.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.470
JESSICA: It's a lot of shoving
going on in here.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.538
TRACY: And you know what?

00:03:14.538 --> 00:03:16.290
There's gonna be a teeny
bit more shoving.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.550
JESSICA: Really?

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.518
TRACY: And it's me shoving
you out of here.

00:03:18.518 --> 00:03:20.954
JESSICA: All right,
I'm out of here.

00:03:20.954 --> 00:03:23.043
OK, so it's day 2.

00:03:23.043 --> 00:03:26.470
I have no clue what's
going on right now.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.830
TRACY: We're in what Jessi used
to have as her kind of

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.480
walk-through room where she had
a lot of clothing and she

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.000
kind of did people's makeup
when there was space.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.580
But we're now calling
it the studio.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.350
This is where people
will come.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.090
They can wait-- we're going to
have a chair for people to sit

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.990
and wait, some stools for people
to sit and hang out

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.200
while she actually does
girls' makeup.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.480
It's also going to have clothing
racks in case she

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.800
winds up getting into doing
styling as well.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.930
Kind of like a big walk-in
closet/beauty area.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.350
I'm not a fan of these kind
of ceiling tiles.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.710
I don't have the time or the
money to rip them out.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.740
So what I decided to do was
paint them, because then they

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.990
kind of feel like they're fun.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.090
Her bedroom kind of
felt overstuffed.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.329
The bed seemed like it was
shoved in a corner, and the

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.010
clothing was shoved over
in that little nook.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.850
So I turned the bed around.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.880
And so when you walk
in, that's not the

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.900
first thing you see.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.870
JESSICA: I think it's definitely
going to help me a

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.670
lot to separate both my bedroom
and my work area,

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.290
because before, it
was just a mess.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.680
TRACY: This is where
I was going next.

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:41.425
Um, oh.

00:04:41.425 --> 00:04:43.980
Oh my god, we have so
much clearance.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.940
I hate to say it--

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.865
I'm feeling like I'm actually
in good shape.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.050
All right, ladies.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.660
Come on down to your
new suite.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.910
JESSICA: Oh my god!

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.580
OLGA: Oh my god!

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.492
JESSICA: Thank you so much!

00:05:09.492 --> 00:05:10.742
OLGA: That's beautiful!

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.075
JESSICA: Oh my god, look
at these chairs.

00:05:16.075 --> 00:05:18.070
Oh my god.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.550
TRACY: I wanted to give you a
place where your clients could

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.900
come in and not be sitting
on the sofa

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.270
with all of your clothing.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.190
And we wanted it to be on
display so when you're working

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.500
on one girl, another
girl can be sitting

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.060
here and just admiring.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.030
Maybe one day you'll
sell some of it.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.070
You mentioned lighting being
such a huge issue.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.560
This mirror--

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.520
I mean, it's a professional.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.730
JESSICA: A dream come true.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.030
TRACY: And you're
a professional.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.540
JESSICA: I am.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.130
I am.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.420
And this is just going to take
me to the next level.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.400
TRACY: So right behind you,
look real quickly--

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.210
JESSICA: I love it.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.500
I love it.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.140
As soon as I walked out--

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.006
look at my window.

00:05:52.006 --> 00:05:53.180
I love it.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.450
Oh my god.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.180
Look at the feathers.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.830
My chair is still here.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.920
TRACY: Oh, and look
up at the ceiling.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.960
JESSICA: I love it!

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.850
This is amazing.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.300
I couldn't have asked
for anything else.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.740
TRACY: OK.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.650
I'm glad to hear you say that.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.140
JESSICA: I am so--

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.850
TRACY: Because I actually have
a little bit more for you.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:09.040
JESSICA: Really?

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.794
Oh my God.

00:06:09.794 --> 00:06:10.550
TRACY: You didn't know?

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.920
Yes.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.240
And here is the cherry
on the cake.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.180
JESSICA: Oh my god.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.280
This is amazing!

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.630
TRACY: Come on in.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.880
JESSICA: Oh my god!

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.630
OLGA: Wow.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.220
JESSICA: And all of your
shoes fit in there.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.750
OLGA: I love the colors.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.850
TRACY: The tiles.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.050
JESSICA: She loves the colors.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.980
OLGA: Beautiful.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.690
TRACY: We gave you a lot of
definition, because the room

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.290
kind of felt a little short.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.030
So we felt like we pushed
that inset back.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.130
We painted it dark to
make it go deeper.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.630
We added some lights for you,
because again, I think the

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.970
biggest thing that you
were missing was

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.130
some light in here.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.070
JESSICA: From the bottom
of my heart, I

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.450
appreciate this so much.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.340
You've done such a beautiful
job of my place.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.990
I'm going to get choked up.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.960
Thank you so much.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.570
TRACY: It's my pleasure.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.300
Really.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.980
JESSICA: I appreciate
it so much.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.890
TRACY: You know, I feel like
this one is a huge

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:10.880
life-changer for her.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.060
I do think a lot of
people are like,

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.890
thanks, my place is cuter.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.070
But this one, I really do feel
like it's going to be a

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.250
launching pad for her.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.340
I feel like we've given her a
place for her business to

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.490
really take off from.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.100
JESSICA: I feel like I'm just
going to want to get up and do

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.570
more for myself in the morning
and just be more proactive and

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.850
productive in my life.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.850
And this all is just so
inspiring for me.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.150
Check out Spaces Store online

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.590
