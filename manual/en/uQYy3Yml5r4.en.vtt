00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:04.509
JEFFREY HENDERSON: The Loeb Classical Library
was founded by James Loeb, who was a great

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.559
benefactor of music and medicine and the arts,
to find means to place classical literature

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.620
within reach of all who care for the finer
things of life. He designed the iconic red

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.060
and green volumes, because he wanted the volumes
to fit in a gentleman’s coat pocket. Soon

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.790
you’ll be able to take the entire library—not
just a single volume—in your coat pocket.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:33.760
&gt;&gt; SHARMILA SEN: We have content that has successfully made it through a series of technology

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.120
upgrades: from oral to written text; from
scroll to the codex;

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.680
 from manuscript to the printed page.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.320
(music)

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.180
&gt;&gt; HENDERSON: The significance of going digital
for the library is huge, because it carries

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.360
out the mission of James Loeb to make all
of these works permanently available to anyone

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.140
who wants them, at a very affordable price,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.000
in a format where they really can   have them with them at all times.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.960
&gt;&gt; SEN: We have actually built it in a way
so that you have the classic two-page view,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.920
but if you want to test yourself or if you
want to just not be bothered with one side

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.960
or the other, you have that ease, and you
no longer have to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.260
put a sheet of paper on one side of the books.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.150
&gt;&gt; HENDERSON: You can grab text and put it
in a notebook.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.970
&gt;&gt; SEN: You can bookmark things; you can create
categories for bookmarks.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.640
&gt;&gt; HENDERSON: You can search the translations;
search the Latin and Greek. So you can look

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.159
up a word and then look and see how it’s
been translated in all of the hundreds of

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.409
volumes in the library.

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.190
&gt;&gt; SEN: You can create a user group; you can share it with your classmates. If you’re

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.770
a teacher you can share it with an entire
class. You can send out a message saying

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.300
“take a look at this text that I have just marked.”

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.400
&gt;&gt; HENDERSON: If you want to know which classical
author talks about love, war, peace, whatever,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.080
you’ll find authors that you probably never
heard of, and you might start reading in those authors.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.600
And you might discover something
that is going to be one of those finer things for you.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
