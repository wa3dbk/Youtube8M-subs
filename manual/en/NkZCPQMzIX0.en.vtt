Hello, my name is Luis Estrada and I'm a software
developer. In this clip we will talk about

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.190
how you can make money on line. First we need
to understand the different ways that you

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.320
can profit from your website. In the next
eighty video we will explore all the different

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.279
options that you have to generate revenue.
These options are called revenue models. There

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:34.120
are five basic revenue models that have proven
to be successful on the Web in the last years.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.930
By far, the most popular option is the advertising
revenue model. This model is based on providing

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.910
your visitors with free services on your website.
Your web pages feature publicity banners paid

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.479
by on line advertisers. You make money from
charging advertisers to display publicity

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:58.470
on your website. All the space available in
your web pages where you can display publicity

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.800
is called inventory. Your inventory is not
a fixed number. It depends on the amount of

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.800
people that visit the website and the amount
of pages that they read there. For example,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.980
if each one of your web pages has a space
for displaying four publicity banners and

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.930
you have an average of a thousand visitors
a day, and they read about four pages of your

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.500
website, then you would have a total inventory
of sixteen thousand banners that you can display

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.220
on your website. So, if you can multiply this
number by thirty or thirty one days per month,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.360
then you have a total inventory of four hundred
and eighty thousand banners. Take in to consideration

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.100
that web traffic is very difficult to predict
and it fluctuates tremendously. So your inventory

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.650
size could vary each month. What is clear
is that the more content that you have on

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.120
your website the better your chances of creating
a bigger advertising inventory. Let me explain.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.520
If you have only ten pages on your website
then your visitors will not be able to read

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.729
more than those ten pages. Once they have
read those pages, there's a good chance that

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.509
they will never visit your site again, simply
because they know they won't find anything

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.860
new to read. If your site has a few hundred
or a few thousand pages then it would be very

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.840
difficult for your visitors to read all of
your pages. Meaning that as long as they find

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.760
your websites information useful, they will
keep coming back for more. Most websites that

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.060
choose the advertising model saw their inventory
using an intermediary. This intermediary area

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.760
is called and advertising network. This network
finds the advertisers that want to purchase

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.840
certain amounts of inventory. The advertiser
pays the ad network for the publicity space.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.260
Then the ad network displays those banners
on your website and finally they give you

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.870
a percentage of the fees collected. The reason
most websites use ad networks to sell their

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.450
inventory is because finding the necessary
advertisers can be a time and resource consuming

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.010
process. In the next video we will take a
look at some of the benefits that ad networks

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:14.430
provide for you and your advertisers. I'm
Luis Estrada and I've just showed you how

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.300
to make money with your websites.
