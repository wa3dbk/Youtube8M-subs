00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.640
Hans Nichols. Where's Hans?

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.340
yes, thank you mister president

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.160
yesterday your friend and ally Cory
Booker

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.510
said an ad that you release the your
campaign released was nauseating it

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.450
alleged that

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.710
Romney at Bain Capital was quote
responsible for job losses at a kansas

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.599
city steel steel mill

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.409
is that your view that romney is partially
responsible for those job losses or

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:27.919
comments from booker and your former
autos czar steve ratner if criticized

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:29.630
some of these is he's advertisement

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.630
calling you to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.049
pull back a little bit

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.820
and generally can you give us your sense
three part mister president

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.700
can address your sense

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.370
here is your sense of just

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.400
what private equities role where's in
stemming job losses

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.729
as they seek a return on investment

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.170
for their investors thank you

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.440
uh... what first of all the uh...
category brokers is an outstanding mayor

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.440
he's doing great work in Newark

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.630
and obviously help them

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.010
turn that city around

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.110
i think it's important to recognize that
this issue is not a quote distraction

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.570
this is part of the debate that we're
gonna be having

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.320
in this election campaign

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.900
about how do we create an economy

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.720
where everybody

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.830
from top to bottom

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.910
folks on wall street and folks on main
street

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.020
have a shot

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.310
at success

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.320
and if they're working hard and they're
acting responsibly

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.080
uh... that they're able to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.470
uh... live out the american dream

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.770
i think my view of private equity is
that

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.750
uh... it is

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.240
it is set up

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.000
to maximize profits

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.750
and that's a healthy part of the free
market

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.440
uh... there but that's part of

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.740
the role of

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.340
uh... a lot of business people

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.670
now that's not you need to private
equity and as i think

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.729
my representatives said repeatedly and i
will say

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:59.980
uh... today

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.290
i think there are folks who do good work
in that area

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.050
uh... there are times where

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.449
they identify

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:10.909
the capacity

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:17.319
for the economy uh... to create new jobs
or new industries

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.179
but understand that their priority is

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:22.589
to maximize profits

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.290
and that's not always going to be good

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.069
for

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.819
communities for businesses or workers

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.509
and the reason this is relevant to the
campaign is because

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:34.829
uh... my opponent governor Romney

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.819
his main calling card for why he thinks
he should be president

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.349
is is business experience he's not going
other touting his experience in

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.129
massachusetts

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:49.349
he is saying 'i'm a business guy I know how to fix it' and this is his business

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.080
and

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.829
when you're president as opposed to

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.930
the head of a product private equity firm

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.609
your job is not simply to maximize
profits

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.709
your job is to figure out how everybody
in the country has a fair shot

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.399
your job is to think about those workers
who get laid off and how we paying for

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:12.529
their retraining

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:16.319
your job is to think about how those
communities can start creating new

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.619
clusters so that they can attract new
business

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:24.889
your job as president is to think about
how do we set up a equitable tax system

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.099
so that everybody's paying their fair
share

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.339
that allows us then to invest in science
and technology and infrastructure

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:36.899
all of which are going to help us grow

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:38.069
and so

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.519
if your main argument

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.389
for how to grow the economy is i knew
how to

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.349
make a lot of money for investors

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.419
then you're missing

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.119
what this job is about

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:55.109
it doesn't

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.760
it doesn't uh...

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.859
uh... mean you're you weren't good
private equity

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.569
but that's not what

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.879
my job is as president

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.559
my job is to take into account everybody
not just some

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:13.109
my job is to make sure that the country
is growing not just now

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.269
but ten years from now and twenty years
from now

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.669
and so

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.270
to repeat that this is not a distraction

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.560
this is what this campaign's going to be about

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.739
is what is a strategy for us

00:04:29.739 --> 00:04:31.779
to move this country forward

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:35.599
in a way where everybody can succeed and
that means i've got a think about those

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.419
workers in that video just as much

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.020
as i'm thinking about

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.509
uh... folks

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:49.509
who've been much more successful.

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.159
what i would say is is that

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.009
mister romney

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:02.400
is responsible for the proposals he's
putting forward

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.560
for how he says he's going to fix it for
the economy

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.529
and if the main basis

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:12.580
for him suggesting he can do a better
job

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.740
is his track record

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.449
as the head of a private equity firm 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.439
then both the up sides and the downsides
or worth examining
