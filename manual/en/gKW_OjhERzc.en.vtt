00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.780
 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.120
Hi I'm Jeremy Pang

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.230
I own a school in Covent Garden called School of Wok

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.290
we're right around the corner from
London Chinatown

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.880
it's amazing being so close to Chinatown
because this so much stuff that you can

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.760
get there

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.470
we can go to one of the supermarkets, the
fish market pick up our stuff

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.210
and cook up a storm here at school
everything's about simplicity

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.320
I'm really breaking down the basic
techniques

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.200
its Chinese Unchopped

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.650
Stir Fry Black Bean Beef in Beer

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.670
that twist gives it a fresh flavour

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.120
the balance of bitter sweet from the
malt

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.329
really really help brings out the flavour of the ginger

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.140
the black bean, the garlic we're goning to wok fry this so we're going to get this straight

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.290
into smoking hot wok and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.059
beef in, a good brown colour and then when
the liquid

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.320
the beer and the oyster sauce does in

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.930
vigorously boil in that wok, if you want to get yourself a super light wok

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.399
head over to SeeWoo in Chinatown on
Lile Street

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.690
they've got an amazing basement full of equipment if you want to get yourself a

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.009
school of wok branded wok,

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:25.009
come into the shop you can find it here

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.860
fine slices of beef here, rump steak, little bit of marbling

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.990
not too much, just just to give that sort of
flavour and moisture

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.820
we need to marinade this up so we've got some

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.119
double deluxe soya sauce, light soya sauce essentially

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.720
with no added MSG. we've got some sesame oil

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.939
and then the added options of a pinch of five spice

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.430
cap full of rice wine 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.530
and one pinch of sugar

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.420
corn flour just a spoon ful

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.610
and really get your hands into it

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.989
give it a good massage and that corn flour basically is

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.230
going to leave a creamy colour around the
meat, when it hits the pan it will help to brown

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.060
the meat

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.870
also have to sip into the sauce and  
thicken the sauce a little bit

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.209
and if you leave the meat to marinade overnight, it will 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.239
sucke up by the beef now, so it's ready to gol that sources me missus

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.370
being set up by the beef now it's ready
to go

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.400
next up but you've got your black beans. 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.670
fermented, preserved black beans, it's fermented, preserved in a salt solution 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.730
and then dried

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.940
so we need about a tea spoon or two

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.820
in to the garlic, a little bit of salt

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.130
not for flavour, just to help 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.220
crush through and bring the moisture of the garlic out, you're going to crush it

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.880
lightly with a little teaspoon just
with the end of the teaspoon

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.699
and that makes your lightly crushed

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.489
black bean paste I've got some finely sliced

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.470
onions and mixed peppers as well so
when it hits the pan could cook

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.690
really quickly, lastly we've got the
sauce that goes on top

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.150
really simple the company is a really nice
and powerful

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.820
so we're going to use about 1 to 2 tablespoons of that and then we're going to top it up 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.730
with some beer, right so we're at wok

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.410
I've got my plate or set up with what we
call the wok clock

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.979
so we've got the onions at 12 o'clock, peppers at roughly three

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.070
I'm going to talk you through it, onions first

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.120
then ginger, then your peppers, then
you're black bean mix

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.690
and then beef last stir fry that

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.070
good flash fry and then

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.590
sauce that goes on top and your garnish,
simple as that

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.090
right I'm gonna get my wok to a real
smoking point

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.180
oil has to be smoking hot right

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.250
onions in given a good fry through

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.630
ginger

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.470
too much dry smoke

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.440
needs a wok toss, quick flick upwards but don't lose your sizzle, straight back

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.729
on the heat, peppers, push your

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:35.729
onions aside bring them over the top
of your peppers

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.139
don't want to overcook your vegetables so push that to the back

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:41.790
ingredient

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.259
little bit of oil

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.130
beef straight away

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.250
give it a good seer with the base of you spoon

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.410
bring your

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.320
onions and peppers over the top, give it a quick toss

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.710
and then back on the heat, don't lose your sizzle

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.290
 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.980
get your sauce in there, little bit of oyster sauce

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.510
one to two tablespoons max

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.440
either third of a can or half a bottle of
beer straight in

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.790
high heat, let is sizzle away, get all that flavour of the bottom of the pan

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.670
let that bubble away vigorously and a little dash of dark soya sauce

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:32.410
if you need it, just for colour, mix that through

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:39.180
a little, you can see you now the consistency of the sauce

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.760
just that smooth, dripping consistency

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.430
we're done!

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:54.430
Right serve up, you'll see that beautiful colour from the red pepper

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.620
that black bean flavour is going to give you that hit

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.730
