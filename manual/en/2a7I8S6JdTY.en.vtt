00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.330
When I were just a lad, Jaffa Cakes were IT!
Yep, I used to get them in my lunchbox

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.139
Aah, that's nice! And today we're going to recreate them!

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.970
As you can see, very few ingredients, it's a very simple recipe. We've got flour

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.480
egg and sugar to make the sponge to our jaffa cakes

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.970
we've got orange jelly which we're going to enhance with orange juice as well

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.929
and chocolate

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.669
I can't tell you how excited I am that we're finally making jaffa cakes

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.260
I know... For the first time!

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.820
Now what we're going to do is crack 2 eggs and caster sugar into a bowl

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.389
We've got over a pan of simmering water

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:42.129
And whisk.
Thank you!
By using the machine it makes it a lot easier because you have to do it for a long time

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.290
We're looking for about 6-8 minutes

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.110
Until it's at a ribbon stage, and over simmering water partially cooks those eggs. In the meantime, Michael

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.819
We're going to do jelly

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:52.670
Ooo he called you Michael

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.340
You've been a bad boy...
Water

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.090
into here

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.460
about three hundred ml along with orange jelly. Now obviously this is just pre-bought orange jelly

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.150
If you can break that up into there so it dissolves

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.130
What do jaffa cakes mean for you?

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.460
Well they're orange chocolate biscuits.
Yeah but do you remember them growing up?

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.460
I used to have a tube of 3 that I used to have in my packed lunch when I was at primary school.
I remember the advert when you got the 'full moon', 'half moon'

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.260
Total eclipse!
These jaffa cakes are going to be huge because we're going to make them in muffin tins

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.880
So they are a much bigger size

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.700
We're also going to add extra orange flavour into our sponge

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.240
In the form of zest

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.110
And our orange juice goes into there as well, so it's really souped up orange jelly

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.730
and a souped up orange sponge

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.549
Souped up? 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.930
When does the soup go in?

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.550
As in super

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.979
Ah ok

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.270
It's so orangey!

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.450
I love fresh citrus fruits.
So as soon as you're happy that all the jelly bits have dissolved

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.820
then pour it into a tray that's lined with cling film so you get a layer of jelly

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.430
That can be put into a fridge to set up.
Now, speaking from experience, do that carefully  

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.259
because you don't want to spill that everywhere

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.219
that's not the fridge
Nope, but

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.369
here's some I made earlier

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.809
Ah, look... Mr Blue Peter

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:10.369
There we go, super jelly

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.339
that's just in sheet form

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:14.729
Will you stop saying the word 'super'? That's about the 5th time so far!

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.010
Pretty good jelly that's in sheet form

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.279
And now hopefully, there we go

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:25.609
nice, thick ribbon stage 
That took no time
I knew you were going to do that
What are you doing?
Turn it off!

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:30.639
You're pushing it the wrong way!
And now we can fold in our flour, so 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.409
you can see how much air is in there now, that just started off as 2 eggs and a bit of sugar

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:38.889
Now we can put in our flour, carefully fold it in

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.370
spoon this into muffin tins, I've just lightly greased them so it doesn't stick

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.190
and we literally need this much in each - just enough to cover the bottom

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.279
they will continue to rise in the oven

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:47.790
Jaffa Cakes aren't that thick, are they?

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.520
No, this should be the same consistency as a Jaffa Cake when you eat it

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.579
It's kind of a slightly chewy

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:53.599
soft

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.249
awesome sponge

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:57.179
Really light and fluffy

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:59.339
mmm doing a grand job there Ben

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:01.629
What we're doing is just demonstrating for the guys at home

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.449
how easy this is.
This can go into an oven, Mike, 180 degrees Celcius

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:09.379
for 10 minutes...
Jamie...

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.749
And then in the meantime we can melt some chocolate

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:14.289
come back, and finish our cakes of jaffa!

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.599
Ooo cakes of jaffa!

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.620
Now that our sponges have cooked, and had time to cool

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.759
We've just kind of eased around the edge to loosen them off

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:27.329
So that you end up with our sponge biscuit base but leave them in the muffin tins.
Fantastic!

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.729
Now we can come to our jelly, which is obviously our middle layer... A little cutter

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:32.169
Just a little bit smaller

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:33.480
than the circles

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.099
and then we just cut out jelly

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.369
It really is that simple!

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:38.439
Do you want to put

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.870
one on each sponge, we should end up with
something

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.369
that looks like that

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:44.599
I think that's the best part of a Jaffa Cake
Look at that wobble!

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.189
Although it does drive me mad, have you seen Barry eat a Jaffa Cake? He nibbles all the chocolate off

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.609
Then all the cake, so you're left with all the jelly bit

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.269
That's how you eat Jaffa Cakes

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.360
If you read the back of a packet of Jaffa Cakes, in the instructions

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.469
It says 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:59.029
deconstruct the Jaffa Cake

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:00.980
I don't believe you...

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.860
I want to hear from you guys, how do you eat your Jaffa Cakes? Comment below in the comment box, I want to know exactly how you eat your jaffa cakes

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.529
and finally, perhaps the best part of the
Jaffa Cake

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:11.719
Dark chocolate, and all you need to do is dribble loads of it on

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:15.010
and then ease it to the edge quite quickly before the jelly melts like so

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.599
You've even got the lump on top!

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:18.799
That's the jelly

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.719
Yeah, I know but that's what 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:24.440
That's what Jaffa Cakes look like!
Yeah, these look like amazing jaffa cakes

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.940
except they are bigger and better

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.319
So we just whack these in a fridge straight after.
Yeah you can leave them at room temperature, the chocolate will set

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:33.679
But we want to speed that up, it'll be even easier
We'll put them in a fridge to setup.

00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:35.599
Meanwhile

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.550
Fortunately we have some we've already done

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.680
and these ones have already set
YES
Lovely
So we can scoop them out, and grab ourselves a plate

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.910
then just ease them out and I reckon we'll stack them up
This is just one of many 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.650
desserts, cakes and biscuits

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.800
Isn't it Jamie?
Do you know what, funnily enough it is. It's one of just many desserts, cakes and biscuits

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.830
we've done before

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.110
make sure you're subscribed to our YouTube channel, it's SORTED Food - we bring you them every week!

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.649
It might be wobbly

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:05.090
but there is our ultimate Jaffa Cake stack

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.930
SORTED

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.729
Now we could just eat them straight away, or we could do this
Aaw, I'm going to eat them straight away

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.939
Ok, that is a Jaffa Cake

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:21.539
It's pretty good!
I think it's better than a Jaffa Cake
You've got biscuit... Sorry, cake,

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.289
jelly, chocolate

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.619
Jaffa cake - what could go wrong?

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:25.259
You've got a half moon there!
