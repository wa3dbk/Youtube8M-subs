00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.810
Environmental group Sea Shepherd on Wednesday
said it is seeking a Supreme Court injunction

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.240
to halt a controversial shark culling policy
in Western Australia. The group, best known

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.260
for battling Japanese whalers in the Antarctic,
has teamed up with Sharon Burden, the mother

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.480
of a shark attack victim, to apply for a judicial
review of the decision, claiming it involves

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.500
the unlawful killing of a protected species.
"Sea Shepherd Australia believes that the

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.170
tender process was unlawful, that the West
Australian state government has been acting

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.700
unlawfully, that the taking and killing of
protected animals was illegal," it said in

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.860
a statement. "The law contemplates some sort
of process being in place to protect these

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.770
protected animals and that process has been
scotched." The controversial policy to catch

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.280
and kill sharks off popular west coast beaches
was given the green light in January after

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.829
six fatal attacks in the past two years. It
is aimed at reducing the risks to water users

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.530
and allows baited drum lines with hooks designed
to capture large sharks to be set one kilometre

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.280
offshore at busy Western Australian beaches
for a trial period until April 30. Any shark

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.540
longer than three metres snagged by the lines
and deemed to be a threat -- including great

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.590
white, bull and tiger sharks -- is being destroyed.
Sixty-six sharks were caught in the first

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.170
three weeks, according to the West Australian
newspaper, which Wednesday said there were

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.490
fears among fisheries officers that sharks
impaled on hooks were attracting bigger sharks

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.869
to coastal areas. The cull move has angered
conservationists with rallies held at sites

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.930
around the country over the past few weeks.
Opponents claim the trial flies in the face

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.370
of international obligations to protect the
great white shark. "We are seeking an injunction

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.930
to remove the drum lines immediately on the
basis that a judicial review needs to be conducted

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.941
as to the way the shark mitigation programme
was rolled out," Sea Shepherd said. Sharks

00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:55.770
are common in Australian waters and experts
say attacks are increasing in line with population

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.620
growth and the popularity of water sports.
