00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.500
So, the two and a half days of
Bitcoin 2014 -

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.100
Amsterdam conference -

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.500
is now over.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.870
It's been really interesting and
really busy.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.000
We had a booth for BTC Store -

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.300
and we sold a lot of stuff at the booth.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.500
We had a lot of interest and we also had the -

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.600
Lamassu Bitcoin ATM.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.300
It was functioning and people also bought bitcoins from there.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.200
There's been a huge amount of talks.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.300
I'm looking forward to actually listening to them, 
later on -

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.200
because I was networking and 
didn't really have time to watch the talks.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.800
But I did hear they were really good.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.700
Hopefully they come online as soon as possible.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.000
We've been doing interviews of key Bitcoin figures -

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.200
such as -

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.000
BitPay's CEO Tony Gallippi,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.700
Bitstamp's CEO,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.100
and Coinbase's COO.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.200
We've had interesting discussions.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.900
We're gonna publish the full interviews on the channel, so -

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.000
check them out!

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.400
After two and a half days of constant walking

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.300
and standing,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.000
we're pretty much tired.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.840
Everyone's a bit tired but I think that -

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.300
it was all worth it.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.300
The conference was really interesting in many ways

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.500
and there's been a clear change 
from last year.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.500
The Bitcoin scene is much bigger

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.800
than it used to be -

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.200
It's different.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.000
we have new companies and old companies -

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
everything is moving forward.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And -

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.500
the people that are just looking at the Bitcoin
headlines from the news -

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.000
don't really understand that infrastructure is -

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.580
growing at the huge rate and there's so 
much innovation going on

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.200
and -

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.200
you don't see that from the newspapers.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.300
So I'm looking at an exciting -

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.500
year for Bitcoin to come.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.030
There have been a lot of product
launches at the conference.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.900
Especially really visible is the new ATMs.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.900
There's so many different ATM producers 
and manufacturers

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.400
and new models for some ATM manufacturers -

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.500
like Lamassu.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.800
The roadmap for getting Bitcoin mainstream - 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.200
I think, starts here.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.500
We finally have the development of -

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.400
secure and convenient wallets,
multisig wallets

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.900
all kinds of new things that will make Bitcoin -

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.200
at the same time, more secure to use 
and more easy to use -

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.200
and that will allow regular people to use Bitcoin 
securely and easily

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.800
And hopefully we'll see
a lot of development on that side -

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.900
during the next year.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.900
I think there's probably never been so
many central key Bitcoin figures -

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.500
in one conference.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.200
I think this conference has almost everyone.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.700
So, that's kind of a really good opportunity for
networking -

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.900
and getting to know the key people here.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.400
And I think that -

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.300
at least for us -

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.100
it worked out successfully.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.500
With Bitcoin 2014 -

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.800
Bitcoin took a huge step forward.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.000
It's much more serious, -

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
there's a lot more companies, 
it's much bigger -

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.400
and the level of innovation is incredible.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.200
It's gonna be really interesting to see 
how all of this develops

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.300
over the next six months and the next year.
