00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We would like to welcome you 
to the YouTube channel of Przewozy Regionalne. 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.500
We are in Bydgoszcz, exactly 
at station Bydgoszcz Główna. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Behind me you can see, how looks 
the head of that station. 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:50.000
We see regular railway, normal-sized, 
but in a moment we will move to the world of smaller railway

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.000
Because we are in the 
Laboratorium Prowadzenia Ruchu Pociągów, 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.000
Belonging to Kujawsko-Pomorskie Department of 
Przewozy Regionalne in Bydgoszcz. 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.500
That place is the largest
model railway in northern Poland,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
In addition to the fact,
that trains are a little smaller,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.000
Everything in this model looks exactly 
like normal-sized railway. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.500
Laboratorium Prowadzenia Ruchu Pociągów,
because that is how the model called, 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Was created in 1981. 
It was building from 1980. 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:09.000
The idea of building it was to train students 
from vocational and rail technical schools.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:26.000
&amp;lt;children singing&gt;

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The model, as I said, 
was built in one year,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:44.000
But for 32 years was also modernized:
semaphores were changed, some rail  systems,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:53.000
So today, we see 
what we see. 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:01.000
Table has a size of 7.5 mx 3.5 m, 
I do not know if it will fit in any room,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.500
But when we are organizing Railway Worker Day 
or other similar events,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
When people come as an unorganized groups, 
it is usually that not the children, but fathers, 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.000
Give the impression that they would love
to play and drove the trains,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.000
Indeed, anyone  could drive it, 
because it is not difficult, 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.000
And the devices are well protected -
as the real train devices: 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:44.000
Verification of the track - the semaphore will not 
show if the track is not laid,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.000
Occupation control - when the track is occupate, 
we can not let another train,

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.000
Everything is constructed, 
as in real life, on railway.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:11.000
That's how we promote our company. 
We are called to trucking people to work, 
27
00:04:11,500 --&gt; 00:03:56,000
Children and young people to school, 
we - Przewozy Regionalne.
