00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:09.020
Hey, out of sight out of mind doesn't work
any longer for this closet.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.660
It's time to get it organized.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.329
You know, organizing a closet is one of those
things that, I don't know about you, but I

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.320
never seem to find the time to get around
to do.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.390
In my house, the closets often get filled
up with all kinds of things, even the guest

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.390
closets.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.500
When you have a rain day, why don't you go
in and reorganize your closets?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.550
If you do, here are a few tips you might keep
in mind.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.070
First, go through the closet and clean everything
out.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.320
I know it sounds like a lot of work, but it's
the best way to look at what you have and

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.400
begin to make some choices, because it's all
about choice.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.610
If you haven't worn anything in a full year
-- that means you have all four seasons or

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.430
at least you have your spring and summer and
fall and winter -- if you haven't worn it

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.370
in a year, you need to get rid of it.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.490
And this is an opportunity for you to do something
for someone less fortunate.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.180
Donate it to Goodwill or some other charity
where someone less fortunate will have an

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.570
opportunity to wear something nice that you're
going to discard.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.430
Take this, for instance: Maybe it worked at
one time -- it's just not me anymore.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.430
It's gotta go.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.110
The thing to remember here is efficiency.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.280
For instance, here, I have all shirts and
I've organized them based on color.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.680
Starting over here with bright colors: In
reds, so forth, to blues to grays and into

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.680
brown over here.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.200
It just makes getting up and getting dressed
in the morning that much more efficient.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.330
Oh, and here's another idea: For scares, I
like to go ahead and tie them on a clothes

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.330
hanger like this.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.560
Makes it really handy and they're not always
sliding off and falling onto the floor.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.520
Now speaking of the floor, if we move a little
closer there's a way you can use some extension

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.040
rods to work on those shoes.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.850
So if you notice, I got all this space between
the bottom of the clothes and the floor.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.619
Wasted space, I can put put certainly shoes
across the bottom here on the floor, but I

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.970
got this intermediate area that I could fill.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.760
By taking a couple of extension rods like
this, you see I have this one in place, I'm

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.659
just gonna put this one in here.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.600
Then you just take the shoes, place them up
there, and hey, you've doubled your shoe space

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.970
in your closet.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.799
If you have any interesting tips on how you've
made your closet space more efficient, I'd

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:10.799
love to hear about it.

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:36.060
