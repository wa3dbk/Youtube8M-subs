00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:12.559
Hey guys, it’s Ro!

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.099
Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies!

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.310
I have been reading the classic fantasy series
The Chronicles of Narnia

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.470
this winter. And if you can’t tell, my outfit
is inspired by the White Witch.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.430
So, today we are going to be making some treats
from the story, they also happen

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.270
to be some of my favorite winter treats, Turkish
Delights!

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.940
But don’t tell Aslan because, he’s like,
kind of a party pooper.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.280
OH! Uh, hey Aslan! No, we’re not, we’re
not making treats over here of

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.960
trickery and tomfoolery and trying to take
over the kingdom…

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.200
Don’t worry about it, hey go over there
in the other side of the wardrobe!

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.160
‘Dere you go, ah!

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.980
OK, let’s get started!

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.450
The things you will need, will be: 3 cups
of regular sugar, a bowl of

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.809
powdered sugar, you don’t need a certain
amount, because we’re gonna use this

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.530
to decorate, so just a bowl of powdered sugar.
1/2 a cup of cran-raspberry juice

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.530
red food coloring dye, 3/4 cup of corn starch,
3 tablespoons of light corn syrup,

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.409
1 tablespoon of vanilla extract, 3 packets
of unflavored gelatin. And then

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.439
we’re gonna need 2 different measurements
of water, the 1st measurement is

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.740
1/2 a cup, the 2nd measurement is 1 and 1/2
cups, and a big saucepan with a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.789
candy thermometer. And then last but not least
we’ll need a pan, I’m using a

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.859
square pan and it is 8 inches by 8 inches,
and then I’ve lined it with a piece

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:42.999
of cling wrap.

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:45.289
Let’s put it all together!

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.659
The first thing that we’re gonna do, is
we’re gonna make 2 mixtures that we’re

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.789
gonna set aside for later.

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.849
The 1st one, you’re gonna take your cran-raspberry
juice and we’re gonna pour in

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:00.259
the 3 packets of gelatin, you’re just gonna
pour them on the top and let them

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.060
sit, you don’t need to mix.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.399
The 2nd thing we’re gonna mix together,
we’re gonna mix our cornstarch, then

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.349
you’re gonna add 1/2 a cup of water, then
you’re gonna whisk it together until

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.989
it’s really smooth and pasty, once this
is mixed together we’re gonna set it

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.250
off to the side and we’re gonna grab our
medium sized saucepan and we’re gonna

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.790
make some sugar syrup.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.810
In your saucepan we are going to combine all
our sugar…

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.820
Oooooooooooh!!!!!

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.650
And the 1 and 1/2 cup of water, and your light
corn syrup, it’s pretty gooey!

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.920
Now we’re gonna whisk it all together, like
this!

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.540
Now we’re gonna bring this over to the stove.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.440
Stir your mixture on a medium heat until it
reaches 240 degrees.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.430
Once it’s reached 240 degrees, add in your
corn starch mixture, and whisk

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.290
together on a medium/low heat until it thickens.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.870
Once its thickened, you’re gonna take your
syrup mixture off of the stove and

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.720
we’re gonna add our juice and gelatin mixture,
so just scoop it in there, I’m

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.770
just using a little spoon. And we’re gonna
add our vanilla extract.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.380
Now we’re gonna mix it together until it’s
nice and smooth, it does take a little

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.120
while, but not too long.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.250
Once everything’s dissolved, we’re gonna
add 3 drops of red food coloring.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.990
1, 2, 3!

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.900
And then mix it together!

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.380
Once everything is mixed together we’re
gonna pour everything into our tray,

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.900
but 1st we’re gonna sprinkle a little powdered
sugar at the bottom, pour it in.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.820
Now that we’ve got it poured into our container,
now I’m just gonna take a

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.960
spoon, and we’re gonna scoop off the bubbles
on top, and just put ‘em back

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.040
in the pot.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.400
Now for the easy part, you’re gonna let
these sit out for 5 hours to set.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.240
I like to let them sit overnight, you want
to let them sit at room temperature,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.370
don’t put them in the refrigerator, just
let them sit out at room temperature.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.590
You can cover them if you like. It’s a good
time to also, maybe watch some movies if

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.380
you’ve got some time to kill. Maybe some
Chronicles of Narnia?

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.530
Now that the turkish delights have set, we’re
gonna take them out of the tray

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.410
and we’re gonna cut them into little yummy
candy bites!

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.440
And roll them in powdered sugar!

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.819
So the 1st thing that you’re gonna do
on a cutting board, is take

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.370
a little bit of powdered sugar, put it down
on the surface.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.910
Pffft! Pfffft! A-ha-ha-ha!

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.480
Now, we’re gonna flip ‘em upside down!

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.539
1, 2, 3! Ohp!

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.079
Then we’re gonna gently peel off the cling
wrap.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.620
Now we’re gonna cut some squares, I’ve
got a little pizza cutter, and I’ve just

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.600
put some powdered sugar along the top.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.349
Just remember, the Turkish Delights are very
tacky, they’re very sticky, so

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.870
you might even want to put a little powdered
sugar on your pizza cutter.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.920
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.340
Look at that!

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.430
What you want to do is cut strips, just like
this, all the way down,

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.279
and then we’re gonna cut them into little
squares.

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:50.879
Now that we’ve got our Turkish Delights
cut, we’re gonna roll each

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.650
little piece in powdered sugar

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.080
And I better, I better taste one, just to
make sure they’re good!

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.260
Mmmmmmm!

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.420
Now you’re gonna do this for the rest of
your delights!

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.539
Ta-da!

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.889
Here are The Chronicles of Narnia Turkish
Delights!

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.520
I hope you guys liked them, they were really
fun to make.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.419
I will be posting lots of pictures on my Facebook,
Instagram, Tumblr and Twitter.

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.770

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.939
Bye-bye!

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.660
You want a treat? You want a treat?

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.449
Yeah? Yeah, I know you did.

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.869
White Witch and Aslan are biffles!

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.900
#PlotTwist

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.120
Have you ever laughed so hard that boogers came
out of your nose like this?

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:05.419
I have!
