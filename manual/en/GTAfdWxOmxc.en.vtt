KEEP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.999
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS INFORMED. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.999
HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.999
ON CHRISTMAS DAY, NORTHWEST 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.999
AIRLINES FLIGHT 253 WAS IN ROUTE 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.999
TO -- FROM AMSTERDAM TO DETROIT. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.999
AS THE PLANE MADE ITS FINAL 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.999
APPROACH TO THE DETROIT 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.999
METROPOLITAN AIRPORT, A 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.999
PASSENGER ALLEGEDLY TRIED TO 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.999
IGNITE AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE ON 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.999
HIS BODY, SETTING OFF A FIRE. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.999
THANKS TO THE QUICK AND HEROIC 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.999
ACTIONS OF PASSENGER AND CREW, 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.999
THE SUBJECT WAS IMMEDIATELY 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.999
SUBDUED, THE FIRE WAS PUT OUT, 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.999
AND THE PLANE LANDED SAFELY. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.999
THE SUSPECT IS NOW IN CUSTODY 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.999
AND HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.999
ATTEMPTING TO DESTROY AN AIRCRAFT. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.999
A FULL INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.999
LAUNCHED INTO THIS ATTEMPTED ACT 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.999
OF TERRORISM AND WE WILL NOT 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.999
REST UNTIL WE FIND ALL WHO WERE 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.999
INVOLVED AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.999
THIS WAS A SERIOUS REMINDER OF 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.999
THE DANGERS WE FACE AND THE 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.999
NATURE OF THOSE WHO THREATEN OUR HOMELAND. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.999
HOW THE SUSPECT SUCCEEDED IN 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.999
BRINGING DOWN THE PLANE. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.999
IT COULD HAVE KILLED NEARLY 300 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.999
PASSENGERS AND CREW. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.999
INNOCENT CIVILIANS PREPARING TO 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.999
CELEBRATE THE HOLIDAYS WITH 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.999
THEIR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.999
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD BE 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.999
ASSURED THAT WE ARE DOING 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.999
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO KEEP 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.999
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SAFE AND 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.999
SECURE DURING THIS BUSY HOLIDAY SEASON. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.999
SINCE I WAS FIRST NOTIFIED OF 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.999
THIS INCIDENT I HAVE ORDERED THE 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.999
FOLLOWING ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN TO 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.999
PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.999
TO SECURE AIR TRAVEL. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.999
FIRST, I DIRECTED THAT WE TAKE 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.999
IMMEDIATE STEPS TO ENSURE THE 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.999
TROUBLING SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.999
WE MADE SURE THAT ALL FLIGHTS 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.999
STILL IN THE AIR WERE SECURE AND COULD LAND SAFELY. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.999
WE IMMEDIATELY ENHANCED 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.999
SCREENING AND SECURITY 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.999
PROCEDURES FOR ALL FLIGHTS, 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.999
DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.999
WE ADDED FEDERAL AIR MARSHALS TO 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.999
FLIGHTS ENTERING AND LEAVING THE 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.999
UNITED STATES AND WE'RE WORKING 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.999
CLOSELY IN THIS COUNTRY WITH 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.999
FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAW- 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.999
ENFORCEMENT WITH OUR 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.999
INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.999
SECOND, I HAVE ORDERED TWO 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.999
REVIEWS BECAUSE IT IS ABSOLUTELY 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.999
CRITICAL THAT WE LEARN FROM THIS 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.999
INCIDENT TO PREVENT FUTURE ACTS OF TERRORISM. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.999
THE FIRST INVOLVES OUR WATCH 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.999
LIST -- WATCH LIST SYSTEM, WHICH 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.999
THE GOVERNMENT HAS HAD FOR MANY 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.999
YEARS TO PREVENT KNOWN AND 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.999
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FROM 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.999
ENTERING THE UNITED STATES. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.999
APPARENTLY THE SUSPECT WAS IN 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.999
THIS SYSTEM, BUT NOT ON A WATCH 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.999
LIST SUCH AS THE SO-CALLED NO- FLY LIST. 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.999
SO I HAVE ORDERED A THOROUGH 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.999
REVIEW, NOT ONLY HOW INFORMATION 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.999
RELATED TO THE SUBJECT WAS 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.999
HANDLED, BUT OF THE OVERALL 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.999
WATCHLIST SYSTEM AND HOW IT CAN 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.999
BE STRENGTHENED. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.999
THE SECOND REVIEW WILL HANDLE 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.999
ALL SCREENING POLICIES, 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.999
TECHNOLOGIES AND PROCEDURES 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.999
RELATED TO AIR TRAVEL. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.999
WE NEED TO DETERMINE JUST HOW 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.999
THE SUSPECT WAS ABLE TO BRING 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.999
DANGEROUS EXPLOSIVES ABOARD AN AIRCRAFT AND WHAT ADDITIONAL 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.999
STEPS WE CAN TAKE TO AVOID 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
FUTURE ATTACKS. 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.999
WE DO NOT GET HAVE THE ANSWERS 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.999
ABOUT THIS LATEST ATTEMPT, BUT 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.999
THOSE THAT WOULD SLAUGHTER 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.999
INNOCENT MEN, WOMEN, AND 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.999
CHILDREN MUST KNOW THAT THE 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.999
U.S. WILL DO MORE THAN SIMPLY 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.999
STRENGTHEN OUR DEFENSES. 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.999
IT WILL CONTINUE TO USE EVERY 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.999
ELEMENT IN OUR NATIONAL POWER TO 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.999
DISRUPT, DISMANTLE, AND DEFEAT 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.999
THE VIOLENT EXTREMIST THAT 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.999
THREATEN US, WHETHER FROM 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.999
AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN, YEMEN 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.999
OR SOMALIA, OR ANYWHERE. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.999
ANYWHERE THEY ARE PLOTTING 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.999
ATTACKS AGAINST THE U.S. HOMELAND. 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.999
FINALLY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.999
SHOULD REMAIN VIGILANT, BUT CONFIDENT. 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.999
THOSE PLANNING TO UNDERMINE OUR 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.999
SECURITY, BUT ALSO THE OPEN 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.999
SECURITY AND VALUES AND THAT WE 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.999
CHERISH AS AMERICANS. 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.999
THIS INCIDENT, LIKE SEVERAL THAT 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.999
HAVE PRECEDED IT, DEMONSTRATES 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.999
AN ALERT AND COURAGEOUS 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.999
CITIZENRY AND FAR MORE RESILIENT 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.999
THAN AN ISOLATED EXTREMISTS. 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.999
AND AS A NATION, WE WILL DO 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY. 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.999
WE WILL BE GUIDED BY OUR HOPES, 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.999
OUR UNITY, AND ARE DEEPLY HELD 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.999
VALUES. 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.999
THAT IS WHO WE ARE AS AMERICANS. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.999
THAT IS WHAT OUR BRAVE MEN AND 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.999
WOMEN IN UNIFORM ARE STAYING FOR 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.999
AS THEY SPEND THE HOLIDAYS IN 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.999
HARM'S WAY. 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.999
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.999
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.999
AMERICA SAFE IN THE NEW YEAR AND 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.999
BEYOND. 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.999
BEFORE I LEAVE, LET ME BRIEFLY 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.999
ADDRESSED THE EVENTS THAT HAVE 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.999
TAKEN PLACE OVER THE PAST FEW 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.999
DAYS IN THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.999
IRAN. 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.999
THE U.S. JOINED WITH THE 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.999
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.999
STRONGLY CONDEMNING THE VIOLENCE 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.999
AND UNJUST SUPPRESSION OF 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.999
IRANIAN CITIZENS, WHICH HAS 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.999
APPARENTLY RESOLVED AND 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.999
INTENTIONS, INJURIES, AND EVEN 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.999
DEATH. 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.999
FOR MONTHS, THE IRANIAN PEOPLE 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.999
HAVE SOUGHT NOTHING MORE THAN TO 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.999
EXERCISE THEIR UNIVERSAL RIGHTS. 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.999
EACH TIME THEY HAVE DONE SO, 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.999
THEY HAVE BEEN MET WITH THE IRON 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.999
FIST OF BRUTALITY, EVEN ON 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.999
SOLEMN OCCASIONS AND HOLY DAYS. 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.999
AND EACH TIME IT HAS HAPPENED, 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.999
THE WORLD HAS WATCHED WITH DEEP 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.999
ADMIRATION FOR THE COURAGE AND 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.999
CONVICTION OF THE IRANIAN 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.999
PEOPLE, WHO ARE PART OF THE

IRAN'S GRADE AND IN DURING 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.999
CIVILIZATION. 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.999
WHAT IS TAKING PLACE WITHIN IRAN 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.999
IS NOT ABOUT THE U.S. OR ANY 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.999
OTHER COUNTRY, BUT THE IRANIAN 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.999
PEOPLE AND THEIR ASPIRATIONS FOR 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.999
JUSTICE AND A BETTER LIFE FOR 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.999
THEMSELVES. 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.999
THE DECISION OF IRAN COZY 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.999
LEADERS TO GOVERN THROUGH YEAR 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.999
END TIERNEY WILL NOT MAKE THOSE 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.999
ASPIRATIONS -- THROUGH FEAR AND 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.999
TYRANNY WILL NOT MAKE THOSE ASPIRATIONS GO AWAY. 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.999
ALONG WITH ALL FREE NATIONS, THE

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.999
INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS THAT

WE CALL FOR THE IMMEDIATE 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.999

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.999
UNJUSTLY DETAINED WITHIN IRAN. 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.999
WE WILL CONTINUE TO BEAR 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.999
WITNESS TO THE EXTRAORDINARY 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.999
