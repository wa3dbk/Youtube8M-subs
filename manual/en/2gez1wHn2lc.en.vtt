00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.660
We're at the Tollgate Education Center, part of Michigan State University

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.950
and Novi Michigan, and today we're talking about thinning

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.230
apples. And this is a procedure or
process that we go through

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.480
in the early to mid-summer time, and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.150
the process of apple growing is really a
two-year process.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.650
The flower buds for this year's apple
crop

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.640
really began to be formed last summer
in July and August and September

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.559
throughout the fall. The apples then
develop throughout the winter

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.840
and flower this springtime. Now many
homeowners face the issue of having a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.100
light crop of apple's one year and then a really heavy crop the next year, and then a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.660
light then a heavy and a light then a heavy. And the way to break
that cycle

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.590
on years that you have a heavy crop of fruit, just thin off some the apples,

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.710
and that would mean that the apples that
are left will be larger

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.770
and higher quality and, more importantly,
they'll mean

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.649
that the tree will put more of it's energy
into producing flower buds

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.350
for next year's crop. And so thinning does a couple of things that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.720
not only helps to improve the quality of fruit, but this year, but it also helps to

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.020
improve the quantity of fruit that you will get
next year. The process of thinning is

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.930
something that is

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.929
pretty easy to do, and usually it
occurs in about

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.270
mid-June through early July,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.450
and we usually wait for a time of June drop.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.860
And June drop is a time that some of our fruit naturally drops from the tree

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.060
that hasn't been pollinated entirely or properly.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.380
So you wait to see some apples on the ground underneath the tree.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.880
And once you've gone through with that that time of June drop, then you begin to decide

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.479
how to thin an apple tree. And in
this case

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.530
I always start by saying, "Let's do some cluster thinning." And

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.270
when I say "cluster thinning", I look at a
group of apples that are all in the same

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.670
cluster, and I take them all off except one. And the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.780
best tool that I use for
that is really handy, it's just your

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.489
thumbnail.

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.599
And you simply break off all but the largest
sized apple,

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.290
and put these apples into a bucket, and
put them into a well-working compost

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.760
pile.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.690
Now this apple that is left is going to to
grow larger this summer,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.020
so higher quality fruit, and also next
year the possibility

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.160
of forming more flower buds on this twig are going to be greater and you're

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.720
going to have a

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.910
higher quality and quantity of fruit next year.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.100
So let's move up the limb. Now as I'm doing my
thinning, I sometimes see that I have

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.380
some fruit

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.770
that is diseased or insect
damaged, and here's some fruit

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.480
was an apple scab. So there's
automatically a fruit that I would take off

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.730
in this thinning process. Here's
another cluster of two.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.120
Move up. Single. Single.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.520
Here's another cluster of three
apples, and

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.220
here again I have a little bit of
insect injury so that's an apple

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.790
that I would again snap off my thumb nail,
and

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.850
another one comes off, so this is the
apple I'm leaving. Another cluster right

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.330
here,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.780
and take them all off except one. Move up the tree,

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.590
take it off, take it off, keep moving up the branch.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.030
And so as you move around the tree, you're going to
find lots of apples that need to come off.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.700
Again, I like to have a five gallon
bucket close to me, and just drop the

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.240
apples into a bucket.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.660
Then they should be put
into a well-working compost pile,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.960
and they'll deteriorate in that pile fairly
quickly,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.300
and I hope your compost as well.
