00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:08.850
As freshman Lydia McManus sees her room in
New Central 1 for the first time...Awww...it's

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.570
easy to see she's excited about her new home.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.309
Oh, I have a perfect view of the library.

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.330
But she's also excited that she'll soon be
learning in this new residence hall, too...as

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.580
part of the Honors Living Learning Community.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.280
My only 8 AM class is in Central 2, so everybody
is like, oh you have an 8AM and I'm like,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.280
it's in my dorm, no big deal!

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.010
While students may appreciate the convenience,
UK officials say living learning programs

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.330
help create a unique student experience.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:45.960
This is an opportunity for people to learn
together but also to offer almost an individualized

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.300
education.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.470
It blends those two experiences powerfully.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.940
So a living-learning program is when you sort
of combine that residential experience you

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.439
have in your residence hall with your academic
missions.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:03.980
Soon even more students can choose to have
this experience.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.781
By fall of 2014, officials plan to have a
total of 6 residential colleges &amp; 13 living

00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:13.110
learning communities on campus.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.290
We know that this kind of living and learning
space is a strong predictor of student success.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:28.000
It's not just that they gradate but they find
the deepest of meaning and purpose in the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.380
education experience.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.141
Officials say the programs help students make
connections not just about academics, but

00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:36.810
with each other, too.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.720
The purpose is to help our students be successful
and it's important to help them be successful

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.870
academically but also socially.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.860
It makes a big university small in some ways.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.060
This becomes your family within a big family.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.630
Part of being happy is meeting new friends
in your new locations and the quicker we can

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.650
get them engaged and connected the quicker
they'll be more successful.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.880
The relationships one gains in quality college
experience are typical the ones that you take

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.289
with you your entire life.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:18.810
So we're going to have an environment that
really fosters building those kinds of relationships...relationships

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.980
that will start in this very residence hall
and continue long after graduation.
