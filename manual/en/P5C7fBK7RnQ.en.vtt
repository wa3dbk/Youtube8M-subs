00:00:00.836 --> 00:00:02.510
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.230
Welcome to GLAMLAND and
the world of GLAMGLOW.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.290
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.520
So we have a confession.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.690
GLAMGLOW was our
sexy little secret,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.830
and Shannon and I
never imagined it

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.100
would go beyond behind
the scenes in Hollywood.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.130
We were having a casual evening
at an actor's friend's home

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.930
in Hollywood, when
the conversation

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:26.970
turned to a question.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.400
Does a skin care product
exist that can instantly

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.745
make you look camera ready?

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:33.370
Our friends confided
that they couldn't

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.200
find a product that
would give them

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.060
camera ready skin in minutes.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.850
They wanted a skin care
solution that could instantly

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.390
refine pores, diminish
visible imperfections,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.150
reduce fine lines, and
immediately inspire

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.830
a sexy glow that lasts for days.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.690
And it absolutely had to
provide instant results.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.850
Once we developed our
formula, our journey

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.830
took us to a cosmetic chemist.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.930
We took a leap of
faith and began

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.050
filling samples with a kitchen
spoon on our coffee table

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.280
at home.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.110
We gave the jars to
our actor friends

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.750
and figured that would
be the end of our story.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.220
Oh we were wrong.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.650
Our friends came
back saying, wow.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.320
That stuff really works
and asking for more.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.100
They all said their skin was
brighter, smoother, clearer,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.240
and glowing.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.310
After a year of
supplying Hollywood

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.790
with our plain white jars
with no name and no labels,

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.080
my wildly creative
husband grabbed paper,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.400
and from that same
coffee table we

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.700
created a box and
brainstormed names.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
It had to be sexy,
innovative, and fun.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.150
It had to be GLAMGLOW.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.530
Every formula includes our
proprietary patented TEAOXI

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.470
technology, and every product
is designed for men and women

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.720

Best of all GLAMGLOW fits
into any skin care regime.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.740

to cheat on your favorite.
