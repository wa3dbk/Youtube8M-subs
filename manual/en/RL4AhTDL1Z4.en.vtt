00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.460
The BMW i3 vehicle's body is from carbon fiber reinforced plastics

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.733
Beyond the engine you see aluminum sheets which are used for mounting of the seats

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.755
...on the one-side. So, let's move to the front.

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:18.654
You see that the crash structure here in the front.

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:23.955
And for that spring struct, you see a bracket from aluminum diecast

00:00:24.183 --> 00:00:26.663
And its a really beautiful example of

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.280
to see how they really

00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:33.335
enhance strongly to the carbon fiber reinforced plastics

00:00:35.523 --> 00:00:38.323
So all this naturally transfers the force

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.240
from the front. You also see a

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.640
honeycomb deformation [structure] part

00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:49.595
which helps in time, in case of a front crash

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.460
to absorb the front energy.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.300
So this is a extremely impressive part about the front end vectoring-technology.

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:00.449
We have the propulsion here, comprising  both...

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.569
on the left side we have the electric engine 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.640
with the power electronics on top

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.500
and on the right side

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.660
we have installed a two-cylinder gasoline engine 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.560
that makes more sense as an electric generator

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.480
and this just producing electricity

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.280
and if the customer orders it [the i3]

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.695
without the extender

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.440
there is nothing there, it is taken out.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.960
Maybe an interesting look is also the die cast part of aluminium 

00:01:25.095 --> 00:01:28.695
and the science of...this is a multi-functional part

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.480
of tri-formula[tion (strut, shock + frame)].

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.020
sorry

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.100
And this ONE site works for the spring strut

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.480
and also enacting the leaves [shock absorber] of the wheel

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.760
and it also holds the engines

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.380
So it's a multi-functional part

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.260
[German engineering term]

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.860
Its also a statement for a multi-material design

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.600
So...thank you very much...thank you.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.460
[Applause]
