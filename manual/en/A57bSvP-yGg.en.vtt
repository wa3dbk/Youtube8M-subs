00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:10.289
Okay, now we're going to build it up with
a little bit of pinkier tone. And the darker

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:16.820
areas, and remember it's fairly wet, so when
you place it down you want to make sure that

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:31.590
it's the right wetness. If it's too wet it'll
flow too quickly. If it's not wet enough it'll

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:49.920
cause a hard edge. And we're going to turn
this to do a gradation

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.210
because the cheek is a little bit darker,
on the edge of the cheek, so we're just sort

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.649
of dabbing paint into the edge of the cheek,
and then we're going to bring up some color

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:12.690
here, and then just on the inside of the nose,
put a little more color there, and then right

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.050
below the nostrils, I'm just going to put
some color there, then we're going to take

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:39.300
out the color, and before we do anything else,
we're going to soften up the edges.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:50.570
And remove any paint that we need to.
Sometimes hard to remove, if there's not that

00:01:50.570 --> 00:02:12.040
much to remove. It's a soft face, there's
not really going to be too many hard edges

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.400
to look at.
