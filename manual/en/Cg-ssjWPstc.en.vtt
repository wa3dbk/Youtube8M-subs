Okay next thing that we are going to step
into now is what we call our Indian stepping.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.450
Now with everything that is actually in breaking
it is just like if you watch a movie it is

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.210
needs a beginning which is your intro, it
need to have a story line of where it is going,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.890
it needs a climax part, on how hip it is going
to be and it needs a very good ending like

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.439
everything does to be memorable So that is
what we are going to go into next we are going

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.050
to start with our intro where you need to
start at. As more as you get more advance

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.900
to this you are going to start figuring out
where you want to top rock, or if you are

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.130
going to use your footwork and things like
that etc, etc so that is all going to be on

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.920
you when you get home. So first thing we are
going to start into is going to be your basic

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.360
top rocking. Now it is almost like you are
playing hokey poky and I like to teach it

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.890
like that cause kids kind of makes it fun
for you know us grown folks, you know for

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.281
the kids at home and everything like that
and so. We are going to start with a basic

00:00:56.281 --> 00:01:02.350
arm swing as you swing your arms back and
forth just like this, you are going to be

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.719
making that X on your arm whenever you are
doing this step now. As you step and your

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:14.560
arms cross, as they come back behind you your
right leg would step out to your side. Now

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.210
you really don't want to step in be pointing.
A lot of ya'll would probably point for the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.450
first time but basically try to get your foot
to be stepping to a side or a angle or anything

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.679
like that just for better balance. As you
see me step back I'm going to step back just

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:35.310
like that and now my legs come back together.
As they come back up my left foot would step

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.759
out just like that, coming back and forth.
This is a little bit slow right now so it

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.210
seems like it is a little you know kind of
boring or anything like that but you know

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.550
as we speed up you are going to start seeing
where the moves actually go. So as you can

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.420
see me I'm teaching very slowly and now as
I'm speeding up it is really kind of easy

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.720
to do. As you can see you can see that hokey
poky thing you know put your right leg in,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.740
put your right leg out, right leg in, left
leg out you do the hokey poky but don't spin

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.080
around. So very easily I turn side ways so
you can see this I'm on the tip of my toes

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.770
the whole time you don't hear me clucking
around, no body you don't hear a big sound

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:26.630
on the floor or anything like that. You know
your right corner here and you are going backwards

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:34.480
yo can see the back of my shoe this is a very
good thing for like side, left side here,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.630
back and forth and back to the front.
