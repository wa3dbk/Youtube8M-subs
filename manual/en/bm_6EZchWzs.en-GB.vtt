I look like a new me, I’ve tried on lots of different items of clothing that I would never have chosen for myself, it’s given me whole, vast range of new choices for me when I go shopping, it’s great

00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:38.500
Well since I’ve lost weight with LighterLife I just feel so much more confident, physically, mentally, spiritually, just feel lighter

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:46.500
I smile more, I’m just a happier person, I just feel lovely, it’s been a real make over of my life.

00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:57.500
My story began when I was a little girl, I’ve always had weight issues, I’ve always been very fit but I’ve always been aware that I’ve been the biggest girl in my social environment

00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:10.500
And it’s never really been a problem until I had my son. I was forty-three, I realised that if I didn’t do something about my weight, I wasn’t going to see my grandchildren. 

00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:17.500
I wasn’t going to see my son grow up, I wasn’t going to see him get married and I want to be around for a little bit longer so I had to do something

00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:26.500
At my biggest, I felt dark, down, unnecessary, I didn’t look after myself because I didn’t think I was worth it

00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:35.500
I think I’d always over-eat, my whole life revolved around food, I have always been an emotional eater and it’s a big comfort thing

00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:44.500
When I was a little girl I was always given food to make me feel better and it’s a learned habit but like every habit it can be unlearned, I’m still learning

00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:51.500
When you’re vulnerable in life, when you’re tired, when some things aren’t going right, when you’re not happy, that’s what leads me to over-eat

00:01:52.501 --> 00:02:02.500
The group work helped me because I realised that actually, you’re not on your own when you try to shove food down your throat because you’re feeling so bad

00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:10.500
Everybody understands that, it’s nice to know that somebody else is there for me and could go ‘yeah I’ve been there, I know that’

00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:20.500
LighterLife was right for me because you could see results quickly, which make you want to continue, it enforced the diet.

00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:28.500
I would step on the scales and see a weight loss and it spurred me on because I wanted to do it again the following week

00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:35.500
It was very easy to do for me, if I hadn’t have joined LighterLife, I wouldn’t have had a future, I feel I’ve got a future now

00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:42.500
I can be a better parent, I can be a better partner, I can be a happier person, a better person

00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:55.500
I lost five stone with LighterLife and when I reached my goal weight, I felt phenomenal, great, I haven’t the words to express how great it feels
