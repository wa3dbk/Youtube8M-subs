Adobe Photoshop is a registered trademark
of Adobe Systems Incorporated. I am in no

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:13.110
way affiliated with Adobe. Hi, I'm Steve Anthony.
I'm a digital and re-touching artist here

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.820
in New York City. In this clip, we're going
to talk about how to edit photo's in Photoshop.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.070
Now, editing pictures in Photoshop, involves
many different aspects. We're going to cover,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.800
just a few of them in this particular instance.
I've opened a picture here, for some editing.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:41.000
The most basic thing you might want to do,
excuse me, is, is change your levels. Now,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.649
there's, the best way to do that is to go
into Image, Adjustments, and just click on

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.329
Auto Levels. Now, in this case, it lightened
the picture a little bit, and punched up the

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.469
contrast a tiny bit. T hat might be all you
need to do. That might do it for your picture.

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.430
But, let's say you want to go a little bit
further. You say, well, I'd like to make the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:09.609
picture a little bit more intense. So, let's
go to, let's go to a, Curves. Now, what Curves

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:18.329
allows you to do, is by changing the shape
of this line, change the brightness and contrast

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:25.979
levels of your picture. In most cases, a very
gentle S curve is all you're ever going to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.919
need. But, this is the best way to adjust
your brightness and contrast with Photoshop.

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:38.939
Because it doesn't actually discard any image
information. Whereas, using the brightness

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:48.630
and contrast settings, which I'll show you
right now. Now, this is probably easier. Adjust

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.009
your brightness and contrast with these sliders,
but most professionals prefer to use the Curves

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.509
adjustment. Because it actually allows you
to make changes without discarding any of

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.779
the information in the picture itself. But,
if you're comfortable, more comfortable with

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:15.110
the Brightness and Contrast Tools, by all
means, use them. Another useful tool for editing,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.620
is Hue and Saturation. You might find that
your color's a little bit too intense, using

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.970
your Saturation slider, bring it down. You
can actually make it a black and white picture

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.909
by doing "tha", going all the way, at minus
one hundred. But you might want to punch up

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:37.500
the color a little bit. Give it a more, sort
of a vintage slide look. It's, and the hue,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.470
just change, that's, you can do some scary,
special effects with your color settings.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.829
I don't recommend that for my face, but some
of you might find that interesting. Maybe

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:55.040
that's too intense, so OK. As you can see,
there's many, many different ways to edit

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.379
pictures in Photoshop. I encourage you to
play around, and find the way that's most

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.519
comfortable for you. There are immense and
very, very versatile tools, at your disposal,

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.909
in Photoshop. I'm Steve Anthony, and this
has been, How to Edit Pictures in Photoshop.
