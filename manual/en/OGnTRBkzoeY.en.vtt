[Chris] Hi I’m Chris from OneCall and I’ll
be talking about the Mitsubishi L75-A91 LaserVue

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:23.500
HDTV which features a full 1080p resolution,
and a 75-inch screen as shown here. One of

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.000
the things I really like about this laser
TV is the exclusive laser light engine it

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.820
uses actual laser beams inside to give you
the purest light source available and because

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.860
of that laser light engine you get twice the
amount of color. If you imagine the most expensive

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.001
high end TV out there on the plasma or LCD,
this TV has twice as much color. The laser

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:51.269
light engine also gives you much better hues,
contrast in skin tones which in the end gives

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.159
you a much better picture. This TV is also
3D ready and features a built in emitter for

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:03.899
the active 3D glasses. Keep in mind to enjoy
3D you need 3 main components; you need the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:12.020
3D television, 3D glasses and also a 3D source
like a 3D cable box, 3D satellite box, or

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.180
a 3D blu-ray player. This TV also features
the Stream Internet TV media; this allows

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.420
you to stream movies directly to the TV. It
has the 6 color processor built in, and that

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.290
will allow you to individually adjust the
6 primary colors. And the auto sensing audio/video

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.780
connections allows you to plug in a device
such as a 3D blu-ray player and the TV will

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.140
ask you what you plugged in so you can properly
name it. Keep in mind when you buy a 3DTV

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.150
you are also buying the very best 2D picture
technology as well. Thanks for watching this
