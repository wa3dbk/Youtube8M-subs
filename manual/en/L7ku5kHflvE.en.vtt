00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.380
Hi I'm Mat from eSpares.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.160
In this video we're going to be looking
at detergent dispenser problems in

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.210
washing machines.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.250
There are a number of common problems
that can occur with the detergent

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.860
dispensers

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.410
in washing machines.
Most to these can be avoided with a little regular

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.919
maintenance.
Safety first, always unplug the appliance before carrying out

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.960
any work.
Now I have unscrewed the top so I am just 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.960
going to take the top off for easier access.
And here we have

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.519
the detergent dispenser and soap drawer.

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.710
Now the soap draw is split into three
compartments

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.109
The pre-wash compartment which has its
own solenoid valve.

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.899
The main wash compartment which is also
fed by a valve.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.100
The condition or fabric softener
compartment

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.999
which is fed by both valves.
One of the common problems

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:06.030
with the soap draw and the conditioner
compartment is the condition not

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.140
syphoning away.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.409
This could be due to old condition or
'gunk'

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.409
stuck in the syphon like this one.
Very easy to clean

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.020
just give this is a wash in the sink.
And a good way to test it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.090
is to put together

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.200
fill it up with water it should then
naturally drain

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.700
from underneath.
If you could not a good wash

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.320
and it's still not syphoning away it
could be that there's a problem with the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.909
jets

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.420
inside the detergent draw housing.
Using a new

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.640
detergent drawer cover,
If I just flip that over

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.939
you can see the Jets that feed the
pre-wash compartment,

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.200
the main wash compartment
and just the one jet the feeds

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.170
the conditioner compartment. And the
conditioner compartment is only fed when

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.070
both valves

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.210
a filling both the pre-wash and the main
wash compartments.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.689
So the water pressure going to the
condition jet is much less.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.470
Now I can give it a good clean using a
brush

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.190
on the inside of the detergent drawer housing.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.710
But if that doesn't work it's likely you
going to have to change the top dispenser

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.370
drawer,

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.610
I'll show you how. In order to get the
dispenser drawer housing

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.350
the first thing I need to do is to
remove the control panel easy enough to

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.770
do

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.330
under these two screws at the top and
these three screws

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.330
in front to the soap drawer.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.710
Once the screws are out you just need to
release the two clips at

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:50.710
the back to release the whole control panel.
to the washing machine.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.530
Once the control panel is free, 
you just need to release these two

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.530
electrical connectors to the valves.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.000
With the electrical connectors out of place
I just need to undo the screw the back

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.310
which holds the valves to the body of  the
machine.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.610
With the screw at the back out we just
need to release the dispencer drawer

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.300
from the tub filler hose.
This is just connected by a

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.489
elasticated loop,
undo that

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.909
and feed the hose of the pipe.

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.400
You can then spin

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.640
the dispenser drawer 
which frees it from the machine.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.670
Once the dispenser assemblies is out I just
need to

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.739
unclip the soap dispenser body

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:56.739
via these clips here.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.040
And if I bring in the new dispenser
drawer top

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.500
you can clearly see the difference the
effectiveness

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.540
of these jets is affected by mould.
Now I need to do

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.840
is to fit the soap draw housing and
these valves

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.840
onto the new dispenser drawer top.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.090
When you put the valves on the new
dispenser housing

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:40.090
remember to take the seals with it.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.639
You can then put the dispenser housing
back into the machine.

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.960
reconnecting the tub filler hose
screwing the valves back to the body of the

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.520
machine.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.440
and reconnecting the electrical connectors.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.300
Reattach the control panel

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.330
making sure that the soap drawer locks
into place nicely.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.570
You can then screw it back together.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.919
And there we have it one new dispenser
drawer top fitted to this Indesit

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:21.849
washing machine.

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.789
Dispenser drawer tops and all other
spares and accessories for washing

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:26.360
machines and other appliances

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.139
can be found on the espares.co.uk website.
Thanks for watching.
