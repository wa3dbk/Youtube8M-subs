Hi! My name is Scott Reil and on behalf of
expertvillage.com I will like to talk to you

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.090
about vegetable gardening. No matter how good
of a gardener you are eventually you are going

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.040
to come up against garden pests of some kind.
This is year for me it looks like the problems

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.650
are going to start with cucumbers. Now I have
planted my cucumbers out. The rest of the

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.529
row looks pretty healthy but I have started
to see some issues with these two plants down

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.480
here. The first thing that I started to see
was somebody have been chewing through the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.810
base of these guys. It started to get wilty
it still has not died back yet but it is not

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.750
very healthy the way it is connected there.
Who do I suspect on that level? That's probably

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.000
slugs. What can you do to keep slugs away?
A good way to keep them out is Diatomaceous

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.350
earth it is a product that you can find in
any pull supply store and often in a lot of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.160
good garden centers. It is all natural, it
adds calcium to your soil and slugs hate it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.320
they won't cross it. Just put a little thin
ring of Diatomaceous earth around your plant

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.930
that would help it keep it away from it. The
other problem I started to notice is the leaves

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.990
are being skeletonized here well that is not
slugs that is somebody else. I suspect vine

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.740
weevil but it could be any number of things,
so what is a boy to do? Well in this case

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.130
I'm probably going to apply something called
Bacillus thuringiensis . It is a bacteria

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.400
that you could actually populate on your leaf.
It is perfectly harmless to you but to any

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.590
animal on the insect side that is eating this
if I get the right BT and you do have to ask

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.520
the people in your garden center when you
are buying the BT. You don't want the stuff

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.840
called israelensis. That is for mosquitoes.
You want one that is specifically for beetles.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.170
It is going to go along way to help knock
him back, who ever is chewing on this. Now

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.380
there is a lot of other different kind of
garden pest rather than the insect variety

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.870
and I know a lot of people have trouble with
the before I get varieties many deer, woodchucks,

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.990
rabbits, there is more and more products coming
available on the market all the time but nothing

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.700
bets a good fence. You fence remember should
extend a little bit to the ground 7-8 inches

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.560
to make sure digging animals cant get underneath
it and in the case of deer it should extend

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.350
at least 6-8 feet in the air because otherwise
they would hop right over it. The best thing

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.120
to do if you run in across pest in the garden
use your state cooperative extension service

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.890
or the folks down in your friendly garden
center who are going to help you identify

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.560
your insect problem or your pest problem and
give you a good way to handle it.
