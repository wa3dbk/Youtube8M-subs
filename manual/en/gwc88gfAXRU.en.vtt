Hi, I'm Kari Byron from
Discovery Channel's MythBusters.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.660
Now, usually I'm getting really dirty--
bomb range, gun range, eating bugs.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.680
But today I get to get in
touch with my girly side.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.900
I'm partnering with Pantene so
I can get the truth behind some

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.250
of the biggest hair urban legends.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.860
We all know that feeling,
a freshly washed head

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.505
of hair blowing in the breeze.

00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:31.240
It's clean.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.610
It's beautiful, and it gives
you that certain something.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.030
Why this is no poo craze
all anyone's talking about?

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.960
Is washing your hair every
day really bad for your hair?

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.160
So I checked in with my fellow
science geeks over at Pantene

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.080
to delve deeper into
this hair urban legend.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.620
It turns out that clean hair is about
overall health from root to tip.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.390
Washing your hair is actually necessary
to remove unwanted buildup, oil,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.940
environmental pollutants, and styling
products that can build up on your hair

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.620
and leave it looking really just dull.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.050
You know how when you're walking around
outside and stuff flies into your eyes?

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.710
All that stuff is also
building up on your hair.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.290
One of the biggest discoveries
that Pantene has recently made

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.380
is that copper can build up on your
hair, leading to daily oxidative

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.410
damage.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.220
Think of an apple that when
you cut it, it turns brown.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.130
Now, this is an example of oxidation.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.270
You may not realize this, but
copper is an essential mineral

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.100
for the body's overall health.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.640
However Pantene uncovered that
copper can build up on hair

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.640
and wreak havoc through oxidizing and
breaking down hair's proteins, which

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.110
weakens the hair's fiber over time.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.750
And in fact, severely
damaged hair actually

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.430
absorbs more copper, thus
amplifying this damage.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.340
With this discovery, Pantene
created a new formula

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.990
to help combat and
prevent oxidative damage.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.790
Check back for my next video
where I uncover the truth

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.590
behind more hair urban legends.
