bjbj Manly Makeup Video 4 Hi. Emily Marie
back here, showing you all the tips and tricks

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.750
about how to use makeup for men. In a lot
of different scenarios, you re going to want

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.740
to use blush. You want to use a really bright
colored blush if you re going to be on stage

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.050
especially if you re going to be in a theatrical
type of play or something of that nature.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.919
But for today, for right now, we re building
our male model and using colors for a nice,

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:41.030
neutral look for say sportscaster, newscaster.
All right. So if you have fair skin like I

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.300
do, you re going to want to use a more pink
shade. For the olive skin tone, today, we

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.469
re going to try to use a nice neutral shade
and it s a little bit more peachy in color

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.870
for our model here and this matches already.
As you can see, you can probably tell in the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.360
camera here that it is matching his natural
lip color and that s kind of what you want

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.160
to go for is matching your natural lip color
to the blush if you want a neutral look. re

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.680
also going to need a blush brush and I told
you about these earlier. You want something

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.070
that has got a nice oblong, circular head
and basically it s super easy. You re going

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.530
to put a little bit of makeup on the end of
your brush so it s going to look like that.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.630
But then you want to tap it off on your hand
or on a paper towel just to get the excess

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:41.840
off. Then you re going to make a C shape on
the cheek here. Just make a C shape just like

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.530
this and deposit a little bit of color. You
don t want too much. You don t want too little.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:02:00.300
You just want to make yourself look like you
re awake. He now looks like he has got a little

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.760
bit of color. He s awake for the day. Awesome.
So that s how you apply blush. PAGE \* MERGEFORMAT
