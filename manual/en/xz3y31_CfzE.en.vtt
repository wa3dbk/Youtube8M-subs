00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.690
Perhaps more so than any other, the Chrysler
Group loves to produce limited edition model.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.690
Take this Charger R/T Road &amp; Track, for example.
For an additional $2,500 you can be 1 of only

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.300
3,000 to own a 2013 Charger Daytona.
Introduced at the 2012 L.A. Auto Show, the

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.640
return of the 'winged warrior' has been limited
to 2,500 copies in the U.S. this go around

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.160
after having been offered for 4 consecutive
years from 2006 -- 2009. And while we were

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.920
out for a drive, we encountered this vintage
1993 example -- which has apparently seen

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.510
better days.
My striking Daytona Blue example is 1 of 4

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.489
unique color choices and comes with this cool
matching engine cover, a Satin Black crosshair

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.489
grille with heritage R/T badge, a custom vinyl
hood graphic, roof warp, rear R/T spoiler

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.530
and the "Daytona" graphic on the rear quarter
panels. There are also black, performance

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.850
Nappa leather heated and cooled seats with
blue stitching and piping, somewhat strange

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.850
looking dark, brushed aluminum trim surrounds,
a Mopar bright pedal kit and a 552-watt 10-speaker

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:27.310
Beats Audio System with a subwoofer. And to
put it in the history books, there's a special

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.689
numbered badge on the dash with your Daytona
build number.

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.840
Whether you start with the Charger R/T or
R/T Road &amp; track, if you're going Daytona

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.840
you've got to spend the extra $400 for the
Super Track Pak. It includes these sticky

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:49.939
20" Goodyear Eagle F1 performance tires, a
3-mode ESC system with full off mode, beefed

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.770
up brakes, performance steering and sport
suspension with larger sway bars. It sounds

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.729
hardcore but in reality never ruins the Charger's
excellent, everyday drivability.

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.729
What the Daytona does very well is allow for
the 5.7-liter HEMI V8 to fully demonstrate

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.950
its might. With a more aggressive SRT-derived
3.06 rear axle, high speed engine controller

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:21.519
and paddle shifters with sport mode for the
5-speed auto, this car is a blast to drive

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:28.519
-- especially considering its large footprint.
Its 370 horsepower and 395 pound feet of torque

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:35.739
are instantly on tap for lively acceleration
and all kinds of burnout fun. A zero to-60mph

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.480
time in the low 5s awaits.
You know, its' everything that's different

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.150
about the Charger that makes it great. It's
big, it's American, it's rear-wheel drive,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.799
it's V8 powered and even with the sport suspension
the ride is incredibly comfortable and the

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.540
handling is impressive.
It's also a car that is incredibly modern

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.290
and well equipped. My tester adds the Driver
Confidence Group with all of today's driver

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.189
assistance features, the best touchscreen
in the biz with this 8.4" UConnect system

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:14.540
and creature comforts such as a heated steering
wheel, heated seats all around and cooled

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.019
in the front, heated and cooled cupholders,
memory settings, etc. It feels quality-driven

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:28.019
and very fresh with lots of room to spare.
My loaded Charger Daytona comes in at $41,645

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.819
and returns gas mileage of 16mpg city/25 mpg
highway. And before you think it's too late,

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:42.999
as of air time dealer inventories still show
some in stock.
