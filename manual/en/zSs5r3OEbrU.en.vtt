00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.440
Hi! Welcome to The Silver Spleen.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.860
My name is Leon Russell and this is my review of

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.440
THE WHITE HAIRED WITCH OF LUNAR KINGDOM.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.020
Let's get the obvious out of the way first:

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.340
this is a version of the same story used for

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.140
THE BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.020
Y'know, that movie with Brigitte Lin and Leslie Cheung.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.480
It's easy to say that this new movie cannot

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.780
compare to the old one,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.760
but it's also really not a very fair comparison to make.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.320
THE BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.720
is an iconic movie that stars two iconic people

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.500
THE WHITE HAIRED WITCH OF LUNAR KINGDOM

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.020
is an interesting movie;

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.100
the version I saw was in 2-D, which is fine with me.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.480
If you watch the trailer you'll see that there are

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.900
'3-D shots.'

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.780
Like this:

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.240
Ooohhh...

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.360
Aaaahhhhh...

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.800
I really don't care much for 3-D.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.020
Or U2.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.540
But I digress.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.800
The plot isn't so much convoluted as it is illogical.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.260
Well, maybe the plot isn't convoluted ,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.440
but the people's behavior in the plot certainly is.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.180
"No one will ever be allowed here!"

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.920
"No one!"

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.760
"No one, not ever! Never!"

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.000
"I just met these people, they seem nice,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.760
can they come in?"

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.640
"Sure!"

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.960
"Hey, what are these people doing in here?"

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.520
What do you think they're doing?

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.240
The story doesn't hold up to any kind of logical scrutiny,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.660
but then again neither do most of my life choices,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.700
so I'm really not in a position to talk

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.780
This movie is another one in a growing list of films

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.580
that suffer from the same problem.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.680
I usually use a cooking metaphor:

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.180
this movie has a lot of really good ingredients

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.620
and a lousy recipe.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.440
Jacob Chung, the director,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.020
has done some pretty good movies:

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.340
1992's CAGEMAN, an excellent film,

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.520
and  1997's INTIMATES, also a really good film.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.700
But he also directed BATTLE OF WITS.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.320
It's obvious that there was a budget for this film,

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.900
and that they spent some money on it.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.640
A lot of it is really beautiful.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.780
Now, when you have Tsui Hark on board

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.160
as an artistic consultant,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.700
that's kinda to be expected.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.740
But it's also obvious that some money

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.640
wasn't spent on this movie.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.740
Some parts of the film are very obviously sporting

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.820
cut corners,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.540
some of the sets look really, really nice,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.400
and some others... don't.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.020
The execution of the story,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.140
both technically and narratively,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.680
is often pretty good,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.660
but there are times when it falls flat.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.040
Huang Xiaoming and Fan Bingbing really don't

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.660
have any chemistry together.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.040
I admit it may be hard to feel

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.920
romantic in a scene with a woman who looks like this:

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.180
Elijah Muhammad warned us about the blue-eyed devils!

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.920
It's also difficult when you're obviously not

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.240
doing what you want the audience to think you're doing:

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.500
Ummm... That's her navel.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.380
Ahh, that's better... isn't it?

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.927
And I can't really say that Huang Xiaoming wasn't

00:03:10.927 --> 00:03:14.600
trying very hard in this movie, because he was.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.340
While filming

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.760
THE WHITE HAIRED WITCH OF LUNAR KINGDOM,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.400
lead actor Huang Xiaoming was injured

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.500
when he slipped on this Tyvek coat.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.600
His recovery was aided by an environment

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.300
as visually tasteless as the coat that injured him.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.640
Most of the time Fan Bingbing was very good in her role.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.980
It's a tough role to play, partially because

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.380
Brigitte Lin did it before,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.140
and partially because of

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.380
the way she had to look and act for a lot of it.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.720
but more often than not,

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.660
I felt like she was convincing and even engaging

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.680
Now, her action scenes were... obviously doubled,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.320
but I felt that a lot of the dramatic work she did

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.080
just with her facial expressions was pretty admirable

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.200
It was a strange thing,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.660
I noticed at least two different shots in the movie

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.640
that were just unflattering.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.460
I don't mean that she didn't look pretty,

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.520
I mean she looked... weird.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.245
The overall look of the white-haired witch

00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:01.140
gets an update,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.340
thanks in part to the magic of computers.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.560
We see her hair turning white,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.380
but to be honest it's pretty obviously CGI,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.480
and her eyebrows stayed black so I guess it's not a...

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.380
total... transformation.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.500
Her outfits also get an update,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.580
and at times I think it was a little too modern.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.800
She ended up sometimes looking like a

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.320
over-styled goth from some Japanese anime.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.360
Then again,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.520
maybe that was part of what made her a witch,

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.980
because Japan is evil!

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.280
Speaking of politics, this version of the story

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.620
apparently uses a lot of elements

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.900
that are in the original but were left out of

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.140
THE BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.540
Many of these elements are political and reflect

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.560
the time in which the story is set.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.580
They can also be seen as reflecting the present time,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.120
too, and I'm not sure if they're supposed to or not.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.620
There are things in there about

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.300
sacrificing oneself for the good of the country,

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.720
and about forgiving soldiers who killed a lot of people.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.160
As many faults as I might find with this movie,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.680
there were things I liked about it.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.260
Right before the big romantic interlude

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.940
Huang Xiaoming drops a torch

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.900
so that he can embrace Fan Bingbing.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.560
The torch hits the floor, y'know, out of frame,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.200
but it makes this really loud... noise.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.220
It seems weird but only because it's realistic;

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.120
if you drop the torch onto a stone floor

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.260
that's what it would sound like.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.300
But it was kind of a disruption,

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.140
and that's really emblematic of my impressions about

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.840
THE WHITE HARIED WITCH OF LUNAR KINGDOM.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.660
Too many contradictions, distractions, and...

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.140
missed opportunities.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.940
I didn't dislike the movie,

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.980
but I wish I could like it more than I did.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.280
This film opens at the end of the month in cinemas,

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.920
so if you have a chance to see it,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.300
I would recommend that you do.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.580
It's a lot of fun to look at,

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.500
and if nothing else, you can watch it

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.360
and then compare it to the older versions.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.100
If you don't see it in the cinema,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.920
wait until it comes out on home video and buy it.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.480
When it's released to home video,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.574
I'll update the description with a link

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.520
where you could do just that.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.860
