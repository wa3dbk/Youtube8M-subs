00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.450
SCOTT BROWDER: Now we're going to talk about
hitting a shot from in close say the--your

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.460
opponent hits the ball up, rarely gets over
the net or it ticks the net and drops over

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.140
which is still in play as we know, we're going
to have a difficult shot especially if we're

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.080
hanging back in our normal position and our
ready position, we're going to have to really

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.680
make a quick move without banging our legs
on the table or getting hurt in the process.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.870
So the ball, basically all you going to be
thinking about is trying to get--if you guys

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.870
hit a really good drop shot that barely gets
over the net of like I said if it ticks the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.390
net and you haven't did a last second defensive
shot, what your idea is just to get the ball

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.999
over the net. So the way that I usually accomplish
it is you have to be focused, keep your eyes

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:59.550
on the ball and get a good jump right as you
know, as soon as you know that the ball is

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.340
going to be a short shot, you have to react
as quickly as possible and I usually just,

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.470
if I'm in the ready position, I'm turning,
I'm lunging in and maybe I'm hitting a little

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.960
bit of under spin with a shot but I'm just
trying to place it maybe in a corner or just

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.590
to get the ball barely over the net, if the
guy--if your opponent is on one side of the

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.140
table or other, obviously you're going to
try to go on the other side, I don't think

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.530
I would want to try to hit the ball too deep
because chances are you're going to pop it

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.930
up and he's going to slam it down your throat
at that point, what I use to do like I said

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.260
is just to drop the ball over the net, come
up quickly, maybe put a little under spin

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.030
on or you can hit with a little bit of top
spin, just rolling your wrist over and trying

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.730
to get the ball back in play. So we're going
to go ahead and give that a try right now.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:02:00.710
So as you see, you can chop away the ball
and actually even though it is a defensive

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.480
shot, you can get some good results offensively
if you put enough of a little of a slice on

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.739
it and angle it at the same time and basically
like I said you just try to keep the ball

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.659
in play and if the guy--your opponent is in
bad position on his side of the net, then

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.989
you can take advantage of it but most of the
time it's just going to be a defensive shot

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:24.939
from the standpoint.
