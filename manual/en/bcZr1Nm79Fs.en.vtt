00:00:01.765 --> 00:00:04.528
What do we mean when we talk about animal testing and REACH

00:00:05.178 --> 00:00:12.720
If you are a company manufacturing or importing chemicals into 
 Europe, under the REACH legislation you have new responsibilities.

00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:22.105
You must register each of your ingredients with the REACH authority, which is 
 called the European Chemicals Agency, who have their headquarters in Helsinki. 

00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:30.697
Whether it’s an old fashioned ingredient used for generations, or 
 a brand new ingredient you’re currently inventing 

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:36.270
all must be registered and a series of safety data about that material supplied.

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:43.421
So let’s take a completely imaginary example to show how it works.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:54.440
So for example you are a manufacturer of Vanillin, which is the artificial vanilla that we are 
 all used to tasting in lots of our foods and smelling in perfumes every day.

00:00:55.681 --> 00:01:00.395
You have to register with the Agency and say you are a vanillin manufacturer.

00:01:01.092 --> 00:01:09.822
The Agency then sees how many companies have registered that ingredient and 
 organises them into a group called a SIEF.   

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.886
This stands for Substance Information Exchange Forum.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.782
On your Vanillin SIEF there might be huge companies, 
 some of them might be smaller, 

00:01:21.572 --> 00:01:27.480
one might even be even be a completely animal 
 testing free company who already sell to Lush.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:36.502
This group is then responsible for supplying a dossier of all the 
 safety data that the REACH legislation requires for that ingredient.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.440
You are expected to pool all the data that you all have 
 and make sure you have everything needed for the dossier.

00:01:43.863 --> 00:01:48.830
If you find there are gaps in the data, 
 together you are expected to fill these gaps.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.600
So let’s say for Vanillin no one on your SIEF has data for maybe

00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:57.020
Температура плавления

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.100
Melting Temperature

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.000
Flashpoint or Flammability

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.250
Eye Irritation

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.130
So together now you have to decide how to find that data elsewhere, 

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:11.630
if you couldn’t find it elsewhere how are you 
 going to test for those things. 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.110
If you are going to test who is going to pay for it 
 and who is going to do the testing for the group.

00:02:18.112 --> 00:02:26.870
It could be that all of you pay a little bit towards it, it could be 
 that one of the companies agrees to do the testing and bear the costs 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.020
but each SIEF will discuss that and debate it 
 and come up with their own arrangements.

00:02:32.578 --> 00:02:40.730
So you can get the Melting Temperature tests done in a laboratory 
 in test tubes.  Same with Flash Point and Flammability.

00:02:41.216 --> 00:02:44.720
But Eye Irritation data, that’s a little more tricky.  

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:52.010
That could very likely lead to having to test on animals, 
 because there is currently no complete alternative available.  

00:02:53.941 --> 00:03:02.370
So your SIEF would have to apply to the European Chemical Agency, telling 
 them that you need to conduct animal tests to complete the dossier.

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:06.150
That’s is why Lush is worried about REACH.  

00:03:06.154 --> 00:03:10.520
Our suppliers might end up on a SIEF 
 that has to animal test.  

00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:18.360
Because of our strict animal testing policy, all of Lush’s suppliers 
 over the years have been completely free of animal testing.

00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:25.170
Our policy says we wont buy from any supplier, who tests 
 any ingredient for any reason on animals.  

00:03:25.682 --> 00:03:30.320
REACH means that our suppliers who were previously committed to no animal testing 

00:03:30.721 --> 00:03:38.640
could suddenly find themselves required by law to be party to 
 testing via their SIEF in order to complete their dossier.

00:03:40.102 --> 00:03:42.420
And that makes us weep.  

00:03:42.424 --> 00:03:47.560
To be honest, after 17 years of running a 
 cruelty free business,
It makes us angry.  

00:03:49.436 --> 00:03:56.310
Laws should exist to guide people to do the right thing, not 
 force them to do something so very, very wrong.  

00:03:57.215 --> 00:04:00.540
Lush will never be comfortable with the REACH legislation 

00:04:00.536 --> 00:04:05.300
until all animal testing is removed from it.
