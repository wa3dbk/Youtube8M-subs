00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.360
It's time to replace another section of the exhaust

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.140
the front one's not bad

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.180
but this middle one

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.800
it's starting to corrode

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.640
and there's a line of holes here

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.840
and it's getting thin the pipe

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.900
it's not worth repairing

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.960
we'll replace that

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.440
otherwise it will just need it before the next MOT anyway

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.060
and the back one

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.200
that's not too bad, we'll put that one back as well.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.940
and that's that one

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.580
now that I have undone the clamps

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.980
what I have done is, I have just put an axle stand

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.300
under the front exhaust because otherwise

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.600
when we pull the middle and back one off

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.600
there's nothing to hold it up!

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.500
So now it's just a case of lifting these off at the bungs

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.500
and taking it out the rear

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.920
Now the hard part removing the bungs!

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.260
one at the back and two at the front

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.560
and then waggle that a little

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.440
and we should be able to get that back one out

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.700
that's that one out

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:25.223
and then with the back one out this one should come off a bit easier

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.100
that's that one off

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.940
nobody said it was going to be easy!

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.260
That was good timing

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.460
because while we were doing that

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.800
the middle section and two new clamps have arrived!

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.980
There's the holes on the old exhaust.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.220
Put some exhaust paste on there.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.160
Just to help it go on easier and then to give it a good seal.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.640
Waggle that back on a bit

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.820
then just support that exhaust and then we can join the next one on

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.240
and then the same again with this section

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.860
paste on to the exhaust

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.180
before joining the other one on to it

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.061
we've already got the clamp in place there

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.680
and then that will set with the heat of the exhaust when it needs to

00:06:01.963 --> 00:06:03.243
try that on to there

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.720
that's it, straight on

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.400
a little wiggle

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.820
and then all we've got to do

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.000
is get the bungs back on

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.080
and we're done

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.160
I've put the back rubber hanger on

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.920
that helped assist putting the two difficult ones on

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.740
and now just got to tighten up the clamps

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.560
and we're done.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.160
That's it all clamped up

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.940
all we've got to do now is start it up and check for any leaks
