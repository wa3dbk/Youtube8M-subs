00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.249
[Piano Music]

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:10.249
[Spike Dolomite-Ward Voiceover] My life is
so completely and totally different.

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.990
I feared there, for a while, that 
it would never be the same.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
[Music]

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.779
[Family] God is great. God is good. Thank
you for our food, Amen!

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:24.990
[Spike] I'll take some potatoes.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.630
[Spike] My name is Spike Dolomite-Ward, and
like so many Americans today, I got frustrated

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.180
with what was happening in Washington. 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.180
I was a registered Democrat, and I re-registered

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.670
as an Independent, stopped listening, and
missed some very valuable information.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.800
We have always had health insurance. My husband
had a really great job working for a local

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.440
entertainment company, and when he got laid
off, he decided to go into business for himself.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.769
[David Ward] Paying for our own health insurance
was really expensive. It was over $1,300 a month.

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.609
And then, when the recession hit, we
just couldn’t afford it anymore.

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:07.439
[Spike-VO] The day came when my husband said,
"We can’t pay for health insurance anymore."

00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:12.980
So, it was a hard decision to make, but it
was either that or the mortgage, and we don't

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.200
want to be homeless. And then, the worst possible
thing that could happen, happened.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.350
[Spike-VO] When you get told that you have breast cancer,
and you’re uninsured, there’s no hope for you.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.990
If you have a pre-existing condition, there is
no private health insurance company that's

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.509
going to welcome you aboard and take care of you.
I thought I would just fall right off the

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.891
face of the earth. And then just being haunted
by the fact that I could actually die

00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:44.369
and leave my kids too soon.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.990
[Daughter] Bye, Mom.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.103
[Spike] Bye, baby.  I love you.

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.990
[Spike-VO] What’s available to middle-class Americans
who are uninsured and have a catastrophic illness?

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.310
One of my dear friends who discovered
the Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP).

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.910
Ten days after applying, I had health insurance
and I'm in treatment for stage 3 breast cancer.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.680
It’s been the smoothest experience I’ve
ever had with any health insurance company.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.860
With PCIP under the Affordable Care Act, anybody
with a pre-existing condition qualifies for

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.790
health care.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.640
[David] Getting covered gave me some hope,
you know, that we can get through this in one piece.

00:02:30.504 --> 00:02:34.070
[Spike-VO] And, I pay premiums just like
everybody else with insurance.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.070
It’s not a government hand-out. 

00:02:39.212 --> 00:02:44.640
I criticized the Affordable Care Act, 
and the very thing that I criticized

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.640
is what is going to save my life. 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.170
Because President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act,

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.774
I get to keep my house. I won’t go
bankrupt. My kids are going to go to college.

00:02:58.774 --> 00:02:59.750
And I’m going to live.

00:03:00.248 --> 00:03:06.100
