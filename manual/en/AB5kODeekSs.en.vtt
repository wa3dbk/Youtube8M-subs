00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.500
The flyPhone is so much more than just a new product.

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:16.901
We even created a completely new way of communication.

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:20.002
And we call it “SmallTalk”.

00:00:21.403 --> 00:00:26.503
It will change the way of our communication, forever! 

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:35.204
When I first used the flyPhone I was blown away by it. I was like “wow”!

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:38.505
I could actually hear the people I was talking to…

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:43.506
and smell their bad breath. Everything was so… real!

00:00:44.507 --> 00:00:50.507
Everytime I use SmallTalk I can’t believe that all of this is really happening! 

00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:57.208
With the new flyPhone there are so many new ways of how to kill your time. 

00:00:57.209 --> 00:01:03.209
You can sit in the park and read a book.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.210
And it feels like an actual book!

00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:12.211
It’s like you’re reaching through the screen into the book to turn over the page. 

00:01:13.212 --> 00:01:18.212
For the new flyPhone we wanted a new photo- and videoapplication.

00:01:18.213 --> 00:01:25.113
And to stand out from the masses of smartphones and develop a new innovative technique.

00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:36.014
Our view through this hyper-mega- wicked phone is that real that it actually IS reality!

00:01:37.015 --> 00:01:41.515
For people who are interested in videos there’s the video app.

00:01:41.516 --> 00:01:49.516
But it isn’t necessary! Cause with the flyPhone you ARE the reality! 

00:01:50.517 --> 00:01:55.517
A lot of people complained about the email app, cause it was so impersonal. 

00:01:55.518 --> 00:02:00.018
With our new flyPhone it all seems so real!

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:03.419
It’s as if you’re writing the letter with your own hands! 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.520
And if you send out the message it’s like a flash.

00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:11.521
It’s like your partner is immediately receiving your letter.

00:02:11.522 --> 00:02:17.722
It’s unbelievable! It’s even that real, as if you were delivering the mail yourself. 

00:02:17.723 --> 00:02:22.923
With the map app for the flyPhone you’ll never get lost again. 

00:02:22.924 --> 00:02:28.724
It’s amazing. Doesn’t matter if you wanna go to the next supermarket or just find out where you can grab something to eat.

00:02:28.725 --> 00:02:32.725
Everything’s possible! And you’ll always find your way.

00:02:34.426 --> 00:02:36.126
… Well, she’s a woman! 

00:02:36.127 --> 00:02:40.027
The usual smartphone games are too boring.

00:02:40.028 --> 00:02:42.228
Our new flyPhone-Games are not!

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:50.229
It’s like you’re diving into the game! It’s so real, you’ll merge with the character in the game. 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.030
Even the beer app is compatible with the flyPhone.

00:02:54.031 --> 00:03:01.031
It’s more than that, it IS beer! And it’s even getting me drunk! 

00:03:01.932 --> 00:03:08.032
There’s a new build-in light, which was specially designed for us. You’ll find everything with it’s help.

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:14.433
It’s so unbelievable and real! You turn on the light and you’ll merge with the flame! 

00:03:15.534 --> 00:03:23.134
The flyPhone has a very elegant design and is easy to use. But there’s brilliant technique behind all of this.

00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:28.035
The basic module is the D4-Chip.

00:03:28.036 --> 00:03:36.436
It was designed and precisely inserted by the most brilliant brains of this world.

00:03:36.437 --> 00:03:43.437
A lot of people ask us: With this huge chip, where is the battery?

00:03:43.438 --> 00:03:50.438
And this is just unbelievable! The flyPhone doesn’t need a battery! It runs by itself.

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.839
It runs by itself!

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:03.140
The new flyPhone is very solid. Compared to other smartphones the cover is sooo solid

00:04:07.141 --> 00:04:09.141
Well, she’s a woman…

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:07.142
that even the strongest men couldn’t break it.

00:04:09.942 --> 00:04:13.942
All of this really gets you, when you hold your flyPhone in your hands.

00:04:16.143 --> 00:04:17.643
And lick it… 

00:04:17.644 --> 00:04:19.644
oh baby!

00:04:21.645 --> 00:04:22.645
It is SO real!

00:04:24.146 --> 00:04:29.946
A lot of people asked us why the flyPhone is called “flyPhone”.

00:04:31.147 --> 00:04:37.947
The answer is as simple as that: The flyPhone is the first smartphone that can make you fly!

00:04:37.948 --> 00:04:42.248
It sounds impossible, but it’s true! And it’ll make everything so much easier.

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:46.349
You can fly to work or to your friends… or you can….

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.350
....crash-land! We’re still working on it…

00:04:53.851 --> 00:04:57.851
This changes everything.

00:04:57.852 --> 00:04:58.352
Again.
