Hi, this is David from geekanoids.co.uk and after this short break

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.649
I'm going to be bringing you a review of the Wacom intuos

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
four graphics tablet

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.279
Welcome back. This is the Intuos 4 graphics tablet

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.469
It comes in three different sizes and in this review we're looking at the medium size graphics tablet. Now it has an active area

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.290
in this central position here of

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.710
223 by 140 millimetres

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.999
and that's roughly, this is an a4 sheet of paper roughly half of an a4 sheet

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.589
so a good

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.589
area [for] actually working

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.140
on your artwork

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.140
Now these new Intuos 4 tablets have increased sensitivity you're getting

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.739
2048 levels of Pressure Sensitivity

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.490
And there's also tilt sensor sensitivity [too] so with your pen it will actually

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:30.079
Adjust the thickness and the angle of [your] lines if you tilt the pen on the tablet as well

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240
So really really nice

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:39.439
features on this particular tablet now there are eight express keys down the side here [and]

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.179
These have tiny little OLED screens

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.069
Next to the next to the Express keys now they can be customized

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.859
Depending on which application you're in so it will actually show you what the function of each

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.889
Express key is next to it on the little screen, and if you flip the tablet round then the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.409
orientation of the screens

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.670
Rotates as well, so it works for both left, or right-handed users

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.559
So really really well-thought-out and a nice nice addition to these new interests for tablets here. We have a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.850
selection button and a rotation ring here

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.279
And you can create shortcuts on screens of various tools if you're using photoshop for example

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.209
You can rotate round to different tools within the photoshop application. So really really nice

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.370
I'm just going to pop that [down] a

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.929
Second and show you the pen that comes with the tablet you get the pin itself and you also get a holder for the pin

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.869
Which goes in like so on your desk?

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.989
And if you open up this holder it actually contains all of the different nibs that

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.209
[you] can use with the tablet now

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.500
The interest for tablet senses which nib you are using in the tablet

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.959
So if you're using for example the fiber tip pen then it will sense that and give you a different

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.769
experience

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.828
when you're using the the pen on the tablet, so really really

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:14.970
well-thought-out, and

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.649
and again well done wacom for taking things one step further and

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.949
improving the design over previous generations

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:29.149
now prices online start from [200] pound for the small version of this graphics tablet right up to

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:36.649
[430] pounds for the large size which believe me is large and takes up a lot [of] desktop real estate

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.549
Now this medium version. I think is the best buy it's

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.220
330 pounds and

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.470
Increasing the creativity and productivity of your artwork and [the] way in which you work is really really superb and this

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:59.869
Product has impressed me because I think wacom have really thought out the design especially the addition of these little led screens

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.179
Which tell you what the express keys are doing

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:09.799
I think that's a really really nice feature [if] you want to check out the full details then head on over to Wacom -
