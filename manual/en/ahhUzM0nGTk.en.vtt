Hi this is Danielle from diydanielle.com and
I'm going to show you how to make this toaster

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.070
cover so here's the instructions.Thanks for
visiting!

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:31.720
Her toaster is 9.1 x 12 x 12" so I added an
inch to each dimension so I have one top piece

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:40.649
of both inner and outer fabric that's 13 x
13. I have 4 sides of each fabric that are

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:52.089
13 x 10. 13 is the amount across the top.
10 is the amount down.

00:00:52.089 --> 00:01:13.799
To start out, sew all of your inner fabric
side pieces together. Separate out your top

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:33.520
piece for now. Face 2 side pieces right sides
together, sew them along that side. Continue

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.570
adding pieces until it's one long line of
fabric.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:59.009
Do the same for the outer fabric. Here is
my long line of the rooster fabric. And here

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:14.640
is the top for the rooster fabric. Now you're
going to pin the top piece 
to the top of the side piece and sew along

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:25.110
the top. You will go to next side and do the
same thing. This is the first side I've done.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:36.850
Now it's open, then pin the next section.
Make sure you don't get the layer you just

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.170
sewed.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:46.880
Okay so here we are. You can see we have two
different sections sewn up now. I'm just going

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:56.040
to keep going around until I'm done. Here
it is with all the pieces sewn onto the top.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:05.650
Next you have the two side edges left. Put
those right sides together and sew right up

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.440
the edge. Next do the same thing with your
inner fabric. Then we'll talk about the next

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.230
section.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:21.310
Here's the outer fabric sewn up. I'm using
my sewing machine to show it because I don't

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:32.980
have the toaster. This is the inside piece.Turn
the outer fabric right sides in. Keep the

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:58.190
inner fabric right sides out. Tuck the inside
piece into the outside piece. Pin them together-

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.260
they're right sides together.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:10.700
Okay so here it is, right sides together.
I only pinned at the corners, but you may

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:19.880
want to pin all the way around. You want to
leave about this much area open so you can

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:38.670
turn it right sides out after. Sew along top.
Here we are, we are sewing all around. This

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:52.130
is the bottom edge of our cover that we're
sewing around. I'm going all the way around,

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.330
leaving an area to turn and topstitch.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:01.550
Here I've finished and turned it right sides
out. I pushed the inside fabric in. Now I'm

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:10.030
going to sew around to close up the opening.
I recommend ironing first for a more finished

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:19.250
look. Here it is all finished.I hope this
is helpful for you guys, thanks so much for

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.100
following and take care. Have a good day!
