00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.560
Welcome back to my food series on Retro Food.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.560
I am Johnny Marsh.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.029
I am the head chef for food by Johnny Marsh.

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.610
In this episode, I'm going to show you how
to make a banana split.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.080
[Music]

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.210
Everybody loves a banana split.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.080
So the first step I am going to do is I am
going to make a delicious strawberry syrup.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.099
And I simply put sugar in a pan.

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:28.689
And it is always the same quantity of sugar
to water in a stock of syrup.So pour that

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.210
in.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.060
And that goes onto the stove.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.149
As you can see, I have already quartered some
strawberries and I have got two leaves of

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.620
mint.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.469
Obviously if you cannot do this, it is fine.

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.920
Roll it up and just slowly shred it.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.570
The mint adds a real kind of different aspect
and different element to the dish.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.739
And it is a type of element that people do
not normally expect in a banana split.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.129
That is why it would bring it up to now rather
than keeping it back there.

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.190
So I have got this on.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.670
The stock syrup is bubbling.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.030
Just need to leave it until it is all dissolved,
all the sugar is gone, and it comes up to

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.030
a boil.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.049
You can find the full list of the ingredients
in the description box and all the quantities

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:15.049
of the recipe.

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.320
So now it has come up to the boil.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.170
It is going to be really, really, really hot.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.820
Even if you think you have got especially
tough hands, please do not attempt to touch

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.040
it because hot sugar is hot.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.420
Like really, really hot.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.450
So we are just mixing this in.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.880
And the best thing about this dish now the
strawberries they are finished.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.600
Just leave them to one side and let all the
strawberry flavor just get into that stock

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.680
syrup really.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.390
I have got my cream.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.630
What I did before is just whipped some cream,
added some sugar, and added a vanilla pod.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.700
So that is my sweetness in the dish.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.840
So I have got my ice cream.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.570
I have got my cream.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.280
I have got my baby marshmallow, pavlovas,
some strawberries, banana split needs banana.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.009
I am not going to take it right back to the
1970's where I am just going to go bang on

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.009
a plate.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.020
I am going to take a bit of an elegant side
to it.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.760
So at an angle, just to be a bit fancy.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.390
This is a wicked recipe for kids.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.200
Put them in the dining room.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.200
Give them all of it.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.910
Give them the cream, the marshmallow, the
pavlovas, the bananas, the strawberries.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.230
Obviously do the syrup yourself because we
do not want people leaving with third degree

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.230
burns.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.180
But it is just wicked for them all to do that
and you can just keep to your side.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.480
You can have drinks with your friends.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.310
And they are happy for hours.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.319
So this is ready to assemble now.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.209
So now we are ready to plate.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.629
Just grab your plate and ice cream.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.631
Obviously do not be alarmed by the bowl.

00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:47.220
The bowl is massive, but this serves two.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.659
Little bit of sprigs of mint and a little
tip now.

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.160
Now the strawberries have been infusing, add
a touch of lemon juice.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.860
Just let it sit.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.260
Give that a stir.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.120
Let us go into plating it up.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.040
Bowl into the middle.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.230
Crush the pavlova.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.780
Obviously depending on how many you've got,
let the kids get a rolling pin and let them

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.810
go to town on that and add a little fun factor.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.850
So, I like to go pavlova first.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.000
Scatter that around.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.110
Then you go the strawberries.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.019
Trust me, the mint.

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.459
You will not be not be crossing me adding
the mint.

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.220
It is just delicious.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.150
Touch around.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.650
You got syrup as you can see.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.799
It is just starting to take that tint of red.

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.470
Drizzle that over.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.650
Marshmallows, scatter.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.019

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.019
more.

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.319
Next goes on the bananas, anywhere.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.340
Just get them stuck in.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.879
Use the rest of them.

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.950
Sprinkle more of that over.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.110
I like marshmallows.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.750
Add the rest of the strawberries.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.350
There is no strict rules about how to do it,
where to put them, how to do things.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.090
Just get that stuck in.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.330
Syrup all over.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.080
So now, ice cream and cream.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.270
You have got to have cream in a banana split,
and you have got to have ice cream.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.240
So what I have done, is I have got a bowl
here.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.630
Hot water.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:41.950
Always have water because it would just make
life easier.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:53.350
Couple of these.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:09.530
And then, a couple of scoops of cream.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.530
Just to be a bit fancy, sprigs of mint.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.810
And that is my banana split taken right back
from the seventies.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.820
I hope you enjoy this dish, and I hope to
see you next time.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.880
