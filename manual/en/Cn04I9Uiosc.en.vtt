00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.000
Hi folks, welcome to one more video of Pompeia Hidroméis channel, 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.760
Today I´ll tak about anothe use of natural yeast (Pasta Madre)

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.760
That part you need to throw away

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.080
instead od just throw it, what if we use it to make Grissini?

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.300
Grissini is a bread stick, simple and quick to make, and is delicious

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.520
and allows you to create variations

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.520
So let´s take a look, that is simple and quick!

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.200
This is the ingredients you will gonna need to make your Grissini

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.560
7.41 onces of natural yeast (Pasta Madre)

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.100
You can use the natural yeast before you feed it

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.380
That part you usually discard

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.380
3.7 onces of flour

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.380
more or less 1 once of water

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.380
0.25 onces of salt

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.980
2 soup spoons of olive oil

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.840
To start making the Grissini, I´ll take the Flour

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.640
Put all together with my natural yeast (Pasta Madre)

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.700
ok?

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.300
Add also the olive oil

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.940
Give a quick mix before add salt

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.140
To facilitate add some water.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.140
Don´t use all the water at once

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.140
Put less in the beginning

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.640
Because if you have your natural yeast more wet

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.420
You will need less water

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.960
So here we start to mix it all

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.640
And you will mix this, what is a quick proccess,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.380
until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.240
In this kind of dough is very quick

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.400
When start to get smooth add the salt and we can go to the next part

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.620
After a little more time, I got my dough with salt

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.480
I really didn´t need all the water

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.920
It´s a dough that really reach the point quickly

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.980
So don´t spend to much time on it

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.980
What you´ll gonna make now is 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.980
to take...

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.280
a piece at a time... a small ball

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.400
Wow look at this texture... what a elasticity

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.500
So with this small amount at a time, I even took too much

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.320
So start rolling it until get the format 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.320
of a stick

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.180
Make it with something around 1 and 1,5 centimeter wide, so it will bake well

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.900
That´s it!

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.440
That´s the grissini, make a lot of it, spread olive oil in a baking pan and place them in there.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.020
So quickily I made my bread sticks

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.740
Now in this moment

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.660
You can create a lot of variations, 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:59.860
Example, reduce the salt in the recipe, and add now some fresh grinded sea salt over the dough

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.300
You can put rosemary.... cheese....

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.000
The tradicional grissini is without nothing of it

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.880
But you can play adding a lot of things you like!

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.900
You also, besides the stick, create another formats

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.180
This dough is very easy to work with

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.420
You can make it flat and give it a twist as well, can make a braid format as shown

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.420
You can create a lot

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.860
Now that we have it ready,

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.420
these is one of the few recipes with natural yeast that you don´t need to allow it to grow, to ferment

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.160
As you finished it, turn on yout oven, as it is warm already, put it in there

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.540
You want your oven at around 392-428ºF, ok?

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.980
And you´ll bake it until it gets a nice golden color. Easy doesn´t it? Let´s bake it! 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.040
So folks, here we got our baked grissini

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.380
Look how nice are ours bread sticks

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:11.280
You can eat it like this, you can dive it in a souce... can pass some butter!

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.280
You can make a lot of things! 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.860
And now the great test that I always make! 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.840
let´s see how it turned out!

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.760
Very good!!!

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.040
