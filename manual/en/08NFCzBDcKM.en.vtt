00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.280
Hey!

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.040
First of all, I just want to apologise for the noise in the background.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.540
It's a fan.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.440
I got pimples on my chin, pimples on my chin

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.120
I'm in LA, in the US.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.580
We've been here for a day. The time is...

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.660
I don't know.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.780
5pm?

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.500
Maybe?

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.660
Which means that it's 2am o'clock in Sweden.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.480
Which is exciting.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.740
Oh, helicopter. Watch out for the bird.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.960
You're flying into the bird. Ah, he missed. Good.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.980
So today we've been sunbathing and swimming.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.920
And I've got dirty feet, look:

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.300
I don't think cleaning is their greatest priority over here.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.720
I forgot what I was about to say.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.360
Damn it, y'all.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.500
And the reason I'm in the US all of a sudden

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.340
is because we're going to VidCon!

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.220
So what is VidCon, really?

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.200
Well, VidCon is the biggest youtube convention in the world, which is totally crazy.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.100
It's their fifth anniversary this year

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.740
and everybody is here - it's all the american youtubers, all the big british youtubers,

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.900
it's fangirls, fanboys, people working in the business

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.680
and now I'm here, to show you what's going on.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.880
There's so many people, and I've got the sun in my eyes.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.160
But... I'm excited!

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.320
Join me!

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.820
He wants to be a rockstar so bad! He should be.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.000
Yeah.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.080
Now we're going for dinner, somewhere

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.880
and tomorrow we're going to VidCon.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.780
I'll be recording some over there, so it's either going in this video or in another.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.734
I don't know. We'll see.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.440
Well okay, so, thanks for watching. See ya.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.740
Bye!
