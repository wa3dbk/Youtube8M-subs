00:00:00.745 --> 00:00:02.791
Feeble humans.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.364
Let us give you... our power.

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:21.495
Soon... you'll become unable to resist this... intoxicating power.

00:00:36.037 --> 00:00:38.963
Hey. Wake up.

00:00:43.583 --> 00:00:47.068
Crawl out of one hole... and into another.

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:49.725
You wanna tell me what's going on here?

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.050
American, right?

00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:56.808
Now what brings bloke like you to this part of the world?

00:00:56.986 --> 00:01:00.032
Hey. Easy... whoever you are.

00:01:00.884 --> 00:01:04.515
Name's Leon. Came here looking for this girl. Seen her?

00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:08.092
What? Are you supposed to be a cop or something?

00:01:08.804 --> 00:01:10.934
Nah! You don't look the type.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.025
Maybe.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.208
OK. Let me guess.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.576
She's the president's daughter?

00:01:20.722 --> 00:01:23.782
That's too good for a guess. Wanna start explaining?

00:01:24.763 --> 00:01:26.602
Psychic powers.

00:01:28.678 --> 00:01:31.171
Nah. I'm just kidding with you amigo.

00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:35.849
I overheard one of the villagers talking something about the president's daughter in the church.

00:01:43.225 --> 00:01:44.718
And who might you be?

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:46.837
My name's Luis Sera.

00:01:47.143 --> 00:01:48.957
I used to be a cop in Madrid.

00:01:49.815 --> 00:01:54.840
Now I'm just a-good-for-nothing-guy who happens to be quite a ladies man.

00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:56.310
Why you quit?

00:01:57.265 --> 00:01:58.550
Police man...

00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:03.687
you put your life on the line, nobody really appreciates you enough for it.

00:02:04.706 --> 00:02:08.086
Being a hero isn't what its cracked up to be anymore.

00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:13.480
Used to be a cop myself. Only for a day though.

00:02:13.987 --> 00:02:15.455
I thought I was bad.

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:20.466
Somehow I managed to get myself involved with the incident of Raccoon City,

00:02:20.612 --> 00:02:22.498
on my first day on the force.

00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:25.541
That is the incident with the viral outbreak, right?

00:02:26.206 --> 00:02:30.540
I think I might have seen a sample of the virus in a lab at the department.

00:02:32.728 --> 00:02:35.071
I'm going... to kill you...

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.090
Do something cop!

00:02:39.454 --> 00:02:40.434
After you.

00:02:42.544 --> 00:02:43.085
Now!

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.892
Over here... stranger.

00:03:44.288 --> 00:03:46.478
I have something that might interest ya.

00:03:59.073 --> 00:04:02.716
There are rumors that a foreigner is here with us.

00:04:02.936 --> 00:04:08.146
Our boss himself will take care of the rat. And if la plaga is far better thanâ€¦

00:04:09.343 --> 00:04:10.422
You are right...

00:04:28.778 --> 00:04:31.836
You carry the same as us it seems.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.624
Nevertheless you're an outsider.

00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:37.820
Just remember...

00:04:38.398 --> 00:04:41.529
If you become unpleasant to our eyes...

00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:45.678
you'll face severe consequences.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.575
What? Same blood?
