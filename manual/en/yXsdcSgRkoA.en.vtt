CHAD BASTIAN: Hi, this is Chad Bastian, welcome
to Expert Village. We're here to talk about

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:11.490
the trike buggy and PPG triking with paragliders.
Okay, in this clip, we're going to talk about

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.480
inflation, that is inflating the glider and
bringing it overhead. So, we've already done

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.500
our preflight. We've got our seat belt on.
We've got the motor running. I'm going to

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.240
talk you through it without the motor running,
but what you would do is make sure you got

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.660
your brakes in your hands. Make sure your
glider's trim is set where you want it. And

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.110
we're going to take the A's and hook 'em into
our thumb like this. Okay, when you take,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.640
you got your brake and your throttle. There's
a lot in your hands. You want to make sure

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.450
that this A when you put that on, it doesn't
go over the kill switch or as you pull up,

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.630
you're going to kill the motor. Make sure
you tuck the A down behind the kill switch,

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.580
right in between there. So when you push up,
this comes up like that. As soon as there's

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:06.820
tension on that, you'll be able to slide right
out of there and get that A. Let it go. And

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.950
initially, we have to hit the throttle, full
throttle, and push straight up. The last thing

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.030
you want to do is pull down like this. We're
going to tuck the front of the glider if we

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.070
do that. So all we want to do is it's like
we're couple of posts. We're going to push

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.960
straight up like this, full throttle, until
we can see the glider overhead. We going to

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.450
look either up at the glider which I find
rather difficult to do so that why I use a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.799
mirror. I looked down right there and right
front of me, as soon as I see that glider

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.280
in the mirror, I backed down a midrange throttle
that's going to allow me to taxi along with

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.060
this glider. So the whole idea of the inflation,
make sure it's perfectly set up. We hit the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.420
throttle, full throttle, and push up to assist
the A's to accelerate the glider until it

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.200
is overhead. As soon as it's overhead, we're
going to slide our thumbs out from underneath

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.080
these and catch the glider with some brake
pressure. And then look at our mirror, once

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.619
we see it there and balance the glider overhead.
You want to position this mirror so that your

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.511
head is visible right in the bottom of the
mirror. In that way, as soon as the glider

00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:16.560
clears your head, you let go of the A's and
start catching the pressure in the glider.
