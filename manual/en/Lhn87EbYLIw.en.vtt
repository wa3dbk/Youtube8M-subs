00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.970
hi folks how's it going welcome to my
virgin kitchen where as always we cooking a

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.270
recipe for the very first time

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.820
and today's is so easy that Phoebe did most of it right

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.940
did you enjoy it did you what did it taste like

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.420
it tastes like salmon and pasta yeah...

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.120
it is salmon and asparagus pasta

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.330
it tastes as good as it looks with all those textures and flavours in there

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.720
&amp; salmon

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.910
oh yeah baby you get the ingredient list when Phoebe clicks her fingers

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.410
okay so the ingredients should come down

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.050
hit pause, write them all down and this is how you do it

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.900
first boil your kettle then add your pasta we used this colourful pasta right mate

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.940
yeah that was cool Daddy poured the boiling water

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.600
onto the pasta because it was dangerous for me

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.900
put the saucepan onto a medium flame and cook the pasta according to packet instructions

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.500
cut off the asparagus bottoms

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.120
with scissors why cut off the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.829
bums mate because they are nasty

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.110
they are nasty bums, not good so then I came in with a big old knife and cut the asparagus

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.520
into 3 sections once

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.290
the pasta was cooked I poured the

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.340
asparagus into the saucepan when you asparamonks do you mean

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.390
asparagus?..... yeah

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.850
once the asparagus is cooked through with the pasta should only take 2 to 3 minutes

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.680
drain it all off then you need to get that pan again

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.510
Phoebe sings ba ba black sheep
Phoebe is doing amazingly well in fact i'm probably here just for

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.100
health and safety purposes

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.110
do you actually need me? No

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.049
i'm doing fine

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.080
in that same pan pour in the water then Phoebe got to crumble a stock cube for the first time

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.220
this is a stock cube, this is cream cats like it

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.570
and people like it, try not to make a mess like I did..... crazy kid

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.119
Once the mixture is all mixed through chuck in some coriainder / parsley, pepper

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.350
and also your salmon which should be nice and fine

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.630
in little pieces your child did for you

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.940
put that pan back on the hob to warm it through before it hits boiling point remove from the heat

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.000
and push in your asparagus like this *makes silly noise* ..... yeah

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.430
give it a real nice mix around together

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.640
to make it really coated once it is coated add on a little parmesan

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.980
mix it through and that is done right Pheebs? Yep

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.800
once you've done it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.800
yeah, get your spoon and spin it around and see what happens..... Phoebe breaks wind!

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.739
Phew! It's a bit pongy / in here anyhow with your pasta done whack it on a plate

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.910
give a sprinkling of black pepper, more parmesan cheese and some parsley / coriander

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.280
go to town on it make it look really good

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.819
tweak it as much as you like and that is a load of layers

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.420
of flavour there right now &amp; that is how you make our asparagus and salmon pasta

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.099
 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.780
I really liked the pepper salt

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.200
and the um fish and pasta

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.060
and it's really good

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.719
Phoebe breaks wind again

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:24.000
aghhhhh ..... is that the asparagus?
