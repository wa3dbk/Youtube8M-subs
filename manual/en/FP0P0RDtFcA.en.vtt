Hi, I’m Shelly Cordsen with expertvillage.com.
We’ve just completed a 6x6 scrapbook, brag

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.510
book, gift book, whatever you want to call
it. But now I’m going to show you in case

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.340
you just don’t have that perfect piece of
paper or say you specifically need it for

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.470
a baby gift and you don’t have any focal
paper that even resembles being a baby, so

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.539
I’m going to show you how to make your own
focus paper through stamping. Okay we’re

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:39.260
going to do some stamping and when stamps
are pretty common but they’re becoming a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.579
thing of the past and now we have acrylic
and in the acrylic you have a different set

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.309
of blocks and you just have a collection of
blocks and your stamps now become this compact.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.230
There’s like 35 stamps on here, now can
you imagine having 35 of these in a drawer

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.739
when you can have them all right here and
your different size blocks. So we’re going

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.770
to do a baby theme here and I’m going to
find, I actually got a nephew that was just

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.470
born. So I’m going to take a stamp here
that says, “It’s A Boy” and because

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.900
it’s acrylic I can put it on this block
and I can stretch it, twist it, turn it and

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.570
I’m going to make it kind of curvy, then
I’m going to find this little boy face and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.140
I’m going to stick it right in the center
there. So I now have the stamp that I’m

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.610
going to use and what’s nice about acrylic
is you can see right through it and you know

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.530
exactly where to stamp. So I’m going to
use this color called bris and I’m just

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.111
going to start stamping, “It’s A Boy.”
Now a rule of the thumb, we’ve got to fill

00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:51.540
this whole paper as we kind of work in triangles,
so I’ve got one here, I’m going to do

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.250
one here. To form a triangle I got to come
about down here, twist it anyway you want,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.820
now we have two here, I’m going to throw
in one there, so you’re kind of working

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:11.111
in a triangle format but just kind of sporadic,
it does kind of gets them evenly so here I’ve

00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:20.280
got to form a triangle. Now I want to switch
stamps because I want a lot of color, kind

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.480
of wipe that off, now I can take that off,
but I’m not going to take the time right

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.319
now. I’m going to pull off another stamp
off my rubber cover here and put it on the

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.870
back side, I kind of put it in the corner
where I can kind of see through it and I’m

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.540
going to go with this real pretty green up
here and I’m going to start filling in.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.200
And see I can still see through there, the
stamp, what’s nice about acrylic you can

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.379
also see that your stamp is inked all the
way, so you start filling things in. What

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.810
makes it nice, of course I didn’t print
scrap paper, is to make your image go partly

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.890
off your paper. Now we’re just going to
continue changing stamps and we’re going

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.219
to fill this whole thing up and in the end
we hope to have a page like that.
