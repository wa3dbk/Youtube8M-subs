&gt;&gt; DAMIAN: Hi!

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:07.279
I am Damian Dinning and I am the lead programming
manager for imaging experience for Nokia smart

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:08.279
devices.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:12.570
There are three key things that we have to
make breakthroughs in to make this happen.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:21.859
The first one is the sensor, 41 megapixel
sensor, and genuinely there are 41 megapixels

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:22.859
on that sensor.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.619
We have had people questioning whether or
not we are up-scaling or anything like that

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.300
that maybe it’s a 20 megapixel sensor which
we are up-scaling, but it’s genuinely a

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.559
41 megapixel sensor.

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.649
As you can probably guess, you can’t just
go and get one of those things off of the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.649
shelf.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.699
They just don’t exist so we had to co-develop
that sensor.

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:44.860
So, that was the first thing we had to do.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.449
Second thing was with a sensor that was able
to resolve that amount of detail we had to

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.460
introduce new optics.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.300
We worked closely with Carl Zeiss, collaborated
with them to produce optics that have roughly

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.850
speaking a precision at ten times higher than
the rest of our lenses.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.670
So, that was the second thing.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.420
The third area was in terms of the imaging
pipeline.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:16.310
So, for example in video where we are recording
1080 video, we are handling over 1 billion

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.409
pixels per second which is about 16 times
the number that you will be able to handle

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.750
in a regular smartphone that handles 1080
video, and you also have that full field of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.689
view by the way which I don’t think you
get in any other devices that I am aware of

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:38.090
at least that record 1080 video, so those
are the breakthroughs that we had to make.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.050
Now, of course everyone is talking about the
41 megapixels, but really for us the story

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.060
is not about the number of megapixels, but
how we are actually using those pixels.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.030
That’s the really big deal.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.250
So, the two key things that we are doing here
first is oversampling, and this allows you

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.290
to capture and create 5 megapixel images which
are about one megabyte which have significantly

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.500
more detail than any other camera smartphone
you have ever used or exists in the marketplace

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.270
today by a long way not by a small way, but
a huge margin.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.340
So, that is the first thing.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.660
Incidentally, I should add to that, that pixel
oversampling also allows in low light a significant

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.480
reduction in noise, so your images captured
in low light are significantly better than

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.640
you have ever been able to produce before.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.920
The second area that this very high resolution
sensor allows which is the primary reason

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.500
why we developed it in the first place is
the zoom capability.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.150
So in stills you have roughly three times
lossless zoom and video to full 1080 you have

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.400
four times lossless zoom, and if you record
in 720 video that would give you the capability

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.820
to have six times zoom.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.840
In fact, you could even go further and use
the 360p setting and that would give you 12

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.130
times zoom completely lossless.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.420
&gt;&gt; MARK: So you can forget the digital zoom
thing that most cameras have?

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.230
&gt;&gt; DAMIAN: We had great delight in completely
disabling digital zoom.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.700
There is no digital zoom in this device whatsoever.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.990
There is no up-scaling at any point and whatever
you are using, video or still, is purely based

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.370
on the resolution that the sensor has available
to it.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:25.250
So, we preserve the maximum capability of
the optics and the high resolution sensor.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.310
This combination provides us with a number
of unique benefits over optical zoom.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.700
So, for example, we have a very large maximum
aperture of f-2.4 that is throughout the zoom

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.700
range.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.860
It is not affected by the zoom that you are
using unlike optical zoom, typically when

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.750
you zoom in for example three times zoom might
end up being 5.6.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.530
We are still 2.4 which means we have 5.4 times
the amount of light reaching our sensor throughout

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.420
the zoom than you would get with conventional
optical zooms.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.550
It is completely silent as well that means
when you shoot a video, you are not going

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.960
to hear any noise from the zoom mode or anything
like that because there isn’t one.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.770
I can see a lot of people who currently have
N8s wanting to make the upgrade to this device;

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.470
a lot of logic in that.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.890
I think there is also going to be a lot of
people, who, the kind of people who are interested

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.371
in photography either at the enthusiasts level
or even at a level where they just want to

00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:25.740
take great pictures really easily who will
be really interested in this product.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.759
We saw a similar thing with the N8 incidentally.

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:34.370
So the PureView is the technology which we
are introducing which is a combination of

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.020
high performance optics, high performance
sensor, and Nokia industry-leading image processing

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.020
algorithms.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.510
There is a number of different ways that we
can utilize those elements together and what

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.710
you will see over time is us using different
combinations of those in our future lineup.
