Hi, I am Eugenie. 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.290
Today I am baking cheesecake. 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.580
You can make it with a springform pan,  

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.120
or a cupcake pan.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.420
And this is my choice 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.210
because it's the fastest way.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.420
I want my cheesecake today, not tomorrow.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.070
For this recipe, you will need:

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.670
3 oz Digestive biscuits, crushed into fine crumbs (85g)

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.380
2 tablespoons melted butter (30g)

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.290
9 oz cream cheese, softened (255g)

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.910
2/3 cup granulated sugar (133g)

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.120
½ teaspoon cornstarch

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.120
½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.710
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.210
and 2 eggs

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.410
First, in a bowl, add biscuit crumbs and melted butter. 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.050
And stir until combined. 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.870
Then divide the mixture between cupcake molds lined with cupcake liners. 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.880
Today I used silicon molds. 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.760
And press down firmly to make crust.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.170
In another mixing bowl, 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.370
add in softened cream cheese 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.880
and with a spatula spread the cheese firmly pressing in the bowl.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.290
This way there will be no lumps.  

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.080
To soften cream cheese I microwaved it for 15 seconds. 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:50.500
And beat until just smooth.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.830
Add sugar, 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.120
cornstarch, 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.000
vanilla extract, 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.540
and lemon juice. 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.550
With lemon juice cheesecake tastes better.  

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.970
And stir a little 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:21.580
and beat until creamy. 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:46.200
Beat in the eggs one at a time until smooth. 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.920
Divide the batter between the molds. 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.710
Fill only 2/3 of the mold. 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.200
It’s very liquidy. 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.830
Tap the pan on the working surface to make the top even.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:07.950
Bake in the oven preheated to 355 degrees F (180C) for about 20 minutes 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.870
or until risen.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.080
Out of oven, transfer to a wire rack 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.170
and let completely cool in the pan. 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.380
And refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.000
Voila, 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.790
On top it’s sunken a little, that’s normal.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.410
I will serve my mini cheesecakes with whipped cream and fruit jam. 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.210
Quick and easy baked cheesecake. 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:48.500
I love my fluffy mini cheesecake cupcakes.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:04:09.120
Bon appetit.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.630
Today it was baked cheesecake and tomorrow it's Alfredo pasta. 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.910

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.750
Thank you for watching. 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.750
Bye for now.
