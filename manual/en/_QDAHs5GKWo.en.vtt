00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.969
Hi I'm Mat from eSpares.
In this video I'll be showing how to change the lower

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:12.930
oven element

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.690
in this K3E1 Indesit cooker.
There are two types of oven,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.640
fan assisted and convection so if
you're using a fan assisted oven in

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.800
convection mode.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.840
Or if you often doesn't have a fan and
it's not heating correctly

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.289
it may well be that the lower element
needs replacing.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.780
On none fan assisted ovens the grill element

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.199
and the lower element combine to give
the oven it's heat

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.060
so if your grill is functioning
correctly but you can get the desired

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.239
heat in the oven

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.989
it's likely that the low element is the problem 
and will need replacing.

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.450
Now before beginning any work on a
appliance

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.460
always make sure it's disconnected from
the mains. To access the low oven element

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.989
and to have a look at both elements

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.050
we need to replace this back panel

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.050
by unscrewing the screws.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.350
So once unscrewed put the back panel to
the side,

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.530
and here we can see all the electrical
connections.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.829
Now a good idea before you start any
work on the electricals

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.970
to take a picture of all the wiring just to
be sure you know

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.610
where it all goes and here we can see

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.929
the thermal cut-out, these are the connections to the grill element.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.869
This the connection to the light,
and lower down here

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.869
we have the connections to the lower oven  element.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.159
Now it's always a good idea to use a
multimeter

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.130
to confirm the faults,
so take one of the spades of

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.530
connect the multimeter probes

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.840
to the spade terminals on the element.
And for a fully functioning lower oven

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.619
element

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.640
you should get a reading of around 50 ohms.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.709
for this lower oven element I'm getting no

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.709
reading, so we're going to need to
replace it. Easy enough to do

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.190
simply remove the baffle plate by undoing
these two screws which hold it on.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.350
Now inside there is a lot of sharp edges so do 
be careful.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.609
Next we need to disconnect the
connectors and unscrew the earth wire

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.109
by undoing this screw here.

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.579
Next

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.910
just need to undo these three screws and
then slide the element out.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.910
Now being careful not to damage or disturb
the insulation

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.250
slide the old element out.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.220
You can then grab your new

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.220
lower oven element and replace it again
being careful not to disturb the

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:10.859
insullation

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.920
or cut yourself on any of the sharp edges.
With your new element in

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.580
you can refit the screws re screw in the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.799
earth wire, attach the electrical
connectors.

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:29.799
And then reattach the baffle plate.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.950
With the baffle plate in place

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.950
I can now reattach the back panel.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.480
So there we go, one lower oven element
replaced on this

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.810
Indesit K3E1 cooker.
Remember

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.860
we have plenty of other relevant videos on the
espares website

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.610
on fault finding, diagnosis and the replacing
of parts.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.459
And spares and accessories for this
cooker and many other makes and models

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.430
of appliance can be found on the espares.co.uk website as well.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.409
Thanks for watching.
