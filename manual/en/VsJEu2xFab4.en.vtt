Hello. My name is Grady Johnson and I'm a
professional painter. And, today I'm representing

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.769
ExpertVillage.com. Okay. Now, we're rolling
this wall. And, when you're rolling you want

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.850
to be sure and get the paint on your roller
evenly. You do that just by spinning it in

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.630
your bucket. Now, if you get a paint screen,
that's even easier. It'll press it in. But,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.410
you can just roll it in your bucket. Get it
on there evenly. And then, go ahead and roll

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.099
it on out there. Now, be careful near the
top so that you get that line nice and even.

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.500
And, once you've got that filled in, then
you can start to work your paint. You see,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.680
I'm already out of paint. One thing about
rolling, be sure you have enough paint on

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.890
your roller to do the job. Go ahead and roll
it again. Get a little more in there. More

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.650
paint on my roller. And, I'm going to bring
it on down. Now, take that down as far as

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.600
you can. Then, we'll cut in the bottom after
we're all done. Yeah. There we go. Nice and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.010
even. Now, be sure it all fills in. There
we go. Nicely done. Now, you want to look

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.970
back on your work as you go to make sure there
aren't any holidays. That's what we call little

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.789
places we've missed. And, on stucco those
can be just one little, little spot of white

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.270
that'll pop up. Sometimes you won't see them
until the next day and you can always touch

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.780
it up. But, try and catch it as you go while
it's wet. The main thing with rolling is you

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.070
want to watch those ridges. These are just
little lines that come from the roller. You

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.390
see that line on the edge right there? I'm
going to work that out. And then, roll that

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:37.829
out across my work. Just like that. And, the
same thing on the bottom. Now, you never want

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.520
to dry roll. Cause if you dry roll, you're
going to have a mess. We look pretty good

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:53.109
here. So, we just going to even it on out.
And, move up and down our wall. Yeah. That's

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:58.419
looking good. There we go. And, that's how
we roll a wall after we cut it in.
