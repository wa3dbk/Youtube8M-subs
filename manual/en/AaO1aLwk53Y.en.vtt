00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.930
We worked on the jab, the cross, the hook
and the uppercut. Carmalit is going to put

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.139
them together here, you’re going to notice
on the uppercut she can’t go upwards because

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.280
she is working a bag so she’s going to go
inwards but it’s the same position. So,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.241
just nice and slow let’s see a jab – just
watch your form, notice how she’s rotating

00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:26.900
the shoulders, keeping the hand up nice and
high on the other side protecting her. She’s

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.980
tucking her chin and her shoulders so she’s
protected. She’s rotating her hips and now

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.829
she’s going to cut loose a little bit and
put some power in there. Okay. Tightening

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:44.390
the stomach muscles; breathing out on execution.
Rotating the arm, bringing the punch back

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.430
the same way it went out. Okay, now, here’s
the cross. It’s the back hand, it’s the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.149
power arm it’s usually the dominant arm.
Because Carmalit is right handed she’s got

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.679
her left leg in front that enables her to
have her dominant hand in the back. So that’s

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.890
something that you’re going to want to make
note of. Okay, now she’s going to cut loose

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.670
on the cross. It’s a powerful punch; notice
the rotation in the hip, the foot twisting,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.320
the breath and the distance between her and
the bag. She’s just in the right spot; she’s

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.579
not too close she’s not too far away. Nice.
Now we’re going to take a look at the hook,

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.210
the hook punch. We’re going to switch places
here real quick so they can see this. She’s

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.619
going to throw the cross slowly and leave
it out for a second. Notice the wind up in

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.000
the body; this is lending itself to a follow
up hook punch. Now she’ll unwind to throw

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.040
a hook. Elbow and wrist at the same height,
foot twisted hip turned, here it goes. And

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.340
let’s cut loose on a cross hook. This is
a cross hook combination. Listen to the breath,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.490
nice. One more. Now we’re going to put the
last punch in here for you, it’s the uppercut.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.290
It’s going to come in from the back side
she just threw the hook. Now watch the uppercut

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.190
come in straight. There it is. Hook punch.
Notice how she’s bending, and using her

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:22.250
legs. Breathing. Good form. Elbow and wrist
in good alignment. And here’s the jab, cross,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:35.930
hook, uppercut combination. Alright, have
fun with it.
