00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
So, YouTube has introduced
its new commenting system,

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.280
and I cut myself shaving very badly.

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.040
Possibly, these two events
are connected in some way.

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.360
So, we’re all on the new commenting system,

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.800
and some people are very annoyed about that.

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.840
If you’re interested, you can read
my personal thoughts

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.320
and first impressions of the new system

8
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.200
by clicking here if you have annotations enabled.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.360
If you don’t have annotations enabled,

10
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.840
then you’ll find the link in the video description
and I will look like an idiot.

11
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.480
A special hello to <b>bearchay889</b>
who recommended me to his viewers

12
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.040
which was very nice and is always welcome:
thank you for that.

13
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.000
I really should spend more time on YouTube,

14
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.600
looking for videos and channels
that might interest you;

15
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.920
I wish I had the time to do that, but I don’t.

16
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.160
But there it is; thank you anyway, bearchay889.

17
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.040
And just to clear up one thing
you didn’t seem sure about:

18
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.920
I am British, I am still a British citizen,
I have a British passport,

19
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.840
I just live in Germany.

20
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This also answers <b>Nick Zokkt</b>’s question:
why make videos about Germany?

21
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.600
Simple question, simple answer: I live here.

22
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.120
Although, if there are
some nice sponsors out there

23
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.760
who would be willing to pay me
to visit cities in other countries,

24
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.320
I’d be very interested in hearing from you.

25
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.840
<b>waagemensch</b> suggests that perhaps the most
difficult thing for foreigners learning German

26
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.760
is grammatical gender; because in German nouns
can be masculine, feminine or neuter.

27
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.080
And waagemensch wants to know:
is there a recipe for teaching this?

28
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.720
And the answer to that question is:
no, there isn’t.

29
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.000
Some text books give a very long list
of rules to learn,

30
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.240
and then an even longer list
of exceptions to those rules.

31
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.640
So that tells you all you need to know
about grammatical gender in German.

32
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.560
You just have to learn each word as it comes.

33
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.400
Of course, German isn’t the only language
that has grammatical gender;

34
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.560
and some languages that don’t have
grammatical gender

35
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.000
have even more bizarre things instead.

36
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.040
Is it the most difficult thing
for foreigners learning German?

37
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.600
Well, I don’t know.

38
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.400
Maybe some people who are learning or
have learned German as a foreign language

39
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.240
can comment and say what they thought
was the most difficult thing.

40
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.280
And finally, I’m going to be on television!

41
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.440
In Germany.

42
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.320
Well, I say “on television”: it’s one of those
small no-budget community channels,

43
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.240
but I’m going to be on television.

44
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.600
It’s going to be broadcast over the airwaves
in the Oldenburg region,

45
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.280
but if you’re not in the Oldenburg region —
in fact, if you’re not even in Germany —

46
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.840
you can still watch it on the internet.

47
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.600

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.240
And if you don’t have annotations enabled,
you’ll find the link in the video description,

50
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.280
and I will look like an idiot.
