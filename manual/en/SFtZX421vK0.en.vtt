00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.800
So what you're saying is this is pantyhose for my arms?

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:13.720
[music]

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.260
So this week we're reviewing Sports wristlet...FOR MAN!

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
That's right like a cologne, LIK A MAN!

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.100
Actually this is...kind of weird.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.590
It's um, it's like a half-sleeve, like it just goes from here to here.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:34.010
And I guess this is high technology wristlet, durability and comfort for outdoor exercises.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.910
Right so I think the idea behind it is that people burn their arms

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.820
or get their arms any darker so then they wear these sleeves

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.560
under their t-shirts,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.360
which kinda just confuses me, because if you wanted long sleeves

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.780
why didn't you just buy a long sleeve shirt?

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.780
But everyone wears them!  Really, they're actually popular.  

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.380
It's not like a rare thing.  And they'll sell them on the subways,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.700
like people will go by with little carts and sell them 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.490
for like 1000 won or something like that.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.410
And you see lots of people on the subways buying them also

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.810
Yeah!  It's like a really hot commodity.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.620
What I really like about this is if you look at the back of it

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.220
they've got a whole bunch of pictures of people doing athletic activities

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.050
but in none of these pictures are anyone actually wearing the wristband!

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.980
Wristlet Simon [Wristlet!  Sorry!]

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.350
Like you see somebody running, but you only see their legs.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.570
You don't put these on your legs!

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.780
You see somebody playing tennis, but he's not wearing the wristlet!

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.520
There's a guy fishing in a complete silhouette!

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.020
It's like you can't even pay your models to wear this!

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.230
I really like the diagram that they have on the back,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.830
cuz, like, arrow going up this way, arrow going up that way.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.430
What does that even mean? [circulation?]  Circulation?

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.130
It looks more like an Indian Rug Burn (Damn!  Meant to say Sunburn!) that they're giving you

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.050
Do you guys remember Indian rug burn?  RRRRR!

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.960
Ow you're not supposed to do it!  [Oh, sorry!]

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.370
Ok so let's put this on, then.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.270
Alright, so since this is for man [I want to put one on, too!]

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.660
But then why didn't you get the one for woman?!

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.850
There was one for woman, but I...

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.980
Now what I want to know is why is there one for man and one for woman?

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.090
It's like, are women's arms that different from men's arms?

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.810
It's like, do women's arms have breasts on them or something

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.190
so that there's a different shape?

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.620
Cuz if they did, that would be awesome!

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.620
Boobarms.  BOOBARMS!

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.210
Ok let's put them on [ok]

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.440
Ok here goes.  It's pretty tight [snug] fit.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.830
I really feel like an anime character.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.850
You know how like manga and anime characters have like these ridiculous costumes

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.660
that have, like, armpit free zones?

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.860
And they're like "I'm gonna fight for life cuz that's what I can do!"

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.880
[Martina mimics off-dubbing. She's really mouthing the words "But I like elephants as well!"]

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.700
You know what I'm talking about?

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.420
SHOYUKEN!

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.990
It actually feels a little bit cool.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.020
It does feel cool, yes!

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.710
I really hate to say that, I feel like 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.610
OK FLAP YOUR ARM this way.  Do you feel that?

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.900
Now flap it the other way.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.650
Ohmigosh!  That's so weird!

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.980
This actually keeps your arm cool.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.670
I don't know why.  I feel like I have a cold gel feeling on my arm.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.290
Ok, you know what? I was totally mistaken about this.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.400
If we could just walk around in public and just flap your arms like this

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.130
And all the Korean people at home are like "There are those foreigners again!"

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.710
And we're like, walking down the street.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.420
Do the Seungri Dance.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.650
OH OH OH OH! OH OH OH

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.130
Maybe he was cooling his arm.  [but he didn't have a] Can I have the other one?

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.830
I want double DUAL cooling effect.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.450
OMG!  I know what this reminds me of!  This reminds me of like a figure skater costume!

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.260
You how they have like, the top part will be spangly, 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.950
and then it like, doesn't attach,

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.180
oh the hardcore nylon throughout your entire body?

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.020
But it doesn't attach at the armpit it has like these really

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.520
long sleeves that go to their fingers and they have scarves that they wave around.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.240
If I was a figure skater I'd dance to Rain's "Love Song"

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.030
I'd be like, on the skating rink and be like NANUN OTTOKAY!

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.850
Would you take off your shirt and  NEE NEE NEE NEE NEE!

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.160
Because I'd give you a 10 out of 10 if I saw that one.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.260
GONG!

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.100
It's giveaway time [OH YEAH!]

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.410
Yes, we have reviewed four WTFs.  We did the epic Twonkle Twonkle mug,

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.850
the double eyelid tape, the Ddung Products,

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.850
the perfume as well as the cream, and now

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.860
the man wristlets.  LIKE A MAN!

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.160
Yeah, sorry.  Namja means man.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.770
So to win this time all you have to do is make your own Twonkle Twonkle nursery rhyme!

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.290
TWONKLE TWONKLE LITTLE STAR!

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.980
And then you do the rest.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.700
You don't have to sing it in a Viking accent if you want,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.410
all you have to do is leave it in the comments for our YouTube page,

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.810
our our eatyourkimchi page.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.530
And we'll pick out the best, funniest, most awesome and most creative poem

and mail you out a WTF package.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.840
Including the extra coveted Twonkle Twonkle mug.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.840
That's right.  You know we actually found other Twonkle Twonkle stuff?

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.670
We found Twonkle Twonkle meers!

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.580
That's right.  Twonkle twonkle what?  

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.180
Mee-rors.  

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.570
Mirrors.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.090
I'm leaving!

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.090
GONG!
