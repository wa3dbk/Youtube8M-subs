00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:05.859
Free motion quilting can be done on this machine
with a breeze.

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:11.630
Now the foot that comes with it is foot letter
R, which works okay, but the foot that you

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.070
probably want to purchase if you’re going
to get into free motion quilting quite a bit

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.860
is the open toe free motion spring foot and
that one will actually screw into the side

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.860
of the machine.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.230
I’m going to show you both.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.630
First off, for the R foot, you’ll notice
that you have a little vertical part of the

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.760
foot in the place where it sticks on.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.109
This vertical part does need to sit in front
of the white ankle, so as you slip that up,

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:37.920
it just clicks into place.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.850
On the machine, what we do want to do is go
ahead and set it for free motion quilting.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.850
This is the symbol.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.729
It’s in the sewing information area and
as you touch it, the very first one is the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:50.729
free motion floating.

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:51.859
That’s for the R foot.

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.980
You’ll hear the feed dogs click and lower
down and now it’s ready to go.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.909
Here’s a little bit of a quick how-to free
motion quilt.

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.990
Go ahead and as you sew, it’s going to go
ahead and take a few stitches, but as soon

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.090
as you move the fabric, you need to be in
control of how fast you move it so you get

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.229
nice even stitches.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.009
Set the machine so the needle stops in the
down position and utilize the speed control

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.130
of the machine, so you can actually reduce
it to maybe halfway.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.469
That means as you step on the foot control
full speed, it’s not as full speed as it

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:36.520
could be and you can start to match your hands
to the speed of the needle to start to get

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.460
some nice even stitches as you go around.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.350
You can see that that foot is just hovering
over the fabric and then, as you can see,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.710
that you have a nice working stitch as you
go.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.960
If you go too slow, you’ll get tiny stitches.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.710
If you move too fast, you’ll get longer
stitches.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.270
This isn’t something that you’re going
to learn in 10 minutes.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.119
This is something that every time I sit down
to free motion quilt, I get better and better,

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.880
but without the practice, you don’t get
the accuracy that you’re looking for.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.540
Let me show you how you switch over to the
other foot we talked about.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.870
You’re going to go ahead and take your screwdriver
out, loosen this screw here, take the entire

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.410
ankle off and we’ll just leave the R foot
attached to it while we are not using it.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.319
We also on screen are going to switch over
from the free motion floating option to the

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.510
free motion spring action option and then
that way, the machine knows to handle this

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.159
foot just a little bit differently and then
we’re going to go ahead and slide this up.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.629
This is going to go up right over and around
the post and there’s a part right here,

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:55.510
this angled top of the spring, that goes above
your needle through, I’ll get it, above

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.629
it, yes.

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.200
There you go.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.640
Don’t try to do it below.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.040
It doesn’t work so well.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.129
Just get it lined all up and then make sure
you give that screw a nice little turn because

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.079
you don’t want that wiggling loose while
you’re sewing along.

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.079
Okay.

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.120
Same concept.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.090
As you start to stitch, go ahead and step
on the foot control, take a few stitches in

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.750
place and then as you go, start to match the
speed of your hands to get the nice looking

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.719
stitch length that you would normally see
if you were sewing and what you get with this

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:37.010
foot is the foot actually kind of bounces
and taps the fabric, helping for the way the

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.879
stitches come together and it’s really a
better source, instead of that foot hovering

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:43.879
all the time.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.170
You’re going to get a better looking stitch.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.170
All right.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.189
Let’s go ahead and take a look.

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.409
Sometimes on the back, we do need to adjust
the tension a little bit.

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.180
Actually, this is looking really good here.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.180
This is the one we just did with the spring
action foot.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.319
This is the one we did with the R foot earlier.

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.370
What we’re seeing right here is where you’re
starting to see a little bit of some dots

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.159
getting pulled to the backside, where we don’t
see it over here and sometimes we see more

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.629
of it because of the different weights of
thread that we’re using.

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:19.270
On the screen what you’d do is, to get this
to be smoother, we’re going to increase.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.240
Go to a higher number of tension.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.670
So go ahead and turn that up to a whole number
plus, try it again, see how you like it and

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.280
see if you can eliminate some of those little
dots on the back.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.360
That’s probably the most common thing is
that we’re increasing the tap tension when

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.300
we are using it for free motion quilting.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.570
I also like a top stitch needle for that particular
technique and then that way, too, as I’m

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.060
going through quilts stitching where I would
have a lot of inner sections and piecing going

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.940
on, where it gets really thick, that top stitch
needle will go through it perfectly, but have

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.970
fun free motion quilting.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.530
You’ve got a wonderful machine, because
you have lots of space and if you do put it

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.750
into a cabinet, you’re going to love it
even more.
