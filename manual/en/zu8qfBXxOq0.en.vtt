00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:06.089
hello musicians thank you for joining us
My name is Andrew Mercer and today we will be 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.180
addressing one of the
biggest

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.419
transduced

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.579
debt and the vocalist have recording
vocal tracks

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.260
now these challenges issue comes from

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.099
many subscribers that i've had in you
both u_-two as well as on my blog 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.299
www.andrewmercer.ca

00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:28.419
and that is wiseman vocal sound money
why how can i get my vocals a sound

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.999
clearer were more volume is always a
little too quiet

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:35.600
these of course the cartoon from
vocalists or trying to record

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.510
so let's have a look and see how we can
fix that problem

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.010
they can see here i'm using a white guy
friend condenser microphone for this

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.900
demonstration and this is actually broke
and at sixty sister proc

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.070
uh... this uh... microphone well when i
was working

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.050
uh... there's certainly some worked well
now i'll tell you about how this works

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.050
and we can use that as a demonstration
for halloween continue you work with

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.380
yours

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.679
and first of all

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.860
most musicians most vocal spanish
singing

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.380
they tend to be too far away from the
microphone they'll stand next year into

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.810
some kind of reports of thing that
happens in

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.250
many people are free to get on top of
the microphone

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.430
so when they stand experiencing the
microphone is working very hurt

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.180
to pick up the sound and it's in the
process is picking up all kinds of room

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.860
sound

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.900
picking up a echoes off the windows
picking up echoes of ceiling in the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.090
florida and is making the biggie
recording some money and not clear and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.760
of course you further away so you have
to crank on your savings on your soccer

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.000
and in your hardware

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.310
in order to compensate for the distance

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.389
they are indeed

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:40.700
away from that you get closer to the
microphone

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.030
now if you get close to this microphone
what's gonna happen is

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.290
your close if you're keys in your case
in your bs

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.600
these sandy's a constant

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.790
are gonna prop

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.070
the microphone is going to cost clipping
in your microphone and we don't want

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.920
that and watch this video here this will
talk to you how to deal with close

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.400
that's how to do with katie's in peace
and things like that

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.950
now i want to do in order to uh... fix
some of that isn't going to use a pop

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.700
filter or wind screen that's what this
is a two-fold cover the cost of a

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.889
microphone

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.999
now you can also you may have seen is
also when she can get their uh...

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.940
uh... screens a call from the microphone
using ground

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.360
if you watch this video you'll see how
it actually make your own pockets are

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.169
basically for free

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.379
i don't know but i got a fasting on

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.559
papa filter

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.819
now if i may use this microphone i'm
gonna want to be but this close i'm

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.889
going to want to be the four inches from
this microphone

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:35.689
that will probably do it for this one

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:36.790
four inches

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.230
they might saying let's not to be close

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.099
uh...

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.300
moon and we need in the area may be
quite loud that's what we want

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.419
we want the microphone to be you to do
its job it doesn't need to work store

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.219
and when you're this close your
microphones gonna pick up all the

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.229
residents in your head you know things
that if you stand that these concerns

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:56.379
are lost

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.460
when you're in close is going to go all
the nuances of your chest sound in your

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.080
your head seven alternates thrones a you
produce

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.889
as well as the consonants and things you
making as you produce tone

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.339
when you're close to this to the
microphone you we'll get that beautiful

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:11.619
reached sound

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:13.010
and for the move away

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.320
that sample teach

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.450
you need to explore that as well you
need to get on the microphone like this

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.340
and and record yourself four inches from
that directly into the capsule

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.889
and then listen to it

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.329
ending they move the six inches back
directly to the capsule listen to that

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:27.830
back

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.589
and do baby and see which one you like
better

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:34.679
then maybe tracing a little bit
off-center ccm off the caps a little bit

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:37.829
that little bit off and on and i don't
the capsule

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.369
and try that too which is four eighty
six inches and see how that works for

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.909
you

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.939
eventually you'll find the sweet spot it
for your microphone and when you do

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.499
stick to it it's really worth it because
you're going to get this being strong

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:50.980
sound that you want

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.079
buckets for the meeting the issue for

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.349
so get on that microphone getting nicer
clothes and let the microphone do the

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.799
work for you

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.149
okay if you like this give us a life and
the law gives the phones up that really

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:04.680
helps a channel some intriguing to
select to be like this

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.599
and insures describes well we have loads
of new tutorials coming up on times of

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.749
the short this is described as well
