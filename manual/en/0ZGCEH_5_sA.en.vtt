00:00:07.583 --> 00:00:10.248
Hi everybody!
Hello!

00:00:10.248 --> 00:00:17.075
We're going to try making some dango-shaped candy with this kit.

00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:22.233
You can make three kinds: taiyaki, mitarashi dango, and ichigo daifuku.

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.502
Let's open it up…
They're tiny!

00:00:24.502 --> 00:00:30.583
Inside we have… molds, mochi mix, taiyaki mix, mitarashi mix…

00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:36.500
a spoon, chocolate flavor mix, strawberry flavor mix, sticks, and a tray!

00:00:37.974 --> 00:00:42.766
Alright, let's make all three kinds!

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.958
You have to put water in up to this line.

00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:46.575
About this much, right?

00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:49.091
Whoa, it's yellow!

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.416
It turned yellow!

00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:52.525
Oh no!

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.183
So much powder…

00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:01.525
It's like cookie dough, it all clumped together

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:03.358
Wow!

00:01:04.558 --> 00:01:06.122
Let's make it into a ball

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:11.100
Now split it into two, and roll them around.

00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:15.291
I should split this into two?
Yep, right in half

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:17.258
They're ready!

00:01:17.308 --> 00:01:21.158
The taiyaki dough is a little yellow

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:25.575
Stir stir…

00:01:29.616 --> 00:01:31.249
She's not going to…

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:33.308
She put it back in!!!!

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:39.499
It smells like chocolate!

00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:45.208
Now we squash the taiyaki dough into the taiyaki mold

00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:48.740
It's taking shape…

00:01:51.816 --> 00:01:55.340
When you're done, take it out of the mold.

00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:58.920
Whoa, it looks good!

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:01.720
It kinda stuck out from the mold a bit

00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:03.940
Smooch smooch!

00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:07.250
Now you make a dent in the middle

00:02:12.708 --> 00:02:16.260
Uh oh, it leaked out a little

00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:20.290
The taiyaki are ready!

00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:24.210
Next, we're gonna make ichigo daifuku!
Yep!

00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:32.680
Aww!&lt;3

00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:36.980
We shoulda done it like this…

00:02:38.483 --> 00:02:42.400
Put 'em together and now it's a strawberry!

00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:57.930
Now, time to make the mochi! (mix mix mix mix…)

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.230
It's like the rice balls from the Tsukuro Obento kit! (mix mix mix mix)

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:06.040
Yeah, stirring is definitely the best part

00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:09.040
It doesn't taste good if you just eat the powder!

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.450
That was close!!!

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:17.080
Time to pour in the chocolate…

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:20.520
You put it on top of the strawberry?

00:03:20.525 --> 00:03:24.780
Now for the strawberry. The ichigo daifuku is done!

00:03:24.783 --> 00:03:26.710
It looks tasty!

00:03:27.825 --> 00:03:29.030
Finished!

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:32.370
I made the taiyaki into a girl!

00:03:32.383 --> 00:03:34.720
I'm making mochi balls!

00:03:35.605 --> 00:03:37.490
It fell!!

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.880
Alright alright!

00:03:44.883 --> 00:03:46.060
Finished!

00:03:51.923 --> 00:03:55.208
They're done!!!!

00:03:55.208 --> 00:03:58.420
Ready set go! Itadakimasu!

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.270
They're delicious!

00:04:04.833 --> 00:04:06.617
It's too hard…

00:04:06.617 --> 00:04:08.620
I'm gonna make you all covered in chocolate…

00:04:11.508 --> 00:04:14.090
It's good covered in chocolate

00:04:14.091 --> 00:04:16.670
The taiyaki is good!

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.730
They were all really sweet!

00:04:22.733 --> 00:04:29.250
If you like mochi, you should really give this kit a shot.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.000
Byebye, come watch us again!
See ya!

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.200
Today's friend is…

00:04:36.666 --> 00:04:38.950
Hello. I'm a weird old guy.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.020
Where are you from?

00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:45.608
Umm, I'm from Tainoshima. Thanks for having me.

00:04:45.608 --> 00:04:47.930
How old are you.

00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:49.759
I'm 79.

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:55.540
Ok then, next time there is a video, I am going to come watch. Good bye.

00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:58.780
What a weirdo…
