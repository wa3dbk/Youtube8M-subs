"Hormones in Skim vs. Whole Milk"

00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:06.456
Major review on diet and acne this year

00:00:06.456 --> 00:00:10.296
in the International 
Journal of Dermatology.

00:00:10.296 --> 00:00:16.114
Acne is described as a disease 
of Western Civilization,

00:00:16.114 --> 00:00:21.134
a near universal disease 
affecting up to 95% of teens

00:00:21.134 --> 00:00:24.424
and about half of adults 
here in the United States,

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:28.453
but if you go to places that 
still eat more traditional diets --

00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:30.673
out of over 1,000 people studied,

00:00:30.673 --> 00:00:35.453
not one single case of acne.

00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:39.899
Dairy appears to play the major role.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.347
The steroid hormones in milk are 
at high enough concentrations

00:00:44.347 --> 00:00:48.927
that it may affect our 
oil-producing pores.

00:00:48.927 --> 00:00:52.007
But, if there are that 
many hormones in milk,

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:57.135
then acne would seem to 
be the least of our worries.

00:00:57.135 --> 00:01:02.499
From the Journal of the German 
Society of Dermatology this year --

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:07.129
Milk consumption: 
aggravating factor not only of acne,

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:11.739
but a promoter of 
chronic disease in general.

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:19.444
Yes, the potential risks of cow's milk 
consumption include affecting the skin.

00:01:19.444 --> 00:01:24.684
But I'm less concerned in 
the so-called acne epidemic

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:28.030
than I am about the epidemic of dementia,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.520
and cancer, and heart disease,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:40.540
though pre-mature puberty and auto-immune 
diseases are serious issues as well.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.320
Which has the highest 
hormone levels, though?

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.175
Fat-free milk,

00:01:46.175 --> 00:01:47.360
reduced-fat milk,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.500
whole milk,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.290
or buttermilk?

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.150
Here's the study --

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.040
and buttermilk had the most hormones.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.470
But, who drinks buttermilk?

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.691
Which is #2 after buttermilk?

00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:08.011
Is it skim, 2%, or whole milk?

00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:13.380
The #2 most hormone-
packed milk is skim milk.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.470
Why are we concerned?

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.780
Breast cancer for one thing.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.200
All part of the soup of 
cancer-causing suspects

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.270
scientists continue to find in milk.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.392
Skim milk, second only to buttermilk,

00:02:31.392 --> 00:02:35.972
in terms of the levels of about 
a dozen steroid hormones

00:02:35.972 --> 00:02:39.892
recently found in retail milk.

00:02:39.892 --> 00:02:44.990
Part of the reason is what 
we've done to dairy cows.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.161
Through dietary and genetic manipulation,

00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:54.271
we're now able to force cows to lactate 
even in the late stages of pregnancy,

00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:59.751
and since we have to keep them 
constantly impregnated to produce milk --

00:02:59.751 --> 00:03:02.011
that's good for the industry --

00:03:02.011 --> 00:03:04.090
but right at the end 
of the third trimester,

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.210
the hormone levels really skyrocket,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.940
and that's what we end up drinking.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.080
Milk was designed by nature 
to make things grow like crazy.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.600
That's why it's good for 
babies, but bad for tumors.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.345
Good for baby cows,

00:03:20.345 --> 00:03:22.365
but bad for adult people

00:03:22.365 --> 00:03:26.365
who may have tiny microscopic 
breast or prostate tumors

00:03:26.365 --> 00:03:31.415
which we don't want growing so fast.

00:03:31.415 --> 00:03:35.482
In a study of 140,000 men this year,

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:38.952
35 grams of dairy protein 
increased the risk

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:44.138
of developing high-grade 
prostate cancer by 76%,

00:03:44.138 --> 00:03:50.200
so that's like 2% increased risk 
for every gram of milk protein.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.907
So, a cup of cottage cheese a day 
could increase one's risk by about 50%.
