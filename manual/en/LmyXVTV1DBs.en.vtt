00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.019
this is one of the places in the
Caribbean

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.029
that Gauguin would really love.

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.060
It´s  a far remote place in a cave with the ocean

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.300
full of mystery and secrets. His working

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.370
technique would not be such a mystery, it
would be a process and he would stick

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.489
to the process

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.399
at first he would go around the island

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.200
and collect some thing that
impress him

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.740
and out of the things he would take out 
some symbols

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.000
symbols that are full of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
meaning for a mystery or something
that he want to express.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.350
in the next step he would take some of
this symbols that he had collected

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.680
and put it together to some scratchers, this scratchers are not

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.280
pictures, like a like a photography or
a snapshot

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.479
but they are full of meaning, because
first he was collecting

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.770
not things but symbols, symbols with a
meaning

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.240
and dis meanings are output together

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.240
to a new context in a new picture

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.580
in the next step he will try some color
designs. this color designs

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.229
he is doing mostly with watercolors,
because

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.750
it's a quick way to find out which
color are working together

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.770
which are not and also you can see the
structure of the picture

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.770
very well already with the water colors

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.680
the next step is unusually a acribic

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.150
because he is putting over his design a grid

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.709
and transforming his first stretches

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.040
to the canvas and then

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.430
all the lines are made again with Prussian

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.430
blue

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.550
the next step is to work all the colors
that I

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.120
already have in my color designs. I´m working

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.950
not with big spaces to make the sky blue

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.069
but from one focus point to the

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:21.069
outside

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.709
now I'm finishing the picture but the
best part about a Gauguin

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.260
picture is that it has to be unfinished,
it is still a adventure

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.819
it is still part of this mystery of the
Caribbean

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:43.819
something raw something dangerous
something mysteries.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.920
I hope this little demonstration

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.110
could interestyou in a Gauguin painting adventure

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.510
because painting like Gauguin

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.780
it's not only about making pictures

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.300
but it's also a lifestyle, a dangerous
adventurous

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.130
lifestyle and that's what I love about ist
