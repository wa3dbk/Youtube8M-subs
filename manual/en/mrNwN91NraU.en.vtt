hello everyone. this is Chihiro aka Choicerish,

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:29.146
today i tried 3 looks using Shu Uemura xmas collection 
 collaborated with the most famous cat Shupette Lagerfeld.

00:00:29.994 --> 00:00:33.908
i mainly use this eye and lip palette which got 14 colors,

00:00:34.371 --> 00:00:37.025
pink and coral color blushes,

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:42.675
and the famous cleansing oil in travel size. all items 
 are included in this shupette xmas palette kit.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.656
my first look is Bold pink lip makeup

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:54.690
i already applied foundation and eyebrows so ill start with eyeshadow.

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.392
apply this gray eyeshadow on the eyelid

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:06.863
this dark gray color will be the main color so i 
 put this along the eyeline and blend it upwards.

00:01:07.693 --> 00:01:11.164
next, take the burgundy brown eyeshadow  and apply it on the outer eyelid.

00:01:11.746 --> 00:01:22.819
and blend it with the gray color and make a 
 gradation. also put it along the bottom lashline.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.190
as a hightlight, apply this cool gray shadow on the innter corner of 
 the eyes to make eyes look closer and brighten up the area.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.462
and put the same color on the puffy area right 
 under the eyes to make eyes look rounder.

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:42.570
for eyelines, apply the eye need shu iner in 
 midnight black which is black with blue shimmers

00:01:43.408 --> 00:01:46.710
firstly put some color on the outer corner of the eyes

00:01:47.445 --> 00:01:51.810
then take the flat brush from the palette and wing it up the line

00:01:52.612 --> 00:02:00.240
soft pencil eyeliner can be blended easily with a brush like 
 this so if you like natural lines, use this technique.

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:05.000
and after that, apply mascara both on top and bottom lashes.

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:08.400
then ill take this silk cushion cheek in pink

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:19.100
as the name goes, its really soft like a souffle and 
 u can build up the color as you wish.

00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:23.610
today, the lip color has more impact so i put blush lightly.

00:02:24.863 --> 00:02:34.340
for lips, take the dark violet color and outline the lips first.

00:02:35.404 --> 00:02:43.200
then take the magenta color and apply it in the middle and 
 blend it with the dark violet to achieve the plump lips.

00:02:49.514 --> 00:02:54.100
now add some items and make it a smokey eye makeup

00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:57.940
first, take off the lip colors and start with the eyes.

00:02:58.776 --> 00:03:05.920
apply eye need shu liner in gala brown which is brown 
 with gold shimmer on the eyelid up till the crease.

00:03:06.914 --> 00:03:09.680
then blend the edge with the eyeshadow with your finger

00:03:11.431 --> 00:03:18.510
take the burgundy brown color and apply it on 
 top of the eyeliner and blend it well

00:03:20.695 --> 00:03:25.620
then apply the same eyeliner along the bottom lashline and smoke it out

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:35.240
use a black eyeliner to fill the water lines. then take my precious 
 glitter set in gold on the inner corner of the eyes.

00:03:35.913 --> 00:03:40.690
this is loose powder so use felted tip and press it on the lid

00:03:42.884 --> 00:03:53.320
after that, apply a foundation on the lips to erase the 
 redness and apply the pink lip color with your finger.

00:04:04.263 --> 00:04:09.980
the 3rd look "spicy girly makeup" is recommended by Shu Uemura 

00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:13.670
firstly take the pink eyeshadow and put it on the outer eyelid.

00:04:14.478 --> 00:04:33.660
then take the pastel blue which is created by the inspiration from Shupette's eye color and 
 apply it on the inner half and blend in the middle with the pink color.

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:41.240
and as a highlight, apply the cool gray color 
 on the inner corner of the eyes

00:04:42.471 --> 00:04:51.770
then take my precious glitter set in pink on your finger and 
 put it under the eyebrows and blend with the pink shadows.

00:04:53.805 --> 00:05:03.600
this drawing pencil in metal pink is pigmented and 
 soft so its easy to draw winged eyelines.

00:05:04.402 --> 00:05:10.020
to sharpen the eyes, eyeline with black liner

00:05:10.698 --> 00:05:14.020
and apply mascara both on top and bottom lashes

00:05:15.997 --> 00:05:22.940
for cheeks, take the silk cushion cheek in pink and apply 
 it in a round shape on the highest point

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.810
if its too light, just add on the middle and blend it

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.720
for lips, take the baby pink color and apply it with your finger

00:05:34.582 --> 00:05:45.520
then take the salmon pink with a brush and apply it on 
 the middle of the lips and this look is done

00:05:52.749 --> 00:06:05.410
