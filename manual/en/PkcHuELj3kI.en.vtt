taking your audience questions submitted
them through our website david packard

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:08.250
dot com or a make a video of yourself
asking the question and then send us a

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.930
link to that or leave us a voice mail
with your question into a ninety day to

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.510
be here's a question for maxwell david i
would like to know your thoughts on self

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.740
driving cars pacific league google self
driving kar

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.310
seem like big news when i first heard
about it but now it seems less promising

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.270
we talked about the self driving cars
louis now here's the thing google self

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.480
driving car specifically my
understanding is that it has actually

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.240
now legal in california

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.390
as long as there's someone sitting in
the passenger seat next to that next to

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.590
the uh... well

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.720
addison avenue that anybody and

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.800
um... but putting the google car side

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.550
i actually tend to agree with what

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.120
ob read the grace at in an interview
with us at this point i guess it's

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.260
private a couple of years ago which is

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.530
as life spans grow

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.200
dude too

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.680
met advances in medicine whatever else

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.190
it's going to become incredibly clear
that people driving cars themselves is

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.440
is an incredibly risky activity that
should be phased out altogether

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.240
i happen to agree that i think that that
the first step would be certain highways

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.920
were once your vehicle gets on the road

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.610
a computer system takes control of it
um... they keeping it at a safe distance

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.310
from the vehicle in front controlling
vehicles together making it so that we

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.600
have less traffic and faster speeds and
taking out the uh... uh...

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.910
risk of having people actually driving a
car that eventually i assume that this

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.240
will spread beyond just major highways

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.150
google's car specifically

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.720
i don't really care about the car
specifically

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.370
beyond the idea that it seems to be the
start

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.590
getting into this direction i'm talking
about

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.720
yet it's the start obviously the
technology has come a long way meet in a

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.800
great job

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.210
with the cars uh... seeing as there now

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.570
which treat legal but uh... you'll never
catch me in the passenger seat aboard

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.689
well now but what would be more
dangerous being in the passenger seat of

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.210
the car or just being on the road with
other people in uh... you know

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.490
itself driving vehicle well the problem
is that other people are not insult you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.010
having vehicles

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.330
so i'm at the mercy of this car while
there's still a lot of people driving

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.739
around drunk

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.069
themselves interesting user you believe
that is that really the one thing though

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.849
that you would you would say well

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.739
if there are drunk drivers i want to be
able to avoid them with a manual vehicle

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.279
rather than being at the mercy of the
soft writing vehicles like is that the

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:28.099
real the one reason you don't like it in
general i i just

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.999
but it's it's it's technology has come a
long way we are talking to has a long

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.760
way to go so they've heard of it was i
believe that the technology is still

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.749
promising

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:39.739
whether google's scar specifically is
going to be the catalyst for make

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.059
everything happen

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.870
i don't really know

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.310
but infineon in general i am in time for
the idea of taking manual control of

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.370
vehicles away from people as a way that
did to decrease uh... deaths and injury
