00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.361
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:10.046
The Mercedes C63 Coupe has many
notable attributes, not

00:00:10.046 --> 00:00:13.046
the least of which is the fact
that its small, two-door body,

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:16.712
which normally runs a 2.2 liter
diesel motor, has a 480

00:00:16.712 --> 00:00:19.822
horsepower 6.2 liter V8.

00:00:19.822 --> 00:00:23.336
That's 66 horsepower
more than a BMW M3.

00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:28.206
But perhaps the C63's best
boast is the relationship

00:00:28.206 --> 00:00:33.096
between that V8 and
its rear tires.

00:00:33.096 --> 00:00:36.346
You see, the C63 behind me has
the Power Pack fitted, which

00:00:36.346 --> 00:00:41.126
gives it 480 horsepower, 368
foot pounds of torque.

00:00:41.126 --> 00:00:42.236
They're big numbers.

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:46.746
But the rear tire is just
255 in section.

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:49.106
That to me gives it
an unprecedented

00:00:49.106 --> 00:00:51.346
amount of power to rubber.

00:00:51.346 --> 00:00:54.456
Let's think of it as a power
to rubber ratio.

00:00:54.456 --> 00:00:55.596
It's the biggest in its class.

00:00:55.596 --> 00:01:01.186
In fact, outside of stuff like
the 1,099 horsepower

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.866
Koenigsegg Agera R, I can't
think of a car that is better

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.366
qualified to destroy
its rear tires.

00:01:09.226 --> 00:01:14.406
So this is a C63 on absolutely
standard tires, 18-inch rims.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:19.532
The rear tires are 255 sections,
the fronts are 235s.

00:01:19.532 --> 00:01:21.504
I've left the systems
on now, OK?

00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:36.787
I'm getting oversteer
everywhere.

00:01:36.787 --> 00:01:38.759
This is a Millbrooks
handling track.

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.731
It's quite famous actually
because it's treacherous.

00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:46.948
[INAUDIBLE], and there's
not massive amounts.

00:01:46.948 --> 00:01:48.932
We have a concrete surface,
which is quite

00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:50.182
harsh on the tires.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.380
So you can see, I've having
to make very few steering

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.630
corrections.

00:02:04.308 --> 00:02:05.796
[INAUDIBLE], I have to say.

00:02:05.796 --> 00:02:08.276
But you know what?

00:02:08.276 --> 00:02:11.736
In these conditions, this
doesn't feel like it has an

00:02:11.736 --> 00:02:13.746
enormous amount of grip.

00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:15.636
When we say, "mechanical grip,"
we mean, "tire grip,"

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:17.986
because there is no aero
grip in this car.

00:02:17.986 --> 00:02:20.336
Doesn't feel that grippy,
because the

00:02:20.336 --> 00:02:23.156
surface is a bit wet.

00:02:23.156 --> 00:02:26.626
What the hell is it going to
be like when I've got a 125

00:02:26.626 --> 00:02:29.748
section tire on it?

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:32.213
The mind boggles.

00:02:32.213 --> 00:02:39.616
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:39.616 --> 00:02:42.936
That's right, we're going to
alter the power to rubber

00:02:42.936 --> 00:02:47.026
ratio even further in
favor of that motor.

00:02:47.026 --> 00:02:49.406
These are space-saver tires that
are supposed to be used

00:02:49.406 --> 00:02:52.716
to get you to the next garage
after a puncture.

00:02:52.716 --> 00:02:56.496
In fact, these are special AMG
versions that have vast spokes

00:02:56.496 --> 00:02:58.316
to clear those massive
brake calipers.

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:12.116
And so here we are, the change
from 255 to 125.

00:03:12.116 --> 00:03:16.256
Looks kind of slippy,
doesn't it?

00:03:16.256 --> 00:03:18.176
Now there are two ways of
looking at the choice little

00:03:18.176 --> 00:03:18.996
modification behind me.

00:03:18.996 --> 00:03:21.326
On the one hand, we could get
the calculators out, go all

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.986
geeky, and work out the
exact increase in

00:03:23.986 --> 00:03:25.546
power to rubber ratio.

00:03:25.546 --> 00:03:28.946
Or should that be decrease
in rubber to power ratio?

00:03:28.946 --> 00:03:29.896
I can't work it out.

00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:32.456
On the other hand, we could do
what my photographer, Neil,

00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:35.866
just said to me earlier, well,
hang on a minute, the 125

00:03:35.866 --> 00:03:39.936
section space-saver's about a
third of the width of a normal

00:03:39.936 --> 00:03:42.306
tire, a normal 255
section tire.

00:03:42.306 --> 00:03:44.496
So that's about three times
the horsepower.

00:03:44.496 --> 00:03:46.596
So let's say the car's got
around 1,200 horsepower.

00:03:46.596 --> 00:03:50.956
So what we have behind me
is a C63 Coupe with 1200

00:03:50.956 --> 00:03:51.246
horsepower.

00:03:51.246 --> 00:03:53.489
And that is a good thing.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:04:01.176
And so here we have it, this
is the C63 AMG Coupe with

00:04:01.176 --> 00:04:06.166
Power Pack, 480 horsepower,
on 125 section tires.

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:07.846
What's it going to be like?

00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:11.166
Got manual, gearbox selected,
I've got all the traction

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:13.467
control off.

00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:14.361
It's a little tippy in here.

00:04:14.361 --> 00:04:16.556
See what we get.

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:20.294
Tires are at 60 PSI, which
feels quite a lot.

00:04:20.294 --> 00:04:21.755
So this is [INAUDIBLE]
throttle.

00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:25.164
So there we go, oversteer
immediately.

00:04:28.573 --> 00:04:31.008
Oh, oh, oh.

00:04:31.008 --> 00:04:33.666
This is marvelous.

00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:40.176
We have just invented possibly
the greatest driving machine

00:04:40.176 --> 00:04:42.726
on the planet.

00:04:42.726 --> 00:04:52.396
The C63 Coupe on space-savers
might be the best handling car

00:04:52.396 --> 00:04:54.895
in the world.

00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:58.759
Oh, come on.

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.657
This was in third gear last
time, and this time it's full

00:05:01.657 --> 00:05:04.416
[INAUDIBLE].

00:05:04.416 --> 00:05:06.697
I got no traction in third,
it just lights up.

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:20.936
[LAUGHS]

00:05:20.936 --> 00:05:24.336
Can't quite ignore that
one, but all the rest

00:05:24.336 --> 00:05:27.436
of it's just marvelous.

00:05:27.436 --> 00:05:28.946
It's got a locking
deferential.

00:05:28.946 --> 00:05:30.761
Non-standard, but you
need it for this.

00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:35.416
Oh, come on.

00:05:35.416 --> 00:05:40.276
This is the best handling
car I've driven in ages.

00:05:40.276 --> 00:05:41.789
It just is so predictable.

00:05:48.172 --> 00:05:49.645
It's just a joy.

00:05:49.645 --> 00:05:51.609
It's a joy.

00:05:51.609 --> 00:05:54.106
OK, initial impressions.

00:05:54.106 --> 00:05:59.340
If you're going to buy a C63, it
needs to have space-savers.

00:06:04.296 --> 00:06:06.093
This is the bit when we get to
discuss the moral of this

00:06:06.093 --> 00:06:09.816
brief tale as you watch some
sexy, slo-mo shots at 200

00:06:09.816 --> 00:06:10.886
frames per second.

00:06:10.886 --> 00:06:13.816
A bit like they did at the
end of He-Man, but He

00:06:13.816 --> 00:06:15.966
gets a great new V8.

00:06:15.966 --> 00:06:19.276
So is there anything serious to
be learned from bunging an

00:06:19.276 --> 00:06:23.216
AMG onto pathetically small
tires and pulling big drifts?

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.266
Actually, you know
what, there is.

00:06:25.266 --> 00:06:29.306
Modern sports cars are now so
obsessed with lap times and

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:31.786
circuit performance, that at
normal road speeds they're

00:06:31.786 --> 00:06:34.746
mostly boring because they never
come close to moving

00:06:34.746 --> 00:06:37.126
around, making the
driver work.

00:06:37.126 --> 00:06:41.446
OK, a 125 section's excessive,
but this does prove that

00:06:41.446 --> 00:06:44.176
narrower tires equal fun.

00:06:44.176 --> 00:06:47.641
And on the street, fun
is better than speed.

00:06:52.006 --> 00:07:49.873
