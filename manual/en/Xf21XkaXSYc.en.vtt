Hi, I'm Kim with Simply Beautiful in Austin,
Texas. I'd like to talk to you a little about

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.389
how to prevent and cure acne. Now this is
a large subject that can't really be covered

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.059
in a short amount of time, but I'm going to
tell you the basics. We're going to do a really,

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.400
really good cleaning on your face. So cleanse,
tone, moisturize with an oil-free hydrator.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.210
You're going to mask twice a week and you're
going to exfoliate. We want the pores to be

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.750
really, really clean. I'm going to demonstrate
on Nancy and we're going to show you exfoliation

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:43.310
and masking on her hand. So, the products
I'm going to recommend to you are alcohol-free.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.100
Now most people - go ahead and put your hand
out. Most people who are a little bit oily

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.550
 - those people who are prone to acne - want
to get alcohol onto their skin because they

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.329
feel like they get rid of that oil really
well that way. But what really happens is

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.610
it dries out the surface of your skin. Once
the surface layer of your skin gets dried

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.000
out, the sebaceous glands, or your oil glands,
overproduce oil because it wants to compensate

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.040
for that dryness. So don't use alcohol. You
can get your skin clean in other ways. Use

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.780
a very mild cleanser to begin with. I really
like Cetaphil. It's a great cleanser for almost

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.780
any skin. Okay, cleanser, toner - which is
what we just did - alcohol-free. Once a week

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.670
I want you to use a very, very gentle scrub.
Let me see your hand. You're going to get

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.610
your skin wet with water. Just a little warm
water, open those pores. Not hot water because

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.210
hot water, again, dries out the surface of
your skin. This is a really mild seven day

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.039
scrub from Clinique. Love it, because it's
really, really gentle. Don't push really hard

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.939
 - lightly, with your fingertips, in circular
motions. This is going to get all the dead

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:08.420
skin off the surface. Dead skin blocks pores
and if a pore is blocked, that's what's going

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:16.730
to create acne for you - a breakout. So lightly,
in circular motions. Rinse your skin again

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:29.840
with warm water. This is just a little water.
Over the top. Once that's done, once you exfoliate,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.400
you may as well go right into your mud mask.
Any mud mask will do, honestly. Borghese has,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:45.020
what I think, is the best one, but Swiss Ives
has one too. We're going to put a thin layer

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:55.040
on. What that's going to do is draw the oil
and the dirt out of the pores. Now, I'm warning

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.800
you, as that dirt and oil comes up through
the skin, you may find that you're having

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.430
a little bit more breakouts at the beginning.
But once you get through that difficult part,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.190
your pores are going to be cleaner and you
won't be having as many breakouts. If you

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:20.270
keep a good skin routine - keep your skin
really , really clean - you're going to reduce

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.629
the incidents of your acne. Don't pick your
skin when you have a break out. Everybody

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.540
has a tendency to want to pick it. That's
just going to break the surface of your skin

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:36.050
and cause scarring. Keep a sunscreen on. Use
an oil-free moisturizer to hydrate the surface

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:46.810
of your skin. Drink lots of water, because
that tends to flush out the oil glands, and

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.550
change your pillow case every night because
the oil gets on there and the bacteria does,

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.770
too.
