Hi, this is Troy Roberts.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.040
Today we are going to talk about the correct
finger place for the alto saxophone.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.640
Your first finger is going to go on the B
key, which is right here.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.570
Your second finger is going to go on the A
key, which is right here.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.210
In between that we have a little B flat bus
key.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:37.270
The third finger is going to go on the G key,
which is right above this little finger stack,

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.270
here.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:45.079
The little finger controls this stack of keys,
here.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:55.980
On the right hand, the first finger goes on
the F key, second finger goes on the E key,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.860
and the third finger goes on the D key.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.320
Your little finger on your right hand controls
these keys down here, which are the E flat

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.610
and the low C.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.680
That is finger placement, but we also have
thumbs and the sides of your hands, which

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.930
also control keys.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.480
The thumb controls the octave key, back here.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:34.500
Your left palm controls the side D, which
is high D, E flat, and F. Your left little

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:50.720
finger controls this little stack of keys
here, G sharp, C sharp, B, and B flat.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:02:03.740
Your right palm, or side of your hand, controls
the side keys here, which is B flat, C, and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:12.920
high E. It is important to remember when you
are playing the saxophone you have got all

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.340
your fingers and thumbs doing their job, it
is important to pretend you are holding a

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.040
couple of tennis balls, to keep your fingers
rounded and your palms out so that they are

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.260
not hitting any keys, side palm keys, by accident.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
We keep them rounded like you are holding
a couple of tennis balls, and that way you

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.760
can efficiently reach every key you need to.
