00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.080
MN8 Foxfire is the use of advanced photoluminescent pigments

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.389
that are placed in various items for
firefighters.

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:30.679
We can suspend these pigments in
different types of carriers such as high

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.760
temperature grade silicone,

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.530
epoxies, and different types of things
that are very high heat resistant and

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.920
very heavy-duty and they give off illumination for up to seventeen to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.950
twenty hours based on a very quick
charge.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.100
I see this as an incredible benefit for my

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.230
brother firefighters that are out there.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.060
Some of the biggest risks that
firefighters encounter is

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.940
uh... lack of visibility, accountability
of their tools and each other, and then

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.460
disorientation

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.500
and when i first discovered this
technology and the applications that it can be used for

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.610
with firefighting

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.900
I knew it's something that i had to do

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.340
to help the fire industry and what's happened
over the last year or so has been quite

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.160
incredible how it has started transforming
and changing the way that we conduct

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.140
firefighting operations.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.510
One of the things that we are

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.430
constantly striving for is firefighter safety.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.880
Firefighter safety with regard to the
Foxfire products are really threefold

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.330
number one is if you're the company
officer

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.620
and you're in a very low light environment

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.159
you can at least keep track of your crew by seeing

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.580
where those helmet bands are illuminating 
or where the tools that they're carrying

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.790
to assist them are.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.430
The tool itself

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.329
may be what you need to

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.980
extricate yourself or others

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.860
in your team and

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.939
losing it

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:52.740
in a very

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.700
darkened environment

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.369
is akin to you having never taken

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.950
it in.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.220
The third situation for firefighter safety
is knowing the way in and knowing the

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.370
way out

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.169
and

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:10.259
especially with secondary means of
egress such as a ladder through a window,

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.139
if that is painted with

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:16.059
the luminescent paint - the epoxy paint,

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:17.229
hopefully

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:21.790
the person will be able to see it once they
get close to that window and know that

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.039
that is the way out. As

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:28.789
the smoke conditions become worse, when
they become closer to the ground

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:31.939
then the visibility of me being able to
see

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.619
a foot, two foot in front of me

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:39.289
become more difficult. We tried to
manufacturer our turnout gear with

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:41.100
striping on it that will help but

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.210
when you hit smokey environments it becomes
more difficult to see through that, it

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.189
doesn't cut through the smoke as well.

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.819
One of the good things about the uh...
Foxfire product

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.609
is that it requires no other
lights and it seems to do a very good job

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.099
of cutting through the smoke products.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.949
It is important to keep track your
tools just in case you do need them

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:06.459
in certain circumstances, say if you're
doing overhaul pulling ceiling lots of

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.779
drywall is coming down on the ground and
you set your tool down for a second and

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:15.040
a big piece of drywall or rubble comes down
and your tool is covered. Without Foxfire

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.099
usually it would be covered and your captain
would be mad at you because you 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.229
lost your tool.

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.519
Now with Foxfire I

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.180
can set it down, rubble may fall down, and it
will be illuminated through some rubble and I

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.639
will be able to find it later. The Foxfire
product is relatively inexpensive

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.279
and the line fireman

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.919
is certainly able to purchase it on his own

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.729
to give him that additional safety.

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:43.249
We felt very strongly about it after seeing
our members wearing it that we started

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:44.810
purchasing the product

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.569
uh... as a department.

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.189
Every product

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.439
that foxfire has compliments one another

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.459
uh... it's all geared toward firefighter safety.

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.749
You can take part of that package you
can take all of that package but it is

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:00.149
all geared in its illumination

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:02.180
towards firefighter safety

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.159
and their accountability.
