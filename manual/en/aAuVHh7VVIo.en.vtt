00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Hey there, Fish Fans! Ashley here from Zoo Med. Today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.240
use Zoo Med's AguaSun® Aquarium Timers. Timers are a helpful tools that can be

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.110
used to automatically control electrical
components such as lights and pumps in

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.670
your aquarium. Zoo Med's AquaSun® Timers are available in three different styles

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.740
to help you regulate your aquarium. The
AquaSun® Aquarium Timer has one outlet

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.390
that can automatically turn on and off a
single lamp or other element. The AquaSun®

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.550
Aquarium Controller has a total of
eight outlets. The front timer controls

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.750
the four timed outlets, while the four
'switched' outlets provide constant power.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.910
The AquaSun Dual Timer has one outlet
that's controlled by the timer, and one

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.640
constant power outlet. A bypass switch on the side of each Timer allows the option

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.670
to bypass the timer and provide power to
all outlets at any time. AquaSun® Timers

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.260
are easy to use. For this demonstration,
we'll set up the AquaSun® Aquarium Timer

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.040
to turn a light on at 8 a.m., and turn it
off at 8 p.m. On the Timer, locate the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.900
ring of tabs around the dial. Push down
the tabs adjacent to the times you want

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.530
the lamp to be on. After you've programmed the hours of activation, turn the dial

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.640
until the arrow on the timer's face
points to the current time of day. For

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.140
now we'll say it's 3:30 p.m.
Ensure that the bypass switch is set to

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.370
'Timer' or 'Timer ON,' so that it will
provide power according to the times set.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.690
The AquaSun® Aquarium Controller has a
Power Switch on the top that should be

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.430
set to the 'Reset' position. Make sure the
devices you're plugging into the Timer

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.550
are set to the 'On' position. Finally, put
the timer into use by plugging it into

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.840
an accessible GFCI protected power
outlet, and plugging your device into the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.990
timer. That's all, for now. Thanks for watching.
