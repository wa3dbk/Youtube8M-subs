00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.650
And maybe we'll be through in a couple of
weeks.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.309
They say an eco-friendly house can't be built
in 150 days for $150,000, and I say it can.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.309
I'm Allen Smith.

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:21.770
Join me as I push the limits with time, budget
and creativity with the Garden Home Challenge,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.630
exclusively on eHow Home.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.779
Everything in a house is connected to a schedule.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.800
And right now, our schedule is a little messed
up-- we're off.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.079
We got the utilities figured out.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.510
Right now, we need to paint.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.390
The most important thing we need to do is
finish painting the inside of this house.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.110
And right now, all we've done is primed most
everything in the house.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.739
So we are waiting.

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.350
We've been about two weeks, and we got all
our paint colors picked out.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.430
We want to use low VLC paints when we do them.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.610
And so, what we're doing is we're waiting
to finish the painting inside, so that we

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.030
can finish out the trim.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.060
So all these things inside-outside are connected.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.710
And right now, until we finish the paint--
until we finish the paint, we cannot talk

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.319
about countertops or installing them.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.719
We can't talk about any backsplash.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:23.540
We can't install any tile in the bathroom,
downstairs or upstairs.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.119
We can't really move forward at all.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.639
And what we need to do is finish this painting
quickly.

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:38.259
We have a range, a microwave, a refrigerator
to go in, and we can't get those in-- and

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.259
a dishwasher.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.729
We can't get those in right now, because we
got to get through with the paint, you know.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.700
And then back to the countertops, the backsplash--
everything like that.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.700
And then we also have, you know, other issues:
We need to, you know, we can't do anything

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.399
with our lightening, our grill work on our
mini-splits-- anything like that to, or 'til,

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.880
we get through painting.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.490
So a lot of the choices right now are, or
the delays we're having right now, are not

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.829
weather delays.

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.690
We're simply just waiting on Allen to make
those decisions, and final decisions.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.219
And, I mean, final decisions on paint colors
and how the cabinets are gonna finish out,

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.680
and how the bathrooms-- and those tile choices
in the bathrooms are really important.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.650
And right now, we're really struggling with
our master bedroom vanity and our upstairs

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.650
vanity.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.739
So, and how many bowls we're using and what
kinda countertops that we're gonna put on

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:36.739
them.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.629
And until we have the vanities in, we can't
measure for countertops.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.370
And until we have the vanities in, we can't
finish the paint either.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.560
So, we have have several decisions that need
to come from Allen, so that we can wrap this

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.470
up.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.510
Some said I should've played.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:20.629
I'm such a klutz.
