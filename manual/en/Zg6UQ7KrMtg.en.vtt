00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.840
Hi YouTube, Darth Here:
Today's the third day of the four-day pre-release

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.419
of Final Stand on the CTE.

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:09.450
Like the other two days, we've got a new map
to look at, and today's is Hangar 21.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.780
We're only getting a one-day look at this
content, so my videos covering these maps

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.370
are going to be skin-deep reactions.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.720
Once the DLC is actually out, I'll go into
much more detail on these maps.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.740
But before I talk about the map, I have a
quick news update on the CTE: today DICE released

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.240
a patch fixing the ridiculousness of the SC-42
metal storm which would cause vehicles hit

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.400
by it to go barreling out of control.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.000
You can see an example of this in my first
day impressions on Operation Whiteout.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.320
With that out of the way, let's talk all about
this new map, Hangar 21.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.050
First and foremost, we've got the first and
only night map of Battlefield 4.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.710
The community has been asking for a night
map for a long time, and DICE LA has delivered.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.310
Gameplay wise, this won't change much, as
it's a very light full moon night outside

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.310
the Hangar.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.129
This might be kind of disappointing to anybody
who was hoping for a total blackout outside.

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.559
Speaking of outside, you might have noticed
this trend in the previous two maps we've

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.290
seen, but this map is also enormous.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.219
Hangar has 21 six flags, four of which are
outside, and two of which are in the hangar

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.219
itself.

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:07.610
Aside from numerous transportation vehicles,
and two jets, this map is almost entirely

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.950
infantry-focused.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.050
There's no armor, and that's the differentiating
factor from the previous two Final Stand maps

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.490
that we've seen so far.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.860
Combined with a lot of open terrain outside,
and long sight lines inside and outside, not

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.650
having armor makes the map a sniper's playground.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.600
While the distances between flags aren't oppressively
long, there isn't a lot of great cover between

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.950
them, and, the exceptionally vertical nature
of the map only intensifies the constant threat

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:30.950
outside.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.869
This would be exceptionally annoying if not
for a mitigating factor.

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.360
Hangar 21 has some new technology that comes
to the rescue: the four escape pod launchers.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.110
At both Foxtrot and just outside the hangar,
there are two launchers that you can use to

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.439
get yourself to just about any point on the
map in rather quick time.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.760
It's basically your own personal human cannon.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.990
The problem you'll run into is that they make
exceptionally noticeable targets, and the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.810
moment you pop your parachute coming out of
one, the enemy is probably going to see you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.310
if they are at the point you're trying to
head to.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.790
But they definitely make for an interesting
way to get around the large map very quickly.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.040
Or, make a crater of yourself very quickly.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.990
Outside, the points are pretty much on par
with what we've come to expect in Final Stand.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.629
They have light protective clutter, and maybe
a building or two next to them.

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.659
What I like to call the "sniper tower" radar
dome makes its return on this map at point

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:15.659
Delta.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.709
I believe this is also the location of the
railgun on this map, but I didn't go sniffing

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.569
around that point for too long because of
the constant attention it receives from every

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.769
corner of the map.

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.180
But like previous maps we have seen, I think
this map has a bit of a multiple personality

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.180
disorder.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.439
I believe there are actually three maps in
Hangar 21.

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.989
There's the outside, which I've already covered.

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.999
Then there's the air superiority map with
huge flight ceilings, clouds, and wide open

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:41.939
flying area that seems to be made for stealth
jet pilots to just shoot at each other all

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.690
day without really affecting the outcome of
the map.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.829
Finally, there's the beating heart of the
map, the hangar itself.

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.290
And inside the Hangar is a Titan under construction.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.670
If you're not familiar by now, this entire
DLC is a tribute to Battlefield 2142, and

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.540
tells the backstory of how the technology
of that game saw its start.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.069
Like the Walker factory on Giants of Karelia,
this interior is tailor-made for infantry

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.069
combat.

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.230
It's absolutely enormous inside the Hangar,
and there's a lot of extremely long walkways,

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.889
underbellies, side-paths, and countless leveled
tiers to fight up the inside in the hangar

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.280
and on the Titan itself.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.529
The inside of this hangar could be an entire
conquest map itself.

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:21.549
Frankly, I wish it were, but I have a feeling
that that is what the Domination map will

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:22.549
be for.

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.480
And I certainly can't wait to see Rush on
this map.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.519
But, with just two capture points on the inside
of the Hangar, it still provided quite a bit

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.689
of good focused infantry play, something that
I think has been generally lacking in this

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:33.689
DLC.

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.569
There's two levolution events on this map,
and both take place in the hangar.

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.790
First, there's the closing of the hangar doors,
which is accomplished from the upper most

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.089
scaffold on the right side facing outwards.

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:46.359
Secondly, the trailer in the bottom back of
the level controls the other levolution.

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.809
And that's the test firing of the Titans engines.

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:52.569
If you're curious as to why this levolution
matters, there's an entire underbelly to the

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.530
Titan hangar that gets scorched out when the
engines are fired up.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.260
It's really cool looking, but just don't get
caught in the blast.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.959
Overall, I think this is another map that
I'm guessing will keep me playing Domination,

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.219
Rush, or TDM.

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:07.260
I think these outside areas are fine, but
I just don't find them all that interesting.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.819
And if you've seen my other two videos, you
know how I feel about maps that make you crawl

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.119
over open terrain for hundreds of meters.

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:17.000
I just think that the interior of the Hangar
is the interesting, new, fun thing on this

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
map.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.579
It feels like the main course when the rest
of the map is just dressing, or maybe even

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.579
a garnish.

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:26.270
And while the size of these maps, thematically,
reminds me of Battlefield 3's Armored Kill

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.090
expansion, I feel like they have actually
been a better experience.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.380
In both Giants of Karelia, and now in Hangar
21, there are tucked away areas of the map

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.080
that are genuinely interesting.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.270
I just wish they were more of the map's focus,
because undulating hills just aren't that

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.270
interesting.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.319
In any case, we've got one more map coming
tomorrow, Hammerhead.

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:47.259
I'm curious to see if the map sticks with
the themes we've seen so far, or if it breaks

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.009
the combo and becomes the Guilin Peaks of
this DLC.

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.520
Anyways, that's it for my day three impressions
of the pre-release of Final Stand.
