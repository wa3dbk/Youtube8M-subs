00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.699
Hi, Alan Stratton, from As Wood Turns dot
com.

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:16.320
Last week when I made this wizard's wand,
I did not know that it would be such a busy

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.890
week in wands. In fact, Carl Jacobson made
one also and mentioned he was making them

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.500
for an Boy Scout Eagle Project for a children's
hospital in Salt Lake City. So during the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.480
Oregon Steam Up, that I went to this weekend,
I made several more that I will send off to

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.770
the children's hospital.
But there were some who insinuated that my

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.440
wand inventory was not sufficient because
I did not have an eccentric wand, initially.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.050
Now, let me assure you that I have eccentric
wands in my shop inventory here. Ready to

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.829
go, at a moments notice. And, in a younger
day, I would have just thrown a curse your

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.780
way such as "Wood Splinter'm" or "Wood Fly
away". But Dumbledore has gotten to me and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.820
now I am more calm and collected. So, I will
not throw a curse to you right now. I will

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.729
show you how to turn an eccentric blade for
a wand today. And then you tell me what curses

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.460
you would have used in my place in a former
day.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.080
I'm starting with a cylinder of red oak. I've
marked it with approximate divisions for the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.950
point, each turning axis, and a handle transition.
I'll leave the point portion square to preserve

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.370
as much wood as possible. Otherwise, I fear
the wood may split if too near the edge. I've

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.359
also predrilled a hole for the tail stock
at each axis point. Again, so the wood will

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:53.060
not split when I change the axis. Each of
the four axis holes is about Â¼ inch off center.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.740
I've shifted the wood to the first eccentric
axis. With a gouge, I'll carefully cut away

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.890
the ghost image until I see solid wood. Even
then, it is not quite round.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.520
Then apply my beeswax/mineral oil mix and
sand the first area. I'll start this time

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.410
at 120 grit and go to 400 grit, adding more
sanding media as necessary. Finally, I give

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.160
it a spin at high speed to melt in the wax/oil
mix.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.850
Then carefully, move the live center to the
next axis. I'm being careful to move to the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.250
next hole around the end. I expect this will
preserve as much continuity in the wood grain

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.580
as possible rather than flipping to an opposite
axis.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.190
Then off again with the gouge. I'll stop the
lathe frequently to check the transition between

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.270
the segments. They're impossible to see with
the lathe running. The ghosts are just not

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.500
that reliable.
With the second segment, I'm starting to fight

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.450
the flex of the cylinder. Pressure from the
gouge is pushing it backward. Unless, I take

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.920
a very light cut, I'm getting a lot of unwanted
chatter.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.510
Again, sand and finish this segment while
I can.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.500
Now carefully, move the axis to the third
position. Now, I'm really fighting the flex.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.450
I thought about mounting a steady rest -- but
where would it go. A steady rest could only

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.590
run on the portion I'm working, That's counter-productive.
There's some pretty wild chatter. If I could

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.440
only get chatter that good where I want it.
I'll crank up the rpm's but there's a limit

00:03:35.440 --> 00:04:08.720
to what I feel safe to run at. I'll try a
skew but...

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:42.910
Again, sand and finish this segment while
I can. This segment took more sanding than

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.310
the previous ones.
Now for the fourth axis. I'm now getting closer

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.750
to the headstock -- the wood is stabilizing
a bit -- a little less deflection and less

00:04:51.750 --> 00:05:17.880
chatter despite the thinness of this blade.
Again, sand and finish this segment.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.590
Now for the transition to the handle. I'll
taper it down, then form somewhat of a bead

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:51.721
just above the tenon for the handle.
Now to cut the tenon in two stages. Pretty

00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:58.460
rough down to 7/16" then gently down to the
3/8" final. A final check with the calipers.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.330
The wrench cutters tend to leave the tenon
a little large. Then a bit more sanding and

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.410
finishing.
That leaves the point. Some would have tacked

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:12.220
it already. I needed as much wood there as
I could get -- even at the cost of having

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:24.010
to return to the other end. Fortunately, the
point will be on the center axis.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.800
I'll do the near final sanding and finishing
while it is still attached.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.460
I'll saw off the little bit of wood at the
end of the tenon and round it slightly on

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:38.090
a sander. Then gently mount the blade again
in the long jaws of a scroll chuck. It barely

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:44.139
fits. Otherwise, I'd have to adapt a faceplate.
Now just a little careful, touchup on the

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:48.930
point of the blade and we're finished.
Now anyone who doubts the extent of my wand

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:56.370
inventory will get a dousey of a curse. Perhaps
"Wood Shatter'm" or "Gouge Slipp'm". In the

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.340
Harry Potter tradition, please share your
favorite woodturning curses.

keep you updated.
Have fun and be safe -- always wear a full

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:11.790
face shield. Hmmm. Maybe that's another curse.
"Faceshield Fog Totalus".
