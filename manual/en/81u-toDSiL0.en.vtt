00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.779
Before I get into the next demonstration,
I want to take some time to show you how to

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.100
make a stitch without having it show on the
front side so if you're hemming a pair of

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.590
pants, this is your pant hem and this is the
front of your pant. What you're going to want

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.429
to do is make a hem, or excuse me, make a
stitch to stitch it up, but you're going to

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:32.630
want it to be invisible on this side so what
you're going to do is you want to put your

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:39.610
knot inside of the hem so you can't see it
and then to make it so it's invisible you're

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.480
going to want to on this part which is the
pant part which is going to show you want

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.940
to just pick up one or two of the threads
within the weave. You don't want it to show

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.780
on the other side so I'm just picking up a
couple of threads and then I'm going to go

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:09.070
into the hem. You can pick more threads on
the hem and then just pick up a couple, one

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:21.799
or two threads on the top. This ensures that
it won't show on the right side so it won't

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:35.079
look like you hemmed your pants. They'll look
clean. So there we are and as you can see,

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.829
you cannot see it on the front side because
you didn't put the needle all the way through.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.999
You only put the needle through a couple of
threads, picked up a couple, it will be strong

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:51.450
enough, it'll hold once you continue on around
the whole service, but it will not show on

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:00.139
the front. So with that in mind, I'm going
to show you now some other steps now that

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:01.169
we learned this technique.
