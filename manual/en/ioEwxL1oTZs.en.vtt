00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.500
O.k. In this segment we're going to cover,
removing the passenger side rear back rest.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.320
For the back seat. First thing we have to
do, as we did on the other side. Before we're

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.839
going to remove the back rest. We have to
remove the carpet from it. This section of

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.790
carpet is for the hatch back. And steamed
like the rear trunk or hatch back carpet.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.810
And it's a separate identity from the actual
interior carpet. Because once the seats are

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.500
folded up, there's a divider that goes in
the hatch back. And it's actually sealed off,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.570
from the rest of the interior compartment.
When it's in that load. But if you want to

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.960
keep the continuity, just say of the vehicle
together. this will be a separate carpet identity.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.429
If you want to replace it. And so, you've
got matching new carpets. Both front and rear.

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:49.351
But also keep in mind, that's not really available
to the occupants on the interior of the car.

00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:56.530
When the equipment's installed. So following
the same procedure, using our tool. We'll

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.289
release the push pins. And in our previous,
we removed about six of the or four of the

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.720
six. That are necessary to get it. Then sliding
upwards, pull the bracket off, on this clipper.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.210
We'll just fold that back another way. Once
again, we've got that spacer pin. That's located

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.500
on the outside of the seat. And sometimes,
you can remove with your fingers. And sometimes,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:31.390
you have to use pliers.
There's a spacer pin. We'll set that aside.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.810
Now that allows us to push the seat over.
And when we push it over, it comes off the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.090
mail end, on to the fitting on this side.
And we can just simply, slide the seat out.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.170
Once again, we're going to want to set this
aside. Clean, dry environment along with the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:55.210
spacer pin, it locks it in.
Now in our next segment, we're going to cover

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.210
moving the bench portion. And other rear seat.
It's a one piece unit. So the rear seat kind

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.370
of, breaks down into three components. You've
got the two back rests and the actual seat

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.750
cushion, itself. So please watch our next
segment. And we'll cover removing our rear

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.149
seat cushion.
