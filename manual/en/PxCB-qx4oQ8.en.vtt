00:00:27.864 --> 00:00:32.624
What you can see behind me is the University of Art and Design-

00:00:32.624 --> 00:00:37.500
-which shares the facilities with KICL, Kyoto Institute of Culture and Language.

00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:58.305
It's hot today, isn't it? You put on your hat and...

00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:03.089
- Walk?
- Take a walk?

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:10.264
"You put on your hat and take a walk" is okay, but 
 you can also say "Put on your hat and go out"

00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:15.651
The teacher's way of explaining is easy to understand.

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:18.321
You get to learn fast.

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:24.172
I have fun during the lessons and enjoy it a lot.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.377
Every day you're using Japanese constantly.

00:01:27.377 --> 00:01:33.344
And especially I think the biggest thing is you 
 get to study next to the university-

00:01:33.344 --> 00:01:39.143
-and you can actually meet Japanese students, make some 
 friends and converse in Japanese with them.

00:01:55.868 --> 00:01:59.580
What purpose does the students usually have when they come here to study?

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:03.670
You could divide people into two or three groups, the first one-

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:08.960
-is people who want to enter a university or vocational school.

00:02:08.964 --> 00:02:14.160
Another one is people who want to use their Japanese skills to find work.

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:19.250
The last one is people that are just 
 have a burning interest in Japanese culture-

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.570
-and want to study the language on top of that.

00:02:23.778 --> 00:02:25.470
These three are the most common purposes.

00:02:25.473 --> 00:02:28.970
There are really a lot of students from different countries.

00:02:29.235 --> 00:02:32.420
In my class though, about half of the students are from Taiwan.

00:02:32.416 --> 00:02:36.870
Then we have students from Thailand, Sweden, England and so forth.

00:02:36.874 --> 00:02:43.440
The students in the beginner class are mostly people that 
 had no previous experience of studying Japanese at all.

00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:48.460
The mid-beginner class are usually people who've studied a little bit back home-

00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:52.610
-and then come here to take their studies to the next level.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.330
They recognize some things that they've studied in 
 the past and then build upon that.

00:02:57.331 --> 00:03:05.160
If you want to have a drink with someone you know, 
 I truthfully think you should meet them in real life.

00:03:05.156 --> 00:03:10.940
- Instead of drinking with friends online...
- I think this way is better.

00:03:10.938 --> 00:03:14.160
But when you really can't meet people for 
 some reason, what do you do then?

00:03:14.165 --> 00:03:16.980
You do your best to try and meet them.

00:03:17.393 --> 00:03:21.250
The school's strong points? It's hard to summarize in a few words but-

00:03:21.247 --> 00:03:30.440
-what we're aiming on is not only to make the students 
 learn Japanese, but to learn many things IN Japanese.

00:03:31.162 --> 00:03:35.310
Besides studying, do you have any cultural events?

00:03:35.306 --> 00:03:40.450
We have many of them. This is not something that we separate-

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.700
- but rather encourage the student to use the 
 Japanese they've learned on these kinds of events.

00:03:45.698 --> 00:03:53.040
Our school's students and university students from around 
 Kyoto get together and meet each other.

00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:56.730
Everyone, you should definitely come to Japan.

00:03:56.727 --> 00:04:04.720
Come to discover many things and experience many situations.

00:04:04.715 --> 00:04:10.990
For this, we think there are no greater place than Kyoto.

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.930
We will be waiting for you to come and study at our school.
