00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.366
- So, you know that feeling
when you're searching

00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.889
for something and then, moments later,

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:05.424
there's ads popping up trying
to sell you that thing?

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:07.322
You're, like, "Is there
somebody watching me?

00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:09.241
"Am I okay with that?"

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:12.216
And I think it's similar
to the feeling I have

00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:15.545
when recently I was talking
to somebody with Google Glass,

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.076
and it's like I'm talking to that person,

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:20.449
and it's, like, "Are you looking at me,

00:00:20.818 --> 00:00:24.723
"because I can't tell and
I'm not okay with that."

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:25.753
I'm Tiffany Schlain.

00:00:25.753 --> 00:00:29.453
I'm a mother, filmmaker, I
founded the Webby Awards,

00:00:29.453 --> 00:00:31.070
and this series is about how the future

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.912
doesn't start somewhere
far off in the distance.

00:00:34.419 --> 00:00:36.249
The future starts here.

00:00:41.463 --> 00:00:45.058
(smooth rock music)

00:00:45.296 --> 00:00:47.370
- I love thinking about this kind of stuff

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.356
and you know who else loves thinking

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:49.520
about this kind of stuff?

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.725
My husband, Ken, 'cuz he's
a professor or robotics.

00:00:52.768 --> 00:00:53.537
Hey!

00:00:53.537 --> 00:00:54.120
- Hey!

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.152
- So, Ken, what is this all about?

00:00:55.152 --> 00:00:56.604
Why are we creating technologies that

00:00:56.604 --> 00:00:58.722
are getting more and more creepy?

00:00:58.722 --> 00:01:01.145
- (Ken) Well, as our technologies
become more sophisticated,

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:03.204
they're becoming more and more lifelike.

00:01:03.204 --> 00:01:05.221
That triggers a primitive reflex in us

00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:08.164
because we know it's not
human, but it's too close.

00:01:08.164 --> 00:01:10.190
- (Tiffany) Which is
uncomfortable and kind of creepy.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.489
- (Ken) Exactly.

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:12.828
And there's a word for this.

00:01:12.828 --> 00:01:14.573
They call it "the uncanny."

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:15.837
- (Tiffany) The uncanny.

00:01:15.837 --> 00:01:17.205
- (Ken) And it's not just technologies

00:01:17.205 --> 00:01:19.836
that trigger this reflex,
it's all sorts of things

00:01:19.836 --> 00:01:22.455
that are close to being human but aren't,

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:27.993
like wax figures, dolls,
robots or zombies.

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:30.771
- (Tiffany) So, it's
like our body's response

00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:33.329
that warns you, "pay extra attention.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.369
"This might not be what it seems."

00:01:35.753 --> 00:01:37.428
(growling)

00:01:37.428 --> 00:01:39.157
(screaming)
(laughing)

00:01:39.157 --> 00:01:40.698
- (Ken) The things that
trigger this reflex

00:01:40.698 --> 00:01:43.124
fall into two categories.

00:01:43.124 --> 00:01:44.866
The first has to do with
things that are lifelike.

00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:47.939
Is this thing real or is it artificial?

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.643
That distinction has to be really clear

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:50.893
or else we get creeped out.

00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:52.084
- (Tiffany) Like those "reborner" dolls

00:01:52.084 --> 00:01:53.460
I just found out about, that are

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.730
way too lifelike and very creepy.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.614
- (Ken) Right.

00:01:56.614 --> 00:01:58.994
And the uncanny explains
the classic example

00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:00.679
or cartoon characters.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.502
Animators have learned that they can't

00:02:02.502 --> 00:02:04.213
make the eyes too realistic

00:02:04.428 --> 00:02:06.057
or they'll make us uncomfortable.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.462
Cartoons can't be too human.

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:10.193
The second category of things

00:02:10.193 --> 00:02:12.916
that trigger this reflex is surveillance.

00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:14.233
- (Tiffany) What do you mean?

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:16.778
- (Ken) Well, you know that creepy feeling

00:02:16.778 --> 00:02:18.632
you sometimes get when you feel like

00:02:18.632 --> 00:02:21.567
someone is secretly watching
you, like those websites--

00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:22.833
- Like the websites--
- (Ken) That we were talking about?

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:24.529
- (Tiffany) The ads pop up
- (Ken) Exactly.

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:27.783
- Or this very creepy
painting that's behind us

00:02:27.783 --> 00:02:29.000
that's been in our house forever.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.015
- Which painting?

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:30.681
- This one.

00:02:30.927 --> 00:02:32.271
He's watching us.

00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:32.952
- Right.

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:33.863
Exactly.

00:02:33.863 --> 00:02:35.568
- (Ken) Some of the
most advanced software's

00:02:35.568 --> 00:02:37.456
getting too close for comfort.

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:39.097
It's watching us like a hawk.

00:02:39.097 --> 00:02:40.517
- (Tiffany) Or even more uncomfortable,

00:02:40.517 --> 00:02:43.477
that little camera on your
laptop that can be hacked.

00:02:43.477 --> 00:02:45.318
I mean, someone could
just switch on your camera

00:02:45.318 --> 00:02:47.289
and watch you without the
green light turning on.

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:48.351
- (Ken) And the connection here is that

00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:51.369
they both raise uncertainty
about awareness.

00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:53.453
- (Tiffany) Is something
aware of me or not?

00:02:53.453 --> 00:02:54.309
- (Ken) Exactly.

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:57.669
The uncanny describes our
awareness of awareness.

00:02:59.653 --> 00:03:00.903
- (Tiffany) So, why are we drawn to things

00:03:00.903 --> 00:03:02.479
that give us that creepy feeling?

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:05.325
- (Ken) Because uncanny experiences
sharpen our perceptions.

00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:06.790
It goes back to when we were hunters.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.338
- (Tiffany) When we were
out in the Savannah,

00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:11.681
it was all, like, "Am I about
to be haunched on and killed?"

00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:12.506
- Haunched on?

00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:13.722
(laughing)

00:03:13.722 --> 00:03:16.524
- Haunched, like somebody
gonna come get me and kill me?

00:03:16.524 --> 00:03:17.100
- Right.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.806
- (Ken) Which triggers our
fight or flight instincts.

00:03:19.806 --> 00:03:21.911
Is this predator dead or just sleeping?

00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:23.638
- (Tiffany) So it's
rooted in the amygdala,

00:03:23.638 --> 00:03:25.566
the part of our brain
that reacts to danger.

00:03:25.566 --> 00:03:26.336
- (Ken) That's right.

00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:28.320
The uncanny reflex is deeply rooted

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.874
in our brains and bodies.

00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:32.520
This was especially popular
in the 18th century,

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.012
the golden age of automaton,

00:03:34.012 --> 00:03:36.076
when machines began to move like humans.

00:03:36.076 --> 00:03:37.508
- (Tiffany) And wasn't
that around the time

00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:39.198
that Gothic writers started
exploring this theme

00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:40.655
in books like, "Frankenstein,"

00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:42.478
the natural versus the artificial?

00:03:42.478 --> 00:03:43.191
- (Ken) Right.

00:03:43.191 --> 00:03:47.274
In 1919, Sigmund Freud wrote
an essay called, "The Uncanny."

00:03:47.274 --> 00:03:49.690
He describes an old folk
tale where an evil magician

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.251
threatens to steal a
little boy's eyeballs,

00:03:52.251 --> 00:03:53.730
which is very creepy.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.275
- (Tiffany) Because eyes
are that crucial thing

00:03:56.275 --> 00:03:58.074
for knowing if something is real.

00:03:58.074 --> 00:03:59.514
- (Ken) And that brings up this concept

00:03:59.514 --> 00:04:01.157
of the uncanny valley.

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:03.074
It's a function that
describes how we react

00:04:03.074 --> 00:04:05.338
to things as they become more human-like.

00:04:05.722 --> 00:04:08.099
They become more likable up to a point.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.547
Then there's this transition where things

00:04:09.547 --> 00:04:12.205
are too similar, too close for comfort,

00:04:12.205 --> 00:04:14.460
where they fall into the uncanny valley.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.160
- The unknown, the
mysterious, the unexplainable.

00:04:18.404 --> 00:04:21.104
- (Ken) This is a danger zone
for designers and animators,

00:04:21.104 --> 00:04:23.852
'cuz they need to avoid
making things too lifelike.

00:04:23.852 --> 00:04:26.251
That can backfire and
make people uncomfortable.

00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:27.635
- (Tiffany) What about the
other side of the graph?

00:04:27.635 --> 00:04:29.091
- (Ken) On the other side of the valley

00:04:29.091 --> 00:04:30.337
are the real humans.

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:31.296
- (Tiffany) Which we like.

00:04:31.296 --> 00:04:31.896
- (Ken) Right.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:34.363
If human's become too
robotic they can fall

00:04:34.363 --> 00:04:35.581
into the valley too.

00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:37.512
- (Tiffany) Like if
someone's had too much botox

00:04:37.512 --> 00:04:39.598
and suddenly their facial
expressions don't move

00:04:39.598 --> 00:04:41.118
in the right way near their eyes.

00:04:41.118 --> 00:04:41.846
- (Ken) Right.

00:04:41.846 --> 00:04:43.854
- (Tiffany) So, the key
is to not make robots

00:04:43.854 --> 00:04:46.805
too human-like and not
make humans too robot-like.

00:04:46.805 --> 00:04:48.226
- (Ken) And that's precisely what

00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:49.912
technologists wrestle with.

00:04:49.912 --> 00:04:51.712
- (Tiffany) And what Freud
talk about, with the eyes.

00:04:51.712 --> 00:04:54.330
- (Ken) Yes, which is why a
perfect example of something

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.382
that triggers the uncanny
reflex is Google Glass.

00:04:57.382 --> 00:04:58.400
- (Tiffany) No, not that guy.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.280
That guy.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.435
- (Ken) Yeah, there he is.
- (Tiffany) Okay.

00:05:00.435 --> 00:05:01.560
- (Ken) Google Glass triggers both

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.214
types of uncanny responses,

00:05:03.214 --> 00:05:05.625
our confusion about things
not looking quite human

00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:07.521
and our fears of surveillance.

00:05:07.521 --> 00:05:10.048
You might say it's the
uncanny double whammy.

00:05:10.048 --> 00:05:15.048
(upbeat music)

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.671
- (Tiffany) So, in today's
technological jungle

00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:20.933
are we always gonna be on
that edge of the valley?

00:05:20.933 --> 00:05:21.909
- (Ken) Definitely.

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:23.843
Our technologies will be
increasingly lifelike.

00:05:24.258 --> 00:05:26.067
Sigmund Freud saw this coming.

00:05:26.067 --> 00:05:27.748
He predicted that the uncanny reflex

00:05:27.748 --> 00:05:31.163
would be increasingly important
to sharpen our awarness

00:05:31.163 --> 00:05:34.260
and keep technologies, like robots, botox,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.820
Google Glass, and whatever comes next,

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.324
from getting too close for comfort.

00:05:39.324 --> 00:05:44.322
(upbeat music)
