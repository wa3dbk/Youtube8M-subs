Later at her house where her mother is. It's
right in here. Would you like to introduce

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:17.490
me to your mother? Oh, this is my mother.
Hey mom. Her name is Sandra. Hi Sandra. Hi

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.130
Sandra. You raised a fine daughter. She's
going to pay the book, she spilled pizza on

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:31.800
at my bookstore pizzeria. And I got to get
back there pretty quick. I'm sorry mom. Uhhhh

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.620
if you don't get mad at me, maybe I could
wash your hands. Oh that would be a nice thing

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.160
to do. Is that something, a tradition in your
family where to make somebody not mad, you

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:56.090
wash their hands? No, it's stop fighting with
your sister. Well, she's right, if you stop

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.300
fighting with your sister, that'd probably
be an even nicer gift than washing her hands.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.790
I'm telling my lawyer about this. Oh my. Your
daughter gets mad easy. I didn't mean to cause

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.800
trouble and have you dealing with lawyers.
Are you talking' to me? Are you talking' to

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.540
me? Because I just met you and I don't see
why I have to get involved in your family

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.470
affairs and I'm not going to give a deposition
to the lawyer. Do you even know what a deposition

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.870
is lady? May cause excitability in children.
That's true. A deposition may cause excitability

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.080
in children and I don't want to be part of
straining your family relationships. So, if

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.650
you don't mind, I'll just go back to the bookstore
pizzeria, and we'll just run your credit card.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:52.490
Do you have anything else to tell me about
that? Do you? Yes. How about a nice parfait?

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.750
Well, I'd love a nice parfait and then we
can all just get along. Yah. Ok. Dadaddada.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.180
Oh go ahead, do you want to tell the moral
of the story? Go right ahead. It was the best

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.310
of times. It was the worst of times. Yes,
that's absolutely correct. Our bookstore pizzeria

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.510
saga in the family home, Lassie the waiter
and the people that he met and ended up in

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.590
their family affairs. It was the best of times.
It was the worst times. Well, that scene went

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.190
exactly the way it was supposed to go and
we...I had fun. Did you guys have fun? Yeah.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.720
Alright, cool. Well, there's an improv game.
You can play with your family and friends,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.810
play it in your living room. In the meantime,
my name is Les. I'm Lucia. I'm Marina. You

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.980
should go play well with others. We'll see
you in another clip. Bye. Bye.
