Hi. Today I will show you
how to make Christmas tree made from feathers.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.340
We need:

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.400
...feathers...

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.180
...thick A3 paper...
(in similar color to feathers)

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.300
...scissors...

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.120
...double-sided adhesive tape...

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.240
...glue gun...

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.000
...ribbon...

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.240
...zircons...

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.140
...beads...

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.320
...crystals...

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.240
...and ribbon bow.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.300
First, make a cone from the paper.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:48.100
Glue it by using double-sided adhesive tape.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.600
Cut a lower part of cone.
It should stand up straight.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:11.460
Glue the feathers to the cone starting from bottom.
Shorten them if they are too long.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.120
Glue smallest feathers at the top.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:31.700
Glue the ribbon to the top of the tree.
Wrap the tree. Glue the ribbon in a few places.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:40.240
Glue the zircons to the ribbon.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:53.120
Glue beads and crystals to the feathers.
They will look like small Christmas balls.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.260
Glue ribbon bow at the top.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.960
And Christmas tree is done.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.880
