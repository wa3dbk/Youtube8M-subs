00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:14.500
hello everyone

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.930
Michael here with the daily note 2 youtube 
channel. Today, I want to show you how to

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.529
turn this shaky video, into this

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.720
or this shaky fast motion video

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.220
into this

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.890
or this still hand-held still shot

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.269
into this

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.769
you get the gist

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.949
and mind you, this is after the fact that
you've shot the video. which means you ca'n do

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:37.680
this for a video that you've shot in the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.470
past, and it's not just for

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.680
video you plan to shoot in the future

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.840
there are some limitations and 
i'll get into that later

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.120
so you can see from the example videos
that the stabilization is pretty amazing

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.440
and the way we're going to stabilize the video
is through something called...

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.620
Youtube. And the reason i wanted to 
suggest you do this is because YouTube

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.650
provides top of the line software
video stabilization, for free

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.780
it is pretty much identical to the Warp
Stabilizer that you can use if you own

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.170
a copy of Adobe After Effects CS6

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.320
and only if you had a powerful enough
computer, but YouTube doing this

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.680
for you, you don't need expensive
software or a powerful computer

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.600
they provide this service for free

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.600
in hopes that you may want to share this
video and use YouTube's free video sharing

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.870
services

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.390
and before i forget, i've created 
a little video montage with the samples

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.760
used in this video, so make sure you
check that video that is linked at the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.510
end of this video

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.710
so anyway, let me show you just how easy
it is. go to youtube's website. Hit

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.090
upload. Drag the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.900
video files that you've shot with your note 2

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.049
you can choose to do

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.689
this directly on the galaxy note 2's youtube app

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.939
and use the stock web browser, but 
i prefer to do it on a PC when i have more

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.290
than a single video to work with

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.920
suggests upload it through youtube's
website. wait a few minutes for your

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.729
video to get processed

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.660
then click on enhancements
click stabilize,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.889
then click save

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.959
then you wait while the magic happens

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.749
it may take up to 10 minutes for every
minute of video you have, so while that's

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:19.890
happening let's talk about how it works
and the limitations for this

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.799
so when it comes to processing based
video stabilization

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.499
your video will become a little cropped
at the edges because the computer is

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:31.949
comparing each frame or picture and
using references to align each frames to

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:33.379
a central point,

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.579
and it'll have to throw out the edges
that are not present on all the

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.389
frames

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.299
this is how youtube video stabilization works

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.329
and this is how the anti shake feature
works as well

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.339
so expect your video to be a little
cropped

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:48.870
so understanding all that,

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.909
let's talk about problems and solutions
for better video stabilization

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.339
for one, you can see that all the examples 
that i showed you are videos i've

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:58.709
taken outside

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.479
it is because the lines need to be
crisp along the edges of your video for

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:07.389
stabilization to work well. I find that 
videos shot indoors don't have crisp

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:12.299
lines around the objects for variety of
reasons such as aperture and noise,

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.549
and that leads to video stabilization
to not producing a clear result

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.639
although, I'm sure it will be a lot
better than what you started off with

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.659
it won't be that great either

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.069
so with that in mind shoot video 
in well-lit settings and minimize the

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.449
shake for even better results

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:31.779
and just because you can stabilize video later

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:35.340
doesn't mean at all that you shouldn't make
your best effort to hold the camera as

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.869
steady as possible

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:40.319
your efforts will all add to 
a better video at the end

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.379
this also means, if you shoot video 
on the note 2 with Anti Shake enabled

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.650
and you run it through youtube's video
stabilization, it will probably yield

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.230
in better video,

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.809
but remember you would be cropping 
the video twice

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:56.209
so let's check to see if we're done

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.489
and there we go

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.439
it's stabilized, and it's ready to be
shared

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:05.009
amd I must admit, it does remarkable job
on stills and panning shots. for shots

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:09.009
when you are walking, it does a very good job 
but expect to see some warping here

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:12.710
and there with large building because the video sensor,
when you are shaking the camera,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.170
records with a little bit of a wobble due to
something called the rolling

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.580
shutter effect also known as jello effect

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.660
the galaxy note 2 is great in terms of
having a very little amount of it, but no

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.530
smartphone is immune to this problem, now
if you want to for some reason, download

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.990
the video after you've stabilized

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.770
all you have to do is that 
hit this drop down

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.180
download MP4. now there are problems
with downloading of the videos. I find

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.129
that it gets interrupted more often than
it should and you have to try to

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:43.370
download it again

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.570
and you may find you've hit some limit
and it will tell you to wait for an hour

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.370
before you can try downloading again

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.220
another problem is, sometime in your videos, 
you may have briefly walked by

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.930
someone playing a song through the radio,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.339
or maybe you stepped into an elevator
with some elevator music

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:01.879
and lo and behold, that music is copyrighted

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.920
and it won't let you download that file 
but the good news is that there

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.010
is an app that can solve all these mentioned
problems, and this is where your note 2

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.710
can do something your PC can't

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.189
the app is that you want is called TubeMate

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:19.009
let's download it from the developers
website directly. make sure not to

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.479
download it from the google play store because
many people have taken this guy's code and

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:30.479
put spam all over it and put it up 
in the google play store

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.490
let's try to download the video again

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.799
probably the easiest thing you can do is
email yourself the link to this video

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:47.729
I'm using an app called mobizen to do this 
i'll probably do the next video on

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:48.689
this app

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:52.990
this app is an app that Mike from Maine
had recommended. So big thanks to him

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.580
because it is an amazing app and 
I definitely would not know about it

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.080
if he hadn't mentioned it

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.569
anyway when you try to open this link,
select TubeMate

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:04.939
hit the green download button, then 
hit the resolution that you would like to

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:06.889
download the video with

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.810
there you go this app has a built-in
download manager and a

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.139
if it stops in the middle
it knows how to

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.300
resume and i've never had any problems with it,
it is a great app

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.169
so that's how you can do some amazing
video stabilization for videos that you

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:22.499
have captured on your galaxy note 2

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:26.059
but before you go, please make sure to
check out this video montage of I've created

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:29.569
with the youtube stabilized videos 
by clicking on this link

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:31.960
and don't forget to hit like and subscribe

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.710
this is Michael from the daily note 2 youtube 
channel. once again, thank you for

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.960
