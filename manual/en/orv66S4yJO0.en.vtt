00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.520
Swish it around your mouth a little bit.  It doesn't have any scent.  Nope!

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.970
It's just water.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.750
With a little bit of salt as a catalyst.  A little vodka in there maybe?

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.090
Does this drink have, uh...

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.240
no, no

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.250
nope.  Haha, ok so I can

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.890
drink this? Am I ready to do it?

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.640
You're absolutely ready.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.810
It's great.  Swish it around a little bit, it's a little salty.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.880
Yeah!  Just a little

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.420
bit of salt.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.150
It's super great.  It's what

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.300
we clean with.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.940
That should be great.  Alright, here we go, here goes nothing!

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.260
Cheers!  Swish it around in your mouth a little bit and swallow.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.829
This guy's a chugger!  Man!  Now, you

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.870
will have no indigestion or bouts of acidity.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.890
How was it?

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.100
I'm gonna have more haha!  Not like drinking Mr.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.100
Clean is it?  No it's not haha, this is the stuff.  Alright!

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.300
This was amazing to see.  As you know, this is our

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.500
little library area, and how the
dogs lay on this.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.259
I know.  And I had the carpet cleaners come and clean it

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.880
and then within day it would just be this big,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.880
black mark.  And it's not the dogs that are dirty, you know how clean our dogs are, right?  I think so

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.540
But what happens is they clean it, and then they have this

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.730
soapy product.  And so the soap is

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.640
sticky, and it's just in there.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.510
So if your gonna walk in there with shoes or the dogs it's going to pick up all the black.  And that's

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.520
why we kept getting black.  So they eliminated that process

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.110
by going in there and cleaning with their...alkaline?  Alkaline water.  It's just water

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.410
we both drank.  And they get

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.990
all the soap out.  They get everything out.  Yeah.  And like this couch

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.220
where Jesiree camps out...

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.750
Yeah?  Well I don't know if you remember how dirty this was.  Oh yeah, oh yeah, it was terrible.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.950
And this is his little section, how

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.390
dirty it was.  Look at that!  But it's the same thing, there was soap on it, and that's why....

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.770
So you mean to tell me we don't need to buy new couches now?

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.430
Thank you Zerorez!  Haha!  For

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.100
carpets or floors.  Yup, yup!

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.500
Wow!  Haha!
