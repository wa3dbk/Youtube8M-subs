00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.190
Want to figure out the important themes in
The Great Gatsby?

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.340
I know you do, so stay tuned.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.340
Hey there.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.389
It’s Professor Bernstein, and in this episode
of Get Into Lit, I’m going to help you figure

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.970
out the possible theme or themes in F. Scott
Fitzgerald’s novel.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:26.269
Teachers often ask you to talk or write about
the theme of literary works, and so many students

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.099
struggle because they don’t understand the
difference between the subject or topic of

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.660
the story and the theme.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.460
So let’s just make sure you’re totally
clear.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.050
The subject or topic of the novel is basically
what the story is about.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:56.320
A really simplistic way of describing the
subject of The Great Gatsby is to say it’s

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:04.559
Nick Carraway’s reflection on his experience
while living in West Egg (which, FYI, is actually

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.759
Great Neck—a town on Long Island—a place
where I grew up).

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:20.439
And honestly there are a wide range of ways
you could summarize the subject.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.329
The theme of a novel isn’t its plot or subject.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.789
It’s not just what happens.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:45.529
The theme is the larger, broader message that
the novel seems to be communicating, and 

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:55.909
there 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:08.450
can be multiple, sometimes conflicting themes
in a work of literature.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.860
Now this is where lots of students start freaking
out and start searching the Internet for someone

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.250
else’s idea about the theme of the story.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.350
Maybe that’s what you’re doing right now.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.050
. .hoping that I’m going to give you the
answer.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.850
Giving you the answer is lame.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.120
I think more highly of you than that.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.750
What you need more than someone else’s answer
is to learn how to ask yourself the right

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.050
questions so that you can figure it out for
yourself.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:46.819
Trust me. . .this approach is a lot cooler.
. .it makes you smarter.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:58.230
. .it actually teaches you how to Get Into
Lit.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:06.910
So here are 4 main sets of questions you can
ask yourself when you’re starting to read

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.610
The Great Gatsby and they’ll help you start
figuring out one or more of the possible themes

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.800
of this great work of American Literature.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.800
1.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.250
The very first thing I want you to do is just
think about the American Dream.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.900
When you think about it, what comes to mind?

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.660
Start with your own images and ideas about
this dream.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.660
Really.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.660
Trust yourself.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.660
2.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:41.550
Now, I want you to ask yourself this question:
Where do the characters in the story seem

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.610
to be situated in relation to the American
Dream?

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.910
Have they realized it?

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.910
Why?

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:47.910
Why not?

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.950
Are they striving to achieve it?

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.490
How does the novel convey this striving?

00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:03.080
Are they happy with where they’re at in
relation to it?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.080
Why?

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.080
Why not?

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.500
How can we tell?

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.700
What clues does the novel provide us in terms
of their feelings about their situation?

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.739
Write down these questions.

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.090
. .you want to have them present when you’re
reading.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.090
3.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.070
Keep in mind that the characters don’t have
complete control over their representation.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.500
Their descriptions are being filtered through
the consciousness of Nick Carraway, the narrator,

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.220
and, of course, ultimately through F. Scott
Fitzgerald.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.280
So we really need to get a sense of Nick’s
perspective and feelings on the American Dream—or

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.820
at least the culture of his time—and how
it differs from place to place.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.360
To understand these things, you’re going
to have to look carefully at the first few

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.500
pages of the novel, and in the next video,
I’m going to get you into these opening

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.500
passages.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.860
For now, though, just remember that the point
of view in a novel shapes how and what we

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.860
see—and what we don’t see.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.860
So think about Nick’s perspective on the
characters and their relation to the American

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.860
dream.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.860
4.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.300
Now I want to bring together the previous
questions to take you to a higher level of

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.000
interpretation—one that’s going to get
you closer to figuring out one of the novel’s

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
themes.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.690
Is there one character who seems, at least
on the outside to have achieved the American

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:27.020
Dream but who is still aching and unsatisfied?

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.720
What has this character achieved?

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.340
What hasn’t this character achieved?

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.270
Is it an external or internal thing?

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:50.280
What is the narrator—Nick Carraway’s—perspective
on this character?

00:05:50.280 --> 00:06:04.300
Here’s are the big questions—Does the
novel seem to be sending a message about the

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.900
American Dream and/or the culture of the 1920s?

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:16.810
Is it a message about America in general or
about a certain group of people or certain

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.590
groups of people living in certain places?

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.949
Is it a positive, negative, or mixed message?

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.620
How would you describe this message?

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:46.199
Does it ever get conveyed in a direct way—in
a particular sentence or passage?

00:06:46.199 --> 00:07:09.090
Or is it a more subtle message that’s conveyed
through the characters’ lives and the narrator

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:17.050
and something we have to figure out for ourselves?

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:24.470
So there you go—you’ve got a set of questions
that can help YOU start figuring out some

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.699
of the themes in The Great Gatsby.

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:40.280
You can do this—you can come up with your
own unique way of identifying and describing

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.040
the theme.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:52.860
You might feel a little uncertain and nervous
at first, but you’ll get the hang of it.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.070
Make sure you check out the next video in
the series…where I’m guiding you into

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:05.740
the first few pages of 
the novel.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:10.610
If you liked this video, I’d love it if
you liked it, left a comment, and subscribed

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:11.680

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.120
That’s it for now.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.479
Bye.
