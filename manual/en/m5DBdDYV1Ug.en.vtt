00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.620
This is a story about a boy named Robert who
lives on a farm in Learning, Vermont.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.419
He is a smart kid who does well in school,
except in English.

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:10.980
Robert lives at home with his father, a pig
slaughterer, his mother and his aunt.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.090
The farm is doing well and his father notes
that they'll soon own the land if they keep

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.090
working.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.820
One day Robert runs away from school and as
he approaches his farm, he sees a cow from

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.340
the neighboring Tanner's farm that is giving
birth and helps it.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.330
However, in an attempt to save the cow from
choking, he sticks his hand down it's throat

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.380
and the cow bites down.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.869
He is battered and sewn up from the injuries.

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.640
Mr. Tanner then gives Robert a pig for saving
the cow and Robert raises the pig, Pinky,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.640
as a pet.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.829
Pinky even wins a blue ribbon at the local
fair.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.170
However, it is discovered that Pinky is barren
and they must kill her.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.949
As they kill the pig, father and son share
a moment of mutual respect for each other.

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.879
All seems to be going okay until Robert's
father reveals that he's been sick and that

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.460
he will die soon.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.780
He explains that Robert will have to be the
man of the farm.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.739
Robert is reluctant to fill this role, but
soon accepts it.

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.079
His father dies the following spring.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.320
This is a real coming-of-age story where a
boy must grow up to assume the role of his

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.320
father.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.990
Robert doesn't understand his father, but
through raising Pinky, he learns little by

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.202
little what it means to be a man.

00:01:12.202 --> 00:01:13.202
Ultimately, a man is defined by someone who
does what needs to be done no matter what.

00:01:13.202 --> 00:01:14.202
Readers see Robert assume this role after
his father's death in the last chapter when

00:01:14.202 --> 00:01:15.202
he prepares the funeral arrangements and begins
making business deals with his peers.

00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:16.820
There is also discussion of religion tolerance
in this story.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.649
Robert and his family are Shakers who abide
by strict religious rules.

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.350
At first, he dislikes those of other religions,
particularly Baptists.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.799
But when he realizes that his neighbors are
Baptists, he learns to accept their different

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.920
religious practices.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.000
Lastly, we are reminded of life and death
as fundamental principles in life through

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.259
this rural setting.

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.619
Life has a beginning, as we see in the birthing
of the calves, the new litter of kittens,

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:42.979
and the introduction of Pinky.

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.450
At the same time, we are also reminded that
life has an ending, as we see the death of

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.780
a frog, squirrel, Pinky, and Robert's father.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.799
But consistent with Robert's father view of
manhood, death is just something that has

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.200
to be done.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.149
So why is there a day no pigs would die?

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.390
As the story goes on, it would seem like Pinky
would be spared by the father, similar to

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.110
what we see in Charlotte's Web.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.720
However, it's quite the opposite.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.350
Quite unexpectedly, when Robert's father dies,
a lot of his co-workers show up to his funeral,

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.740
thus stopping work at the slaughterhouse.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.550
And that is why it was a day no pigs would
die.
