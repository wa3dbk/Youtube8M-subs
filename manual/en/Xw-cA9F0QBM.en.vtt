00:00:01.572 --> 00:00:02.590
- Good morning clan,

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:03.500
and welcome to Sunday,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.090
our last day here in Las Vegas.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.120
We've already packed it up
and headed off the strip,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.520
to, where are we at?

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.570
South Point, for a little buffet action.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.483
Everyone stuffing their faces.

00:00:16.193 --> 00:00:21.110
(upbeat country music)

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.823
- It is 5 I think.

00:01:03.823 --> 00:01:06.330
Dinner time.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.770
Bryce has already ate all his

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.232
- [Kid with towel] He's
lost all of his teeth.

00:01:11.232 --> 00:01:12.190
- [Bryce] So have I.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.820
- [Sierra] Mason ate most of it.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.840
And here I am, still eating.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.710
- [Kid with towel] And
then there's me spectating.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.450
- [Sierra] And there's him.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.550
And um, I've been talking too much.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.580
- [Bryce] Yes you have.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.960
- So that's why I have so much food still.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.630
- Okay, hey guys.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.610
I'm going to do a hide
and go seek type thing

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.520
in the house.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.550
Sierra's going to start.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.030
Whoever has the camera is pretty much it.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.320
She's going to try and find us three.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.090
- So I'm going to count for 20 seconds,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.710
and then I'm going to go find them.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.380
One, two, three...

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.130
18, 19, 20.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.230
Oh yeah, and by the way,

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.230
if you guys don't know who that kid was,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
he is Mee'ma and Papa's neighbor,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.380
which is kinda cool,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.030
because we have another
kid to hang out with

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.100
when it's just us three.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.480
Which we can hang out with each other,

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.274
but another kid is really fun.

00:02:13.304 --> 00:02:16.990
Okay I found Bryce and Ryan,

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.160
they were in the closet.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.450
Now we have to find Mason,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.200
- [Ryan] No we don't.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.710
- Yeah we do.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.430
- [Ryan] No we don't.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.110
- Then where is he?

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.270
- [Ryan] He gets to keep his spot.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.800
- Ohhh that's kind of a cool rule,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.835
so if I don't find Mason,

00:02:29.835 --> 00:02:31.900
then he can stay in his spot,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.410
and hide for the next round.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.890
Okay that's cool.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.700
He's probably going to be like,

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.500
"Why are they taking so long?"

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.871
- Okay hey guys,

00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:40.750
I'm gonna start, we're gonna.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.480
I'm not it.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.460
We're gonna hide from Bryce.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.120
(breathing heavily)

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.420
(whispers) Where is he at?

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.600
Where is he at?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.140
Is he out there?

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.150
Oh jeez he's coming!

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.540
- [Bryce] (distantly)
Ready or not here I come!

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.750
- [Man] No one's in there.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.950
- [Ryan] Ahhh!

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.590
- Found you.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.670
- [Ryan] Dang it!

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.160
You knew where I was!

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.860
- [Bryce] No I didn't.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.430
- [Ryan] Yes you did.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.390
- Well guys,

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.590
we finally made it back home,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.620
picked up the kids from
Mee'ma and Papa's house.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.480
Sierra was already asleep,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.660
she woke up to say hi to us,

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.470
but as soon as she got in
the car she passed out,

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.470
and about five minutes
later Bryce passed out.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.940
It's about 8:30 PM,

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.500
they just went straight to bed,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.678
we didn't even wake them
up to shower or anything,

00:03:33.678 --> 00:03:34.860
they'll do that in the morning.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.370
Now Tiff and I are just
kind of decompressing

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.376
and chilling out the rest of our evening.

00:03:40.376 --> 00:03:42.629
This is where we're going to
go ahead and call it a night,

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.350
hope you enjoyed the video,

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.750
probably short and sweet on our end.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.107
I know Sierra ended up
vlogging a few clips

00:03:48.107 --> 00:03:49.760
at Mee'ma and Papa's,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.020
and at this point obviously
I haven't edited the vlogs,

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.740
I'm not sure what it is,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.700
but you know already,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.430
and so hopefully you enjoyed the video.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.360
If you did, be sure to
give it a thumbs up.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.590
Tomorrow is Monday,

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.835
start of a new week.

00:03:59.835 --> 00:04:01.440
Gonna start it off with
going to take the kids

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.140
to go see The Avengers movie,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.200
the new Avengers.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.470
Super excited about that,

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.970
it looks awesome, cannot wait.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.780
This just kicks off the
summer of movies guys,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.510
I'm looking forward to this summer so much

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.850
because I will be able
to go see all the movies

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.490
that I always wanted to see,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.710
typically there's usually
a plethora of movies

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.170
that come out, and I only
get to pick and choose

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.290
certain ones,

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.850
but now I'll be able to see all of them,

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.620
and I'm very much looking forward to that.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.270
Tap the "i" in the sky for
the last three year's videos.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.170
One year ago we went to Turf Paradise

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.400
to watch the Kentucky Derby,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.110
and bet on horses for the very first time.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.830
Two years ago,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.610
hanging out in Chandler
with my buddy Chuck,

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.330
and the guys at Gang Plank.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.510
Chuck is Rhino Ranger in Twitch,

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.120
he's the moderator for my Twitch channel

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.880
when I do my live streams and whatnot,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.580
good guy.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.750
And three years ago,

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.250
this is the video I mentioned last week,

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.250
when Sierra went to sing
in her school choir,

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.490
and started crying.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.220
And we kind of establish that
she's good behind a camera,

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.470
she's good when she has time to prepare,

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.160
but she's not good live and
in front of a bunch of people.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.040
Since then she's gotten over her fear,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.270
but this is the video where
we kind of established that.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.430
So check those out in the
cards or the links down below,

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.200
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.629
Vlog on.
