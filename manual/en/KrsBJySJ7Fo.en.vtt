english lyrics by kafkafuura

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.820
I’ve forgotten; in some old box I’ve put you away

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.740
In a loud voice I cry I’ve lost you, but I won’t be heard

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.120
I’ve made another, but it can never replace you

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.680
A doll, it won’t move; it has forgotten how to smile

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:13.320
Now I’ll open the gate unto a new world

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:21.460
With the courage I need to step forward into a sky I’ve got seen for some time

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:28.820
The happiness I grasp in my hands I won’t let go, not anymore

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.400
I’m afraid. Don’t show me that face

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:44.400
We’re bound together by invisible threads.I won’t forget

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.160
My feelings of pain in longing I lift to the winter sky

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.280
The tangle of threads unravels bit by bit

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:17.300
Given freedom, for the first time you show me a smile

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:25.860
What should've been locked away in the depths of my heart

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.860
My loneliness awakens and I’m filled with tears

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.120
The unforgivable lies that mislead my heart

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:48.000
The emotions conveyed to my hands, the feelings on these fingertips

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:56.980
Can only distract from my loneliness, they can’t hide it.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.980
My feelings kept secret in my heart won’t reach…

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:29.780
Left behind in a dark world of fantasy, all alone

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:43.340
While trying to hide my loneliness in an old box I found you

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.600
The happiness I grasp in my hands I won’t let go, not anymore

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.900
I’m afraid. Don’t show me that face

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:06.060
We’re bound together by invisible threads. I won’t forget

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:13.020
My feelings of pain in longing I lift to the winter sky

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.060
