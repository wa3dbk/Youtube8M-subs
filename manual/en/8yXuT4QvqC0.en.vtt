00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:11.030
Today on this 2008 Volkswagen Eos we will
be installing Tow Ready part number 119176kit.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.540
Our first step is going to be to access the
rear truck of the vehicle.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.690
We have a couple of trim screws we are going
to have to remove.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.480
This will be identical on the passenger side
also.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.840
We have one here behind the tail light and
one here behind the threshold.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.450
There will be two identical on the passenger
side also.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.789
WE are going to remove all four of those now.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.850
There are the two on the driver side, I am
going to repeat the same process on the passenger

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.850
side.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.380
:34
Now that we have our trim screws out of the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.730
way, we need to remove the rear threshold.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.760
I am going to get underneath it and gently
pry it up.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.300
Now lets go over to the passenger side and
locate the blinker.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.659
First, I am going to gently pull the connector
off of its mount to make it easier to get

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:53.659
to.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.469
Using our test light that comes with our kit,
I am going to back probe the blinkers here

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.030
to locate the blinker.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.600
The yellow wire on the passenger side is our
blinker.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.280
For connection points, the brown wire is our
vehicle ground.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.760
The black wire are our running lights.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:30.610
The yellow wire is 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:56.520
our 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:06.120
left 
turn signal.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:03:41.830
The red wire 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:58.349
is 
our brake.

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:47.930
Now we can 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:05:18.460
go ahead 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:46.169
and 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:07:19.050
make 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.860
our connection.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.669
