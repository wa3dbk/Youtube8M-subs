00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.550
I was able to make pretty good progress on
the vanity dresser over the past couple days.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.050
 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.290
I'm just about to start the second
coat of stain now then I'll make a judgement

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.150
call on whether or not I want a third.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.180
Before starting this however and after finishing the drawers in the last video.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.100
I thought it would be a good idea to go back and put some finishing touches on the base units before starting on the top. 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.080
touches to the base units before I started
on the top.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.720
I haven't attached the foot pedastals yet
so lets do that.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.560
I'll make an initial forty five degree cut
on the end of one of my boards I'm using for the feet.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.610
Then from the short end of the cut measure
and mark.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.620
I'll transfer that mark up the board so you
guys can see it when I make the cut.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.230
I like to cut this end long and sneak up on
it later if I need to. A board that is too

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.450
long can be trimmed.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.630
A board to short is just frustrating.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.730
Let me just check that cut to see how close
I am. I'm looking for twenty one inches on the tape.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.740
Thats not bad.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.810
Alright I'll repeat that process for the rest
of the boards I need.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.100
I'm going to partialy assemble these before
attaching them to the dresser base units.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.280
My dowel jig will be a good point of reference
to make sure the miters I cut are ninety degrees.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.270
I don't want to think I did a good
job cuttin them only to be disappinted when

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.710
I go to attach them to the base units.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.120
That looks pretty good.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.550
I'll pop a couple nails there, then flip it
around and pop a couple more.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.780
Now it's time to attach my partially assembled
foot pedastals to the dresser base units.

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.769
If I cut them correctly they should just slide
right on.

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.859
I need the overhangs on the pedastals to be
identical for both base units because if they're

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.479
not then they won't be the same height.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.259
And that would be...well...bad.

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.399
Unless of course your installing them on stairs.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.360
But I don't know why you would.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.529
And that would definitely be a separate video.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.080
Now I'll add some ledge pieces for added strength
and support.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.220
Place the base units back on the floor

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.880
and
attach some trim pieces.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.800
Alright that is done lets knock out this dresser
top. 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.740
Measure,

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.480
 mark, 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.320
trim to size.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.439
That will make up the bulk of the top.

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.379
I've cut some strips of solid oak for which
I will use as nosing so that I can shape the

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.599
edges in just a moment.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.480
First I need to trim this front piece to length.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.260
The dowels worked out pretty well for the
drawers and they looked good, so I thought

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.269
I would bring that look to a more prominent
place on the dresser.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.180
Here is the seam I just created when I added
the nosing. You can see the imperfections

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.459
quite clearly. Thin strips of the vaneer have
torn away in places

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.329
leaving bigger gaps in some areas all around
the edge of the top. It just looks raw.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.110
Where going to clean that up a little bit.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.870
A shallow pass with a one eigth inch straight
bit will start that process.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.780
That looks better already.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.080
Now I'll roung over the top edge.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.400
You know what I forgot to do?

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.240
Yep!

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.800
You know what, since I'm here, I'll give the top a quick sand.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.210
Alright so where was I? Oh yes, I was rounding
over the edges.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.320
Flip it over.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.270
Chamfer the bottom edge.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.880
Smooth out the rough spots with some hand
sanding.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.539
Now that looks a lot better than it did just
a moment ago. Now all I have to do is apply

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.160
a dark stain inside those dadoes and it will
almost look

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.840
like an inlay.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.419
I thought a long time about how I wanted this
vanity dresser to go together as a complete unit.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.460
Because of it's size and design, vanity dressers
of this style have a weak point  

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.980
if you have to move them.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.340
The center.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.800
A lot of times you will see them connected
in the back but I'm not convinced that will

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.090
completely mitigate the risk of damaging the
dresser when it

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.940
comes time to move it.

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:22.889
So I have decided to not permanently connect
the base units to each other, nor the top

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.090
So when it needs to be moved I've elected
to have it be broken down to its individual

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.680
pieces, but that means I am going to need
a way to quick way to reference

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.440
one piece to another for reassembly.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.190
So I'll futz around with this for a while
until I get everything the way I want it.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.870
Clamp it down.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.680
Drill some pilot holes for reference pins.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.400
I've just got to be sure not to go all the way through the top because,

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.040
at this point that would really suck.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.180
Now I should be able to place some pins and
have the dresser go back together without

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.660
a lot of hassle.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.600
Well my plan for this week is in between the coats of stain.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.020
I think I'll start on the jewelry box for the top.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.020
