00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:15.859
This demonstration is set up to show the effectiveness
of a Blacoh pulsation dampener on a peristaltic

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.070
or hose pump.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:27.220
Hose pumps are used primarily to pump thick,
viscous, abrasives and slurries.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:34.200
And they operate on the principle of pushing
the flow, capturing the flow, between rollers

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.840
inside the hose and pushing that flow out
through the discharge.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.620
As they do that, when the roller passes the
discharge and passes the inlet, the flow momentarily

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.620
stops.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.720
So, you get this type of start/stop flow and
you get a wide swing in pressure variations.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.790
Both of which can be harmful to a system because
of vibration and because of the inability

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.900
to smoothly flow a product into a system or
a final operation.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:18.340
Now, when we take the isolation valve and
open it to the dampener, immediately we see

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.209
a significant reduction in the pulse and an
almost near steady-state flow.

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:33.009
This eliminates vibration in the system, protects
the piping and components, and ensures longer

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:40.979
hose life because there isn't a backflow pressure
surge in both directions as the roller passes

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.130
the discharge port.
