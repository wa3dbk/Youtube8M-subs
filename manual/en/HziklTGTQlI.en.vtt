00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.550
Okay lovely people, we're going to do a gorgeous,
gorgeous melt in your mouth sticky melt in

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.770
your mouth meat dish.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.350
We're doing a lamb tagine okay.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.930
This is a tagine right, it's basically the
old fashioned hundreds of years old portable

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.930
stove.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.430
Now the point of the lid is that it just traps
the steam around here and just helps tenderise

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.010
meat and stuff like that.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.699
Beautiful lamb shanks, I'm going to hit it
of course with sea salt in there.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.000
We're going to hit it with some pepper in
there as well.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.250
We're going to go spice as well.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.199
I'm going to go with a teaspoon of the Raz
El Hanout.

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.190
Or they call it garam masala.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:50.290
Then I'm going to use some coriander seeds,
half a teaspoon, teaspoon there abouts and

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.089
just a good pinch of cumin, classic, classic
Moroccan flavour and just use a little pestle

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.390
and mortar to crush these bad boys up.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.320
There you go and then just shake that over
the top.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.330
So that goes over.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.880
Get a little olive oil just to make it all
stick.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.860
So, now we've done that.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.440
I'm going to go back to the next bit which
is my tomatoes.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.010
You want about a kilo of fresh tomatoes so
I'm just going to slice these up and I might

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.730
just season this with a little salt as well
and pepper, just because tomatoes need help,

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.840
they need love.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.380
In a good a tagine there's always an element
of sweetness and always from the element of

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.380
dried fruit.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm using apricot here.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.330
It could be sour cranberries, or cherries,
or blueberries, whatever.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.700
I'm going to use a little bit of coriander.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.200
What I'll do is just use the stalk actually.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.420
I'll sue the stalk here.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.800
What I do these days just because I'm lazy,
get a garlic crusher, put the garlic into

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.250
the crusher and just crush it straight in
and it saves me a job.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.049
Right so get all that lovely mix and just
bang it in the bottom of that tagine, just

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.220
like that, all of the juices, don't go throwing
that away we want all of that.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.530
that's all great flavour.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.480
Once you've done that you can put in a few
new potatoes and then go in with your shank

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.480
like that.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:23.280
So look I'm going to whack this on a heat
Look at that!

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:31.310
If i get a little fork and just sort of like
stick it in and then with no power just rip

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.310
it.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.350
you know hat I mean?

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:41.760
That's what you want you want meat that just
watch it, that's what you want.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.730
That's what tagine is all about.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.250
Let's take this over have a look at that!

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.540
Gorgeous, really, really nice.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.849
And if you think about it how long does it
take to put together.

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.000
Four or five minutes to knock together, forget
it, two two and half hours, go down the pub,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.410
go down the park with the kids, you know whatever
and then you've got this when you come back!

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.180
And what's really nice to contrast the gravy
and the spice is some yoghurt and a really

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.180
simple, just chop some mint.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.940
A squeeze of lemon juice in some yoghurt goes
really, really well with this.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.020
Let me do a portion.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.880
What I love to do is just tear up some of
that flatbread like that.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:26.069
Get yourself a little bit of the old couscous,
and then go for your favourite looking bit

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:32.239
of lamb shank over here bang it straight in
the middle like that.

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.050
Go and get some of your new potatoes, you
don't need that many new potatoes because

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.750
you've got the couscous anyway.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.650
But none the less they're good in there with
a little bit of chopped coriander you can

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.950
put on a few little leaves around there as
well.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.890
And the yoghurt just think of it, it's not
being poncy think of it as a little you know

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.890
fire extinguisher.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.520
You've got the spice in there and it's just
really, really nice.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.040
And something that they love to do in Marrakesh,
they've got the pomegranates, and what they

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.410
do is they cut it in half like this and you
pop your hand over like this and then you

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:10.959
just pat over these pomegranates and there's
these little capsules of sweetness and you

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:17.810
have to try it to get it and it's absolutely
gorgeous with this rich, rich lamb beautiful.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.810
SO look at that guys.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.301
An absolutely brilliant dish, really melt
in your mouth, incredible flavour from that

00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:27.490
lamb and that refreshing yoghurt from those
capsules, sweet pomegranate.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.639
It so works.
