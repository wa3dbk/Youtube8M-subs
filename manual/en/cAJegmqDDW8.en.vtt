00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.170
 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.240
Hi, welcome to another episode of Ski Talk. I'm your host,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.420
Steve, and I am the ski buyer and the Ski-E-O here at 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.560
skis.com and this is Ray Skelton. Ray is our local Dalbello rep. Hi Ray.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.660
Hey Steve. How's it going?
Ray, I'd like to go through the Krypton line with you, if you don't mind,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.710
so, this is the first boot in the Krypton line: the KR2. Now, this

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.720
is a 98 flex boot, 98 width boot, 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.820
that's about the narrowest a boot comes other than a full-blown race boot.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.880
Absolutely.
So, this is a really tight fitting, super high performance boot,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.040
correct?
Right.
Now, I did want to point out to you that there's a defect on

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.170
this boot. I don't know if you guys realize. You got one buckle going this way

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.250
but then the other buckle on the other side going the other way, they must have installed the buckles wrong.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.420
Right. Right. Yeah, that's actually not a defect but Steve's kind of joking

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.570
about it. What it is is the front buckle, we designed this originally on our freestyle boots

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.710
that if you reverse the buckle like this and the guy is hitting 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.810
rails or boxes or whatever else, you're not going to break the buckle up.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.830
But this is an all-mountain boot, it's not a park and pipe boot per se.
Right, but think about the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.960
guy that's all-mountain skiing, maybe doing some hiking, maybe doing whatever, that buckle

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.060
might be brushed up against trees or rocks or even if you're hiking

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.100
boot pack, it keeps the buckle from opening or getting knocked off.
Okay. Tell us a little

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.280
about the shell on this boot.
This is one of our three-piece shells and

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.330
the three-piece shell is really unique. What it does, is it allows 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.420
the boot to flex absolutely freely and anatomically with

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.500
the way that your leg moves in relation to your foot so it gives you the purest, truest

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.630
flex. The other thing you can do with a three-piece shell is as

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.720
we said this is a 98 lasted boot. A three-piece shell allows us

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.780
to make the lower shell as stiff as possible for high performance. The

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.930
tongue is a ribbed nylon Polymide tongue and what the ribbed tongue

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.020
does is as the boot, as the upper cuff

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.050
flexes, it flexes against the tongue, the ribs absorb 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.140
shock and then can rebound back. 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.220
You were asking me early off-camera about the nylon tongue and what nylon is for,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.340
most people would just inject plastic. Nylon

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.410
has a high rebound power and if you're

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.580
buying this boot, you're looking for big performance and big guts. This is

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.710
polyurethane right here. It's what they make race boots out of so it's powerful.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.760
It rebounds that quickly. Nylon, on the other hand, when this boot flexes,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.810
Nylon rebounds like that. It's high-powered and tremendous

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.000
power in the boot.
All right, so let's talk about the liner on this.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.120
Tell us about the liner.
This is one of our True Fit liners. The liner's

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.200
heat-moldable. It's a custom-liner. You put your foot in this boot and that liner

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.290
will shape to your foot over a period of time with heat.
Okay, and there is

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.410
the C4 Technology in this boot as well, right?
Right. C4 is a really

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.510
cool thing. Now, Steve mentioned earlier this is a 98mm boot

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.580
which is fairly narrow. C4 makes this boot go on to a

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.620
lot of feet that you might not think in a 98. What it is, C4 stands for

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.730
Comfort 4. There's 4 key spots that boot fitters typically would have to fit your

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.810
boot when you buy that boot.
These are places where people usually get sore or hot

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.850
spots.
Right, where you get punched or ground or whatever else. The ankle bone, the inside ankle

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.980
bone, that's always a killer for me and for a lot of people. The navicular bone, that little bone that

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.080
sticks out under your ankle bone. The sixth toe area...
That's my

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.130
bad one, the sixth toe.
So that spot that feels wider there and then above your heel

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.290
is another spot and we pre-shape these in the shell to accommodate

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.390
that fit.
Okay, and the flex on this boot is?
This is a 110 flex.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.430
It is an adjustable flex. When you buy a pair

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.540
of Kryptons, you have flex blocks that are on the boot so you can take this boot from 110 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.660
and increase it to 120 or fully block it so that it becomes a

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.720
really stiff boot. This is probably the best value in the industry for

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.760
a high-performance, all-mountain boot.
For under $500.
Yeah.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.950
It's $499 map and that's the Krypton Core.
Yeah, besides Dalbello,

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.040
being one of the largest boot lines and one of the highest volume, you guys

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.110
have amazing value in your boots. You offer features that other boots that are 100s

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.170
of dollars more.
Right, I mean, many people would expect to pay $600 or $700

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.300
for this.
So, who is the perfect customer for this boot?
This

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.380
is, you know, when you walk in and you're looking for a pair of boots,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.450
and you're looking for big guts, big power, speed, aggressive

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.630
skier, that's the boot. There's nothing you can't do in this boot.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.710
Great.
It's the Core.
I think I'd like to go try one on right now.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.810
You sold me on it.
I have a pair myself.
I don't think I can get into a 98

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.860
last but other than that, it sounds awesome.
Actually, the Core is the boot I ski in myself.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.030
I love it and one of the reasons I picked it, which is totally crazy, but

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.130
some of you guys might like this, it's a black matte finish boot.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.210
So, like a lot of the new cars and everything that are coming out...
Yeah, matte black is real

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.410
hot, for sure.
Oh yeah. Yeah.
Okay, there you have. That's the Dalbello

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.560
KR2 Core Boot from the Krypton series. This has been Ski Talk

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.650
For Ray and me, Steve, thanks for joining us.
Thank you.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.910
 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.237
