My name is Brandon Sarkis, on behalf of Expert
Village. Our noodle water back here is boiling.

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:23.060
I'm just going to put in some noodles. The
portion size for this recipe is enough for

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.189
about four people, so it's a good rule; four
cups of noodles should be about right; four

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.219
to six, so we'll just do that. We're going
to let the noodles go for about eight minutes,

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:47.969
set our timer.
Also with noodles, you want to make sure that

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.030
you give a good stir all the way to the bottom,
especially when you're first cooking them.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.431
This applies to any noodle; any sort of pasta,
because what will happen is if your noodles

00:00:57.431 --> 00:01:00.129
are going to stick together, it's going to
happen at the very beginning of the cooking

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.040
time, so it would happen in the first couple
of minutes. What you can do is kind of leave

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.750
it alone for a few minutes. Then after about
a minute or two goes along, you can actually

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.049
go through, and start giving it some active
stirring to break those clumps up; if there

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:18.470
are going to be any. Let's check on our meatballs.
All right, so here we are with our meatballs,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.409
and a bunch of steam. You can see that they've
got a nice, even brown coat on them. They

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.790
look great. We're just going to pull them
out, and set them on this plate over here.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:36.409
When you're pulling them out, you can make
sure they all look nice and even, and if not,

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:44.020
you can roll them around a little bit, maybe
get a little more color on them. They're not

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.630
going to look completely the same color all
the way around, due to the fact that they're

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.300
round and they like to roll away from you.
We're going to take all of these out of here

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:04.130
and set them on a separate plate. Also what
you'll do, you see how there are some pan

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.229
scrapings in here? I like to take the spatula
and go around and make sure that they're all

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.870
broken up off the bottom of the pan before
I add the vegetables in because those will

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.810
start to burn. They're good in there because
it's just some of your meatball flavor, so

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.360
we want to leave them in there. We're also
going to leave all of our olive oil in here,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.160
and we're going to move on to our next step,
which is cooking the vegetables.
