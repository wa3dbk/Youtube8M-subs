00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:04.737
Hey I'm Eric Triplet, The Pond Digger and

00:01:04.737 --> 00:01:06.980
today we're gonna take you
on a personalized pond tour.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.960
We're gonna show you some pond design ideas,
that you can incorporate into an existing

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.420
pond, or you can use on a pond that
you're getting ready to build.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.190
We built this pond about eight years ago,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.730
and it's always a crowd pleaser
when we have our pond tours.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.810
But, there's some specific things that we did
here, that sometimes people overlook, and

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.550
they don't understand why they like it so
much.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.110
So we're gonna point those things
out specifically today, so

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.699
you can use them in your own back yard.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.930
A neat thing about this pond is, it's big.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.250
It takes up almost the entire
area that they allocated for it.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.310
But one thing we had to do, we had to create
a crossover, so you could come to the path,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.420
work your way around to the destination
point that's over there.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.010
So what we did is,
we created this land bridge.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.580
And the way to do it and give it a natural
look is, we landed these two logs.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.700
On either side of the bridge,
threw a little bark down, but we have a,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.380
a support underneath it.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.400
And so, it looks like at some
point in time a tree fell, and

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.230
now we can cross over the tree but the fish
can still come across from side to side and

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.440
it's just a really neat effect
that I think people really enjoy.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.010
All right, I wanna point out
the aquatic plants in this pond,

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.600
and the way they've been planted and
how it affects everything.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.500
I like, I like to do what I
would call a specimen plant.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.150
One plant, that is like an exhibit.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.040
It's like,
a plant that's in all its glory, and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.290
it's not muddied up by another
plant growing through it.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.430
So when you look at this plant, this one for
example, it's called blue bells.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.120
In the summertime,
solid purple flowers all over it and

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.000
then just when you look
at it it's just gorgeous.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.620
And it's not disrupted by a,
another plant that's right next to it.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.650
And if you look around the pond,
you'll see red with variegations,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.340
you'll see green variegated, you'll see
soft leaves, you'll see violet stems.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.010
And each plant has it's own location and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.450
they, they typically are not
growing into each other.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.130
And that makes a big
deal when you walk in and

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.650
you see the plants just sitting
there in all their glory,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.149
the specimen plants as you walk around
the pond, they just look gorgeous.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.150
So, one thing I wanna point
out about this water feature,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.902
is we have a different kind of stone
than what we're typically using.

00:03:04.902 --> 00:03:09.310
This, this rock's called Coco Flats and
it's very angular,

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.490
it's almost like a bunch of stepping stones,
it's got a really rich, earth-tone color, and

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.140
we've used this around the whole coping
of the pond, and in the waterfalls.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.070
Now, below water level,
we use a less expensive stone,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.420
the granite that you'll typically
see from most contractors.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.060
And we use it below grade,
it gets a little bit algae growing on it.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.880
You can't really tell what the color is.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.960
Above grade, we use the Coco Flats.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.350
Gives it a neat, interesting look
unlike most of the ponds in the area.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.110
Okay, so
my favorite thing about this pond is the koi.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.860
I mean, what can I say?

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.554
I'm a fish geek.

00:03:38.554 --> 00:03:40.360
It's bred through and through in me.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.230
I'm telling you when people walk
around the corner and they see 66 fish

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.540
swimming around like crazy in this pond,
it really, it's, it takes your breath away.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.250
A lot of these koi were actually born in
the pond, they didn't start with this many,

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.750
but they don't wanna give any up.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.987
And, so when you see that many koi,
it's just fun to see.

00:03:56.987 --> 00:04:06.987

00:04:42.658 --> 00:04:45.390
Well that wraps up our little
personal tour of this pond.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.180
I hope you can use some of the ideas we
have given you today, on your own pond or

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.890
a pond that you might be building.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.419
Take care, and thanks for watching.
