In this video you will learn how to sculpt my French baguette polymer clay charm.

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:18.059
All you need is an off white color. 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.210
This I mixed translucent with white and just a touch of yellow.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.210
Then you need to roll it into a short little
cane.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.450
You want to taper the ends so they are just

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.539
a little thinner than the center.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:46.539
And you want to flatten it slightly.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.969
Now I need to create the grooves within the
top of the bread. I'm going to use this knitting tool.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.969
You could use any tool that you have,
just make three markings. We want them on an angle.

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:53.369
You need to add an eye pin.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.799
Bake in the oven at 275 degrees for 30 minutes.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:10.799
My charm has come out of the oven and the
last step that I need to do is to clear coat the bread.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.420
I use two clear coats one is a matte finish
and the other is a gloss. I'm going to start

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.420
with the matte finish gloss and I'm going
to do one coat on the entire baguette.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.810
And now I want to use the gloss clear coat

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.350
and I'm just going to do a light brushing
on the top of the bread.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.640
This is going to give that look as if it was

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.640
drizzled in butter or oil. 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.650
And here we are. Our French bread baguette
polymer clay charm.
