00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.110
that like tailpiece you don't want to
type 2 type because I told us with to

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:14.710
the strip out pop okay now look at the
way they are

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.830
p trap on there's something about p-trap
that you need to know about most people

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.360
see it up under the sink in it

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.779
why does it look down and come up

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.660
why do we have a need for P trap well
the purpose of the p-trap is when the

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.949
water comes in here

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.179
of course it goes out here but when the
water is done running

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:41.499
you still have amount of water that's
trapped in here

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:44.920
that's why it's called Pete rabbit traps
the water

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.649
ok so the water is trapped in here why
that water trapped in here so that the

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:59.199
sewer gases they go out to this in will
come back in and come up through here it

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.399
come out to your house

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.270
the water stops the sewer gas before it
comes back up into your house and that

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.760
eliminates any sewer gas or any smells
you might get your house as you know a

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.910
constant smelled sewer gas can be
harmful to your help

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.580
so it's important that you have a p-trap
you can find P trap on your floor drain

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.540
upon you

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.360
which is up under your basement floor of
the floor and utility room

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.710
you have me traps on your tub

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.510
and with the toilet you have a built-in
trap that is called a strap which allows

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.600
the when you flush the water allows the
water to create a section which sucks

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.820
all the the water most of the water out
of the toilet so that your ways to be

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.140
washed away

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.070
now that's the important thing about a
p-trap is very important that you have a

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.380
p-trap to wear sewer gases won't come to
your house and every now did you do get

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.820
any kind of smelling your house you
might want to check your p traps are you

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.250
might want to check the P traps in the
floor drains and just a flashlight down

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.920
if you don't see any water shining back
at you

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.360
what you need to do is just get you a
cup of water off and just pour some

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.410
water on that p trap and refill that p
travel is nice and wet

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.070
so it's you again don't come up in there
ok now with that let's go ahead and put

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.110
the P trampling

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.490
all right that was my draping inside
feeling

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.490
line it up with the trip

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.140
yeah

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.049
did not have to have included and line
it up and says the place i usually like

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.599
taking a lot of a dab of glue and just
kind of popped off the outside is to

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.980
make sure we have that nice and secure

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.150
so I want a house that ever hit you
