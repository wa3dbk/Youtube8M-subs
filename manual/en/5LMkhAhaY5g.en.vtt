Hi! This is Tine Buechler from Business Growth
Training on behalf of Expert Village.com and

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.380
in this clip I want to talk about networking.
Now I know that people talk a great deal about

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.540
networking and I want to just briefly touch
on what networking is and what networking

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.890
isn’t. Earlier I mentioned that anywhere
between 65 to 95 percent of the jobs that

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.070
are available are only in the hidden job market.
In order to get access to those jobs you need

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.379
to talk to people and by talking to people
find out about those positions. That is what

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:41.420
networking is. Essentially it is a positive
gossip. Typically when 2 people gossip, 2

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.649
people talk together and this person has this
information and that person has that information

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.350
and they exchange information and when the
conversation is done, neither party owes the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.879
other party anything. Networking is essentially
like that. The only thing is that gossip has

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.379
a very negative reputation where networking
is very positive. So the idea of networking

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.750
is talking to somebody and sharing information.
For your part, you are going to share your

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.610
promo, your name, background and the kind
of work you are looking for. On the part of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.590
the other individual, you are seeking information.
Information that he or she might know that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.710
will help you move forward in your job search.
You can network with anybody. Some of the

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.660
greatest job leads I have come across have
come from the most unlikely positions. I went

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.680
through a drive through once and got a great
job lead. I went to my doctor once and got

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.000
a great job lead. One of my clients got his
best job lead ever when he was getting his

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.070
hair cut; his barber had told him. So it’s
not just networking specifically with people

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.210
you think are in power although, those are
very good people to network with. You can

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.280
network with anybody. All sorts of people
have all sorts of information. They just aren’t

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.100
thinking to share that with you because they
don’t know you want that information. So

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.630
strike up a networking conversation, get talking
to somebody, share your promo, let them know

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.630
what your work experience is and the kind
of work you are looking for and in return,

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.700
you will get all sorts of information which
will allow you to access all those jobs that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.709
are in the hidden job market.
