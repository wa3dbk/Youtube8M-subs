00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.500
Say, Miss Eyelash.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.600
What is it, Misa?

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.700
I got my heart broken...

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.300
Oh dear...

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.700
What does that mean?

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.200
Geez...

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.200
It means, I found out that the person I like doesn't like me back.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.300
I see...

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.400
That must feel ever so lonely.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.700
Yea...I feel ever so lonely.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.300
It makes me feel all alone.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.900
Miss Eyelash, do you ever get lonely?

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.600
Well...

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.700
There used to be many others like me in this forest.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.600
Back then it was always lively, and everyday was like a party.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:30.700
During full moons, we used to all pile up into a tower so high that it could almost reach the moon.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.000
But I wonder why...

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.500
They began disappearing all of a sudden, and I was left all alone.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.600
Miss Eyelash...

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.900
But you know...

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:00.700
Now I have you Misa, that pays me lovely visits.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.100
Then I don't feel lonely at all...

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.100
I'm okay.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.700
Really?

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.700
I love you too, Miss Eyelash.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:28.400
When I'm talking to you, I feel so warm and fuzzy inside.
