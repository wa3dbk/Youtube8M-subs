00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.640
In this clip we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure to remove, inspect,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.110
and overhaul your vehicle's alternator. In
this step we're going to talk about the proper

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.590
service procedure for inspecting our voltage
regulator and brushes, and our commutator

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.130
inside the alternator. Now the alternator
is going to have several more components inside

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.880
of it. Some diodes, diodes that make up the
rectifier bridge, it also has a bunch of windings

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.520
inside the armature. The armature spins inside
a large electromagnet, which is generated

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.410
by the fuel from the battery and control by
the, your voltage regulator through the brushes.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.070
Now most of these components are replaceable
and rebuilt companies do replace them when

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.000
they're bad. However, the availability is
slim to none for the consumer, those rebuilt

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.890
manufacturers by them in large volume and
it's very difficult to get them from a parts

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.640
store. The parts that are available though,
are the wearing items which will be your brushes.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.130
As you can see here, I have my brushes, they?re
actually still connected to the regulator,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.320
here and here. You can see the wear that has
occurred on the brush compared to the new

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.210
one. Line that up for you just like so, as
you can see the difference. These brushes

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.060
are worn out and should be replaced. What
will happen is as the graphite wears down,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.250
the copper wiring will be exposed. Now copper
is pretty soft, but it's still harder than

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.000
the graphite. And it will tear into and damage
your commutator, if your commutator is damaged

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.300
you cannot replace it. So you're going to
want to catch this before those brushes wear

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.880
all the way down. As you can see even on mine,
just due to age, that the wiring is beginning

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:57.420
to degrade. Inside here is beginning to fray.
And that is the proper service procedure for

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.430
inspecting your alternator.
