00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.280
A Meccano two speed automatic gearbox.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.060
This was made by Michael Edwards  in the January 1975 Meccano magazine.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.499
Like most automatic gearboxes there is a centrifuge which provides sideways movement as it speeds up...

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.449
... to engage different gears.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.000
What is a bit unusual about it is the movement is on a lay shaft.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:33.660
That rod is moved over by the centrifuge and then these three rods here get moved over also.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.840
At very low speeds it doesn't drive the output at all because this dog clutch arrangement doesn't engage.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.700
As it speeds up that dog clutch engages for low gear.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.780
That's off this gear wheel.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.880
When it speeds up even more it goes into high gear.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.220
And two things happen there. One is low gear disengages and that's actually done underneath...

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.520
... on this socket coupling. It actually disengages from this end gear wheel.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.600
The gear wheel has a long grub screw on it which disengages from the coupling.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.540
And the top one here engages with this bolt here.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.320
There's also a spring to make sure the centrifuge moves slowly over.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.400
Anyway, let's see it working.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.960
[Motor starts]

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:42.680
Right, so this is idling. It does move slightly the output but it's basically idling, not turning in neutral.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.120
As we speed up.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.040
[Motor more loud]

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.580
It goes into first gear.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.220
So that dog clutch is engaged.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.480
And then we go into high gear.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.820
[Motor even louder]

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.860
And that bolt's now engaged with that gear wheel.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.120
So it does all work quite well.
