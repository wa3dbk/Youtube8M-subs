00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.900
Thank you. Good morning. My topic is
technological convergence.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.710
David’s talk in personalized medicine is
sort of an illustration of that.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.720
I’m going to argue that it’s one of the
major trends taking place in health care today

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.350
is the development of products and
procedures

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.690
that combine multiple complementary
technologies.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.250
So, quick illustration outside the
healthcare is the Apple Iphone.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.630
The Iphone combines 23 existing
applications or devices

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.240
that used to be separate

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.180
and it combines these into one product at
one quarter of the cost.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.370
So, you can see some of the implications of
what technological convergence

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.050
might mean for healthcare.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.920
Technological convergence will serve
several different trends

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.350
taking place in healthcare.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.020
Disease management which is coordinated
care for chronic disease populations.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.860
Personalized medicine which is the
combination of drugs and diagnostic

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.630
test to serve patients with specific
genomic make ups

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.800
and information technology and
bioinformatics.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.600
Technological convergence can take on many
forms

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.270
the combination of any of these circles
designated here.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.480
Biologics communication technology imaging
navigation,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.080
bioinformatics implantable devices,
nanotech polymers and materials sites.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.120
All combinations can be included in
technological convergence.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.160
Much of technological convergence

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.600
will take the form of a targeted controlled
local delivery of a drug

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.890
via a marriage with a device pictured over
the right side.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.800
So, technological convergence is really the
marriage of different kinds of products.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.070
Pharmaceuticals and biologics in the one
side,

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.710
devices, cast litters and other material
sides is on the others.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.540
First technological convergent product was
a drug eluding stent.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.770
You take a bare metal stent, you add on to
it and anti inflammatory drug

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.030
to reduce restenosis in clogged blood
vessels to prop open and keep open arteries

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.820
so patients don’t have heart attacks.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.120
The economic benefit is pictured here

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.680
and this is the world wide growth of drug
eluding stents.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.330
It is not just in the west, this is a world
wide growth.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.430
It is just showing some of the market
potential.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.760
The other thing is this can be market
disruptors

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.010
as well basically taking away business from
cardiac bypass surgery.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.840
So, that there are disruptors as well as
great market potential products.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.250
Another example is the combination of
spinal cage devise

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.250
with bone morphogenic protein,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.820
a biologic inserted into the spine

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.190
which helps bone grow in the spinal cord
reducing some of the pain

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.020
and improving the stability in the spine

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.960
with the next generation technological
convergence product.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.570
A third illustration is marrying navigation
or imaging device

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.800
with minimally evasive surgery techniques

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.710
so you can actually implant a hip or a knee
inside a patient

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.720
with much more precision so you don’t have
to have as many revisions.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.720
There is much less discomfort to the
patient.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.690
Very promising technological convergence
product.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.880
Another illustration much in the way that
David talked to you about

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.090
is marrying drug development and
administration

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.200
with a series of molecular profiling
technologies

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.960
or the Omex, Prodiomex, Genomex,
Metabelomex.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.070
Basically and Herceptin was in the
illustration,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.570
but very proactive personalized medicine.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.370
Another illustration will be marrying
molecular biology

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.940
with high speed, high power computing.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.550
This gives rise to the whole field of bio
informatics

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.160
with modeling analysis. Visualization
prediction

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.460
which will also be a critical component of
personalized medicine.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.430
Sixth illustration of convergence
technology

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.640
will be marrying an insulin pump with a
continuous blood glucose monitoring device

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.390
which will be part of the disease
management for chronic illness.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.980
Diabetes as a classic chronic illness. Not
only prevalent in the west

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.840
but also in India and China. So, these
products have world wide potential.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.080
Then, you can take these blood glucose
monitoring devices

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.780
hook them up to a mobile wireless devise

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.150
and then transmit data on the patient’s
condition to a physician

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.320
which will help not only in the treatment
of the individual patient

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.490
and the patient compliance with their
diabetes medication

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.130
but also the effectiveness and treating
populations

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.330
or subpopulations of patients who have
diabetes.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.170
The future of technological convergence one
thing might be microchips

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.580
that are implanted in the body for program
delivery of drugs,

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.740
other technological platforms

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.750
might be married together including tissue
engineering, microelectric

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.130
mechanical systems, material science,
robotics, Bio materials.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.780
Technological convergence will have several
challenges.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.060
One is just marrying totally different
cultures.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.520
The cultures that pharmaceutical and
Biologics

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.270
with the cultures of medical devices.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.740
Once more is chemistry and biology

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.930
and the other is more engineering and
material science.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.240
Totally different cultures. Totally
different way of looking at risk.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.110
Totally different time horizon.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.350
So, this is not an easy thing to do.
Unlike the long term potential,

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.080
there are huge implications of
technological convergence

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.040
for both companies and countries

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.880
and sort of focusing on a single technology
or a cluster of firms

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.380
making a single technology.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.460
We are going need to be focusing on related
diversification

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.990
with companies that make multiple
complementary products

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.700
which maybe combined in what are known as
health cities into technology parks

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.110
having multiple technology platforms

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.700
where the research will be
multidisciplinary development will be cross boundary.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.970
The partnerships will be more industry
academia in nature

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.160
and where the clusters of firms are making
complementary technology.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.510
Thank you.
