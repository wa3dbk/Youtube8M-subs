00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.980
So today we want to talk about the subject
of first time driving tips.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.950
What is important to learn when we first start
our driving?

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.800
And I feel that the most important thing is
speed control.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.779
We want to have the ability to accelerate
and to brake in a nice, calm, smooth manner.

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.869
So the first time we get in the car, we want
to be able to get a feel for the accelerator.

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.530
We want to realize that you don't have to
press too hard on that accelerator to get

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.640
that car to start to accelerate.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.239
It's a nice, smooth touch on the accelerator,
and the same thing with the brake.

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.670
We want to have a nice, easy touch on the
brake so that we can stop the car and accelerate

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.160
the car in a nice, smooth manner.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.579
The other thing is our hand position when
we're driving.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.429
It's nice, soft hands are very important in
learning to drive.

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.039
We don't want a death grip on that wheel.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.590
We want nice, soft hands, like pretty much
anything that you do in sports, your hands

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.620
have to be nice and soft.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.750
If your hands are soft and you're not real
tense, you'll find that you have the ability

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.219
to steer a car much, much better.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.159
You also want to be able to get the big picture
when we're driving.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.590
We don't want to stare at anything because
when you drive, you will follow your eyes.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.590
Okay?

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.409
So if you're looking to the right or you're
looking to the left and you're staring at

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.450
that portion of the vehicle, that's the way
the vehicle will move.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.280
When people drive a car for the first time,
they have a difficult ability to understand

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.180
how far they are away from the vehicle to
the right, and that's because the right side

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.189
of the vehicle is a little further away from
you than the left.

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.429
So invariably what they usually do is they
stare down to the right side, and what happens

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.780
when you stare to the right, your car will
go to the right.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.609
So you want to pick your eyes up.

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:01.950
You want to keep your eyes ahead of you looking
out ahead and you'll find that you follow

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.950
your eyes.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.270
So if your eyes are straight ahead the car
will have a better chance of going straight.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.640
So again, we want our acceleration and our
braking to be nice and smooth.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.409
So, the first thing you want to do is get
in your car, realize you don't have to press

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:22.510
real hard on those pedals to get the car to
stop and to get the car to accelerate smoothly.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.750
The first time in, get used to the pedals,
then get used to your steering, nice smooth

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.310
hands, nice soft hands will give you the ability
to control the vehicle the best.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.080
Then, you want to look straight ahead.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.090
Remember, you're going to follow your eyes,
so you don't want to be staring left or right

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.260
because that's the way the car's going to
go.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.750
If you keep your eyes ahead, you'll have a
much better chance of going straight.
