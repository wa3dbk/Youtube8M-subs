00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.860
[Parrot TV]

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.580
I always knew,

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.840
how keeping parrots can be joyful passion to have,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.660
and simply spending time with them

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.640
can be an inexhaustible source of satisfaction.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.300
But only here in India,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.440
I got to know that parrots kept at home,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.300
may in some way determine their guardians fate

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.860
and be source of an experience of a religious nature.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.760
To us, brought up in a different culture,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.940
Hinduism seems to be a colored tale,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.840
in which the worlds of gods,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.840
humans and animals, mix up together.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.960
Usually, for the Indians animals are not just pets.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.420
Indians attitude to particular species

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.000
depends on the role,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.780
which they played in tales about gods,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.100
that were described in the holy books.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.040
Certain species of animals are used

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.260
in different kinds of religious ceremonies.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.480
The second biggest religion of India - Islam

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.280
- coexisted with Hinduism for ages

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.020
and has been under its significant influence.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.500
Indian ways of relating to animals

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.620
may seem rather specific to us.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.460
We must remember,

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.800
how our cultures are different from one another.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.540
In the natural environment of Kerala

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.400
parrots are not as common

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.540
as in central and northern India.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.380
Trading  the representatives of the native fauna is prohibited.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.580
However, this ban is not strictly obeyed.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.000
Buying aboriginal species of birds

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.600
from route trader,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.220
doesn’t appear to be a problem at all.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.880
We Europeans, sometimes do not realize

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.780
that keeping animals at home,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.360
may be resulted by such completely surprising reasons.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.640
I doubt that anyone among us, if asked:

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.640
why they keep parrot,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.140
would have given a reason

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.960
similar to that provided by Mohamed.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.340
His motivation is deeply considered

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.440
and based on a peculiar ideology,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.480
which has its roots in a religion- Islam.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.740
But in its specific modification,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.020
which derives from Hinduist tradition.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.840
I ‘am not convinced that a Muslim theologist

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.540
would have agreed with some views of my interlocutor.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.060
Mohamed comes from Kashmir,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.540
but runs a shop

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.740
selling products of Kashmiri craft in Varkala,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.220
placed in the state of Kerala.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.200
Every day his Indian Ring-necked parakeet

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.640
sits in front of the shop in a tiny cage,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.580
arising tourists' curiosity.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.320
In Europe we have breeders

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.060
proud of their new parrots varieties,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.060
or just keepers of tame accompanying parrots,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.220
who derive their pleasure from petting their pets.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.520
What is your - Indians' attitude

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.620
towards parrots kept at home?

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.240
I need to say, I am a Muslim.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.280
Usually, I saw the green parrots,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.740
which recite the Quran.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.360
They say the Indian name of Allah or

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.300
"There is no god but God".

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.080
I'd appreciate, if I die,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.980
I need a parrot to repeat

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.760
lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāh ,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.820
which means: "There is no god but God".

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.680
then I will be in the heaven.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.400
So when  he grows up,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.220
I would like to teach  him this prayer.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.460
This is what I like.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.580
And I  love to keep this one.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.700
You see? He is not scared,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.200
he always wants to kiss me.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.200
Usually, green parrots bite,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.200
but  he doesn’t bite me.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.000
When I open the cage,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.620
he doesn't go away. You see?

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.820
He doesn’t go. This is why I like  him.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.600
And I feel very good,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.660
when I keep the parrot in front of my shop,

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.620
because it’s like a karma.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.340
In India we have a karma.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.840
My sister had problems with her eyes.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.000
She went to the hospital in Cochin,

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.860
and had a surgery.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.840
Before that, all doctors said that it is impossible to do.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.220
But, when I bought this parrot,

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.960
I took my sister to hospital,

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.280
and now everything is fine.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.880
She doesn’t need to wear glasses or lenses,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.880
the surgery was enough.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.480
Now my sister is okay.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.420
And I bought a new house and overtook this shop.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.700
And I also got married and I have got a daughter.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.740
Now everything is going well,

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.220
because when someone wants to keep something,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.300
it should be suitable for his work,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.880
health or home.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.260
If I would keep any other items,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.560
something green as well,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.520
maybe I would lose something.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.000
Usually in Kashmir, when I buy something new,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.640
I have to check in the Quran,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.720
whether it is good for me or not.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.680
The Quran showed me that it is good for me.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.260
It showed my name  - Mohamed Owes

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.720
and a green parrot, which matches me.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.920
That’s why I keep it.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.200
Usually, other people who keep it may lose something,

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.500
have problems in their homes or something else.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.340
But this is good for me.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.580
Everyone is happy.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.960
I bought a new house,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.060
I don’t know how I collected money.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.680
It must be to his merit.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.180
I repay him how I can.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.040
As soon as I wake up

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.760
I need to think that the parrot

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.080
has to eat breakfast before me.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.760
I have to feed  him first.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.140
One more thing is that I used to argue with my brothers,

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.440
and now it is over.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.280
It looks like  he has a good influence on me.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.320
When I  find another one - I’ve been  searching for a month,

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.380
I will keep them in separate cages.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.740
For example, if I want to keep an eagle

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.480
or something else,

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.300
first I must check, if it is good for me,

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.020
my home and my family.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.620
Then I can keep it.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.920
You also can find it in your Bible.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.640
It is the same.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.040
For example, there are different stones:

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.780
ruby, sapphire, amber, diamond.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.640
First you must check,

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.560
which stone is suitable for you

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.560
and then you can wear it. Right?
