00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.670
How to Extend the Life of Your Computer.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.410
Call off the funeral arrangements for your
computer—a second life is only a few steps

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.410
away.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.390
You will need A computer A can of compressed
air A Phillips-head screwdriver An external

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:24.310
hard drive Antivirus and anti-spyware programs
A new RAM chip An antistatic wrist strap A

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.310
computer A can of compressed air A Phillips-head
screwdriver An external hard drive Antivirus

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.310
and anti-spyware programs A new RAM chip and
an antistatic wrist strap.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.779
Unplug any electronic device before opening
it.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.840
To ensure you don't produce an electric shock
inside the computer, ground yourself by touching

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.870
something metal before touching the inside
of the computer.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.870
Step 1.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.649
Turn off and unplug the computer.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.100
Carefully remove your computer's case with
the screwdriver.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.570
To further protect from electric shock, wear
an antistatic wrist strap, available at electronics

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.610
stores, and attach it to your computer to
ground you.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.610
Step 2.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.079
Using the compressed air, blow away dust and
debris that have accumulated inside.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.000
Screw the cover back on and give the exterior
plug-ins and keyboard a once-over with the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.710
compressed air, too.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.710
Step 3.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.890
Transfer any large files, like presentations,
music, photos, or giant databases, onto an

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.409
external hard drive.

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.790
Clearing out files over 50 megabytes frees
up valuable hard-drive space and keeps your

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.560
machine running smoothly.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.560
Step 4.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.200
Locate, uninstall, and delete any programs
you don't use.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.510
For PC users, you’ll find a simple Add or
Remove function in the control panel.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.180
For Mac users, open the Applications folder
and click and drag unwanted programs to the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.180
Trash.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.590
Then, empty the Trash.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.340
Limit the number of programs that run automatically
when you turn on the computer.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.070
It will increase your overall processing power.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.070
Step 5.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.040
Every time you access a web page or read an
email, your computer stores information in

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.030
temporary files, which take up disk space.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.660
Macs automatically delete temporary files,
but PCs do not.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.880
To manually do so, use Disk Cleanup, located
in System Tools.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.680
Empty out your Recycle folder or Trash weekly.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.110
Simply placing files in the bin does not remove
them from your hard drive.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.550
Step 6.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.890
Scan your hard drive for infected files with
an antivirus and anti-spyware program.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.290
Many programs locate and report harmful files
for free, but charge a fee to remove them.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.170
Find an antivirus program that scans your
system at least once a month.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.170
Step 7.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.319
Over time, files on a PC's hard drive fragment,
slowing down your computer.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.730
To "defrag" a Windows operating system, open
My Computer and right click on the C drive.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.969
In the Tools tab, under Properties, you’ll
find Disk Defragmentation.

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.870
Defragging takes several hours, so be sure
to leave enough time.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.700
Macs that run OS X operating systems don’t
require defragmentation.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.700
Step 8.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.860
On a Mac, permission errors can clog the system.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.090
Before and after you install new software,
go to Finder, click Go, select Utilities,

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.680
and then Disk Utility.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.099
Click on Macintosh HD, and click Repair Disk
Permissions.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.099
Step 9.

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.920
Adding random-access memory (RAM) will improve
your computer's performance and extend its

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.920
life.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.769
To check how much you currently have, on a
PC, go to the Control Panel.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.890
Click System, and then the General tab.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.470
At the bottom of the page you should see the
amount of RAM.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.430
On a Mac, in Finder, go back to the Utilities
folder, and click System Profiler.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.299
Click the Memory tab.

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.299
Step 10.

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.029
Every computer model requires a different
kind of RAM.

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:28.620
Visit the manufacturer’s website to find
out what kind of RAM you should install.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.620
Step 11.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.409
Turn off and unplug your computer, and put
on your wrist strap if you have one.

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.340
Remove the cover to access the RAM slots,
located near the (usually green) metal plate

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.709
known as the motherboard.

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.889
The computer will either have empty slots
for extra RAM, or you'll have to replace old

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.170
RAM with new RAM to increase capacity.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.609
Now enjoy your computer's new lease on life!

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:56.559
Did you know In 2008, the number of personal
computers in use reached one billion worldwide.
