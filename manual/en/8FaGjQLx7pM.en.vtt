[music]
[skates against ice]

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.720
&gt;&gt;Tarasai It's kind of become part of my body.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.430
I've been playing hockey since I was 9 years
old and skating on the ice is just like walking

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.929
on the ground for me now.

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.280
[music]
&gt;&gt;Tarasai My name is Tarasai Karega.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.180
I'm a second year grad student in the School
of Tourism and Hospitality Management, studying

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.180
Sport Business.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.520
[music]
&gt;&gt;Tarasai I currently work for the Ed Snider

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.680
Youth Hockey Foundation.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.720
It falls under the NHL's "Hockey is for Everyone"
umbrella.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.190
Our foundation targets boys and girls ages
5 to 17 who are Philadelphia residents, who

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.079
otherwise would not have the opportunity to
play this sport, because it's expensive, because

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.270
culturally, it's not associated with people
like them.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.600
[music]
&gt;&gt;Tarasai I manage the facility in West Philadelphia

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.060
on 63rd and Walnut.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.030
I'm out talking to school and organizations
and marketing our program to get more kids

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.480
involved, to create partnerships, and just
get the, get the word out there about our

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.890
foundation and all the opportunities we provide.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.010
[music]
&gt;&gt;Tarasai After I graduated from college,

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.070
which was 2009, I wasn't sure what I wanted
to do.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.860
I was talking to a family-friend who said
to me, "You know, Tarasai, you could own a

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.180
team," and I laughed and I said, "Hm, I could
own a team," and so that kind of sparked my

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.790
interest to, uh, pursue the business side
of sport and not just the competitive play

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.790
aspect.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.810
I decided that I, in addition to working here
at the foundation, I wanted to pursue my master's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.810
degree.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.960
[music]
&gt;&gt;Tarasai I'm learning about the world of

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.600
sports, the world of entertainment, all the
opportunities that are out there for someone

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.220
like myself who started as a hockey player
and is transitioning into the professional

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.220
world.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.229
[music]
[whistle blows]

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.979
&gt;&gt;Tarasai For these kids, you know being on
the ice, they're being exposed to a lot of

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.670
different opportunities, and they see me as
a professional.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.750
And I want to be a role model for them and
let them know that it's ok for people like

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.950
us to participate in a sport that, when I
was younger, people told me I couldn't participate

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.132
in because I was a female, and because I was
black.

00:02:05.132 --> 00:02:05.143
[music fades up and out]
