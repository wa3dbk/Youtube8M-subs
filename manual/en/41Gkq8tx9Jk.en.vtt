00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.900
Good morning, I’m Christian Zago.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.670
I would like to briefly introduce you
this very particular wine.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.040
Some preliminary remarks:
Ca’ dei Zago is a family business farm that, since 1924,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.370
lives and works farming a vineyard
of 6 hectares in Valdobbiadene.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.300
Today with  biodynamic methods.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.320
Since 1958, we exclusively produce this kind of wine.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.770
Prosecco Col Fondo is a sparkling wine
produced through the fermentation in the bottle.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.250
And this is quite normal.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.090
So let’s see the peculiarity:

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.080
At the end of this process,
the yeast is not amassed in the bottle’s neck,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.050
freezed and removed, but it stays in the bottle.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.610
The bottles are put in a vertical position

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.830
so that the yeast can slowly sediment
at the bottom of the bottle.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.040
And this is how Prosecco Col Fondo is produced.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.320
There is no degorgement of the wine,
so we never open the bottles

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.650
or do any corrections and the wine
comes to you as it was born.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.980
Completely dry, without any residual sugar
and with very low sulfites:

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.800
all information you will find,
together with the bottling date, on the back label.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.830
For this kind of Prosecco,
the presence of a light turbidity in the glass

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.020
should not be considered as an imperfection,
but as a typical feature.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.080
Another important thing is that
the wine is characterized by a great longevity,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.700
since we work in the winery in order
to maintain the natural balance that was created in the vineyard.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:56.080
It represents the tradition of my village, Valdobbiadene:
before the coming of the modern fermentation technology,

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.710
Prosecco was simply as is, col fondo.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.960
Thank you!
