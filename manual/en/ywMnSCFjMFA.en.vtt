Hi! I am Drew Finn here for Expert village.com.
We are going to discuss how to cut down a

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.550
tree safely today. This video is brought to
you by Black Dog Video. You can visit it on

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:21.449
blackdogvideo.biz. On your escape route if
you are looking straight down the tree and

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.240
you are standing say here cutting, you are
planning on having it fall say this direction.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.599
You have got to look up the tree and make
darn sure it is not going some other direction

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.120
in particular towards you. Now obviously if
the tree starts falling and there is now way

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.400
in heck, you could push on that tree and stop
it. It is common in whatever direction it

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.390
wants to go. So, that’s why we like to loop
on it with a rope and you can pull it, but

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:55.160
that is the theory of the notching. So, on
this case, if we are going to fall this way,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.760
the notch would have been in this side of
the tree right here and then we do the felling

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:10.841
cut through here. If we are using a felling
wedge, let’s take a bigger tree. If you

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:18.910
have a bigger tree over here, we have it notched
here and we are cutting through. Say it is

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:26.520
a large tree and we get a chain saw laid right
here and we are heading through. On this side

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:36.440
we put a felling wedge in and that could be
pounded in with a hammer and we cut through

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.610
most of the way. You can stop cutting and
then tap in the wedge. If you have got it

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.310
in, so it is fairly close the wedge and make
it start to fall, you may have to go back

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.580
in and cut a little further with your chain
saw, but the wedge could be in there, it is

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.450
a plastic wedge, so if you accidentally touch
it with the chain saw, it is not going to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.070
damage your chain saw or if it flies off,
it is not as likely to hurt you. So you cut

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.420
through and the tree falls this way.
