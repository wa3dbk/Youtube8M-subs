00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:13.651
I'm in love, madly.

00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:17.898
With an Opel.

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.555
An Opel Astra. 

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:26.866
This is the nicest Opel since the GT. And that was in fact a Pontiac. 

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:31.995
I love the Opel Astra OPC. It's gorgeous. 

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:37.483
Very direct, hard and bumpy. You feel everything. 

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:40.730
One fantastic car.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.532
280 HP on the front wheels. A very hard chassis. Gorgeous. 

00:00:51.412 --> 00:00:56.508
But there's another brand new hot hatch on sale. 

00:00:56.508 --> 00:01:00.676
This is the all new Ford Focus ST. 

00:01:00.676 --> 00:01:06.068
New, wild and completely different than the Astra. 

00:01:20.492 --> 00:01:25.644
Opel wants to compete with the summit: Focus RS, Megane RS. 

00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:30.546
But Ford say there won't be a new Focus RS. 

00:01:30.546 --> 00:01:34.051
There will be a Fiesta RS, they say. 

00:01:34.826 --> 00:01:38.975
I don't understand, the last one was very successful. 

00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:45.278
That makes this Focus ST the most powerful hot hatch by Ford. 

00:01:45.278 --> 00:01:53.167
And since Ford build very well driving cars, they must prove this car can compete the OPC. 

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:58.344
Well, I don't believe it can. 

00:01:58.344 --> 00:02:02.409
As Roy said, the Focus chassis is great. 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:10.256
Opel are not that good at that, but OPC did a fantastic job on this suspension. 

00:02:10.256 --> 00:02:18.672
Push this button, the suspension gets so very hard. You feel everything. 

00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:23.192
A but too much perhaps, but I love it. 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:33.048
It has 280 HP, but you only get that at very high revs. 

00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:35.752
That's a drawback. 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.208
The Focus has 30 HP less, but it doesn't really feel that way. 

00:02:43.208 --> 00:02:46.560
Because it gets the power at lower revs as well. 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.040
From 2,000 rpm it's there. Just a short hesitation for the turbo. 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.928
Unlike the Astra. 

00:02:56.928 --> 00:03:00.107
In accelleration, the Astra is not much faster than the Focus. 

00:03:00.107 --> 00:03:04.100
Enginewise, the ST wins, I think. 

00:03:06.787 --> 00:03:12.987
About the suspension. Ford has a reputation, and this ST is exactly what you'd expect. 

00:03:12.987 --> 00:03:15.970
It even feels slightly RS-like. 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.331
Same steering, same feedback, same directness. 

00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:24.346
Then you push it, and you feel that it hangs on the front wheel, slides away. 

00:03:24.346 --> 00:03:29.313
An RS turns in much more. But this is an ST, one step lower. 

00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:34.819
Typical Ford: it dives a bit, you lift the accellerator and wow. 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.730
The rear breaks out. So you can compensate understeer. 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.170
That might not make it faster, but more fun. 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:03.283
The looks are so extreme. Everyone looks. 

00:04:03.283 --> 00:04:12.178
Look at those lines. It's a great thing to look at. 

00:04:12.178 --> 00:04:15.506
And those massive 20 inch wheels. 

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:18.289
Allright, that's just looks. But I am rather visual. 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:24.098
At this point, no chance for the Ford. The Opel looks so great. 

00:04:24.098 --> 00:04:32.145
The Focus looks too high and heavy to look like a great hot hatch. 

00:04:32.145 --> 00:04:40.186
Still, Ford did well. Fine wheels, sideskirts, exhaust, roof spoiler. It looks powerful. 

00:04:40.186 --> 00:04:43.472
But not compared to the Astra. 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:08.343
One more thing: the traction of the OPC. It has a mechanical diff lock. 

00:05:08.343 --> 00:05:12.040
Is has so much grip. Incredible. 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.529
True, especially now on wet tarmac, the difference is obvious. 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:19.704
The front wheel of the Focus had a hard time, in spite of the electronic diff lock. 

00:05:19.704 --> 00:05:22.825
The differential of the Astra makes a big difference. 

00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:27.713
But the ST is supposed to be an allrounder, not as extreme as the OPC. 

00:05:27.713 --> 00:05:32.728
More a Golf GTI-competitior. And I think that for an allrounder, it does a great job on the race track.

00:05:32.728 --> 00:05:37.971
And it is more practical. It has rear doors, and a bigger trunk. 

00:05:37.971 --> 00:05:43.341
But today, it's about agression, power and fun. And than, the Astra is the winner. 

00:05:43.341 --> 00:05:48.797
But: the OPC still has one big problem...

00:05:48.797 --> 00:05:50.891
But do you think we should mention that problem?

00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:55.741
No. Some things can better be denied.
