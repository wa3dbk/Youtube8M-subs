00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.800
The Natural Products LINCHPIN Laboratory is
a collaboration center that enables chemists

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.340
to work with biologists to address issues
of human disease.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.870
In particular, what the natural products LINCHPIN
laboratory allows biologists and chemists

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:34.760
to do together is to take compounds that are
identified from plants, bacteria, marine sponges,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.220
and translate those to biologists to do basic
cell biology.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:47.420
So, in some way, we're middle man as chemists
that synthetically manipulate these compounds,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:56.090
these elements that come from plants and sponges
to enable discoveries at the chemistry-biology

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.070
interface and beyond that in trying to understand
about human disease.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.530
Our natural product LINCHPIN laboratory has
brought collaborations with many scientists

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.880
worldwide.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.480
We theorize bioactive nature products provided
by the collaborators to do the structure activity

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.270
relationship studies.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.580
We synthesize nature product or derivatives
which are potential struct leads and in a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.630
few cases, we also assist in collaborators
with natural product isolations and structure

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.630
stabilization.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.360
The structure activity relationship study
we perform here in the lab allows us to achieve

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.610
our ultimate goal of synthesizing cellular
probes from these bioactive natural products.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:56.270
To achieve this goal, we synthetically attach
a linker to the original natural product which

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.500
then enables us to further attach a reporter
tag to make the cellular probe.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.000
With this probe, we allow the biologists to
figure out what the natural product is doing

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.610
in such cells or ultimately in the human body.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.409
So here I'm showing you a structural model
of what one of the natural products that comes

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.359
from in fact a marine sponge.

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:26.060
This is a compound that the natural product
LINCHPIN laboratory is currently working on,

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.760
in terms of figuring out if this compound
is useful as an anti-cancer agent that is

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:44.040
able to kill cancer cells, and we want to
find out how useful it is in doing that.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.630
In order to further integrate undergraduate
teaching and research, I initiated the TAMU

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.780
Undergraduate MiniPharma.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.299
THis is basically a pharmaceutical environment
for teaching undergraduates.

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.040
A current project in this semiatomis group
of undergraduates is a collaboration with

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.959
the natural products LINCHPIN laboratory.

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.689
We're targeting an unusual approach to cancer
chemotherapy.

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.819
Currently, a group of high achieving undergraduates
are involved with organic synthesis of novel

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.889
enzyme inhibitors, there is actually five
members in this group, two graduates are performing

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.560
computer simulations of the enzyme inhibitor,
and one student is performing biological essays

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.590
under laboratory professor James Sacchettini.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.049
So, Texas A&amp;M has made it possible through
providing laboratory space of course for my

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.890
research group, but beyond that, they've also
provided initial seed funding to start the

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.680
natural products LINCHPIN laboratory which
again is attempting to translate these basic

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.959
research findings to potential treatments
for human disease.
