00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.760 position:73%
SHREYA: I think now we are very much ourselves,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.409 position:83%
much more so than we were the first week when we were

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:11.969 position:89%
really just trying to make sure we were all just friends.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.859 position:69%
KATHERINE: And it's so much better that way.
I mean, we have a lot more fun,

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.059
just thinking and

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.050 position:61%
being who we are. And I think that's an
important lesson going into it. Really

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.660 position:66%
I mean, it's so cliché right? Be yourself,
but it's still really

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.070
good to always just

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.579 position:61%
from the start, I don’t know …. be YOU.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.220
SHREYA: Yeah, exactly!

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.430 position:95%
KEVIN: What's interesting, I think, about friends from
college rather than friends you may have had from high school

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.780 position:83%
is, like, everyone that you meet here are people that

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.040
you've like kind of chosen to stick

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.520
with and still be friends with.
SHREYA: My 18th birthday was

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.120 position:64%
pretty much like two weeks into the start
of the school year,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.890
and I remember being afraid

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.980 position:86%
in the summer that my 18th birthday was not
going to be special because nobody was going to know it

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.310 position:66%
and I wasn't really going to have friends,
because it was

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.580 position:78%
literally only two weeks into having met everyone.
But it was

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.920 position:72%
the best birthday I ever had.
KATHERINE: Because your brother came to visit,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.240 position:70%
and we all surprised you
and we fixed you something. Oh, it was great!

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.920 position:77%
SHREYA: Yeah, and there were so many people there
and I just felt so loved.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.690
It was really remarkable

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.380 position:80%
because I just didn't think that I would be able to
make friends so fast in any place like this.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.170 position:61%
KEVIN: There's a whole experience here,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.710 position:89%
like, when … In close quarters with such great people you
want to keep that wherever you end up.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.560 position:69%
And so I think because we've seen that
firsthand since the end of our freshman year

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.340
being brought into this

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.180 position:67%
really tight circle. It’s just like, yeah —

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.930 position:73%
I mean it's just sort of confirmed
everything we've been sort of feeling, I guess.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.420 position:92%
DAVID: You have this duty to maintain this sort of network,
this awesome network

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.140
of alumni and friends

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.170
and it would be a shame

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.280
to not stick with it after

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.430
building it over these four years.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.380 position:75%
SHREYA: I think there is always a natural, like,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.400 position:69%
anticipation and setting expectations, but …

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.970 position:78%
I mean, it's difficult to know what they're going
to be like just from an introduction email, so ...

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.790 position:70%
KATHERINE: Right, and in terms of liking you,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.770 position:64%
I guess I just had to think like, "I have

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.250 position:91%
plenty of friends back home, so I don't know why people
here would be any different." SHREYA: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.380 position:98%
KEVIN: You never know who you're going to be put with. Sometimes,
the mystical sheets that tell you

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.249
exactly who

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:11.980
you're going to be with,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.439
sometimes they don't work.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.389
And sometimes they work out
extremely well. But either way, a

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.269 position:73%
lot of it is if you come into it with the right
mindset. That helps.

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.079 position:95%
KATHERINE: When you've never had roommates before, and you've

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.029 position:92%
never lived with your friends … I mean, you might not think

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:27.909 position:59%
that your living habits are usual or …

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:33.729 position:98%
SHREYA: Yeah, it's difficult to know what you're like
or what you want really when the only people you've lived with are family

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:34.759
and friends on a short-term basis.

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.680 position:83%
KATHERINE: Right! Or who you get along with best when
you are living … So

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.119 position:64%
it's like a natural apprehension to have,

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:44.010 position:84%
to be uncertain of whether you'll get along with them.
But I think people should

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.399 position:91%
take comfort in knowing that you will get along with them.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.969
And even if you don't, it's not
the end of the world,

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:53.879
because if nothing else you

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.269 position:72%
can make do with what you have and you'll find
friends in other places, but I think

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.229 position:81%
I really haven't heard of
treacherous roommate situations at all at Princeton.

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:05.609 position:98%
SHREYA: The best part is really just knowing that everyone is there, right there with you learning the same

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.729 position:92%
things about themselves, about Princeton, about each other.

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:11.349
So that just makes it

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.139 position:66%
that much easier to bond. KATHERINE: Yeah.

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:22.139
