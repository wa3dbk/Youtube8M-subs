Hi everyone! This is Keith's Toy Box. Today we are going to show you the Mack Truck Carry

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:14.089
Case from Disney Pixar Cars. Mack is a bright red cheery truck from the Radiator Springs

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.570
Classic Collection. He's an 18-wheeler and you can store up to 16 cars.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:36.500
You can pack up all your cars inside Mack and take them with you. There's also a handle so you can carry Mack.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.420
and the side doors open up so you can easily load your cars inside.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.760
So now let's take Mack out and try him.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:05.240
So there's Mack. There's a handle so you can easily carry and pick him up. 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.040
Mack has a very nice smiling face. You can see his teeth right here with nice

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.780
detail, side mirror, and handlebars

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.180
and a Rust-Eze logo on his cap.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.240
has really nice eyes

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.510
The truck turns. He has 18 wheels.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.880
We have Lightning McQueen at the back with a very nice plate number.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:00.360
Mack is about 18 and a half inches long, 5
inches tall, and 4 and a half inches wide.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.680
Let's try opening this side by pressing this
button here. Now let's load the cars.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:44.240
First we have Lightning, Chick Hicks, Sheriff, Luigi,
Todd, Finn

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.860
Whoops Finn doesn't fit there.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.060
Let's try putting Todd there and putting Finn here.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.240
Francesco

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.020
and Guido.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.680
There you go.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.280
Now let's load up the other side.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.460
Wingo.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.239
This truck is made for 155 scale cars but you can

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:36.599
also use Tomica cars that are in 164 scale. This is a Lightning McQueen Tomica car.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:49.520
Mater and other Tomica cars.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.080
Hot Wheels cars work as well.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.420
There you go. Now we have loaded

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.500
up to 16 cars all in Mack carry case.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.520
The back panel opens as well

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.240
so you can launch your cars and ready to go.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.380
