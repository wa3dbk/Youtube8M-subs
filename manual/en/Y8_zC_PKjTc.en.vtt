00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.340
An ambitious film to say the least, the latest
film produced by the Walt Disney Animation

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.850
Studio cost over 260 million to create, making
it the second most expensive movie ever made.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.610
Luckily though, it also has the distinction
of being the second-highest grossing animated

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.520
feature Disney has ever released, behind only
1994's "The Lion King".

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.541
Tangled is yet another re-telling of the classic
Grimm Brothers' story of Rapunzel - a beautiful

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:31.779
princess with magical hair, imprisoned in
a secluded tower by her evil kidnapper / mother,

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:32.779
Gothel.

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:37.030
Luckily for Rapunzel, played beautifully by
Mandy More, Flynn Rider, voiced by Zachary

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.970
Levi - a bandit on the lam, accidentally chooses
her tower in the woods for his hideout.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.020
And from there, the two begin an unwitting
relationship as Rapunzel sets out into the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.360
world for the first time.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.670
In true tradition, Disney has easily created
one of it's best animated films in years - combining

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.739
a traditional animated style with today's
more conventional CGI renderings.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.600
All of the characters, from the evil hag Gothel,
to the background characters our heroes meet

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.960
along the way are well-voiced, delicately
animated, properly developed, and undeniably

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.960
charming.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.390
Although not marketed as such, "Tangled" is
indeed a musical - with nearly every other

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.759
scene being capped off by a musical number.

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.829
Some of these songs are large and bombastic
involving dozens of characters... others are

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:19.010
quiet duets about love and hope - and all
of them are catchy, and well-executed in not

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.479
only advancing the plot, but providing depth
and context to the character's stories.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.720
For the boys in the audience though, "Tangled"
comes complete with several large action sequences,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.640
including one exhilarating sequence that has
our protagonists escaping into a cave to avoid

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.460
a collapsing dam of water closing in behind
them.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.020
Besides having a haunting singing voice, Donna
Murphy's portrayal of the villainess, Gothel

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.670
absolutely steals the show in most of her
scenes... bringing to life a villain so nuanced,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.310
and complex - she'll easily go down as one
of great bad-guys of Disney lore.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.560
And although many of the jokes were family
friendly, and funny... some were a bit too

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.619
slapstick and childish, in contrast to many
of the films more mature themes and scenes.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.200
For example, the climactic scene in the final
act, where Flynn and Rapunzel sing to each

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.920
other while floating in a row boat watching
the sky lantern festival is as beautiful as

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.670
it is emotional and inspiring.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.869
And although much of the film treads on familiar
ground of classics past, this scene alone

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.870
propels the film from another average re-telling
of Rapunzel to a true modern-day classic.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.670
"Tangled", "Imaginative, Disney at it's finest".

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:33.569
Well, that's what I thought of the film, now
see what you had to say in the YouTube comments.

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.569
Here's the rate-o-matic to show us how we
scored "Tangled"... an EIGHT and a NINE.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.659
Despite being a bit derivative of past Disney
films - Tangled really does shine in it's

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.010
own way, I thought it was GREAT.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.430
You more than agreed, many of you really praising
this film for it's animation and music...

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.349
scoring it an AWESOME.
