00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.930
My name is David Rus; I�m from Sacramento,
CA.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.900
I came to Rightlook here in San Diego hoping
to learn a lot, seeing what I could get out

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.770
of it and I definitely got a lot out of it.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.040
I found rightlook.com through my uncle who
actually went here about 4 to 5 years ago.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.570
He had a really good experience and I came
here to get a really good experience also

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.730
and I did.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.650
The training class that I took was for paintless
dent repair technician.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.440
I took the class because I�m really interested
in cars; l I like fixing things.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.970
My trainer was Greg hull, he was very helpful,
very patient with us, taught us step-by-step

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.890
how to do everything.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.820
I had a lot of one-on-one interaction with
Greg, really good trainer and I recommend

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.340
him to anyone else.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.080
My favorite part of the training was definitely
how hands-on it was.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.800
I came in here and thought we were going to
sit on a desk, watch presentation and slideshows

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.710
but we were in the shop every single day working
6, 7, 8 hours a day at least and it was very

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.710
hands on.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.200
I learned a lot I didn�t think I could learn
this much in 6 days.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.170
The first couple days were pretty challenging,
of course we walked in here we didn�t know

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.470
what we were doing.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.620
From day one, the beginning it was hard, struggling,
had to be patient.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.320
By the 5th or 6th hour I already knew how
to do way more than I did when I walked in

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.180
so that just goes to show how hands-on it
is, how much we learned in a few hours.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.230
By the second day, it was way more challenging
again but by the end of the day I was learning

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.060
more again.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.010
Before we actually started on an actual car,
it was kind of intimidating but I felt pretty

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.410
confident on working on a car.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.050
Just got to block everything out and focus.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.561
Greg was right behind us, telling us what
to do step-by-step how to do and remembering

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:13.349
what we learned the days before and it was
good, we go through it.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.260
This class was definitely worth it, definitely
worth my time, worth my money, worth everything.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.420
Like I said, I got a lot out of this class.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.290
For everyone else watching, this program is
the best program.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.739
I think it�s going to change my life; it
could change your life.

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.959
Wherever you are, PDR is the way to go, Rightlook
is the way to go, Greg is the way to go.

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:52.480
It�s great to get into it and I�m definitely
glad I did it.
