00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.750
Hi everyone.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.750
I'm Rincey and this is Rincey Reads.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.210
Today I'm going to be doing an unboxing video
for you guys.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.690
Oh the stuff inside of here moved while I
picked that up.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.250
What I'm going to be unboxing for you guys
is this new comic book/graphic novel subscription

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.200
service called Landfall Freight.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.660
This is a brand new service.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.430
It's $30 a month for a box.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.400
And what you get in the box is 1 graphic novel
that's been published within the last 60 days,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.230
1 to 3 either single issue comics or trade
paperbacks, and then 1 to 3 additional goodies

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.230
in each box.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.440
Now the thing with Landfall Freight is that
they are focusing specifically on female-led

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.030
comic books and graphic novels, as well as
female creators.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.160
So if you are someone who's looking for options
or different types of comics or graphic novels

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.580
to check out and you specifically want ones
that are female focused, then this might be

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.580
the one for you.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.550
If you guys are interested in this box at
all, I will leave links and information down

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.870
in the description below so you guys can check
it out if you're interested.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.059
They do ship internationally, but shipping
costs extra on top of the $30 per month so

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.850
definitely just look into that depending on
where you live.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.150
Another thing, just so you guys know, they
did send me this box completely for free.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.800
I have no idea what's inside.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.800
Um.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.830
But they sent it for me for review and to
show off for all of you guys to see if you're

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.830
interested.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.970
Also another thing, they mentioned in the
email that they sent me that there's some

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.360
extra goodies that will be coming in the July
box but isn't included in my box because by

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.030
the time they shipped my box out the goodies
weren't at their like warehouse yet.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.799
So there are a couple things that are going
to be missing from my box, but that's fine.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.720
You'll get the general sense of what you can
get.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.320
Oh this is such a cute box, like the box itself
is so adorable.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:51.009
OK so the first thing on top I see is a tea
infuser that looks like, um, a knife life

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.790
from a video game or a comic book probably
more appropriately, which is super cute.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.040
You, uh, put your loose tea on the inside,
like the handle comes off the top and then

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.670
you put your tea inside, then you put it in
your hot water.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.670
So this is adorable.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.110
I can already see things.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:16.379
So this says "Spoilers and info, yo" on the
bag and has information about all the stuff

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.430
that you are getting in here.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.423
I just saw one of the things and I'm super
excited.

00:02:25.423 --> 00:02:26.423
OK.

00:02:26.423 --> 00:02:27.423
I'm getting way ahead of myself.

00:02:27.423 --> 00:02:32.060
DIY bookmark and pencil, which is related
to one of the comics that's included.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.739
Oh man, I'm super excited.

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:34.739
Hold on.

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:35.739
I'm going to explain everything soon.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.380
Also they gave their own tea, which is called
"evil plo-tea-ings" blend.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.190
It says "this unusual tea blend is inspired
by" one of the comics that I will explain

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.190
in a second.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.319
"A white tea blended with strawberry, sassafras,
ginger and spices.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.650
Think strawberry root beer.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.120
Sip hot or iced while plotting or reading
about plotting.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.120
Oh man.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.940
I can't smell it and I don't want to open
it.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.410
But that sounds amazing.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.920
There is a pencil included in here.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.879
There's a lollipop included in here.

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.370
They sent a singe issue of Ms. Marvel, issue
number 16.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.510
Mine got a little bit torn in the shipment.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.610
But I already have this, but there's no such
thing as too much Ms. Marvel.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.610
Am I right?

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.959
Comic I don't have that I've never heard of
before.

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.111
Oh no, I have heard of this one.

00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:25.650
I saw this one and I thought about picking
it up.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.510
It's called The Spire by Simon Spurrier, Jeff
Stokely, and Andre May.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.140
This is issue number 1.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.420
It's by Boom!

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.550
Studios.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.720
This is Sha who is a one-eyed commander of
the city of Watch and her tall and pointy

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.030
dessert bound city.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.760
Apparently this is supposed to be a universe
filled with women, which is awesome.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.490
But yeah, she looks pretty badass.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.490
Am I right?

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.670
And the final thing, which I'm so excited
about because I'm literally like the 100th

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.860
person on my waiting list for this graphic
novel.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.170
[opens wrapping] It's Nimona!

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.799
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited about this.

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:09.080
I'm not buying any books or anything right
now, but I've been wanting to buy Nimona so

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.610
badly.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.220
And I'm on library's hold list for this but
now I own it and this is amazing.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.630
So yeah, the theme that goes along with everything
that's included.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.530
So this is in the shape of a shield so you
can kind of color this however you want.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.400
And then there's the sword theme as well so
it all kind of ties in with the images and

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.800
themes that are happening in Nimona.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.290
Yeah, this is amazing.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.290
Holy cow.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.690
And this is like a hardback copy so this alone
is worth like $20.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.550
So yeah, that was my Landfall Freight unboxing
video.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.410
Again if you guys are interested in any of
this you can leave a comment down below or

just check out the website that I have linked
down below.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.080
The girls who are working on this are really
amazing.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.139
They're really sweet.

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.020
So I'm sure they'd be happy to answer any
of your questions.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.060
They have like a Twitter and everything like
that.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.360
I definitely recommend it because this alone
was like worth it.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.280
But yeah, thank you so much to Landfall Freight
as well for sending me the box.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.800
I definitely appreciated it and I highly recommend
checking this out if you love comics and graphic

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.330
novels and you are looking for a subscription
service that caters specifically towards the

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.330

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.050
Or not caters toward, but features.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.300
