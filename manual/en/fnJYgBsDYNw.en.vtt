00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:02.570
Whats up guys, Squirtdude here.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.480
Ever since the creation of mob farms people
have been trying to come up with efficient

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.830
and simple solutions to quickly bring down
a mob's health so that they can be easily

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.860
killed by the player. However, most designs
ignored a very powerful tool.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.609
Whenever a mob dies of environmental damage
they usually do not give XP. However, if the

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:28.039
player contacts the mob five seconds before
their death, then it will still generate XP.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.050
This devices uses that concept.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.120
Using this, the player can kill a mob with
full health in a single punch and still receive

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.239
the XP.

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.719
Like all good mob farms, the first step is
to gather all the mobs at a central location.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.100
It is also worth noting that, if this device
is done on a spawner then it has to be at

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.100
least 5 blocks under or 10 blocks away from
the spawner.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.929
The reason this design uses lava is because
it is the quickest and the smallest way of

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.840
killing mobs. Is also has the added bonus
of killing baby zombies that are pushed around

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.399
when the holding chamber becomes crowded.

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.680
The redstone for this project requires only
a single piston and a redstone torch, considerably

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.070
less then most redstone focused designs.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.530
To reduce accidental suffocation a transparent
block has to be used to hold the mobs in place.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.060
This can be glass, half slabs or even stairs
just as long as it does not cause suffocation.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.680
This whole process of building the device
can be completed and fully operational in

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.009
The way this works is when the mobs fall down
the pipe they are held in a central holding

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.320
cell. When the button is pressed the mobs
are released and pushed into a 3x1 chamber

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.320
with lava at above their heads. At this point,
when they get punched or damaged by the player

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.799
they jump up and get killed in the lava thus
generating XP.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.219
And there you have it! A simple, cheap and
efficient mob grinder that can be built with

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.070
in minutes. And works for most mobs regardless
of their health. By using the environment,

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.429
we are able to keep from making tedious water
elevators and using up precious redstone.

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.340
Anyway thats about, I hope you enjoyed and
I will see you next time!
