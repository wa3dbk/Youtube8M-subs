Hi, I'm Marlee Speigel, founding team leader
from Wildtree. I'm here on behalf of Expert

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:13.139
Village to show you how to make the finishing
touches on a delicious cr?me brulee. We're

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:21.200
going to do the glazing process. I've used
two different types. One is the pumpkin cheesecake

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:28.039
blend from Wildtree. I'm just going to sprinkle
a little bit of that on one ?cause I like

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:35.829
pumpkin. On the other one, I am using the
very berry cheesecake blend from Wildtree

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.839
and sprinkling that on the other. Now, these
can also be made, and you'll see in later

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:49.409
segments into cheesecake pies, cheesecake
dips, cheesecake spreads. My husband, John,

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:58.089
is going to show you with a torch how to glaze
them. He's using this because I'm not really

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:06.480
good with the torch but he knows it better.
Hi, I'm John Speigel. This is a standard kitchen

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.780
torch available at any kitchen supply store.
It's powered by butane. It's refillable. You

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.210
get a canister of butane and you can fill
it right through the bottom. It works very

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.210
much like a large cigarette lighter. There's
a safety catch, you push that down, you push

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:36.660
the trigger, it lights, sometimes.
There it goes. Now, if you don't have one

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:43.020
of these torches you can also put it under
your broiler for about five minutes. It really

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:55.270
is quick to melt that sugar in the cheesecake
blends. Thank you John and as a little treat,

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.860
let's try some of this. You try the very berry
and I'll try the pumpkin; rich and creamy

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:14.060
if you look at the product;
my favorite dessert.
