00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:06.429
The UCF College of Medicine uses today's technology
to train tomorrow's doctors. And that innovation

00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:12.829
provides a glimpse into what technology will
bring to medical education in 2033.

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:13.750
"Hi, Doctor"

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.189
The college's virtual patient visits the doctor complaining of double vision. He's suffering

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.710
from cranial nerve damage. A standardized
patient can't fake this illness and someone

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.819
actually suffering from this condition couldn't train
medical students because they'd need immediate care.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.360
But in the virtual world, medical students
interact with their patient and see how he

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.030
responds to tests. They even use a virtual
ophthalmoscope.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.020
This technology is in its earliest stages.
Imagine how it will transform in 20 years.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.660
[Phone Rings]

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.910
A student's cell phone rings at 1 a.m. It's
her virtual patient calling with chest pain.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.519
She tells him to go to the ER and from her
computer she examines the patient, orders

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.379
tests, stabilizes him and monitors his progress.
Faculty evaluate the student ensuring she

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.150
can demonstrate key clinical skills -- before
ever hitting the wards.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.440
UCF is also developing a virtual family that
will allow medical students to do what they

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.990
can't do today -- follow a patient from birth
to death all in the course of a module.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.320
In one recent simulation, students faced a post-operative emergency.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.210
"A Healthy, 40-something year old man, who had a gallbladder removal..."

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.010
"...and the nurse comes back around to see how the patient responded to the medication, but finds him unresponsive."

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.500
Their patient mistakenly received insulin
instead of pain medication. Some students

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.210
couldn't diagnose the problem, and their
patient didn't make it.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.900
But the lesson came in a safe setting where students learn from their mistakes.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.110
The college's 98% digital library carries
the motto "information anywhere, anytime,

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.750
on any device" And students get much of their
material on iPads -- a technology that didn't

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.530
even exist before 2010. As you can see, with
technology, the future of UCF is limitless.
