00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.480
Okay as you can see, I've already started
slicing these up. Be careful with your hand,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:11.280
this is a pretty large knife. I would not
use a serrated knife; your standard flat blade

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.570
is just fine for this. Again, I purposefully
chose this size and shape of a yam, so that

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.600
I can hold onto it and not have things on
my cutting board, just to hold onto it while

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.320
I slice it. I've already had some going, and
a couple of them didn't turn out perfectly,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.880
but that's okay potato chips don't either.
That's alright. Some are a little bit thinner

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.030
and thicker than others. Think about your
favorite potato chip, they're not all the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.421
same size, shape, thickness, anything like
that. So just start slicing these. I do try

00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:46.379
to go as thin as possible, because I want
these to bake up nice and crisp and pretty

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.360
quickly. I already have my oven preheating
at 465 degrees. I put it at a very high temperature,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.100
because I want these to get crisp. We are
not trying to slow roast these, honies. We

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:08.100
want to get them nice and crisp, like a potato
chip. So have the oven on at 465 degrees;

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.700
very hot. I'm going to finish slicing these
up, but let me show you what we are going

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:21.240
to do with these. We are going to get these
started on our baking sheet with our parchment

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.750
paper, otherwise known as God's gift to bakers.
Just take that little bit of butter, again,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:37.750
however many tablespoons you need, and just
brush the butter onto the yam chips. Don't

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.549
be shy, butter and yams go great together!
Just brush those on, like that. And then,

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.899
for the final touch, I'm telling you this
is so easy, is to get some good sea salt on

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.470
here. Don't be scared of that either, your
favorite potato chips are nice and salty.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.830
The yams have sweetness to them, so that saltiness
is really great together. They go so well

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.600
together, the sweet yam and the nice sea salt
is perfect. So you are going to pop these

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.250
in the oven once I'm done slicing these up.
