00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.490
&gt;&gt;How many of you have experienced a PowerPoint
presentation gone wrong?

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.180
Long, boring, tedious.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.800
It doesn't have to be that way, and the rules
are actually very very simple.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.940
The number one rule to remember is: keep it
simple.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.910
I grew up in a very sports-oriented family,
so everything had a sports analogy.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.860
If I got an A on a paper, I hit a home run.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.540
And so I was thinking about giving a presentation
and the things you need to think about before,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:40.260
and a lot of it can relate to what an athlete
going into a meet or game prepares for.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.700
For example, what's one thing that an athlete
has to do before the big game?

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.020
One thing.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.670
Very simple.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.670
Starts with a 'p'.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.670
Practice.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.660
Exactly.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.480
The second thing is having a good coach.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.870
Having a good coach is critical in being an
athlete,

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.040
and it's also critical in giving an effective
presentation.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.180
Practice in front of somebody who has little
knowledge of your topic.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.750
Therefore, they can offer you objective advice
as to what's confusing,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.770
or what should be added, what isn't making
sense.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.490
Time.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.980
In many sports you live and die by the clock.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.359
Your presentations should be the same way.

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:20.640
Know your start time, know your finish time,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.369
practice your presentation so you know how
long you're gonna go.

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.409
The minute you go over your time limit, people
stop listening.

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.860
Game over and you lose.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.680
No matter where you speak today, there's a
chance you're gonna end up online.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.429
There's a chance you're gonna end up on YouTube,
even if you don't know it.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.079
So always dress for the camera.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.829
You want to stay away from busy patterns.

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.240
Stick to bold, solid colors.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.039
Now we're gonna run through some common mistakes.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.139
Number one being wordiness.

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:53.189
Putting everything you're going to say on
a slide means your audience is going to read

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.160
from your slide instead of focusing on you.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.860
In addition, it means you are more likely to read from your slide, turning your back to the audience,

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.360
and subsequently putting them all to sleep.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.960
Presentations are not reports.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.460
Presentations are summaries of reports.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.400
If you have a lot of other information that
you want to share with your audience,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.000
provide handouts.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.870
Because there's a lot of really cool templates
out there,

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.650
but they do nothing for your presentation,
they're distracting.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.860
Stick to simple, easy-to-read fonts and colors.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.310
Use the same font throughout your whole presentation.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.909
With PowerPoint, simple is always better.

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.580
Third common mistake is very busy charts and
graphs.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.560
PowerPoint was actually originally designed
to do charts and graphs.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.940
But since then, it has evolved and people
abuse it, severely.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.030
This is not useful for your audience.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.549
This is better.

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.269
Instead of putting all your information into
a graph and onto the slide,

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.269
put your main point.

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.540
Put one point and stick it on the slide.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.629
Number one is know your audience.

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.629
What is the best way to get their attention
from the get-go?

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:00.820
Is it a YouTube video?

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.820
Is it music?

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.069
Is it photos?

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.170
Is it a joke?

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.170
Are you funny?

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.930
Will funny work with your audience?

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.290
If not, then avoid it, 'cause it gets awkward.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.650
And your conclusion.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.230
The conclusion is the time to wake up your
audience.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.310
They've kind of zoned out, it's just a natural
thing that we all do,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.700
we zone in and out.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.280
So you want to get their attention back to
you,

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.730
either by changing your tone of voice, moving
around the room,

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.450
even saying, "In conclusion..."

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.299
because automatically, people will sit up
and listen and say "Ooh, she's almost done."

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.500
Which is fine, because it means they're paying
attention.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.659
So there's no reason to drag on the conclusion.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.560
Keep it short, keep it simple.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.400
And...summarize your key points once again.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.540
This is the -- I like to think of it as the
goodie bag you're giving your audience to

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.540
walk out the door,

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.609
a thank you for attending your presentation.

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.930
They're leaving with these three key points,
the main points of your message.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.040
We have reached the finish line, my friends,
so some ideas to remember.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.010
This is my gift to you as you leave today.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.090
Be prepared.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.780
Practice your presentation, have a good coach,
know your equipment.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.560
Avoid common mistakes.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.730
Busy slides, cluttered charts, too much technology,
crazy templates.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.590
Most of all, have confidence in yourself.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.650
So thank you very much.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.470
Are there any questions?
