BRANDON ANDERTON: Some would see
it as an exercise in futility.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.350
It's invariably
going to wash away.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.370
But if it gets people
to stop and think,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.250
my time is well spent
right then and there.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.810
LAURA LING: You were a
professional motorcycle road

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.510
racer.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.690
What did you love about
motorcycle racing?

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.023
BRANDON ANDERTON: I've always
been an adrenaline junkie.

00:00:21.023 --> 00:00:24.452
So it's just the most
extreme circumstances

00:00:24.452 --> 00:00:25.970
that you can think of.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.520
Being out in the elements,
being on a motorcycle,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.990
and then being able to
carry the speed that you

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.719
can through corners
and stuff, it's

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.200
a perspective, an experience
you can't really synthesize

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.550
through any other means.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.480
LAURA LING: Have you experienced
many crashes and injuries?

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.420
LAURA LING: Oh yeah.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.580
Yeah, I've broken my
legs three times a piece,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.490
my arms twice, ribs,
probably about six ribs.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.650
Disintegrated my tib,
fib, and my femur.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.890
Broke my pelvis in half,
and my lower two ribs,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.325
and my scapula on my left side.

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:00.700
LAURA LING: Racing was your
passion, and all of a sudden,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.390
you weren't able
to do that anymore.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.239
How did you deal with
that emotionally?

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.660
BRANDON ANDERTON:
I was relegated

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.050
to living in a wheelchair
for about a year and a half

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.430
inside my condo,
essentially a shut in.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.750
So I had a lot of time to
work out and practice moving

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.170
and regain my ability to walk.

00:01:19.854 --> 00:01:22.020
LAURA LING: Can you talk
to me about the ritual that

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.380
has helped you through this?

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.338
BRANDON ANDERTON: Yeah.

00:01:24.338 --> 00:01:25.040
I found art.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.980
And it's not something
I grew up with doing.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.665
And I got the idea
one of the times

00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:31.040
that I was out
there on the beach

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.990
to just start scrawling
stuff in the sand,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.650
and I wouldn't have to worry
about anybody else's judgment,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.649
because I was there by
myself and the waves were

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.260
going to take it anyway.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.000
So the process for
me is, basically,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.310
being with a thought,
an emotion, or a story.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.638
Usually on the drive over,
something will come to me.

00:01:47.638 --> 00:01:49.346
And then a shape will
manifest from that,

00:01:49.346 --> 00:01:50.555
and it all starts from there.

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:52.845
LAURA LING: Can you tell me
what goes through your mind

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:54.410
when you're creating this art?

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.920
BRANDON ANDERTON: Sometimes
there's-- I'll have a bit

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.810
of a pity party.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.690
You know, why me?

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.720
You know, why has
this happened to me?

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.630
Other times, I just
think about what

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.690
life is, what consciousness
is, why we're all here.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.503
LAURA LING: It sounds
very therapeutic.

00:02:07.503 --> 00:02:08.669
BRANDON ANDERTON: Extremely.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.280
It's fundamentally changed
who I am as a person.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.060
I was in a really bad place, but
just the creation of the art,

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.570
in and of itself, and that
feeling of gratification

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.550
and thankfulness
and satisfaction,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.470
is something that
I haven't obtained

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.496
from anything else in my life.

00:02:29.637 --> 00:02:32.220
LAURA LING: Do you wait for the
tide to take the artwork away?

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.595
BRANDON ANDERTON:
Sometimes I do.

00:02:33.595 --> 00:02:36.480
It's just an affirmation of
no matter what we do here

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.070
on this world,
nature's still going

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.456
to come back and
reclaim everything.

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:42.810
It's a total catharsis
for me in that regard.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.285
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.080
LAURA LING: And you can also
watch this episode of Rituals.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.705
MIKE SHINODA: And
there are other times

00:03:06.705 --> 00:03:09.790
when I'm hyper-agitated.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.550
In my head, it's like a cyclone
of noise, and it's loud.
