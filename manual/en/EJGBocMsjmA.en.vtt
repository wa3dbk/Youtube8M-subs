hello everyone ...in a previous video i showed you how to make a paper gun that can shoot

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.200
but in today's video i'm gonna teach                              you how to turn this into this

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.700
so today's video is about making those accessories

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.320
the suppressor , the flashlight and the scope

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.700
if you haven't seen the first video , i recommend that you go and watch it first , the link will be on the screen

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.160
but if you already watched it then we can start

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.360
the first thing we are gonna make is the suppressor

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.000
to make it get a sheet of paper and                                 fold it in half both ways like this

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.540
then get a tube of paper glue and put it on the folded paper then roll it like that

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.920
fix the paper roll with some tape                                 then get the tube of glue out

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.320
next get a small piece of paper and cover the opened side of the  tube  with it

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.260
then insert the tube inside the paper roll like that

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.700
use a nail to pierce a hole into the middle of it... this will give it a more realistic look

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.360
then use a small stick to get the tube out

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.380
glue the tip of the barrel and hold the suppressor in place

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.200
the next thing we're gonna do is the flashlight

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.720
first make a piece of roll exactly like the one you made for the suppressor

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.120
then get a sheet of paper and fold it like this

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.440
put the tube of glue inside the paper roll then put it on the folded paper you just made and roll it like that

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.540
after you take out the tube of glue fix the paper roll with some tape then move it to the front like that

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.640
add some glue on the lower piece of roll then hold the flash light in place

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.940
the last thing to do is the scope

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.900
first you need to make a piece of roll exactly like the external piece of roll you made for the flashlight

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.640
then make a small piece of roll like the ones we used to make in the first video and fold it reversely like that

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.660
put some glue at the center of the roll and hold it like that

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.820
then put some glue on the piece of roll and hold the other piece in place

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.780
after that stick the scope between the rolls like this

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.320
but the problem with the scope is whenever you want to shoot a rubber band

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.400
the scope is gonna block its way                                        so you will need to take it out

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.320
and that's it

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.320
