For Expert Village, I'm EJ John Erickson with
Vital Flame Productions and thank you for

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.300
joining us on our sessions focusing on the
baritone saxophone. Okay, we got our reeds,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.450
so in this session we need to get it on the
mouthpiece and start making some noise. So

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.490
this is a good sign. Now, remember when we
pulled this neck out of this particular used

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.350
Bari, I was a little worried that this mouthpiece
was on the neck. Normally, you want to take

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.559
them apart so, I'm a little worried about
what we might find under here. But we need

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:42.649
to be bold and take it off the neck and see
what we find. And we have a mess, a disaster.

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:49.949
And what do I mean by disaster. So this cork
here is broken from here and it's missing

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.729
all the way up to here. You'll notice there's
no cork at all. This immediately needs to

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.649
be taken to the repair shop and fixed. But
say you're impatient like me and you want

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.039
to play anyway. Well, there's a work around
for this situation on the neck and we'll get

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:12.189
to that in a later session. So, let's do first
things first and now we'll work on mouthpieces,

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:22.469
reeds and one additional piece which is a
ligature. So mouthpiece, reed and it's held

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:28.149
by a ligature. So let's start with this. What
are the basic pieces, areas of a mouthpiece?

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.320
The tip, we call this the plate, it depends
on who you talk to what this is called, it

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.320
is called several different things. I call
it the plate because it's the nice flat piece

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.539
that you're going to cook your reed on and
you can tell that they match perfectly from

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:50.219
side to side. So how do you position your
reed? That's really the first step. And what

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.479
you want to do is if you look right up here,
I'm not sure if you can see that too well,

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:03.990
is you want to slide this reed up until you
see just a hair of black coming over the top.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.840
And this should be lined up with the plate,
so left and right it should be centered and

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.420
then you put your ligature on. And there are
several different types of ligatures and maybe,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.230
I'm going to pause real quick and show you
the different types of ligatures that you

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.999
might run into.
