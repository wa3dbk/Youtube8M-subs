00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.390
Welcome to video #11 of the Lead Guitar Quick-Start
Series. In this lesson I’m going to teach

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.100
you some more shapes for your major pentatonic
scale. This is important because it allows

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.520
you to start expressing yourself in other
areas on the fret board. Knowing all of these

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.390
scale shapes really frees you up to explore
some more tonal options on a guitar and helps

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.759
you conjure up some different sounds. Let
me just say it’s more important for you

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.919
to know maybe one or two of these major pentatonic
scale shapes really, really well and know

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.189
how to use them than it is to know all five
of them, the ones that I’m going to teach

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.000
you here, but not really know how to use them
that well.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.850
You can look at this lesson as kind of an
extra credit lesson for the Lead Guitar Quick-Start

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.700
Series. You can take one of these scales and
work on them for a few months and then add

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.270
another one. The idea is to just start getting
familiar with them, pull up the major jam

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.890
track and use these scale shapes when you’re
playing. So let’s jump into these scale shapes.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:01:01.230
You already know this one. The next scale
shape up for the major pentatonic scale, the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.770
lowest root note starts right here on the
fifth fret of the D string. That’s going

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.789
to be kind of your anchor point or your reference
point. Play that note. The other note on that

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:18.030
string is going to be the seventh fret with
your pinky. Remember there are only two notes

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.759
per string in regular pentatonic scale, right?
Those are the two. Over to the next string,

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:37.299
your first finger fourth fret; fourth finger
seventh fret. Next string over, your index

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:45.739
finger is going to grab the fifth fret, pinky
is going to grab the eight fret. Next string

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:56.509
over, fifth fret with your index finger, seventh fret with your third finger. So far from that lowest root note. 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.780
And you can add in the lower notes too. You can do 7, 5 with your pinky

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.789
and second finger on the A string, and the exact same pattern for the low E string 7 and 5

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:29.360
with your pinky and middle finger there so. But there is your root note right there for this scale

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.680
shape. And your other root note is right here
on the eight fret of the B string. So in total

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.740
this scale from the very lowest note all the
way up to the highest note sound like this.

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.799
The next major pentatonic scale shape up ,the next one, has its lowest root note right here

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:58.189
on the tenth fret on the A string with your
pinky. So let’s go from there. You can play

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.180
the notes below it too but let’s just start
there and ascend through the scale. Next string

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.180
over you’re going to play 7, 9 with your
first and third fingers, same exact thing

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.430
on the next string, 7 and 9 with your first
and third fingers. Next string over, 8 and

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:27.859
10, with your second and fourth fingers, and
the highest string seventh fret with your

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:36.159
first finger, tenth fret with your pinky.
So if you start from that lowest root note right

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.940
there with your pinky

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.371
and you can play the notes below it too, which
are the seventh fret of that A string and then

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.070
the tenth and seventh fret of the low E string.
So if you start from the lowest note this entire shape

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.440
and I end it up on the root note right there,
just to kind of lock you in to that sound

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.039
of a G major pentatonic scale.
Next shape up actually starts on that same

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.080
root note on the tenth fret of the A string,
that G note, but you’re going to start with

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.270
your middle finger there instead of your pinky.
So that’s the lowest root note. Play that note

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:44.750
on the twelfth fret with your pinky. Move
over to the next string. Play the ninth fret

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:53.880
with your index finger and the twelfth fret
with your pinky. Next string over, exact same

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:02.540
pattern as the previous string so 9 and 12
with your first and fourth fingers. Next string

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:17.210
over, middle finger is going to grab the tenth
fret, fourth finger 12, so far we have…and

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.710
the last string is the same pattern as the
previous string, so 10 and 12 with your middle

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.910
and pinky. So far that whole thing

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:50.640
and you can play the notes on the low E string too, 12 and 10 with your pinky and second finger. So you can throw those in there too.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:56.900
So you may be on overload right now. Just remember
this is kind of an extra credit thing. Learn

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.080
these scale shapes when you can. Take one
at a time and get to know them really well

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.849
and be able to use them with the jam tracks.
The last major pentatonic scale shape, believe

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.680
it or not you already know the shape but we’re
going to look at it in a little different

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.129
way. So you should know this minor pentatonic
scale shape if you started it right here on

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:24.129
the E note right here. That is also a shape
for a major pentatonic scale. All you have

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:29.139
to do is change your root note over the way
you think about root notes. Instead of using

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.620
this low E as a root note with your first
finger, if you start here on this G note with

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:39.300
your pinky, that’s going to turn this minor
pentatonic scale shape into a major pentatonic

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.379
scale shape. Just play your regular minor
pentatonic skill shape but start here with

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:47.139
your pinky on the root note for G right here.
 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:04.160
I know this is a lot of information and it’s kind of hard to digest all at once but the things you want to focus on are just taking

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:09.400
one scale shape at a time, realizing and memorizing
where the root notes are and being able to

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.449
use it over a jam track. Pull up one of the
major jam tracks I’ve given you and just

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:17.539
experiment with these scale shapes as much
as you can. If you have any questions about

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:21.979
them, leave them in the comments below and
I’ll get back to you or just email me nate@guitarsystem.com.

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:22.229
See you.
