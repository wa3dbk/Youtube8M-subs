Hi this is Made By Mommy, Rainbow Loom Band Designs.

00:00:00.994 --> 00:00:05.763
This is Kim from Made By Mommy and today I'm going to teach you how to make

00:00:05.763 --> 00:00:09.204
one of my easiest charms, the banana

00:00:09.204 --> 00:00:12.824
To make the banana you will need 10 yellow

00:00:12.824 --> 00:00:16.464
loom bands and two brown loom bands

00:00:16.464 --> 00:00:20.174
To begin take a single brown rubber band

00:00:20.174 --> 00:00:24.794
and place it

00:00:24.794 --> 00:00:28.654
across two pegs then

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:35.403
take two yellow bands and stretch them
across the next two pegs

00:00:35.403 --> 00:00:39.174
 

00:00:39.174 --> 00:00:42.743
then take three yellow rubber bands together

00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:45.934
for the next position

00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:49.094
and that's what makes the center of the banana look

00:00:49.094 --> 00:00:53.784
thicker then the ends.   The next pegs need three

00:00:53.784 --> 00:01:00.184
yellow bands again

00:01:00.364 --> 00:01:09.644
and then switch to two yellow bands

00:01:10.454 --> 00:01:14.904
For this last peg, take a single brown

00:01:14.904 --> 00:01:18.764
rubber band and wrap it around that peg

00:01:18.764 --> 00:01:25.764
three times

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:31.614
Like that.

00:01:31.614 --> 00:01:35.773
Then take your hook and

00:01:35.773 --> 00:01:38.804
stretch back the tripled over

00:01:38.804 --> 00:01:42.044
band to catch the two yellow underneath 

00:01:42.044 --> 00:01:46.554
and bring them forward

00:01:46.554 --> 00:01:50.504
then catch

00:01:50.504 --> 00:01:55.364
all three at once for the next position
and bring them forward as well

00:01:55.364 --> 00:01:58.974
and keep going 

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:10.204
and when you get to this last position  

00:02:10.204 --> 00:02:13.524
catch the brown loom band

00:02:13.524 --> 00:02:17.683
on this side and we're going to create a
slip knot

00:02:17.683 --> 00:02:21.164
by pulling this side of the band

00:02:21.164 --> 00:02:25.784
through the center of this side

00:02:25.784 --> 00:02:29.743
Then we're ready to take

00:02:29.743 --> 00:02:36.743
a whole charm of the loom.  

00:02:39.364 --> 00:02:43.544
If you're going to attach this charm to a  bracelet 

00:02:43.544 --> 00:02:46.694
then leave this loop out so that you can connect it

00:02:46.694 --> 00:02:50.104
But if you want to you hide the loop

00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:53.174
put your hook back into the body

00:02:53.174 --> 00:02:56.854
of the banana, catch that brown band

00:02:56.854 --> 00:03:02.164
and pull it through and wrap it around

00:03:02.164 --> 00:03:05.424
and you'll probably need to do that
twice

00:03:05.424 --> 00:03:12.424
to make the rubber band go away completely.
I hope you enjoyed making this the

00:03:12.523 --> 00:03:14.053
