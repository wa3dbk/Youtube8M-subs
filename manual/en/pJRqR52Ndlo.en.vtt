00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.800
great photos on me

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.180
hi this is Joe McNally for at around a
TV a reason I got at our ever

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.289
it's a real store with real people and
I've got friends and associates thereof

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.050
guided me through all my camera
purchases for years hi this is Joe

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.650
McNally for Adorama TV

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.579
and in this segment I'm gonna talk to
you about the effective one

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.690
large beautiful light source in another
video we did

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.280
with the same model Maggie very
beautiful we

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.390
talked about introducing motion while
you're

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.620
using Flash in this I have the same
subject Maggie

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.649
but I'm completely controlling her with
flash and I'm gonna talk about just

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.269
one large beautiful light source and the
powerful effect it has

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.589
on the face for portraiture this light
that I'm talking about is the 74 inch

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.780
Elinchrom Octa it has been the
standard go to traveling

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.290
big light source for photographers for
many years

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.190
I think I bought my first one you know
maybe twenty years ago maybe even longer

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.000
ago

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.450
it's been a standard in the industry you
know

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.660
for easily that law so what it is it's
an indirect softbox

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.390
most of boxes are direct the lamp head
goes in the softbox and points towards

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.060
the subject

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.320
in this enormous of box the lamp head
gets turned around

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.730
okay so the stroke ahead the flash head
actually radiate away from the subject

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.890
into the silver interior the box and
then radiates through the diffusion

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.950
in a very smooth even way you can ramp
up the power

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.120
this the softness of it by moving your
subject close

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.970
so here I'm on a black background and I
take my subject right here

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.380
and then I take this huge light source

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.680
and I knew it extremely close to her so
I'm just sneaking my camera right around

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.220
in here

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.690
okay so my camera angle is right here
and on looking at her right at the edge

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.310
the corner

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.510
the softbox she is literally

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.770
just Dave in light here's a quick tip:

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.319
this is a big thing to move around the
set

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.700
in the middle %uh the light she's just

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.170
literally covered in light if you want
to change the effect

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.630
up this particular lighting solution
don't move the softbox

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.310
that's kind of a pain in the neck move
your subject relative to the softbox

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.980
so in other words if there in the middle

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.020
they're going to get a complete washout
light if you put them

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.459
at the edges they'll be more drama more
fall off

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.459
the light will still be soft but you
introduce an incredibly beautiful shadow

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.740
I think you see on the photograph behind
me there that the late is soft and

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.350
beautiful

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.780
but it rotates relatively quickly into
shadow that means

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.360
she's working right at the edge of the
softbox let me show it to you this

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.660
is this 74 inch Octa okay it's so

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.630
legendary light you know as I said it's
a staple travel photographers

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.240
for many many years it's so popular that
our crime actually

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.220
makes them with different speed ring so
they can adapt to different kinds a

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.069
flash heads

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.550
so it's got a port for the wire where
you place

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.630
your large flat in here right here
