-Welcome to the Exhibition of the Auction House "Fernando Durán". I am José María Quesada, Director of Art and Antiquities. We would like to present to you the works that will come out on July 3 and 4.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:01:07.000
-1 Still life by Francisco Palacios  
-Painted around 1650. Without any doubt, this work was inspired by the later still lives of Juan Van der Hamen, of whom Palacios was a follower. The work we are presenting is simply unique and in a magnificant state of conservation; it could proudly take its place in the best museums of the world.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:33.000
-2 Virgin with Milk. Attributed to Adriaen Isenbrandt
-In the "Virgin with Milk", the Virgin with Child stands out against the background of the poetic Nordic landscape, featuring a walled city dominated by an imposing Gothic structure that could well be a cathedral.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:52.000
-3 The Sienese School: Virgin Enthroned with Child
-In this panel painting the figures of the Virgin and Child are executed with a rhythmic combination of curves and counter-curves that give them a touch of grace and that are so characteristic of the Sienese School of the Trecento.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
-(4A and 4B) Here we have two early landscapes by Carlos de Haes, one painted during his Málaga period and another most likely painted during his stay in Belgium

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:40.000
-5 By ALONSO MIGUEL DE TOVAR
