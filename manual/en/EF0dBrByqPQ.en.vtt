00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.390
Uruguay is just across the Rio de la Plata
from Buenos Aires and well worth a visit.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.890
Many people visit Uruguay to enjoy its beautiful
coastline, as well as it's cities and towns

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.480
like Montevideo and Colonia del Sacramento.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.230
So how do you get to Uruguay from Buenos Aires?

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.460
Here's how:

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.040
One of the most popular ways is by Ferry.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.490
Buquebus is one of the main ferry operators
between Argentina and Uruguay.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.410
The company operates daily crossings from
Buenos Aires to both Montevideo and Colonia

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.280
del Sacramento on the Uruguayan side.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.790
Buquebus also offers bus services to other
places along the Uruguayan coast.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.790
These include coastal towns like Punta del
Este, Piriapolis and La Padrera.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.860
The main Buquebus ferry terminal in Buenos
Aires can be found next to the port area of

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.059
Puerto Madero.

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.879
Within the main terminal building is a ticket
office.

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.520
You can purchase tickets here or online through
the Buquebus website.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.989
Ferries run throughout the day and the company
also runs day trips and excursions to Uruguay.

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.090
If you have time on your hands, you could
travel 1 hour north of Buenos Aires to Tigre.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.320
Here you can catch a ferry to Carmelo in Uruguay.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.930
This crossing takes a scenic route past the
Tigre Delta.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.380
Another way to get to Uruguay is by coach.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.590
To do this you need to go to the main long
haul coach terminal in Buenos Aires called

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.590
Retiro.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.920
The journey from Buenos Aires to Montevideo
takes approximately 8 hours.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.450
Most buses depart late at night arriving early
morning in Uruguay.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.800
Taking the bus can work out cheaper and helps
avoid delays if bad weather is effecting the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.909
ferry crossings.

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.550
Finally, a very quick option but usually more
expensive, is to fly.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.159
There are regular flights from Buenos Aires
to Montevideo.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.920
Most flights depart and arrive from Jorge
Newberry Airport in Buenos Aires.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.680
Other flights go from the main international
airport of Ezeiza.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.369
Whichever way you cross from Argentina to
Uruguay, or visa versa, you are bound to enjoy

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.960
your time in both.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.700
