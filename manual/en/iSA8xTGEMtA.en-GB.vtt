00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.940
Is it rolling in there, or what?

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.600
Is it on?

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.700
It all started when I wanted a new surfboard

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.340
but I couldn't really afford it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.780
I discovered that I could make it happen
if I bought the materials.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.560
So I asked my Father for advice. 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.420
He used to shape sufboards back in the '80s.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.780
He told me it was super poisonous
and a total hassle.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.600
It's the worst idea ever. 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.540
But that didn't stop me.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.040
My name Mathias.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.300
and together with my brother Simon and our friend Bo.
We started the surf brand Oh Dawn.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.360
In Denmark we don't really have
any large oceans around us

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.040
Just small seas and it's almost always shitty weather.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.240
It rains and is often freezing.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.800
And there's almost only waves when it's really windy.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.500
So that creates a lot of challenges
regarding temperature etc. 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.360
So to start a Danish surf brand is
perhaps not the best idea ever.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.320
I can't even begin to count the number of times
we've banged our heads against the wall.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.560
Making clothing is generally really difficult.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.260
I don't think any of us had really considered
how complicated it really was.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.740
Just to know what to look for in terms of construction,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.980
what a good fabric is, what you can and can't do.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.540
It's been an incredibly long learning process.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.900
I think it's tied together by the fact
we love making things with our hands

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.220
and making surfboards and designing clothes

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.560
is the perfect way to work with
surfing when there are no waves.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.660
When we started Oh Dawn
we didn't have any sort of plan

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.260
for how to have it run around.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.860
We didn't have a business plan

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.000
and so they laughed at us down at the bank
when we tried to open a bank account.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.660
So we've had to do it all ourselves.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.800
Everything from making a website,
meeting with customers,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.800
packing boxes, everything.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.400
And they are pretty much still laughing at us.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.020
Sometimes it can be hard to distinguish
between work and free time

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.620
when everything revolves around surfing.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.700
I actually think I had more time in the water
when I had a 9 to 4 job.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.320
I often wish I could take a step back
and just hang with my kid and girlfriend

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.260
and forget all the worries that accompany this.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.480
All the unanswered mails and bills
to pay and dealines to meet.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.300
But then again, I don't think I could live without it.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.300
Just getting that feeling of humility and pride I get

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.960
when I see people wearing the
things we have designed.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.920
It makes it all worth while.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.000
We started in 2011 and despite it
sounding like the worst idea ever on paper 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.660
We're now in sixty stores around the world.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.220
And I definitely hadn't expected that. 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.660
Supporting
Success against the odds
