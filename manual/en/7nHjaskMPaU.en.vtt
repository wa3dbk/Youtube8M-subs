00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.000
So today we're trying a little experiment
with shirataki noodles, also called Miracle

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.290
Noodles. Now, you may have heard about shirataki
noodles because I certainly have. You know,

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.800
in the fitness industry shirataki noodles
have really made a name for themselves, and

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.810
I've heard all sorts of things about these
noodles. I mean, I've heard everything between,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.800
"These things are unbelievable. They're the
miracle food of the century," to, "Oh my gosh.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.359
These things smell incredibly, horribly awful,
and unless you want your husband to divorce

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.949
you, and your kids to disown you, do not open
these in your house." So we're going to go

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.839
on a hunt for shirataki noodles, cook these
puppies up, and see what we can do with these.

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:38.210
Let's head off to the store. So, I was going
to head to the Whole Foods market, which just

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.839
opened up here in Boise, Idaho--first time
we've had Whole Foods--but I just drove past

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.079
there and there were, like, four billion people
in the parking lot, so we're not going to

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.059
do that. We're going to the Boise Co-op, which,
as I understand, also has shirataki noodles

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.299
because they're pretty hard to find here in
Boise. I understand that you can get shirataki

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:59.519
noodles also online. I think you can get them
at Amazon.com, but I'd like to see them in

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.670
person here. I think they're in the refrigerated
section, so let's go ahead and check this

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.450
out. Okay, let's check this out. We're here
at the Boise Co-op. We're going to be looking

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.240
for our shirataki noodles, if we can find
one here in the refrigerated section. Okay,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.470
looks like we got all sorts of options here.
Ooo, little pricey, folks. All right. Now,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.470
we got to pick out which one we want. We'll
do these and maybe a couple of others. Okay.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.940
Well, we're going to try out a few of these
I found--couple spiced ones. We'll see how

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.900
these work. So we're out of here. Have you
ever had shirataki noodles?

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.740
I have not. They look--, they're pretty interesting
I'd say. I work here so I shouldn't say anything

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.100
else. They're very popular, or popular enough
to have a video made about them.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.210
All right. So we're back to the studio now,
and we have three types of shirataki noodles.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.210
We have the Miracle Noodle, garlic and herb,
angel hair plain, and this kind of squishy

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.590
liquid, and then some other brand--shirataki
noodle plain stuff. $7.80. $7.80--most of

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.590
this is liquid. It says it's made from a plant
called konnyaku imo. Okay, people, it's the

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:31.889
moment of truth.

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:37.870
Oh my gosh. Just think of the worst possible
thing you've ever smelled in your life and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.150
then triple that. You just might consider
opening these outside your house, maybe leaving

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.049
them out there for quite awhile. I don't think
you have to worry about any small animals

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:50.180
taking this because if they got within a five-foot
radius, they wouldn't survive. Okay, they

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.730
weren't kidding.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.730
Okay, now we're going to put this in the boiling
water, and it looks a little like seaweed.

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:12.659
The moment of truth. Yeah, basically tastes
like nothing.

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:17.840
Eh, not bad.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.510
Have a little tiny piece.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.849
No.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.519
So it takes a little bit of getting used to,
but it's actually not too bad. So what have

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.790
I learned from my shirataki noodle experience?
One, unless I hit the lottery, I don't think

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.489
I'll be buying anymore of these any time soon.
Two, unless I really want to play a practical

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.749
joke on my family, [buzzing noise] I'm not
going to be cooking this in the house anymore.

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:44.680
And, three, chewing on a box of rubber bands
is less expensive but just as satisfying.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.769
But it's a great way to play a little prank
on your family. Go ahead and cut these up

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.930
just before they get home. You'll be really
popular. So there you have it--shirataki noodles.
