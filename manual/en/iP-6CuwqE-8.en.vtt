00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We have the world's biggest GT grid here in France with 20 drivers capable of winning. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There are many fine cars, many great drivers. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
As a contender, I'm always a bit of a bad loser. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
In any case, I always intend to win when I get into a car. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We're here to try and be on the podium, it's going to be complicated but that's what makes it interesting. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It's the weekend of one-hundredths, I lost the pole position by two-hundredths and that caused David and me to lose the victory by one-hundredth. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000
But that's car racing for you, you get incredible emotions. I love such experiences and I'm really pleased for ORECA.
