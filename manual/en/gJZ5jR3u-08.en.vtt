00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.367
There was never a time my grandfather
didn't have sweet tea in his refrigerator.

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:12.266
Sweet tea is Summerville.

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:15.467
It's part of it.
It's been here forever.

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.400
That's what you do, you sit down
and have some sweet tea and you talk.

00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:23.000
You really do still sit on the porch,
have your iced tea and talk.

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:26.934
Where it all starts is late-1700s.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.133
There's this French botanist
who comes in,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.767
and there's all these
wealthy landowners who wanted

00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:34.667
that type of style on their property.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:37.233
So he brought in things
like azaleas and camellias,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.667
and one of the things that he brought in
is what we know as the tea plant today.

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:43.367
So the first tea plant
to reach American shores

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:48.400
actually happened
at Milton Place, which is today--

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:52.967
nowadays it's the modern-day
kind town line of Summerville.

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:04.533
Dr. Shepherd's tea farm was one
of the first industries in Summerville

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.667
and has
always been Summerville history.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.100
It's always been there.

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:15.100
When he did pass away in 1915,
his farm laid dormant for years

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:18.967
and years and years,
and then the Lipton tea company came in

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:20.600
and bought the property.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:24.667
They uprooted all of the tea plants
that were still alive

00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:26.233
and moved them to Wadmalaw.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.700
And two guys,
local guys who been working

00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:31.800
with Lipton for years, decided
to go ahead and buy that farm.

00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:32.900
It's still active.

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:35.266
It's actually--
they produce the tea

00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:37.100
that is the official tea
of the White House,

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:40.000
and that tea is actually
the same tea plants

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:42.867
that were grown here
by Dr. Shepherd.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.633
The Sweet Tea Trail
is just an easy way for folks traveling

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.633
to take a little road less traveled
through Summerville.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.867
If you drive too fast
down our Main Street,

00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:59.900
you're going to miss those gorgeous homes
that are off the beaten path.

00:01:59.967 --> 00:02:02.667
You're not going to see the park
and take time to sit and walk

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:06.500
and explore it
and just relax a little bit.

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:19.500
People are starting to come around
and take ownership of the fact that,

00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:22.867
you know, one of the most
Southern things on the planet

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:26.934
that almost could
define a culture came from--

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.800
came from us, and people
are proud of it and they enjoy it,

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:34.266
and a lot of artisans
and retailers are getting on board

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:39.667
and creating things like
a sweet tea jelly or a sweet tea pie.

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:47.567
Really, "The Birthplace
of Sweet Tea" is charming and wonderful,

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:52.066
but once you get here, you realize
the whole town is sweet and charming.

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:53.834
Summerville is sweet.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.533
It's the thing
that's at every meeting.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.667
It's at every lunch.
It's at every get-together.

00:02:57.734 --> 00:03:02.400
It's that thing that's in between
the conversation and the relationship.

00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:04.633
It's like the centerpiece
of our culture, really.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.433
Come and see the town
that sweet tea built.
