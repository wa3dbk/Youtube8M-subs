00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:07.710
  

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.670
 [THUNDER]

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.770
  

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.560
 - TODAY WE'RE GONNA GO
 OUT WITH BIOLOGISTS

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.660
 JOHN CALAMBOKIDIS
 AND DR. ERIN OLSON

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.750
 TO TAG THE LARGEST ANIMALS
 ON THE PLANET, BLUE WHALES.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.660
 IT SHOULD BE A
 REALLY EXCITING SHOW.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.670
 - WOW! THAT WAS CLOSE.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.540
 - OF ALL THE AREAS IN THE
 WORLD THAT BLUE WHALES HAVE

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.660
 BEEN STUDIED AFTER COMMERCIAL
 WHALING CEASED, THE CALIFORNIA

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.560
 COAST HAS THE LARGEST
 CONCENTRATION OF BLUE WHALES

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.650
 THAT WE KNOW.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.520
 THE DENSITY IS HIGHEST DURING
 THE SUMMER AND FALL MONTHS

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.690
 IN THE SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.580
 THIS IS ALSO A VERY
 BUSY SHIPPING AREA.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.570
THE CHANNEL SERVES
 AS THE SHIPPING LANES
 INTO LOS ANGELES.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.720
 UNFORTUNATELY, THIS BRINGS
 WHALES AND SHIPS INTO

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.620
 CLOSE PROXIMITY.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.620
 DURING THE SUMMER OF 2007,
 4 ADULT BLUE WHALES

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.500
 WERE KILLED BY COLLISIONS
 WITH SHIPS.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.590
 NOAA IS ASKING SHIPS TO REDUCE
 THEIR SPEED WHEN WHALES ARE

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.680
 PRESENT, AND BIOLOGIST JOHN
 CALAMBOKIDIS IS DOING TAGGING

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.750
 RESEARCH TO LEARN MORE ABOUT
 WHAT GOES ON UNDERWATER WHEN

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.660
 THE WHALES ARE FEEDING.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.710
 - BLUE WHALES ALONG THE
 CALIFORNIA COAST ARE REALLY

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.570
 BEING DRAWN BY FOOD--

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.680
 THAT'S THE MAIN THING.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.660
 THEY'RE ENGAGED IN FEEDING.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.580
 BLUE WHALES ARE EXCLUSIVELY
 KRILL FEEDERS, AND SO THEY GO

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.690
 TO WHERE THE
 KRILL IS ABUNDANT.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.710
 WE'VE BECOME MUCH MORE
 INTERESTED RECENTLY IN HUMAN

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.570
 IMPACTS ON WHALES,
 PARTICULARLY THINGS LIKE THE

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.500
 IMPACT OF LOW-FREQUENCY SOUND
 AND UNDERWATER SOUND, AND NOW,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.480
 WITH RECENT EVENTS IN
 THE SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.630
 WITH BLUE WHALES AND SHIP
 STRIKES, HOW SHIPPING MIGHT BE

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.650
 AFFECTING THEM.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.540
 WE HAVE CERTAIN TOOLS.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.490
 WITH THESE UNDERWATER TAGS,
 WE CAN LOOK AT BOTH WHAT

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.750
 THEY'RE DOING UNDERWATER,
 HOW THEY REACT, AND MAYBE GET

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.570
 A BETTER PICTURE OF HOW TO
 AVOID SOME OF THESE IMPACTS.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.720
 - ONCE THE TAG RELEASES,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.700
 IT IS RECOVERED BY TRACKING
 ITS RADIO SIGNAL.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.690
 DR. ERIN OLSON USES A
 DIRECTIONAL ANTENNA TO HELP

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.760
 LOCATE THE TAG.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.760
 - THERE IT IS.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.530
 - WHEN THE TAG IS RECOVERED,
 PIECES OF DEAD SKIN THAT STICK

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.570
 TO THE SUCTION CUP ARE
 COLLECTED FOR DNA TRACKING.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.550
 THEN ALL OF THE ELECTRONIC
 DATA IS DOWNLOADED TO

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.730
 THE COMPUTER FOR ANALYSIS OF THE
 DEPTH, TIME, AND DURATION

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.640
 FOR EACH OF THE WHALE'S DIVES.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.670
 THE SCIENTIST ALSO GETS SOUND
 RECORDINGS OF ALL THE SOUNDS

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.670
 IN THE WATER.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.650
 WITH THIS, THEY CAN TELL
 IF THERE WERE ANY SHIPS

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.740
 AROUND AND HOW THE
 WHALE REACTED TO THEM.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.510
 BY HAVING A BETTER
 UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT GOES

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.730
 ON WHEN THE WHALES ARE FEEDING
 AND WHAT THEY DO AT NIGHT,

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.700
 THE BIOLOGISTS HOPE THEY CAN
 FIND WAYS TO REDUCE

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.490
 THE WHALE-SHIP COLLISIONS.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.700
 - I THINK A LOT OF THE PUBLIC
 REALLY IDENTIFIES WITH WHALES,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.750
 AND EVEN THOUGH MY STUDIES
 DEAL JUST WITH WHALES,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.540
 ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT
 I THINK THE PUBLIC NEEDS

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.550
 TO REALIZE IS THAT TO PROTECT
 WHALES, WE HAVE TO PROTECT

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.500
 THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT
 AS A WHOLE.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.600
 - BE SURE TO WATCH OUR
 SHOW ON OIL SPILLS.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.730
 WE'RE GONNA TRAVEL TO THE
 MISSISSIPPI RIVER, WHICH IS

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.560
 THE LARGEST DRAIN IN OUR
 COUNTRY, AND SEE WHAT IT TAKES

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.580
 TO CLEAN UP AN OIL SPILL
 BEFORE IT GETS TO THE OCEAN.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.760
YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT WHAT
 CHEERLEADER POM-PONS AND OIL
 SPILLS HAVE IN COMMON.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.620
 STAY WITH US.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.540
 IT'S DIRTY WORK, BUT IT'S
 GONNA BE AN INTERESTING SHOW.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:40.980
