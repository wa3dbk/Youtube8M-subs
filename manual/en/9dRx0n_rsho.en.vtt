00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:12.859
Samsung Omnia M

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:14.900
Expected soon.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.720
We haven't seen one of Samsung's Windows-based
Omnia handsets for a while, but finally we

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.660
have a new addition, the Samsung Omnia M.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.859
The "M" in Samsung's "SRWMY" naming convention
means that it sits near the bottom of the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.210
range, although with its large 4.0" display
it certainly looks like quite a decent handset.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.300
Dig under the surface and you can see where
Samsung have made compromises to keep the

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.540
overall price down.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.570
The display is a 480 x 800 pixel Super AMOLED
panel.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.920
On the back is a fairly standard 5 megapixel
camera with autofocus and LED flash, with

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.339
a VGA resolution video calling camera on the
front as well.

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:04.410
As with most other smartphones these days,
the Samsung Omnia M comes with GPS, WiFi and

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.179
3.5G support and Bluetooth.

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:13.720
It also supports USB connectivity, has an
FM radio and a media player.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.820
The operating system is Windows 7.5 "Mango"
which is refreshingly different from Android

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.300
and Apple's iOS offering, although it is not
to everyone's taste.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.050
Samsung have added their own social networking
and media enhancements too.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:35.690
Inside is a 1GHz CPU with 384Mb of RAM which
frankly isn't a lot.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.959
Internal flash memory is 4 or 8GB, again this
is not a lot and it isn't expandable, although

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:47.879
Microsoft do offer 25GB of free online storage
with SkyDrive.

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:52.340
The relatively big display makes the Samsung
Omnia M a good choice for multimedia playback

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.340
on a budget, but the lack of internal memory
is a bit off-putting.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.320
Really it boils down to how much the Omnia
M will cost, and at the moment we simply don't

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.479
know that.. nor do we known when it might
be availalble.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.720
But if you're looking for something a little
different from a less expensive smartphone

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:15.690
then the Omnia M might be worth keeping an
eye open for.
