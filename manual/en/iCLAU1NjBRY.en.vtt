00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.560
&gt;&gt;THOMAS: Where am I?
Look at all the buildings! And cars!

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.440
I must have made it to the big city!

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.079
Ola!

[PEEP PEEP]

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.240
I wonder if that's Cranky's cousin?

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.160
Coming through!

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.079
[Toot toot!]

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.760
Why hello Ma'am.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.800
King-Zilla! Better keep moving.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.680
Uh oh, I'm down to my last lump of coal.
If only there was a fuel depot!

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.650
There! That looks like just the place.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.040
Phew, just about made it.
Twenty shovels of your finest coal please!

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.140
Or oodles of noodles? Well it might
get me moving. Let's give it a go.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.030
Hmmmph.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.540
Pizza? If you say so.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.780
Mamma mia!

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.860
What is that? A vegetable? It looks
kinda puny, but sure, give it a

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.229
try.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.660
Hot, hot, HOT!

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.100
Me estas tomando el pelo!

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.880
Flaming Funnels

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:39.800
I think it might be time to go
home. So long Big City!

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.080
Home at last. Wait until Percy
hears about this!
