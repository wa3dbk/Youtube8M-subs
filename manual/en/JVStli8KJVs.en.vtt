All right, hi guys! So if you have ever
had an issue with straightening your

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.589
hair and you're trying to get away from
heat, I have a solution that has worked

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.030
out for me. I only saw one video on how
to do this. I tried it out myself about

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.570
two weeks ago and it worked really well
and I actually just did it today -- so you

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.690
can see my hair is like pretty much
straight. And I will walk you through

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.010
steps on how I got my hair straightened
and I had naturally 2B wavy hair, so

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.260
it's wavy so it's not curly and it's not
straight so for those who have 3B or

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.030
4 -- 3/4 hair texture, I will
be interesting if this actually works

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.000
for you, so please if you want to try it
out and leave a comment below, I really

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.629
would like to see if it works for
different people with actual curly hair

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.020
since mine is kind of that in between -- but otherwise, stay tuned!

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.859
For this tutorial, you're going to need: a
bottle of water, leave-in conditioner, a

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:10.490
detangling brush, a detangling comb, a
wig cap preferably, and lots of bobby

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.289
pins depending on how much hair you have.
I already conditioned my hair and used a

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.070
wide-toothed comb to detangle. Using a wide-tooth or detangling brush is up to you

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.670
but I use both because it works best for
me. Part your hair down the middle and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.409
section off one side with a hair tie or
bobby pin; and you're going to use your

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.250
spritz bottle to keep your hair damp, not
dry or drenched.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.790
Now, you're going to section off this
side twice more and pin back the

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.300
sections you're not using. For the strip
of hair that's left, you're going to

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.710
brush it as straight as possible and
begin wrapping it around your head.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.520
Bobby pin as you go and remember to keep it as
straight as possible. Depending on how

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.979
much hair you have, you may need more
bobby pins. -- And it should end up looking

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.390
like this. Repeat the same step with the
rest of the sections of hair by brushing

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.869
it as straight as possible and pinning
your hair in the wrapping style around

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.130
your head. It's perfectly okay to overlap
your hair and you should start to see

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.782
your wrap forming.

00:02:14.782 --> 00:02:23.620
Now for the other side
you're going to repeat the same steps

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.070
and by this point you may need to spritz
your hair with water. Pin away any

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.239
sections you're not using and brush your
desired strip and pin it in the wrapping

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.230
style by laying it around your head and
over pre-pinned sections. This will get

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.860
easier with practice; it's only my second
time doing it. As long as you're trying

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.920
to get your hair as straight as possible,
and you've pinned it enough that your

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.280
strip of hair will not be able to fluff,
the next step will take care of the rest,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.090
so don't worry about that.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.540
Now you're all done! Your wrap may not
look perfect. Pinning wet hair with a

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.020
million bobby pins hidden underneath
won't give the best result, but this is

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.130
the gist! Grab your wig cap -- excuse the
dog hair on mine and place it from back

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.950
to the front of your head.
Wig caps are perfect because they're

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.010
tight enough to lay your hair down and
keep everything in place. If you're doing

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.190
this at night continue your regular
bedtime routine with placing a silk wrap

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.790
as added protection or you can put a
beanie on if you're going out to run the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.180
errands. Depending on your hair drying
can take anywhere to four to seven hours.

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.120
Finally it's time to see your newly
straighten hair! Unpin every strand and

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.480
gently brush your hair in the way you
pinned it up to avoid any tangling. I

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.470
absolutely love this method because of
course I don't have to use any heat. This

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.070
method also allows my hair to maintain
its body without being suppressed from

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.180
using a flatiron. If you're not okay with
having as much body pinning your hair as

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.200
perfect as possible, when you're wrapping
your hair may be essential for you. Heat

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.890
will be optional at this point depending
on how long you let your hair dry and if

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.790
you're satisfied with the final look. I
love to cut my hair natural oils but

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.540
otherwise here is my finished look.
Hope you enjoyed my first tutorial! Don't

if it worked out for you!
