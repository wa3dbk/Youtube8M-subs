00:00:00.491 --> 00:00:01.721
- Yo, yo, yo, what's up guys?

00:00:01.721 --> 00:00:02.780
Little Apple back in the house,

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.378
and we're going to play Inchy!

00:00:04.378 --> 00:00:06.083
- You're playing a game that's
named after how tall you are?

00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:07.027
- Yeah!

00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:07.860
(laughter)

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.158
- Yeah, nobody invited you Orange.

00:00:09.158 --> 00:00:10.276
I'm playing a video game.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.379
- I can see that.

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:12.240
- It's about..

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.073
- I can see that. A sexy surprise.

00:00:13.073 --> 00:00:15.862
- Why do I want a
caterpillar sexy surprise?

00:00:15.862 --> 00:00:19.063
- I'm trying to give you a sexy surprise.

00:00:19.063 --> 00:00:20.628
- Don't try to give me a sexy surprise.

00:00:20.628 --> 00:00:23.100
I don't want a sexy surprise!

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.100
(maniacal laughter)

00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:27.901
- C'mon!

00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:28.868
- Oh hey, you got one!

00:00:28.868 --> 00:00:30.009
- Yay!

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.143
- You're terrible at this game.

00:00:31.143 --> 00:00:32.102
- What's going on?

00:00:32.102 --> 00:00:34.057
- Oh, that's not a
sexy...there's a sexy surprise!

00:00:34.057 --> 00:00:34.930
(laughter)

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.045
- Is that a flame throwing Mariachi band?

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:36.970
What's going on?

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.927
Oh yeah, oh hey

00:00:37.927 --> 00:00:41.198
(In unison) Ooooo, hey lady.

00:00:41.198 --> 00:00:42.158
(laughter)

00:00:42.158 --> 00:00:43.474
- She was the sexy surprise.

00:00:43.474 --> 00:00:44.973
(laughter)

00:00:44.973 --> 00:00:45.902
- Oh darn it.

00:00:45.902 --> 00:00:47.086
- Well, that's not a sexy surprise.

00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:48.071
- No it's not.

00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:48.955
I gotta get to nine.

00:00:48.955 --> 00:00:50.751
I gotta get to nine.

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:51.609
- Guys, who wants a sexy surprise?

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:52.442
- Yeah.

00:00:52.442 --> 00:00:53.275
- Oh yeah.

00:00:53.275 --> 00:00:54.108
- Look at you go!

00:00:54.108 --> 00:00:54.941
- Oooh!

00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:55.874
- How'd you grab that one branch?

00:00:55.874 --> 00:00:57.142
That was crazy.

00:00:57.142 --> 00:00:58.142
- Hey lady!

00:00:58.142 --> 00:00:58.975
(laughter)

00:00:58.975 --> 00:00:59.808
- Oh man, okay.

00:00:59.808 --> 00:01:00.641
Score.

00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:01.474
I gotta get to nine.

00:01:01.474 --> 00:01:02.307
- Yeah, you gotta do it.

00:01:02.307 --> 00:01:03.140
- To get a sexy surprise.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.974
This is a really difficult level actually.

00:01:03.974 --> 00:01:04.856
- Level?

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:05.854
You mean the whole game?

00:01:05.854 --> 00:01:06.687
- Yeah I mean the game.

00:01:06.687 --> 00:01:07.745
- You gotta get!

00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:09.141
- Yeah, that was an ad.

00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:10.602
This whole game is just filled with ads.

00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:11.673
- Every game is.

00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:12.786
- Aaaaahhh!

00:01:12.786 --> 00:01:13.619
I missed the branch.

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.470
- You missed it again.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.438
- What?! Oh yeah, that's
probably an ad too.

00:01:16.438 --> 00:01:18.388
- So, how come you're
still sticking around?

00:01:18.388 --> 00:01:19.787
- Well, what are you talking about?

00:01:19.787 --> 00:01:21.416
- Well, I'm just, I'm
playing a video game.

00:01:21.416 --> 00:01:23.029
You don't need to stick around.

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:24.636
- Oh, I think I do.

00:01:24.636 --> 00:01:25.469
I think I do.

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:26.697
Here's the problem.

00:01:26.697 --> 00:01:27.556
The problem is the sexy surprise.

00:01:27.556 --> 00:01:28.881
If it's gonna happen, I gotta see it!

00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:29.925
I gotta see what it is!

00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:31.029
- Okay, I understand.

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.862
I totally understand.

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:34.440
I mean, when it comes to sexy
surprises, I mean I guess, I..

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.028
- Oooooo.

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:37.140
- Hellooo.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.190
(laughter)

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.380
- It's just that this is a
really, really tough game.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.127
- I'm having a hard time,

00:01:44.127 --> 00:01:46.618
even getting past, a couple branches.

00:01:46.618 --> 00:01:47.799
- It's because...

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:48.632
- Just a little, right?

00:01:48.632 --> 00:01:51.434
- Ah! See. I hate it
when they're staggered.

00:01:51.434 --> 00:01:53.385
And you have different amounts
far away from each other.

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:55.220
Because you kinda get going in a groove,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.530
and you're like, okay, so I only...

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.093
Ah!

00:01:58.093 --> 00:01:59.118
See like that.

00:01:59.118 --> 00:01:59.952
- Hey lady!

00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:01.229
- See, sometimes they're close
and sometimes they're far,

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.297
and you're not like, ready for it.

00:02:02.297 --> 00:02:03.334
And it's a really tough game!

00:02:03.334 --> 00:02:04.864
- I would definitely...oh yeah!

00:02:04.864 --> 00:02:05.941
- Oh!

00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:06.848
- How am I supposed to get those guys?!

00:02:06.848 --> 00:02:07.710
- I have no idea.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.751
- They're so tiny.

00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:09.640
- I know. Just like you.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.626
- Hey! C'mon now, c'mon now.

00:02:10.626 --> 00:02:11.968
(laughter)

00:02:11.968 --> 00:02:12.944
- C'mon downtown, James Brown.

00:02:12.944 --> 00:02:13.777
Don't do that.

00:02:13.777 --> 00:02:14.701
(laughter)

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:15.539
- What?!

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:16.372
You're weird.

00:02:16.372 --> 00:02:18.326
- Okay, we're going to string
together some good stuff here.

00:02:18.326 --> 00:02:19.623
Oh yeah, I'm up to five!

00:02:19.623 --> 00:02:20.541
Oh, oh!

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:21.374
See, it's the tiny ones!

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:22.207
It's the tiny ones!

00:02:22.207 --> 00:02:23.214
- It's always the tiny ones.

00:02:23.214 --> 00:02:24.490
- It's the tiny ones.
You gotta, you gotta...

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.278
you gotta look out for it.

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:27.111
- Oh yeah, case in point.

00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:27.944
Holy moly!

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:29.923
How are you doing this?!

00:02:29.923 --> 00:02:31.847
This is amazing!

00:02:31.847 --> 00:02:32.741
You got up to nine!

00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:33.737
That's the sexy surprise!

00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:34.893
- Is she the sexy surprise?

00:02:34.893 --> 00:02:35.992
- What is it?!

00:02:35.992 --> 00:02:36.910
Is it her?!

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.297
- I don't know!

00:02:38.297 --> 00:02:39.867
- What's a sexy inchworm?

00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:40.883
- Uh oh.

00:02:40.883 --> 00:02:41.901
Do we even want to know?

00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:42.974
- Oh.

00:02:42.974 --> 00:02:43.807
- Is that it?

00:02:43.807 --> 00:02:44.640
- It's just a different color.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.473
- Yeah.

00:02:45.473 --> 00:02:46.306
- Oh.

00:02:46.306 --> 00:02:47.139
I'm not really cool with that.

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:48.048
- That's it?

00:02:48.048 --> 00:02:50.611
- I mean, it's not really
a sexy surprise, right?

00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:51.444
- No.

00:02:51.444 --> 00:02:52.277
Not at all.

00:02:52.277 --> 00:02:54.035
That is definitely not a sexy surprise.

00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:56.118
- I'm...I feel weird now.

00:02:57.254 --> 00:02:58.144
- Me too.

00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:01.337
- I mean, when they said it was
going to be a sexy surprise,

00:03:01.337 --> 00:03:02.282
- Yeah?

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.090
- I expected something
a little bit different..

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.923
- Me too

00:03:04.923 --> 00:03:06.643
- Than just, the
inchworm's color changing.

00:03:06.643 --> 00:03:07.643
- Yeah

00:03:07.643 --> 00:03:08.592
- I'm just throwing it out there.

00:03:08.592 --> 00:03:09.744
Like, I'm just going to let

00:03:09.744 --> 00:03:10.807
your mind wander for a little while.

00:03:10.807 --> 00:03:11.880
- It's wandering.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.852
- About the different
kind of sexy surprises

00:03:13.852 --> 00:03:15.071
we might have gotten to see,

00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:16.016
- I know.

00:03:16.016 --> 00:03:18.069
- Annnnd, this being what it was.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.031
- We didn't get anything!

00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:21.285
I want my money back!

00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:22.960
- Well, that's the thing,
it was a free game.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.642
It didn't actually cost anything.

00:03:24.642 --> 00:03:27.308
- Yeah, but I want my, my time back.

00:03:27.308 --> 00:03:29.784
- Well, unfortunately, we, I...

00:03:29.784 --> 00:03:31.917
You'd have to have like a
time machine, or something,

00:03:31.917 --> 00:03:32.750
to be able to do that.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.598
- Oh, you mean like, this one?!

00:03:34.598 --> 00:03:36.403
(machine revving up)

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:37.690
- What the, what the nuggets?!

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.674
Where did you get that?!

00:03:38.674 --> 00:03:39.963
Is that a time machine?!

00:03:39.963 --> 00:03:40.942
- Yeah! It's a time machine.

00:03:40.942 --> 00:03:41.982
I made it.

00:03:41.982 --> 00:03:43.051
- You made a time machine?

00:03:43.051 --> 00:03:44.500
- Uh, doy! It's sitting
right in front of you.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.552
- You keep..now you're
distracting me, and I can't...

00:03:45.552 --> 00:03:47.963
I can't get anywhere on this game anymore,

00:03:47.963 --> 00:03:49.124
because you're distracting me with..

00:03:49.124 --> 00:03:50.115
- Why? What did I do?

00:03:50.115 --> 00:03:51.119
- It's the time machine!

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:52.443
What...where...I don't even understand!

00:03:52.443 --> 00:03:55.223
- Well, I need to get it! I
need to get back my wasted time,

00:03:55.223 --> 00:03:57.619
that I spent waiting
for the sexy surprise.

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:59.082
- Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

00:03:59.082 --> 00:04:00.085
- There was no sexy surprise.

00:04:00.085 --> 00:04:00.918
So now I'm going to go back...

00:04:00.918 --> 00:04:01.751
- I'm doing it!

00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:02.584
- Oh my gosh!

00:04:02.584 --> 00:04:03.417
- Ahhhhh!

00:04:03.417 --> 00:04:04.398
I thought you were maybe going to

00:04:04.398 --> 00:04:05.544
maybe get to the next level...

00:04:05.544 --> 00:04:06.377
- What were you saying now?

00:04:06.377 --> 00:04:07.965
- I gotta go back in time,
so that I never have to

00:04:07.965 --> 00:04:08.939
to have wasted my time here, okay?

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.722
- Okay. Do whatever you want.

00:04:10.722 --> 00:04:11.601
- I will!

00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:12.485
Hashtag want.

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:13.399
(laughter)

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:14.428
- See what I did there?

00:04:14.428 --> 00:04:15.337
- I saw what you did.

00:04:15.337 --> 00:04:16.663
- It says down at the bottom...

00:04:16.663 --> 00:04:17.519
- I know!

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.352
It says the McDonald's sign, it says that.

00:04:18.352 --> 00:04:19.658
- Okay! I'm going to
hop in the time machine,

00:04:19.658 --> 00:04:20.737
annnnnddd later!

00:04:20.737 --> 00:04:22.708
(machine whirling)

00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:24.328
- Whoooaaaaaaa!

00:04:24.328 --> 00:04:25.518
Are you kidding me?!

00:04:25.518 --> 00:04:27.508
He actually took off!

00:04:27.508 --> 00:04:29.037
That was, that was amazing.

00:04:29.037 --> 00:04:29.983
He just disappeared.

00:04:29.983 --> 00:04:30.942
Right in front of my eyes.

00:04:30.942 --> 00:04:32.490
Although, I'm a little distracted because

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.624
I'm playing Inchy now.

00:04:33.624 --> 00:04:35.550
- So, what's going on Little A?!

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.633
- Um....what do you mean?

00:04:38.654 --> 00:04:40.247
- You playing some video games over here?

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:42.847
Looks like you're having some
fu....what game is this?!

00:04:42.847 --> 00:04:43.783
- It's...it's Inchy.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:44.616
- Oh yeah?

00:04:44.616 --> 00:04:46.120
Oh yeah, so they finally made
a game about how tall you are?

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.877
(maniacal laughter)

00:04:47.877 --> 00:04:50.994
- What the...what...you
already said that joke!

00:04:50.994 --> 00:04:54.404
You watched me play this game,
like just, five minutes ago.

00:04:54.404 --> 00:04:57.405
- Little Apple, have you been
eating crazy pills again?

00:04:57.405 --> 00:04:58.238
(laughter)

00:04:58.238 --> 00:05:00.458
- No, I haven't been....you
hopped in a time machine,

00:05:00.458 --> 00:05:01.550
you don't...

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.383
- I did?

00:05:02.383 --> 00:05:04.037
- So, okay, so you went back in time...

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:05.214
- I did?

00:05:05.214 --> 00:05:07.326
- And didn't come and talk to me earlier,

00:05:07.326 --> 00:05:09.896
so now you don't remember...but
why do I remember?

00:05:09.896 --> 00:05:11.810
I'm so confused.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.506
- Are you sure you're
not crazy, Little Apple?

00:05:13.506 --> 00:05:15.333
- I, I, I think so....

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:18.849
- I'm 95% sure I'm not crazy.

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:19.682
- I don't know,

00:05:19.682 --> 00:05:21.451
I think it's time for you
to do the crazy pants dance

00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:22.800
because you sound crazy.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.725
- That's not a thing.

00:05:23.725 --> 00:05:25.125
- Crazy pants dance! Totally a thing.

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:25.958
- It's not a thing!

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:26.791
- It's a thing!

00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:27.624
- It's not a thing.

00:05:27.624 --> 00:05:28.457
- It's totally a thing.

00:05:28.457 --> 00:05:29.290
- It's a thing!

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.123
- C'mon, do it!

00:05:30.123 --> 00:05:30.956
(both laughing maniacally)

00:05:30.956 --> 00:05:32.986
- I'm very confused, and I'm
actually not having any fun

00:05:32.986 --> 00:05:33.889
playing this game.

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.317
- Well, that's okay, because guess what?

00:05:35.317 --> 00:05:36.150
- What?

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.313
- I've got a time machine!

00:05:37.313 --> 00:05:38.281
(machine whirring up)

00:05:38.281 --> 00:05:39.591
- What, what? Okay, see!
I was just talking about

00:05:39.591 --> 00:05:40.487
the time machine.

00:05:40.487 --> 00:05:41.882
You came in here, and now you're...

00:05:41.882 --> 00:05:42.991
Oh my gosh!

00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:43.905
- What?

00:05:43.905 --> 00:05:44.738
- Ahhhh!

00:05:44.738 --> 00:05:45.733
- I didn't visit you earlier.

00:05:45.733 --> 00:05:47.894
I was just showing you the
time machine right now.

00:05:47.894 --> 00:05:48.775
- No!

00:05:48.775 --> 00:05:50.947
Okay, well..well, well you have it here.

00:05:50.947 --> 00:05:52.673
Let's go in the time
machine so I can go back

00:05:52.673 --> 00:05:53.683
and never have played this game again.

00:05:53.683 --> 00:05:54.811
- Yay! Let's go.

00:05:54.811 --> 00:05:55.740
- Okay!

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.207
- Okay! On the count of three...

00:05:57.207 --> 00:05:59.840
(together) - One, two, three!

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.183
(machines whirs)

00:06:02.183 --> 00:06:05.071
(machine blasts off)

00:06:05.071 --> 00:06:05.930
- It's not my fault,

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.909
that I've got a complex
about people getting killed.

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.969
I live in, uh, ahhh!

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:11.477
Dah!

00:06:11.477 --> 00:06:13.059
I live in a kitchen.

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:14.814
Where this happens constantly.

00:06:14.814 --> 00:06:18.586
You don't even know, how
many times I've met somebody,

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:19.669
and too many.
