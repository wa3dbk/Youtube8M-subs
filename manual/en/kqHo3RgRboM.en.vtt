 "The 40 targets" Tactical Exercise of Take Out 40 Targets Dispersion and Grouping Tactical Saque Exercise 40 Objective: Dispersion and Grouping. 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.419
 Paula, let's do a precision exercise 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.200
 for the serve and this is also going to 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.780
 serve to check if you have improved 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.838
 your serve, I've seen you now play a 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.890
 little bit and I think you do not throw the ball 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.960
 like last year, and the elevas looks 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.649
 a much more stable serve and I'm 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.410
 sure it has given you more 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.868
 regularity in the serve, because last year 

00:00:45.408 --> 00:00:49.609
 I remember that you threw the ball 

00:00:47.868 --> 00:00:52.368
 and some other things but above all it was 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:55.129
 This is throwing the ball. I want to 

00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:58.359
 make 40 serves so you know this 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.120
 many players do it, Nadal, 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:04.329
 Moya already did it in his day, that is to say it is 

00:01:01.118 --> 00:01:06.310
 an exercise of precision and dispersion you 

00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:09.718
 You are going to take 10 serves at each corner, you see 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.719
 that there are some targets there 

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:18.439
 to those targets you will take 10 out, 10 to T and 10 to T 

00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:21.169
 and 10 out, for 

00:01:18.438 --> 00:01:22.428
 example a cut-off serve is logical 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.100
 or whatever you want, I want you 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.720
 there's precision, let's measure the 

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:30.019
 dispersion, which means, that every time 

00:01:26.718 --> 00:01:33.608
 let the ball bounce we will place a ball 

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:36.409
 instead as a brand to then see the 10 balls 

00:01:33.608 --> 00:01:38.568
 the dispersion that you've had 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.759
 have you understood the exercise? 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:43.778
 then when you want, it's worth 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.780
 Paula you can start now 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.269
 Quick 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.899
 Quick 

00:02:00.718 --> 00:02:05.699
 this exercise that is from address 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.950
 has that detail and is that at the end of 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.218
 exercise the player or the player 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:15.240
 this case paula can see where he has 

00:02:11.218 --> 00:02:19.788
 that improve your projection 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.790
 that is, there is a large dispersion 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.449
 is better that, is already approaching 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.330
 is important in these exercises the 

00:02:36.658 --> 00:02:41.128
 accompaniment of the blow, we must continue 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.870
 the trajectory of the ball with the 

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:44.870
 racket to direct the ball 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.799
 There has been no accompaniment. Paula see please 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:20.100
 Paula hits the ball and just paste 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:21.329
 you think you're finished, but you do not 

00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:22.378
 it is very important to follow the 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.380
 trajectory, follow the path 

00:03:22.378 --> 00:03:27.298
 means that the arm and the racket 

00:03:25.378 --> 00:03:29.548
 continue to follow the ball 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.990
 to take it to the site, you have to take it 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.490
 to the site, the only way to take it 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.950
 to the site is to accompany the ball very well 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.480
 you have to follow the ball 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.849
 You can follow her with her arm and also with 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:40.590
 the body, you can keep walking if 

00:03:38.848 --> 00:03:41.038
 do you want towards the direction that you 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.069
 want 

00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:46.108
 The fact is that your whole body projects towards 

00:03:44.068 --> 00:03:48.899
 that address because because the 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.860
 dispersion is very large 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.200
 look here 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.830
 the distances are great, you're 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:59.049
 within normal 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.000
 the areas are pretty good, but 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.069
 You should gather a little, to see if in 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.318
 This side you can achieve, it's worth 

00:04:05.068 --> 00:04:10.259
 that is now going better because you're 

00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:12.298
 following the trajectory of the ball and 

00:04:10.258 --> 00:04:14.108
 that makes the ball get closer to 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.430
 the Diana 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.430
 well fine, that's fine 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:26.959
 that is, you can still continue with the body a 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:30.817
 little bit behind the ball 

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:30.817
 take a step forward if you want 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.389
 that's 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.949
 four targets 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.949
 Now it's worth the other side, come 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:52.199
 very good targets and they are three 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.199
 5 more 3 8 take 8 come
