00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.679
Earlier this Spring actor Omar Epps showed
up on the View talk show to promote some new

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.419
project he was working on, doesn't matter
because he was wearing a skirt! Everybody

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.399
was like what?

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.179
If you're looking for a more in-depth history
on why men wear pants, I suggest you watch

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.990
my video called 'Why Men Wear Pants'. In a
nutshell the reason why pants as opposed to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.050
pantaloons, breeches, hosiery and the like
became European men's clothing du jour has

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.050
a lot to do with the French Revolution. During
this time of massive social and governmental

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.050
upheaval from 1787-1799, those who were loyal
to the new government, the sans-culottes adopted

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:59.269
a uniform almost of floor length pants in
a way to visually distance themselves from

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:05.300
the much-loathed aristocracy and royalty.
Floor length pants then proliferated out to

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.990
the rest of the European continent and hopped
the pond to the United States. And then in

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.270
the 18th century with the Industrial Revolution
pants transitioned from being a political

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.570
or fashion statement to being a utilitarian
tool of the working man who needs that full

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.009
leg protection on the factory floor. Even
though European and American men have been

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.700
wearing almost exclusively pants since the
early 1800s, this is more of a western fashion

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.500
phenomenon. Globally the idea of men wearing
skirts or skirt-like garments is not all that

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.450
revolutionary at least as you would think
it might be judging by the internet's reaction

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.670
to Omar Epps wearing a skirt over a pair of
pants on the View. For instance there's probably

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.020
the best known male skirt out there, the Scottish
kilt. Which some Irish men wear as well apparently.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.520
In Fiji both men and women wear skirt-like
garments called sulus. The men's version is

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.740
called a sulu vah tanga. In nearby Hawaii
aloha means hello and good-bye and kikepa

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.720
could be a man or a woman's sarong-like garment.
Sort of. Tahitian men may wear pareos while

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.410
Indonesian men might wear sarongs. The coolest
male skirt name definitely goes to Samoa,

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.610
aka the home of the lava-lava. I'd probably
wear skirts more often if they were called

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.110
lava-lavas. Over in India the men's traditional
skirt-like garment might be known as a dhoti,

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.530
a pancha, a mardani or a veshti. Then if we
hop down south to sub-saharan Africa, sarong-like

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.090
garments known by various names such as Kanga
are common in the male wardrobe. One point

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.840
that Omar Epps made very well on Instagram.
In addition to these ethnic and cultural groups

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.390
of men who traditional wear skirt-like garments,
we must include two honorable mentions. Cassock

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.400
wearing Catholic clergy, try to say that ten
times fast. Who can forget Kanye West and

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.370
his leather kilt on his 2011 Watch the Throne
tour. Why is it today in an era where it is

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.120
perfectly acceptable for instance for women
to wear pants is it not acceptable for men

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.200
to wear skirts. Sociologists posit that in
western fashion skirts became so completely

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.190
coded as feminine that even today to wear
skirt is to challenge one's masculine identity.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.740
Judging by how we collectively react to someone
like Omar Epps or Kanye West wearing a skirt,

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.640
that is still a major cultural taboo for us.
Pretty backward. If I can wear pants, then

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.300
guys should be able to wear skirts. Right?
Let me know what you think in the comments
