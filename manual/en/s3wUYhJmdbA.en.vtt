Hey, I'm Dr. Josh Axe and welcome to Transformation
TV.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.070
This week I'm going to be talking about artificial
sweeteners which are some of the most deadly

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.210
compounds on the planet.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.390
You and your family want to stay completely
away from artificial sweeteners.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.720
Now, artificial sweeteners, most of the time
they came about accidentally, not even on

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.920
purpose, but people found they had a sweet
texture and taste to them and actually the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.460
number one used sweetener of the past two
decades has been artificial sweetener known

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.230
as aspartame.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.130
Aspartame first started being used in diet
coke and actually they saw, in 1981, when

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.280
Diet Coke was introduced on the market, brain
tumors increased with it exponentially and

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.550
so they rose in correlation with it and that
was just one big side effect.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.820
Now, another study down at the University
of Texas found that aspartame caused kidney

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.900
damage and weight gain.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.729
Lots of you think, "Well, I'm drinking a Diet
Coke or a diet soda.

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.130
Shouldn't that cause my weight to decrease?"

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.039
Actually, at the University of Texas they
found for every diet soda you drink, your

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:20.979
chance of weight gain goes up by 41%, and
the reason is that these are toxic chemicals.

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.299
Toxins get stored in your fat cells if you're
drinking lots of diet soda.

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.899
It's going to be stored in your cells and
your body cannot burn fat and lose weight.

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.490
So if you're trying to lose weight, kick the
diet soda immediately.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.670
One of the most dangerous things and facts
to know about aspartame is what it breaks

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.840
down into.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.399
Actually, aspartame breaks down in your body
into wood alcohol, formaldehyde, and ethanol

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.710
which are toxic chemicals and they're known
to be carcinogenic.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.170
They actually cause cancer, and that's why
you want to stay away from these.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.899
There's a great documentary out there called
"Sweet Misery."

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.840
If you want to get a whole DVD series on this,
again you are going to want to go watch the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.810
DVD, "Sweet Misery."

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.539
Another artificial sweetener that is shockingly
dangerous is Sucralose, and it's found in

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.830
a product called Splenda.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.080
A lot of people think, "Well, Splenda, I thought
that was a health food or I thought it came

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.430
from sugar."

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.780
Splenda started off coming from sugar, but
they add a chlorine ion, a chlorine molecule

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.401
onto the sugar and so basically what happens,
if you're drinking Splenda or Sucralose, it's

00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:30.330
breaking down in your body as chlorine.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.720
I actually recently had a patient come into
my clinic and they told me about a friend

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.780
of theirs who had just been hospitalized for
three days for chlorine poisoning, and the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.510
doctors told them it was from her using too
much Splenda.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.730
She was actually using cups of Splenda in
her baking and sweetening and actually found

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.340
that it caused chlorine poisoning in her body.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.270
So if you are doing Splenda, again, plan on
or just know that it's chlorine.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.120
It's like drinking chlorinated water.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.350
It causes cancer.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.760
You want to stay completely away from these
artificial sweeteners.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.130
Now, places you're going to want to look for
these artificial sweeteners and the names

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.450
you're going to be looking for, the top two
names to look for are Sucralose and aspartame.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.820
Now, if you ever use protein powders, you've
got to look in your protein powders for these.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.340
Number one, if you're drinking a diet soda,
99% of the time it's going to have Sucralose

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.820
or Splenda in it.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.831
Even things like Crystal Light and a lot of
the different sweeteners out there, you're

00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:32.320
going to find they have these artificial sweeteners
in them.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.290
You got to read your labels.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.720
You do not want to bring in this stuff in.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.840
Honestly, I'd rather someone drink regular
sugar than do artificial sweeteners because

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.290
they're neurotoxins, they're toxic chemicals.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.320
Here's what you want to do instead.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.290
You want to switch over to an all-natural
sweetener, something like stevia.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.540
Now, this is personally what I use, but stevia
is an all-natural sweetener that comes from

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.350
the herb of a flower and it's no calories,
and so it's not going to cause the added weight

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.350
gain.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.260
So add a little bit of stevia into things
the like berry smoothies that I do.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.080
If I want to sweeten something up a little
bit, again, stevia is a great option, all

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.080
natural.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.380
Some other things you can do, you got to be
careful of the sugar content, but raw honey,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.569
Grade B maple syrup and things like coconut
nectar are other good options and fruit, but

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:25.939
that's where I'd go ahead and stick with when
you're trying to sweeten things up.

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.440
Again, if you want to do no-sugar, though,
stevia is the way to go, and there's a lot

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.490
of all-natural products coming out that you're
going to find at natural health food stores

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.530
that actually contain stevia.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.030
This is a way you want to go.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.360
So remember, action steps for the week, get
rid of all the artificial sweeteners.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.949
Get rid of the aspartame, get rid of the Sucralose,
switch over to stevia and the all-natural

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:46.949
sweeteners.

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:47.949
It may just save your life and a friend.

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.999
If you like this, think about the people you
know who are at work or at your church or

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:58.749
the places you go to who are addicted to diet
soda and tell them about this.

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:59.749
Spread this message.

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:00.749
You may just save a life.

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.899
I'll see you next week.
