00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:13.533
MAN:
Amaco low fire clay and glazes

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:17.067
are available at
Blick Art Materials.

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:20.033
Amaco's the most popular
clay and glaze on the market.

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:24.167
It has many colours,
textures, and temperatures.

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:29.233
It's non-toxic, lead free,
and gives consistent results.

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:32.767
Amaco low fire clays
bisque at cone 04

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:37.500
and Amaco low fire glazes
fire to cone 05,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500
where the glazes melt
to a glass-like surface

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.033
and are non-porous.

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:44.867
It's popular,
especially in the classroom,

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:47.833
because it requires
less energy and time

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:50.467
and offers brilliant colours.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:51.833
For best results,

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:54.867
use Amaco low fire clay
and glazes together.

00:00:54.867 --> 00:01:00.567
Amaco clay is pugged
and deaired when manufactured.

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:04.067
No wedging is required,
but it is recommended.

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:06.633
There are five low
fire clay bodies.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.100
I have two to show you.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.633
#25 white, this is the wet clay,

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:15.667
this is after
it has been bisqued,

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:21.233
#67 red, wet, and bisqued.

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:23.533
Think of clay as canvas.

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.400
The white clay allows

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.900
the true colour and brilliance
to be shown.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.067
The red clay is used for
richer, darker colours.

00:01:34.067 --> 00:01:38.367
Amaco has 12
low fire glaze varieties,

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:40.467
all with different effects.

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.967
All are non-toxic,
and lead free.

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:45.767
But you should always be sure

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:48.500
to read the directions
on the label.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.467
The most popular
is the LG series: liquid gloss.

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:55.933
They are glossy and translucent,

00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:58.833
and shows the texture
and the clay colour.

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:00.133
It is recommended for its

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:02.667
bright colours
and glossy surfaces.

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:05.933
LM, or low fire satin matte,

00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:08.367
has a matte finish
with bright colours,

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:10.767
and it doesn't
flow over textures.

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:14.367
The appearance hardly changes
over white or red clay.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:18.700
The Artist Choice glazes mimic
high fire reduction glazes

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.667
with distinct
and beautiful effects,

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:24.633
dramatically different
on white and red clay.

00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:27.800
This is glaze
over the white clay,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.767
this is exactly the same glaze
over the dark clay.

00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:37.633
The Amaco Opalescent glazes
are designed for red clay.

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:39.167
They are semi-opaque

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:41.600
with a beautiful
opalescent finish

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.800
that intensifies over red clay.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.300
It's great for special effects.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.967
The Crystaltext glazes

00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:53.300
are opaque with
crystals in the glaze.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.933
The crystals create bursts
of colour when it is fired,

00:02:56.933 --> 00:03:01.333
and this stuff looks good
on any clay body.

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:04.433
All of these low fire
glazes and clays

00:03:04.433 --> 00:03:08.033
are available on
the Blick website.

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:16.600
