JOEL SIEGEL: Alright. So, take a listen and
take a look at what's going on with my feet

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.700
and my hands for this high hat lift on the
downbeat of two. I'm going to be at 80 bpm.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:45.821
Take a listen. Okay? So, you see what's going
there? We have the snare hit on two, and then

00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:50.730
the close on the upbeat of two, and then,
also something of note is the fact that you

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.610
have upbeat of two, downbeat of three with
the kick. So, leaving out both hands, you

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:12.660
have one, two, okay, one, two and three, four,
one, two, and three, four. Okay? So, if this

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.660
isn't coming to you naturally, break that
down in that way, right? The left foot and

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.410
the right foot and also the left foot with
the left hand, okay, like we talked about

00:01:24.410 --> 00:02:09.460
early. Let's go ahead and try it together.
I'll count you off, one, two, ready, play.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.450
Alright, making sense so far? We've got of
interplay between all four limbs now. Okay?

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.100
So, it is not going to be the easiest thing
to get down. Slow down if you need to, practice

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.780
it, and come back to us.
