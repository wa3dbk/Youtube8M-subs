the elements but it happened if you tied

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:29.119
up with it

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:30.859

the palestinians

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:09.649
you want to try to look for students
with a little phone

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:12.469
because this is that was that he wanted
to keep it out of the elements

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.899
but when you say twisting it you get a
different kind of global effect

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:18.389
cause of this error

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.289
football

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:22.269

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.569
and then put the handover

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.779
that's going to keep it that you look at
it for me

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:34.519
and that when you take it down later
you're gonna get that pool bt waiver
