In this helpful Use My DROID
lesson we answer your question:

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.920
How Do I Install the Power 
Control Widget?

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.560
In the previous Use My DROID video 
we talked about what the Power Control Widget

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.039
does.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.619
If you missed it, you may want 
to watch THAT video

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.199
to learn how the widget 
can save you battery life.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.609
Now, Let's talk about how to install the
Power Control widget on your phone.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.390
Find a Blank AREA on your home screen where
you want the widget to live.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.949
Press and hold, also known as a "Long Press",
and up pops the following menu

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.249
Choose the Widget option from the list

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:42.030
and UP comes the "Choose Widget Screen", 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.249
You then scroll around to 
find the widget you want.

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:50.399
In this case we want the Power Control Widget.
Once you locate the power control widget,

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.890
select it by pressing on it.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.049
Then the Widget appears on the home screen

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:58.319
where you long pressed. 
If it doesn't show up here, it might be because

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:00.760
there's not enough free space 
for it to live,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.600
so you have to make sure that there's room
ALL THE WAY ACROSS - this is a very WIDE widget.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.409
If you want to move the widget around on your
home screen, make sure there's room - if there's

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.789
not, it won't stay. We'll have to move this
folder up to free up some space. 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.070
Move the folder or any other item by LONG

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.689
Pressing on them until you feel your Droid
shake a little bit, then drag it to where

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.810
you want and let go. You can even drag it
to other home screens, left or right, if you

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.749
have room elsewhere.

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.499
Here, we've moved the folder to make some

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:35.090
space for this monster sized widget.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.630
Now we can Move the Power Control Widget
Move this one just like you'd move any other

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.109
item on your home screen
long press on it 'til it shakes, 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:46.389
then drag. Remember, this one 
needs a whole row to fit.

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.219
Let's look at how you can remove the widget
from your home screen.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.149
This doesn't really delete it, but simply
takes the view of the tool off of your home

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.399
screen.

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.280
Long Press on the widget, hold 'til it shakes,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.990
then drag it towards the 
application tray

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.950
which you'll now notice 
turns into a trash can

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.909
Once you get right on top of the application

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.030
tray, the item and the
trash can turn RED - they're

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.190
warning you that you're 
about to throw something away.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.830
 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.610
While its still red, 
go ahead and let go,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.310
and the widget tool will be 
removed from your home screen.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.530
But just like other items that you throw away
from your home screen 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.500
it's still part of your phone, 
you're simply removing the "Shortcut" (that's

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.330
a PC term) 
or the "Alias" (that's a Mac Term) off of

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.650
your home screen. 
You can always install the widget again on

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.709
your home screen as long as you have the needed
space available.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.840
Here's the USE MY DROID
Power Tip

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.720
Now that you know how to install the power
control widget on your phone, 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.519
you might want to make room for it on your
MAIN home screen - right up top.

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.200
Remember, you need the whole 
row across to be blank.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.689
The techniques we used to install the power
control widget can be used to install ANY

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.349
widget onto your phone.
