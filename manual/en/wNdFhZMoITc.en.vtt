00:00:03.544 --> 00:00:06.377
(classical music)

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:11.700
- Hey there, I'm Josh Clark,
and this is the Brain Stuff

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.807
where I explain to you a little
bit about diesel submarines.

00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:17.622
Now, I know you're out there
walking around thinking,

00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:20.149
everything's hunky-dory
with our submarine fleet,

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:22.632
if you live in a country that has a Navy,

00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:26.279
but did you know that
there's a war going on

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.162
between what type of submarine is better?

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.671
Yeah, follow me with this.

00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:32.746
Diesel submarines are pretty prevalent

00:00:32.746 --> 00:00:35.881
all across the world,
but here's the spit take,

00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:37.602
they need air to function.

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:40.172
(spits out drink)

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:42.490
So, how do diesel submarines work

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.035
if they need air, but, as is the

00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:47.491
common characteristic of
submarines everywhere,

00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:50.299
they need to stay underwater
for prolonged periods of time.

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:52.280
Here's the answer, and it's so obvious

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.631
you're gonna feel silly
for not thinking of it.

00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:55.629
Batteries.

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:56.974
That's right, diesel submarines

00:00:56.974 --> 00:00:58.609
are pretty much hybrid vehicles.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.409
When they run their diesel engines,

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:01.820
the batteries are charged.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.212
The batteries power electric motors

00:01:04.212 --> 00:01:06.801
that run the propeller and
all that kind of thing.

00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:08.601
Every once in a while when
the batteries get low,

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.681
a diesel submarine has to surface

00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:12.811
so it can run its diesel engines,

00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:15.539
charge its batteries
and then slip back down.

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.139
Either the submarine has
to surface completely,

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:20.411
or they run up a little snorkel

00:01:20.411 --> 00:01:22.379
called a snort.

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:23.420
Snort.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.221
The problem is, if you are on a sub

00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:28.201
and you have to surface
or come close enough

00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:31.154
to run your snort up, that means you are

00:01:31.154 --> 00:01:33.992
at a greater risk of
being captured or sunk.

00:01:33.992 --> 00:01:36.110
Anyone who's ever played
the game Battleship knows

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.730
it's way easier when you can see

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.921
where the submarine is,
you know what I'm saying?

00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:41.139
So to solve this problem,

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:43.658
people came up with the nuclear submarine.

00:01:43.658 --> 00:01:45.420
The nuclear powered submarine

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.941
doesn't rely on oxygen for combustion

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.170
like a diesel engine
does, which means it can

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.652
stay submerged indefinitely, or at least

00:01:52.652 --> 00:01:55.338
until the submarine crew
all loses their minds.

00:01:55.338 --> 00:01:57.220
The problem is, with nuclear subs,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.641
even though they're way
faster than diesel submarines,

00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:01.812
is that they're more expensive.

00:02:01.812 --> 00:02:05.949
You can buy something like
two to four diesel subs

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:08.623
for the price of one nuclear sub,

00:02:08.623 --> 00:02:11.370
and they're also louder.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.887
You have to keep running your
engines in a nuclear sub.

00:02:13.887 --> 00:02:17.007
With a diesel sub, once
the batteries are charged,

00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:19.831
you're just zipping along,
sounding like a Prius,

00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:21.550
(imitates electric motor), you know,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.431
and you can sit silently
with all of your engines off

00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:26.210
on the sea floor and go pretty much

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.650
unnoticed if you want.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.967
You can't do that in a nuclear sub.

00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:32.590
Plus, in a diesel submarine, the crew,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.109
they may have black lung from inhaling

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.060
any of the fumes, but at least they're not

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.248
gonna have a healthy green glow

00:02:38.248 --> 00:02:40.762
like you will probably on a nuclear sub,

00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:41.771
you know what I'm saying?

00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:42.720
So which one's better?

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.804
The nuclear sub or a diesel sub?

00:02:44.804 --> 00:02:47.075
They both have their pros and their cons,

00:02:47.075 --> 00:02:49.137
and really, isn't this the question

00:02:49.137 --> 00:02:50.656
that every human being is faced with

00:02:50.656 --> 00:02:52.567
at some point in their lifetime?

00:02:52.567 --> 00:02:54.374
If you like this video, there's tons more

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:55.446
where this came from.

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:56.686
Why don't you leave us a comment saying,

00:02:56.686 --> 00:02:59.197
"Hey this was awesome,"
or "What about this

00:02:59.197 --> 00:03:00.854
"for a Brain Stuff idea?"

00:03:00.854 --> 00:03:02.358
We love that kind of stuff,

00:03:02.358 --> 00:03:04.580
and while you're at it,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.997
What can it hurt?
