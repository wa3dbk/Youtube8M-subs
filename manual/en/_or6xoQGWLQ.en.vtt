00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:08.290
What’s up gamers?!

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.799
Once again, I’ve had some thoughts I want
to share with the gaming community.

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.929
And they have to do with how the Traveler’s
story seems to parallel Christ’s story.

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:14.929
Whoa!

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:15.929
Isn’t religion a taboo subject?

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.560
Sadly, it’s now come to that.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.369
We can barely say Merry Christmas or Happy
Hanukkah in our schools anymore without CNN

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.009
picking it apart, saying how terribly offensive
it all is.

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.150
But, am I the only one who thinks that people
don’t get offended by someone else talking

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.150
about their religion!?

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.539
I’m Christian, but when my jewish friend
says, “Happy Hanukkah” Am I all like,

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.080
“My goodness, don’t you know I’m christian
and that you're pushing your religion on me,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.400
and it makes me insecure, and now I’m questioning
who I am.”

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.400
Nope!

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.770
I might even reply with a happy hanukkah back,
after all, it’s a cool and interesting holiday

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.770
they’re celebrating.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.480
I think the loudest people on the matter are
just making up a worry that we’re going

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.510
to offend someone by talking about our religion.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.550
But really,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.390
Freedom of religion means you share with me
yours and i’ll share with you mine.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.200
Tolerance means we learn about other religions
and embrace them for believing what they do.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.310
So when I say the Traveler seems to be a Christ
figure, it’s because I’m a proud Christian

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.760
and it’s what I’m familiar with.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.250
If I grew up in another religion I might say
that the Traveler is a Buddha figure, or a

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.250
Krishna figure.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.260
Odysseus, Romulus, Dionysus, Heracles, Glycon,
Zarathustra, Attis, Apollonius, Horus.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.810
All similar figures whose stories are applicable
to the traveler.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.000
How cool is that?!

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.490
So I’m going to unapologetically point out
a few similarities between Christ and the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.610
Traveler in this video, but what I would love
to see everyone post is how the story of the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.470
Traveler holds parallels to your beliefs.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.620
Be proud of what you believe and be comfortable
sharing them here, my facebook page, or the

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.500
Killworthy Gamers bungie group.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.080
Remember to be respectful, and don’t judge
someone elses beliefs.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.370
Links are in the description below.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.590
So, Why would Bungie put religious overtones
in their story?

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.370
Because it’s a tried and true method.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.530
Stories like Narnia, Superman, The Book of
Eli, Twelve Monkeys, Alien 3, The Matrix,

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.080
and Lord of the Rings, proves that the sentiments
found within religious beliefs simply make

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.250
for GREAT stories!

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.380
It’s important to note that there are always
points of departure from the original religious

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.540
inspiration. for instance, in the matrix,
Neo wasn’t an unblemished individual like

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.540
Christ.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.660
The parallel is that he sacrificed himself
to save mankind.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.720
And it made for a great story with substance
and merit.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.760
Let’s go over seven great parallels to Christianity
that we find in Destiny, and speculate on

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.020
some points of departure.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.170
Number 1: Christ came and taught.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.139
He had a ministry where he shared his light
and knowledge with humanity.

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.720
He gave power to his disciples to perform
miracles like He did, and he terraformed the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.720
middle east.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.650
Ok, that last part is not true, but you see
where I’m going with this.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.670
The traveler came and shared its light and
knowledge with humanity.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.290
It gave power to mankind that is wielded by
the guardians.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.920
Number 2: Even though Christ didn’t rally
an army, He still gathered followers who were

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.049
more-like spiritual soldiers, fighting their
own religious oppression.

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.360
The Traveler gathered guardians to be real-life
soldiers to battle darkness.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.659
Number 3: Light and Dark.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.019
A quick search for references to light and
dark in the bible would bring up thousands

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.019
of results.

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.709
The basic imagery of Light against Dark illustrates
well the eternal battle between God and Satan,

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.620
and also the Traveler’s Light against the
armies of the Darkness.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.419
Number 4: Throughout the bible we have prophets,
who act as spokesmen for God, in the same

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:57.650
way the Speaker is for the Traveler.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.849
Number 5, and probably the most obvious: Christ
came and sacrificed himself to save mankind.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.059
In his own words, “Greater love hath no
man than this, that a man lay down hislife

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:09.059
for his friends.”

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:10.249
John 15:13.

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:13.900
That would describe perfectly that act of
sacrifice of the Traveler, as long as its

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.779
intentions are good, which could be a possible
point of departure.

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:21.650
Number 6: When Christ died, he left the Holy
Ghost with mankind to guide men to truth.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.809
The traveler created the Ghosts in its dying
breath, so that a part of it could stay with

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:27.160
us, to guide us.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.279
Number 7: Christians await a second coming
of Christ.

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:33.779
The speaker tells us that we are waiting for
the Traveler to find its voice again.

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:36.840
There are plenty more parallels to Christianity
and I’m sure to many other religions, so

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.159
make sure you post them!

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.530
I want to hear them, and I know the community
does to.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.959
Right now there is a forum dedicated on the
Killworthy Gamers Bungie group just for this

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.099
topic, Destiny - Religious Parallels.

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.199
Again, be respectful and share how your beliefs
parallel the story of Destiny.

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.110
After launch, I’m sure there will be many
more, so remember to come back and report

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.110
your findings!

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.189
Now, I’m sure we’re not going to come
to find that the traveler’s mom was a virgin,

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.219
so we know there are many points of departure,
one of them being: We don’t know the traveler’s

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:02.219
intentions.

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:06.079
pldkn says: “I believe in the good of the
Traveler, right until the moment it awakens.”

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:11.049
So, this guardian could mean a couple different
things, but it gave me the thought, “Assuming

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.280
the Traveler really did sacrifice itself lovingly,
what if the traveler forgets who it is? or

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.790
transformed for the worse in some way.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.780
What if it’s mentally damaged beyond repair.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.370
This god-like being could be a terrifying
force of evil if it decided to turn against

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.370
us.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.430
So, if the traveler never really “sacrificed
itself” and it turns out that it just failed

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.500
to save itself, then the only christian parallels
lie with the Speaker’s interpretations of

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.740
the Traveler’s actions, and the Guardians
are kind of believing in a false prophet.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.590
I’m not going to lie, that could be a pretty
intense story.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.849
Feel free to also point out points of departure
in the Religious Parallels forum.

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.750
Guardians, thank you for your respect and
maturity on this matter.
