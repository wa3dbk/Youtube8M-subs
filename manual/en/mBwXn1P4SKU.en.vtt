Oh yeah, whatever, we ordered

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.270
so the the food runner comes out and it's a
pizza

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.789

kept eating it they come back with the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.469

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.869
about it and not be like--- When they came back with the
pepperoni I'm like I've gone too far I gotta keep

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:16.990
this going as long as possible

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.350
and I was enjoying the food if it taste
like shit I would like whatever

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.320
but it was like God what was like a
tomato and some kind of veggie PS

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.310
pressed on and stuff

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.130
yeah never tried before pretty good
alternative I'd they got so I'm like a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.299
pepperoni pizza

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.840
you at that point cuz you put for
defrauding a minute if it's going to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.729
keep eating it so you could ever have to
wait like it hour-and-a-half

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.100
into the movies forgetting to tell my
peace with everyone else is checked I

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.570
yes n shower feel really bad thing as
p2p got a probably twenty minutes later

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.689
something there still is a long movie so
is a

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.680
play mood ago but I like to think that
they hated me at that point

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.030
and yeah I pretty much told damage food
made mine and they made him wait longer

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.689
for his footwear

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.390
