00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.080
Hello Everyone, Today is July 9,2014

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.380
And we are going to Look at This 12 Cob Cannon Setup

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.840
Originally this was supposed to be a 13 Cob Cannon Setup

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.140
With one cob to assist the lower Half of the Setup

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.560
However, Seeing how easy it was

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.880
I decided to turn it into a 12 Cob Cannon setup while

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.580
limiting myself to using only the cob cannons to the upper half

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.320
This setup will also prove just how powerful the cobless setup is

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.580
The upperhalf of the setup causes the wave to arrive alot  faster

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.080
than what a normal cobless setup would usually handle

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.920
since the cobless setup cannot guarantee to deal enough DPS

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.400
to trigger the next wave of zombies to arrive immediately after the cob shot hits

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.300
then we will be using instants to help

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.960
on predicting the arrival of the next wave

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.160
predicting the arrival of the next wave is very crucial

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.140
in order to maximize the Ice Shroom's freezing effect

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.460
SInce it is possible for the upper half to gather up gargantuars

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.760
( both normal and gigas ) 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.680
in which some are slowed and some are not

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.340
therefore our cob shot interval should always be equal

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.220
to the time at which the gargantuar will take to throw their imps

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.500
In addition slowed gargantuars take twice

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.220
the amount of time to throw their imps

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.860
therefore another cob shot is needed in order

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.980
to handle the imps thrown by slowed gargantuars

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.020
despite the damage dealt by the cob cannons

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.560
the arrival of the next wave may or may not be triggered immediately

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.920
therefore it is necessary to use instants on the bottom half

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.140
to aid on predicting the arrival of the next wave

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.640
normally you should also consider using a few cobs

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.860
cannons to assist the lower half

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.140
but for the sake of this video i had limited myself

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.020
to not using any cob shots to the lower half

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.620
also, 4 empty spaces on the pool can be

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.580
used to store Ice Shrooms and Doom Shrooms

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.120
The cobless formation on the lower half is designed

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.360
to be resistant to jack in the box explosions

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.360
but it is not totally immune

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.040
although it is possible to bring some gloom shrooms

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.720
to be used for repairing

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.160
I find that squash and puff shrooms are much better

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.120
options because they can be used more often

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.760
although three wintermelons are effective

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.280
on keeping most of the zombies slowed

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.340
Ice Shrooms and Doom Shrooms are still necessary

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.740
to keep the whole cobless formation stable

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.060
for the bungees we use a single cob shot aimed at the single gloom shroom

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.435
( unpumpkined in the rightmost of row 5 )  in order to defend 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.200
the laddered plants that are outside the mbrella leaf's range

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.620
The economy for the setup isn't as good as expected

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.400
becase of the constant usage of instants

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.720
and the need to repair pumpkins

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.760
the entire setup works best when you have at least

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.400
one Ice Shroom on the pool that would

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.440
act as a backup jst in case yo missed the timing

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.980
on one of the Ice Shrooms

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.500
for everyone who are asking if i will make any videos about  PVZ2

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.300
I'll soon start uploading videos about PVZ2

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.400
soon as i finalize my method for recording the game

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.180
because my real problem is that

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.940
whenever i try to record using reflector

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.300
it randomly crashes while im in the middle of the game

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.060
and sometimes i just can't pause the game in time

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.000
also i'm trying to decide between recording

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.200
between recording the game with / without the in-game audio

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.620
rest assured i will continue to upload plants vs zombies 1 videos

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.400
just how i always wanted to do it ... a year ago :)

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.240
certain modifications for the setup would be

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.400
to add more gloom shrooms on the pool to aid the lower half o the setup

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.580
although this would reduce the available space for Doom shrooms

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.600
this would also help in giving more DPS

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.060
thus helping in making the arrival

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.820
the arrival of the next wave to be much more predictable

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.320
you may also add one or more twin sunflowers

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.060
if you feel like this setup needs more sun

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.240
overall the entire setup is a bit more difficult

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.980
simply because the arrival of the next wave of zombies

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.700
is harder to predict and there is a very little room for error

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.480

if you also like to test these setups

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.920
i placed a link on the description below

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.860
from every setup i showed on my videos 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.480
this 2014

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.180
The most important is that you have fun

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.920
while playing the game

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.320
Happy Testing Once again

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.500
