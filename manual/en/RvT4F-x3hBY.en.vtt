00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:08.029
Hi everyone, It's me! I got my third reline today.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.980
It definitely fits better, and I'm saying certain sounds better.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.709
It's still a little awkward to say "s"... the S sound...

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.350
But I'm getting better at it...

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.679
and...

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.689
got rid of some of the gumminess 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.260
a little bit of the gumminess anyway..

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.719
It's fitting better...

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:31.459
My mouth is healing a little bit
lopsided though

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:33.970
the right side of my mouth

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.970
is, um, taller than the left side... er, the gums are taller than the left side

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.160
which i think is kind of funny because
I had more teeth on the left side than

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.290
I did on the right side

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.340
I don't know what that's all about

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.410
Sorry, since the reline, I've got that whole 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.920
spit problem again

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.140
making a lot of saliva right now

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.030
it's kinda gross

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.650
Oh well, it is what it is

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.650
I'm gonna 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.470
go home and 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.580
clean my house

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.140
I kind of have more energy now and I need to do that.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.640
I actually got brave and weighed
myself this morning and i haven't

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.310
gained as much weight as I thought I had..

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.260
I hadn't gained as much weight as I had feared, so...

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.040
i'm kinda happy about that but i'm not
going to get all complacent, like 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.950
"Oh I can eat anything I want "

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.049
i didn't gain weight and I'm like uh uh...
you know i did that last time and

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.820
go up to like two hundred pounds and...

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.180
we're not going there... so..

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.970
anyway ad

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.220
congratulations to you

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.200
Uncle Garen, and Danita

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.930
I know ya'lls e-days were yesterday...

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.590
I didn't make a video yesterday because my dentures were just ... just ...

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.750
killing me.. I just didn't want to

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.099
do much talking... Hehe

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.049
but first thing this morning I went in and 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.189
got some adjustments and some relines and ...

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.529
I still think the palate is a little bit...

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:22.199
too low... but...

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.150
We'll see how that pans out... 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.549
They promised me that will get better, and I'm sure it will...

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.939
if it continues to be a problem, I'm going to have to say look... do something..

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.529
because... you know

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:37.409
I can't 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.589
go talking like this for the rest of my
life

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:46.079
so if I get talking too fast, I sound like I'm drunk...

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.040
No... If I want to sound like I'm drunk... I'll get drunk!

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.449
But anyway... so...

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.739
i'm coming up on some pretty gnarly
traffic, so I'm gonna 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:56.959
end this 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.329
I'll talk at ya'll later.. BYE!
