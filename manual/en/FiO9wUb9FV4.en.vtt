00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.709
hey guys chrisfix here today I'm going

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.270
to show you how to diagnose an airbag

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.899
light, so what should happen is when you

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.639
go to start your car, your airbag light

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.620
will come on and stay on for about like

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.410
three to five seconds then it will shut

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.539
off that means that your airbag system

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.730
is working fine but what happens when

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.510
they go to start your car and your

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.730
airbag light stays on or flashes well

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.050
this means that there's a problem with

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.849
your airbag system the flashes are

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.800
actually giving you a code this is a

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.739
2001 Mazda V 3000, it'll work for the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.290
Ford Ranger the Mazda b-series, Ford

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.540
Explorer, and many other makes and models

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.360
but what it does is it flashes so one

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.640
two three four pause one two three four

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.660
five six so that's code number four six,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.270
or forty six after you read your codes

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.280
it'll flash about five times it'll give

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.109
you five chances to read the codes your

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.180
airbag light will stay on and that'll

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.830
let you know that there's a problem, on

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.570
some cars there's no flashing it just

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.130
the airbag light comes on and then you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.960
can just take it to Pep Boys or autozone

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.580
or any of those parts stores and they'll

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.619
check it for free so code number forty

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.360
six means that the driver side seatbelt

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.130
pretensioners circuit is broken

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.140
and the common cause for that is when

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.610
you move your seat or you put stuff

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.570
underneath your seat see this wire here

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.369
I'm going to go upside down you can see

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.320
that there's this connector right here

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.600
and what happens is moisture gets in

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.360
here or the connector gets loose , a lot

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.470
of times when you have something under

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.640
your seat or when you move the seat

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.710
forwards and backwards this will trigger

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.200
this it is a service bulletin for Ford

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.329
but they haven't had a recall for it so

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.950
all you have to do is take this apart

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.009
and spray some wd-40 in it so to get it

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.920
apart all you have to do is push this

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.840
clip down on the end and pull this right

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.079
out just like so and you're going to

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.030
spray a little bit of wd-40 in here or

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.520
use some dielectric grease that'll help

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.799
out just a little bit gets rid of

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.159
corrosion

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.260
and then I'm going to just take this and

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.670
plug it back in make sure it clicks make

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.920
sure this is together completely now

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.900
move your seat back and now we're going

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.709
to go start the car again and we'll see

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.580
if that light comes back on good the

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.620
lights off so that's how you fix it that

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.500
code was number four six or forty six

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.880
that was a driver side seatbelt

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.770
pretensioners circuit 47 is the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.569
passenger side so do the same thing for

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.459
the passenger side there's also other

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.569
codes I'm not going to go through all

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.090
the codes but to give you an idea code

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.120
one 919 that's usually after your car

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.650
gets into an accident or if you had an

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.330
accident in the airbags deployed it's

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.489
the restraint control module memory and

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.810
it's full so you just have to replace

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.330
that RCM and that's the only way to fix

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.549
that there's code number forty-two and

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.830
that's the front impact sensor be

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.880
careful when you're working with the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.620
airbags you always want to shut the car

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.060
off you want to disconnect the battery

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.610
for at least 10 minutes be super careful

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.079
because if you touch that front airbag

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.150
sensor and it goes off your airbag could

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.010
go off and that's definitely not good

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.180
the other thing that I'm going to

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.100
mention is number 27 that's another

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.470
common one and what happens is the light

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.630
bulb for this on/off switch for your

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.660
airbag goes bad it's called the PID

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.049
switch assembly and there's a light bulb

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.549
that you could buy from RadioShack for

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.320
only a few bucks and the part number

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.030
I'll put in the description but it's

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.130
number 272 - 334 and you could just

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.140
solder in a new light instead of paying

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.640
two hundred bucks for a whole new system

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.739
here so that's just a quick video on how

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.840
to check your airbag light so if this

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.430
video was helpful give it a thumbs up

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.930
