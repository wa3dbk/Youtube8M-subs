00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.020
Hi.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.020
My name's Dan Delavan.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.690
I'm the owner/operator of Plaza Cutlery in
Costa Mesa, California.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.850
We have a great selection, we also have a
website, plazacutlery.com and today we're

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.410
going to be talking about knives.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.210
A boning knife is a knife that you use after
your carving knife, so after you've done your

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.850
carving and you're getting in and you need
to do some closer work that's where your boning

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.380
knife comes in.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.250
So the boning knife is used for trimming around
the bones and so forth, also if you're cleaning

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.440
the chicken or turkey and you're breaking
it up into parts, your boning knife would

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.420
be your knife you would want to use.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.570
Okay, here we have a Global.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.239
Global is a Japanese make.

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.160
It's a really fine blade, really popular with
high end European chefs and a lot of chefs

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.160
here.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.530
It's actually the majority of the knives that
we have at home are Global.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.920
It's thinner blade on cutting edge than some
of the knives.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.570
And the advantage to the thinner blade, it's
less drag and stays sharper a little bit longer.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.930
The downside is you can damage it.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.959
This knife is semi-flexible, so you have a
little bit of flexibility to it.

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:17.240
It has a guard built in so your hand stays
back.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.600
This one also is all metal and they do have
these little dimples in it to keep your hand

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.079
from sliding and a lot of people go, you know,
"It's going to be too slippery", don't find

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.799
it slippery at all.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.840
And with the shape on it, when you go to grip
it, you're gripping it in this manner, you

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.639
pretty much have it locked into your hand
so you're not going to have any trouble.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.439
But again it's a nice, flexible blade.

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.439
Here we have a traditional Victorinox.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:48.599
It's what's used in a lot of the butcher shops,
meat packing shops for years.

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.009
This one, again, has a semi-flexible blade.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.049
It also comes in a completely stiff blade.

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.969
But again, it's nice and narrow so you can
get in.

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.789
Any of them that have this kind of curve in
it, if you're going through like chicken joints

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.289
and wings and so forth, you don't want to
use the tip of the blade because it's easy

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.410
to break it off because there's not as much
strength out there at the tip.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.030
You want to use back in the heel, where you
pull the piece of meat up, and then push that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.220
bigger wedge through in order to cut through
the joint.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.080
This one has a fiber ox handle, which is what's
required in the butcher shops.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.940
They are no longer supposed to use wood, at
least in the state of California, and it's

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.940
a very good value.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.250
If you want a really good knife, the Victorinox
is a hard one to beat, and it is the same

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.160
as the Swiss Army Knife company.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.660
Same manufacturer.
