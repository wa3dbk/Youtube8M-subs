BATTLING VALIANTLY

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.938

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:57.791
AH, SHUCKS, MR. KENT,
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:01.428
THERE WAS NO YOUTUBE,
THERE WAS NO PODCASTS.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.697
EVERYBODY
LISTENED TO THE RADIO.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.699
AS THIS WAS HAPPENING,

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.135
STETSON KENNEDY
WOULD CALL THEM AND SAY,

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:12.673
HERE ARE THE NEW PASSWORDS THAT
THE KKK ARE USING THIS WEEK.

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:16.076
THE CODEWORD WAS "ANGLO."

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.278
THE PASSWORD
WAS "AMERICAN."

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:21.682
THE NEXT WEEK,
ON THE <i>SUPERMAN</i> SHOW,

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:25.085
SUPERMAN WOULD SHOW UP
AND SAY, "ANGLO."

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:29.690
AND ONE OF THE BAD GUYS
WOULD RESPOND WITH, "AMERICAN."

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:33.927
