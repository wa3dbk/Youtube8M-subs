00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.890
So the Allen Ginsberg photographs donated
to the Fisher Library

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.820
and the University of Toronto Arts Center
are really an amazing and important addition

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.070
to the University of Toronto Library collections. While Ginsberg the poet

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.509
really needs no introduction: most people
will be familiar with him through his

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.270
seminal works such as Howl

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.650
which really helped put the Beat
movement on the  literary map back in the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.690
nineteen fifties.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.790
Others may be surprised to learn that
Ginsberg himself

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.949
captured those early beat days with this
camera and photography became an

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.879
increasingly important part of his life
from the 1950s onward.

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.170
You know, in some ways you can sort of call Ginsberg
a classic shutterbug.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.879
There are nearly 8,000 prints in total in
this collection,

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.550
making it the largest collection
Ginsberg prints anywhere in the world.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.649
I think it's a real treasure trove that
truly captures Ginsberg's storied life

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.000
and various associations. I imagine that
the photographs that capture the early Beat

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.429
period will probably garner the most
interest,

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:14.630
and all the main players are here. Greg Corso,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.740
William S. Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and
some of my favorites

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.540
are, though, of Neal Cassady, the legendary
figure that served as a model for Dean

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.720
Moriarty of 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.450
Kerouac's On the Road. There's really a number of
amazing black and white photos that

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.200
capture

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.560
Cassidy's charisma, and spirit.
There are also numerous images

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.090
of Ginsberg's lifelong friend William S.
Burroughs beginning in the early

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.560
nineteen fifties with some

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.610
fantastic photos of the young writer,
including one of my favorites

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.030
of Burroughs defiantly holding up his
hands in a boxer stance and he's 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.710
bare chested

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.810
up to the early nineteen nineties
and it's to me a really wonderful

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.500
photographic record of this extremely
important

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.110
American writer. Moving beyond the Beat period
there are a number of photographs

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.439
of individuals that were both friends
and acquaintances

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.560
of Ginsberg over the many years that
he was taking photographs, so you have

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.209
images of writers of course; Arthur Miller

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.209
Gary Snyder. Amazing actually, the number
of musicians that are represented in

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.150
this collection.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.430
Everyone from Bob Dylan to

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.830
Patti Smith to Philip Glass.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.120
Even a young Sinead
O'Connor and Beck from the mid nineteen

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.670
nineties

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.209
so there's really such a wide range
of

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.060
subjects that are
represented in this

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.580
in this photograph collection.  Also
among my

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.830
favourite images from the collection
are the Allen Ginsberg self-portraits,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.680
and there are dozens of these beginning
from the from the nineteen fifties.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.739
I was telling someone the other day that
essentially Ginsberg was doing selfies

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.780
long before it became such a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.450
such a popular expression. So while the
Ginsberg photography collection is being

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.769
housed both here

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.670
and the University of Toronto Arts Center, we
are moving forward with

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.680
scanning a lot of these images and
putting them up

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.549
on the Fisher's Flickr site, basically
allowing worldwide access to this

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:20.819
truly fabulous collection
