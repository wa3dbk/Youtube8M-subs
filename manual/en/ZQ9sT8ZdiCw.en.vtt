00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.920
Today I will show you how to prepare brooch with organza

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.560
We will need:

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.720

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.500
scissors,

lighter,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.660
safety pin

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.600
hot glue,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.260
brads or beads to decorate

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.320
At the beginning from material cut several circles of different sizes

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.440
Then, using a cigarette lighter to melt the edges of the wheels

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.520
be careful not to burn them

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.420

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.480

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.300
