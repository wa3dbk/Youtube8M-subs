Patra Frame

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.210
for ClearedJobs.net. And we’re talking about

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.770
crafting your mini-bio, your elevator speech.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.210
Whatever you want to call it, you need a brief way

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.160
to introduce yourself.  You need to be able to introduce yourself

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.310
in the context of your job search certainly but also at professional events

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.980
and other places where you will meet people.  So, you’re going to craft an

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:36.670
elevator speech

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.980
that allows you to do something effective
for your job search

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.079
and with some small changes, allows you to use it effectively

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.129
for a wide range of other times when you meet new people.

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.500
What’s an elevator speech?

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.570
Well, it comes of course from the day's

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.250
of the dot com boom and the concept that in 30 seconds on an elevator

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.659
you could be so pervasive that somebody would give you money to fund your dream.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.130
That’s probably not what you’re going to do.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.610
Most of us in 30 seconds are not going to get a new job

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.979
but that doesn't mean you don't need

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.680
an effective elevator speech and an effective elevator speech

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.140
is a mini advertisement for you.  It’s 30 to 45 seconds.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.130
I know that sounds like nothing.  It’s three or four sentences .

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.850
And it’s three or four sentences that capture what makes

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.430
you, you and for job searches what makes you, you

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.250
in a work sense.  So, you’re going to want to talk about

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.399
what skills, knowledge,

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.799
background you bring expertise,

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.520
what makes you unique, what

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.500
value you offer to a potential employer

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.540
and you’re going to talk about

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.090
the kinds of work you’re hoping to do

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.060
in a fairly general sense, not generally

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.560
in a specific job title. When you’re doing

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.500
this, you want to remember it is clearly

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.270
something that presents you

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.400
affectively and

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.010
at your best but without all the  buzzwords and jargon.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.760
When I talk to people about what I do,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.400
I talk about helping individuals

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.739
and organizations thrive through more

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.629
effective management of their people

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.390
I don’t talk about talent management

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.540
and HIPPA and Cobra and all those other kinds of things because those don’t mean a lot to most people.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.680
You need to do the same thing.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.360
You need to be clear.  You need to be concise.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.280
Most of all, you need to be not only interesting

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.400
but interested in the person you're
talking to.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.580
You need to talk to that person.You  need

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.260
to ask them what interests them at the moment, what are they working on

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.190
that’s neat and cool and that they love doing, and you need to use

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.760
your elevator speech to build a larger conversation.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.500
In the job search mode, it can lead to

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.620
an interview.  It can be the opening part of an interview

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.150
when they ask you to tell me about yourself.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.970
But clearly, it is tailored to the need.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.650
You might have a master with several variants.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.349
You tailor to the need.  You capture what you bring

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.290
to the table that makes you of value

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.540
and you interest the person you’re talking to

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.110
so that they ask questions and you develop a

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.670
conversation. It’s not difficult.  It does

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.670
need attention.  It does need practice.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.300
 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:19.069
