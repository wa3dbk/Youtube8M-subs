JOEL SIEGEL: Alright. So, we're going to go
ahead and do our high hat lift on the downbeat

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.180
of one, which means we'll closing with our
left foot on the upbeat of one. Take a look.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.679
I'll play it for you. I'm at 80 bpm. Take
a look at kinda what's happening with my left

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:21.830
foot, and also kind of what that's doing in
relationship to my right foot, okay? This

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:55.989
is the beat right here. Okay? So what's happening
as far as my feet go? I'm doing one and. That's

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.809
pretty much what's happening, right, left,
okay? So, a lot of times, this is kinda tough

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.910
to get used to sometimes because, whereas
with the high hat lifts on the upbeat, your

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.610
high hat was only doing quarter notes, right?
So, it's on the down beat which a little more

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.610
intuitive usually, and it's usually it helps
'cause you're usually going, or at least in

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.360
the examples that we did, we were doing the
downbeat at the kick drum at the same time.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.180
So, you're kinda hitting together but now,
we're kind of getting into more advanced stuff

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.070
and we're doing--hitting separately, okay?
So, this is going to be, for a lot of you,

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.000
this is gonna--you may think that it may throw
you off so just be aware of that. We'll go

00:01:40.000 --> 00:02:25.150
ahead and try and play it together. I'll count
you in, one, two, ready, play.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:33.480
Okay? So, this is a tough one when you're
first starting out, so slow it down and work

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.390
it. Break it down. Leave your hands out of
the mix for a little while, just do the feet.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.799
Get comfortable doing those eighth notes.
Do it to the metronome. Just do that one beat.

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:55.030
Let the metronome go. And just play on that
beat one, right? Just get the stuff comfortable.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.340
And then, as you get more comfortable, you'll
really be able to build the beats that you

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.049
want to be hearing.
