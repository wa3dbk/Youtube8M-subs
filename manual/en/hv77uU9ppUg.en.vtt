00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.529
I think that a good pot.

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.049
it has to

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.179
reveal something about the maker

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.949
you would hope to find life and a

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.070
response, sought of brightness

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.999
I think it's important that we want to
touch to hold it.

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.060
Craftsmanship is simply

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.660
the tool which has enabled you to
express yourself.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.440
(Shoji) Hamada spent the first half of his life

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.770
learning how too.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.840
and the second half forgetting!

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.340
In other words

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.370
your technique

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.050
it's only there to help you.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.970
In itself it's nothing

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.330
it can actually hinder you.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.620
I make jars that come from the sought of things that I love, which I have seen 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.870
all over the world, which had a function once.
But I know for a fact

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.270
they're only function now that they bring people

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:09.270
happiness, some sought of consolation. These are items they can hold in the hands.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.020
If your guna fire with wood 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.210
it's a very very time consuming very
very expensive way of doing it and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.310
the losses are enormous.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.340
Throughout the firing

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.550
ash is been deposited on the pots.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.180
That ash

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.340
at hi tempted by itself will melt and make a glaze.
It's not exactly random because

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.340
when you have experienced you begin to place pots where you expect

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.090
somethings going to happen. You begin to
understand different parts of the kiln.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.460
I think that a lot of oil, gas or electric fired pots

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.550
can be spectacular.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.820
But actually

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.200
they tell their entire story

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.690
the first time you see them.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.010
A wood fired pot,

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.480
especially ones that come from these
very

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.780
protracted firings

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.830
whichever side you look at it it's different

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.650
there's so much going on. It releases its
story to you very very slowly.
