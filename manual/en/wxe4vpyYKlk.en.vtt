00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I lose sleep, Krishna, because I chose their deaths over their lives.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And, as I see the river swallow up their ashes, 
 I am not certain I made the right choice.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Look at me, Yudish.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
A king that is impervious to the fate 
 of the soldiers that fight for him

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
is not worth serving.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Your burdens these days are heavy, but also the lightness of a feather

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
compared to the burden of doing nothing to stop Duryodhana.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You are the instrument of fate playing itself out 
 in the grand architecture of the cosmos. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
No man could not bend beneath the weight of this 
 load, but only you Yudish will not break.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I was with you when Markandeya related the tale of the four ages.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You have been witness 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to how this war will determine the fate of 
 the world for future generations throughout time.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Whether the world will see a great dynasty of kings 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
establish a golden age of peace and prosperity for generations to come…

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
…or if it will be ruled by a tyrannical hand 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
whose boot heel grinds away at man’s will and freedom forever

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Fate has chosen you and your brothers to stand upon the crack 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
of the ages and fight for the children of eternity.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Do you see your destiny racing towards us, King Yudish? 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Are you ready to embrace your burden, embrace your true birthright?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Then cast out all doubt, my friend, 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
as these men lying before you did when they 
 chose to follow their King into battle. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This war will test you again and again 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
but never forget for what it is you fight.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I haven’t.
