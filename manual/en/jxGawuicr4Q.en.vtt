00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.000
Hi, Friends!

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.033
It is time to watch 

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:06.033
LiveOlive's video guide!

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:08.000
For those of you who want to 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.033
sell things online, 

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:11.066
it is important that you

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.033
showcase your products in

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:13.033
the best possible way.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:16.033
Today's video will help you do just that:

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:19.000
"Easy Tips on Product Photography."

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
For beginners like yourself,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
there are three things you should focus on

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.033
when taking pictures of your product:

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:27.000
background,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.066
source of light and shots of the product itself.

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:33.000
For this tutorial, you will need:

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.066
two thick cardboards,

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.000
two artificial light sources

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.066
(light from your phones, flash lights or 

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.000
study lamps),

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
mica paper,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.033
scissors,

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:45.066
double tape,

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.033
the product you want to sell.

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:48.033
 

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:50.000
Let's start with the background.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.033
They key for a good background

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:53.066
is simplicity.

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.000
Choose a color or pattern 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.066
that does not clash with

00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.066
what you're photographing.

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.000
For this tutorial,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.033
we will go with a white background.

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:05.000
Set it up like this 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.066
to look like a backdrop.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.066
On the part touching the floor,

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.000
add a layer of mica paper.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You can do this easily 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
from anywhere in your home.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.066
Next is the source of light.

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:21.000
It is best if you use a natural light source,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.033
say from light filtering in through the window,

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:25.066
but if this is not possible,

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.033
you can create your own artificial light source

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:31.033
from say, phones or flashlights.

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:34.000
Last are the shots of the product itself.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It is not enough to just take one shot

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.066
from one angle because that is not

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:42.000
enough information for potential buyers.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
What you need to do is take 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.066
a bunch of shots from different angles.

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:49.033
It will look something like this.

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:51.066
 

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:53.000
Our other quick tips are for you

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.066
to ensure that the product is clean from

00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:59.000
stains or fingerprints before photographing it

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and for you to remember that 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.033
reflective surfaces will reflect your reflection,

00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:05.066
so make sure that you are not caught

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:07.000
in any of them.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If you would like to use a 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
different color background instead of white

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to give it a different feel, you can.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.066
Just make sure your background

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:16.033
doesn't clash with your product.

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:19.000
Don't stress over minor mistakes in your photos.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.033
You can always use software like Photoshop

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:25.000
to clean them up a bit.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
