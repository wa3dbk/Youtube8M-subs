00:00:01.207 --> 00:00:06.269
Ok today we’re going to install screen protector for iPad.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.242
And I’m gonna concentrate on how to get the bubbles out.

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:13.700
First of all why do you have bubbles?

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:15.790
Bubble comes from dust.

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:27.678
So you need to make sure your screen is clean before you start installing the screen protector.

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:34.226
Make sure it’s completely clean. No dust, no nothing at all.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:38.266
Because those were resulting bubbles.

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:46.626
So use the cloth that the most effective way to do this.

00:00:46.627 --> 00:00:48.344
Just simple.

00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:53.406
Air from your mouth.

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:04.784
It’s easier to see those on your screen when your screen is off.

00:01:04.785 --> 00:01:06.502
So I’m gonna turn this off.

00:01:06.503 --> 00:01:09.474
And you all those white spots.

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:13.096
Pull out those dusts, those’re gonna resulting bubbles. 

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:23.313
It is difficult but it’s not impossible, so just make sure you get all the dust off.

00:01:23.453 --> 00:01:30.186
Just clean location of the low, that’s gonna get the dust off also.

00:01:31.672 --> 00:01:37.477
Ok after that dust has been cleaned up, I'm gonna take out this screen protector.

00:01:38.685 --> 00:01:44.165
Watch first as this is number 1, this is the side that we have to peel first.

00:01:38.685 --> 00:01:48.298
So I’m going to peel this part first without touching the side.

00:01:49.738 --> 00:01:55.542
So I’m peeling it, and I’m holding the corners just a little bit.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:10.543
And I’m Peeling it halfway and I’m gonna start to point this from the bottom.

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:41.611
Great… After you applied it, you still see bubbles like here and here and here.

00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:45.790
So before you try to get the bubbles out..

00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:52.571
what you need to do is that you need to peel off the second layer which will be the blue label.

00:02:53.964 --> 00:02:55.868
And I’ll peel that off first.

00:03:03.113 --> 00:03:08.128
Ok, now for the easy part, getting the bubbles out.

00:03:09.382 --> 00:03:18.623
Get a credit card or in our case accessorygeeks gift card. And just rub it!

00:03:19.692 --> 00:03:23.128
Let those bubbles out.

00:03:23.138 --> 00:03:31.627
Corners, corners, corners and bigger bubble here.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:43.376
Ok So that's how we have the bubbles out of our screen protector for iPad.

00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:54.475
Luckily for accessorygeeks customers, you get two screen protectors in a package.

00:03:54.476 --> 00:03:57.633
So if you mess up then you have a second chance.

00:03:58.887 --> 00:04:04.413
