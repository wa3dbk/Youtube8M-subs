Hi! I am Dr. Adrienne Mulligan. I am the owner
of Camp Verde Veterinary Clinic. I am here

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.750
today on behalf of expertvillage.com, and
I am here to talk to you about taking care

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:32.349
of cats with critical conditions, critical
emergencies and health issues. So your little

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:40.730
outdoor kitty, or the one you have found on
the streets, may also come to you with external

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.679
parasites like fleas and ticks, things that
live on the kitty and suck blood, and spread

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:52.949
diseases and fleas and ticks, can cause your
cat to become very anemic, and lose a lot

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:02.379
of blood and make it life threatening. Ticks
also can do the same thing, and they can spread

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:09.751
diseases. So, if you find this to be the case
with your kittens, you can go to the store

00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:18.009
or pet store and find over-the-counter products
to help with those. One word of warning: many

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:25.829
of the products that are over-the-counter
are very, very toxic in a broad sort of way,

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:32.890
and cats can be very, very sensitive to things,
and many of them have been known to kill cats,

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.500
and so I do not think it is a good idea to
get over-the-counter flea and tick products

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.020
for your cat. Now if it is an emergency, and
you cannot get to the vet, some places will

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.539
carry just a mousse or shampoo that is very
mild that you can use on a kitten, that says

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.800
it is safe for kittens and those are probably
okay. So if you have, to do that in the meantime,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.659
but you are still going to need to go to the
vet; and again you will find that they have

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:09.509
products that can take care of the problem
with one treatment, and much easier than what

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.269
you would deal with buying anything from the
stores.
