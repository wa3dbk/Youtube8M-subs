00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.230
there also a whole buncha rules it
something like fifty pages when it comes

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.630
to you

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.190
caloric content sodium content sugar
content fat content schools that don't

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.420
comply face fines or loss of funding

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.700
not all parents think it's a great idea
here's Vicky masters

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.980
from I am where she from this is Vicky
masters to be honest this is a

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.870
report from Fox 59 who talk to her she
said I like the way it's done now

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.210
because they are fast food one day a
week they are in Plainfield and they

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.559
have a lot of choice they have things
that they will actually eat so they get

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.189
the food

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.880
in them to go through the day there are
things they just won't

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.000
eat they'd rather not eat then eat
something they don't like

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.640
is truly sad that this is even necessary
because the childhood obesity epidemic

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.810
it partially bad habits from parents
having

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.610
unhealthy food in school course doesn't
help and of course there's the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.250
socio-economic problems right junk food

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.680
and foods that are particularly good for
you are disproportionately cheaper

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.610
per calorie combined out with food
desert type situations where we have

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.600
parts of the country where there isn't
really

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.840
much 222 to buy other than mediocre
produce and fast food and chain

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.310
restaurants so this is this is a problem

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.590
but Louis I would much rather have

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.549
the food situation resolved and start
working on childhood obesity

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.240
so that we can move on to things like
creationism being taught in school

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.130
students doing worse and worse when it
comes to math and science right-wingers

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.000
wanting to bring back school prayer

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.140
standardized tests that measure very
little about

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.129
students real potential we have huge
education issues so on the one hand

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.730
this is a problem the the diets of stuff
too many kids are disaster

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.610
a lot of it is a resulted the parenting
a lot over to socio-economic

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.180
we have a childhood obesity problem on
the same hand

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.080
and I i would i would say on the other
hand is really on the same hand because

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.519
it is

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.920
you're just more school problems there's
this long list the issues in our public

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.470
schools

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.959
not to mention private religious schools
but I'm not even thinking about that

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:39.569
right now

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.239
at there are connected because we're not
we're not teaching kids

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.900
about why they shouldn't be eating these
things in about why we're taking them

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.480
away

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.060
we're just taking them away and I don't
think it's going to be very effective

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.050
know it its

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.209
it's questionable how effective it will
be I

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.379
but but again if if nothing was being
done I would think that was also

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.730
Ron that's the issue I have with this I
don't know exactly how effective it will

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.459
be overall

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.800
I think skid spend a lotta time in
school and if they get better habits

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.330
there it could make an impact but
ultimately

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.180
what happens outside of school in the
long term will dictate how how these

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.640
kids do
