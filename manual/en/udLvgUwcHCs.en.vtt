00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.290
Welcome to the Missouri University of Science
and Technology 2013 Solar house.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.620
This is our fifth U.S. Solar Decathlon, and
we’re proud to say all four of our previous

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.320
solar homes now serve as student housing and
outreach assets on our Rolla, Missouri campus.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.189
We asked ourselves a simple question for Solar
Decathlon 2013.

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.949
How do we design a sustainable home that serves
as many markets and regional needs as possible?

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.380
Our design concept comes from the Chameleon,
a creature that successfully adapts to its

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.620
environment.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.740
Why not blend solar and other technologies
associated with sustainable living with the

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.580
ability to adapt to changing environments?

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.120
We therefore introduce the Chameleon House,
an adaptable living environment.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.160
To tour the Chameleon House, let’s enter
through the south-facing solarium that expands

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.810
the home’s floor plan to the outdoors living
space, and combines passive solar light and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.480
shade design ideas that help reduce the home’s
energy needs.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.000
The solarium expands the house’s feel, especially
for the kitchen, the heart of any home.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.440
Red tones on the sliding kitchen cabinets
reflect the warmth of a family gathering,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.510
and also mark each of the home’s adaptable
features.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.100
The multipurpose space features high-mounted
windows that bathe the home in natural light

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.220
that reaches deeper into the rooms, and frees
up wall space for the tenant’s favorite

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.220
creative touches.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.820
A suspended “cloud ceiling” softens artificial
lighting, holds the house’s fire suppression

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.240
system, and hides ductwork that gently distributes
fresh air throughout the conditioned space.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.560
Clean and energetic lines describe the Chameleon
House.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.570
The TV doesn’t dominate the room; its flexible
mount directs the screen toward or away from

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.690
any room in the house.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.550
A “Grid Wall” serves as a versatile and
adaptable decorating, and storage, space.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.100
The top shelf is perfect for Solar Decathlon
awards and other decorations.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.060
When not in use, cube-shaped end tables slide
into the lower wall openings, and middle cabinets

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.560
provide plenty of storage space.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.030
If you work from home privacy and flexibility
are high on your “want list” of Chameleon

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.380
home features.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.840
The movable panel wall is easily closed to
separate the home office from other residents’

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.840
daily activities.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.800
The office desk rolls out of the way and even
the classic “murphy bed” can disappears

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.629
into the east wall, so when the wall is fully
open the house is perfectly suited for hosting

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.019
large family or neighborhood gatherings.

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.239
A bathroom can be one of a home’s busiest
places, so “spacious” is a must!

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.129
Ceramic tile provides a perfect low-maintenance
surface impervious to bathroom humidity or

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.269
wear and tear from the co-located laundry
area.

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.349
The bath and laundry area is immediately adjacent
to the mechanical room to minimize installation

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.989
costs, maintenance, and energy loss.

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.549
The Chameleon house is conditioned by noise-,
dust- and draft-free radiant systems that

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.200
make the homeowner feel more comfortable while
using less energy than traditional forced-air

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.200
ductwork.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.779
An air exchanger provides fresh air while
roof-mounted flat plate thermal collectors

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:58.469
take care of hot water needs.

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:03.579
We’re proud that our student-designed and
–built predictive automation system controls

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.700
lights, HVAC, windows and shades, and even
the entertainment system from any web-enabled

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.700
device.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.309
This program even takes into account weather
predictions to configure the house for maximum

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:16.029
efficiency.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:20.489
Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) make up
the structure’s shell, and lightweeeight

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.269
concrete floors add valuable thermal mass
to the envelope.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.269
SIPs meet California Seismic codes, have high-R
values, are easy to set up, and reduce standard

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.269
construction waste to near zero.

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.940
Thank you for taking the time to tour the
Chameleon House.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.059
We look forward to seeing you in California
in October, 2013!
