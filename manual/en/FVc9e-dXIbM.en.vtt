Hey Loves, Giselle here, thanks so much for
watching!

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.020
Today, I got to film some really scary promos
at LATV - hence the super intense professional

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.580
background -- I got to rock a half skull look,
and it was way too fun not to share.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.340
Now, just to let you know know, I was super
rushed for time.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:35.480
BUT, like the day of the dead look from last
year, I did manage to mix up some black light

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.370
glow in the dark makeup on both sides.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.510
I began by brushing on LOTS and LOTS of primer
to help the makeup apply smoother and to at

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.010
least try to keep some of the paint out of
my pores.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.130
Now, I drew my division line down the middle,
but now I wish would've tried something else,

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.300
like a diagonal, or a top to bottom, or a
cross zig zag kind of a thing.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.300
But, maybe next time!

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.329
I'm using a full coverage foundation on one
side of my face and all of my neck -- and

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.590
yes it was totally weird applying makeup only
to one side of my face at a time.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.760
Next up, concealer to brighten my eyes, some
bronzer to contour my cheeks, a little powder

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.820
and highlight where I need it.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.920
And then over to the other side, where I kept
a black light handy to test the evenness of

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.500
the white face paint -- to find out how I
mixed that up to make it black light glow,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.030
click this box or the link below.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.820
And, long and even strokes are definitely
the key here.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.759
Also, I used the paint to prime my lips, as
well as my eyes, to make those colors stick

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.479
and especially pop when I apply them in a
bit.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.529
Oh, and almost forgot, I went over and sponged
the whole skull side with a translucent powder

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:43.500
- minus the lips - and this is just going
to set the paint, get rid of any brush marks,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.870
and prevent future smudging and bleeding.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.190
And then, since I'd never used the fluo night
makeup as actual makeup, instead of over face

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.780
paint, I did a lot of the testing on the spot,
as you're watching right now.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.219
I started off my dabbing the purple around
my eyelid and pulling it in until about the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.219
half way point.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.109
And then I applied the hot pink to the inner
half of my eye, around the tear duct and my

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:04.979
lower lash line.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.990
Layering and layering and layering both pigments
to intensify the color and shape as I got

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.420
more comfortable with the product.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.950
Now, like I said earlier, I was in kind of
in a rush, so I kept designs pretty simple

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.950
around here.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.159
I used the same powder as my eyes, I added
a little aqua seal to create more of a paint

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.680
consistency and I used my brushes as stamps.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.069
Dabbing instead of tracing the petals, for
max color and time efficiency.

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.150
Again, more in depth tips for this by clicking
the box or the link below.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.569
Now, I'll let the petals dry and quick fill
in my brow.

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.519
And now to bring the character to life...
or I guess death.

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:44.069
I'm filling in my eye completely -- even over
my brows -- with a nice thick coat of black

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.069
face paint.

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.620
Careful when going around the edges to keep
the shape clean and round.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.019
Now a little break from eyes to lips, which
I'm filling in completely with the same neon

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.150
pink powder I've been using.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.379
And I'm actually using a narrow angle brush
for application and precision, Adding a little

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:00.790
aqua seal to deepen color.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.129
I even decided to blot on some black for a
creepier effect.

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:12.750
Then I used a thin brush to pull out for the
cut around my cheeks and quick stitch marks

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.280
The nose, for me, personally, is the hardest
part, I don't know why.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.070
But luckily, I only had to do one side of
this.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.110
I traced around my nostrils and shot up two
little points, and filled it in.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.530
Quick little detail of filling in the water
line.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.530
Quick black light check.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.900
All is good in the hood.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.480
I decided to add some crazy lashes, topped,
of course, with my glow paint...

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.439
Then, on the other side, I curled my own lashes
-- cure face, I know -- and applied some false

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:39.950
whispies.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.180
Letting those dry and moving on to hair.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.370
I just went crazy here.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.810
Honestly, I needed to be quick.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.190
I teased teased teased the roots and the ends
-- lots and lots of hairspray, of course - And

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.370
then I flat ironed and smoothed out the other
side.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.200
Quick application of thick mascara.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.599
Quick clean up and highlighting powder under
my eyes and around my mouth.

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.150
I also added a little white accent to my inner
corners.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.349
And we are done.

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.989
There is the final half skull look that I
used for my scary Halloween promo with LATV.

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.200
I hope you enjoyed this video, I had so much
fun playing dress up with my co-hosts.
