hi I'm Chris from Fibre Glast

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.790
today we're going to show you the
Duratec Clear Hi-Gloss Additive that

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.650
we carry on Fibre Glast dot com

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.820
Duratec Hi-Gloss Additive is blended
with gel coats to improve gloss level

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.390
lower viscosity and enhance the gel coat
properties

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.119
it allows gel coat to cure open-air so 
it's our recommendation to use this for

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.939
any gel coat repair that will have air contact

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.340
although most gel coats can be sprayed
straight out of the can

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.820
most people choose to thin them this addiitive thins gel coats enough to help you

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.450
spray

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.350
resulting in a high gloss pinhole free
class A surface

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.100
it's typically used for repairs and out of mold applications

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.690
but it can also be added to gel coat for
in mold applications to enhance the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.510
gloss level

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.610
Duratec Clear Hi-Gloss Additive should
be measured out and blended with a one

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.760
to one ratio

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.760
when used with regular gel coats you
will notice the lower viscosity in the mix

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.820
when using with tooling  gel coat you should use a fifteen-percent ratio

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.090
tooling gel coat benefits include
improved gloss level

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.399
reduced surface porosity open-air cure
and improved durability

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.630
after blending you should catalyze your gel coat with two percent

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.890
MEKP when mixed you're ready to spray

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.289
this additive improves gel coat performance for repairs

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.069
but for below the waterline repairs we still
recommend adding our number 71 styrene

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.229
wax for maximum cured hardness

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.479
