I am David Clemen on behalf of Expert Village.
Today we are going to learn how to draw characters.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.110
Today, before we are getting started, when
you think of drawing characters, a lot of

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.900
people will confuse that with a caricature,
which is basically a drawing with a big head

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.189
and a little body. That is something you might
see in an amusement park or something like

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.900
that.
What we are going to do is a little bit different.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.460
And, with the character, you can draw from
your mind or something you see, but it is

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.080
not realistic, it is just kind of like a cartoon
and so forth. So, to get started, which you

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:47.080
can do is practice drawing anything you want
basically and make it into a character.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.900
I usually start practicing with eyes. I usually
come in and just draw a big eye like here,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:05.721
get a big eyebrow, give it an eyelid and then
drew the eye. Then usually I come down and

00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:15.080
maybe he really has a long nose. I just do
a little ball for the nose. Maybe he is kind

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.320
of a tight lipped guy and really serious and
I will do this really small lips. Maybe add

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:31.372
some glasses. Maybe he is a school principal
and he is balding. He only has hair here and

00:01:31.372 --> 00:01:38.140
there and tries to do the comb over. There
is only three strands of hair. And he's got

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:49.090
this long face. A silly mustache that is not
even even, it is kind of crooked. Now I coming

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.900
over here and do this side of the face the
same, and he's got this really long face.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:01.150
I try to do the eye very similar, but if it
is off, he is a character, so it doesn't matter.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:08.610
Now I will bring the eyeglasses over here.
He is definitely going to have a pocket protector

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:16.150
because he is a school principal. Bring the
tie down there and lots and lots of pens,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:26.890
the shoulder. Oh, I have to do his hair of
here. One more comb over for a full effect.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.989
And there he is.
