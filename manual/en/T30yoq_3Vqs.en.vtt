00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.940
It's the Spanish rider - I don't remember
the name - he called me Nicholas Cage, and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.369
all the peloton call me Nicholas Cage.

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.190
My name is Michele Pallini. I work to Astana
from this year, it's my first year here

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:30.190
at Astana. This is my seventeenth season in
cycling. My grandfather rode the bike, my

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.980
father, and me. I wanted to do the soigneur
from a child.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.600
The day from the soigneur is long. I wake
up at 6.30 in the morning. We clean the car.

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:02.809
We do the cooler and the bidons and water,
salt and sugar for the race, we help the rider

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.520
in the breakfast, and after we take the luggage,
we put it in the truck and we go to the start.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.340
After we go to the feed zone before they start
the race, the rider, and after we give them

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.619
food we go to the finish line, we wait for
the shower for the rider and we come back

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.570
to the hotel for massage and dinner. After
the dinner we need to wash the clothes. In

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.960
this Tirreno-Adriatico is very bad because
it rains everyday and there are a lot of clothes

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.960
to clean. We finish, I go to bed at 11-11.30.
It's a long day and a small night, every

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.430
day.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.430
Bars... gels... and cake... one bottle of
water... and one bottle for energy drink.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.690
We go to the bus, we prepare some sugar for
recuperation for drink after the race. We

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.800
go to the finish line and we wait at the line
there, and see if we win. We go with the winner

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.860
to the podium, we change, and we wait for
the press conference and doping control.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.900
He go to the bus and we wait for to know if
there are leader or not, and nothing... that's

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.520
all.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.870
Good day?

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.250
Yeah good day, nice day.
