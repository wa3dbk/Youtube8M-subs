00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.259
Millions of geese enter Kansas during winter
months, and now is the time to hunt these

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:11.410
impressive waterfowl. Three kinds of geese
may be found together: Canada geese, the most

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.210
familiar, white-fronted geese, and snow geese.
Geese are social and congregate by family

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.270
groups into large flocks that roost on any
open water. City environments with their relative

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.480
safety often become geese headquarters. Geese
are long-lived birds that are smart and hard

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.980
to hunt. Scouting is essential to learn where
birds are feeding and this may change on a

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.550
daily basis. The best advice: hunt where geese
want to be.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.320
Most goose hunting takes place on private
land, so getting permission is vital.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.590
A successful hunt often requires lots of work.
Decoys are set before daylight in hopes of

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.930
attracting flying geese. Layout blinds allow
camouflaged hunters to hide among the decoys

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.850
for close shots.
Goose calling is an important art that helps

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.220
invite birds to land. Geese are suspicious
and will bypass hunting setups where anything

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.149
seems out of place.
Large powerful birds require nontoxic heavy

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:25.259
shot and many hunters use special shotgun
chokes to increase range out to about 50 yards.

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.679
All waterfowl hunters must also have state
and federal duck stamps in addition to a hunting

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:36.329
license when required by law.
When everything comes together, goose hunting

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.930
is an unforgettable experience. The beauty
of birds setting in against a painted sunrise

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.729
keeps hunters coming back again and again.
The reward is a tasty meal that is part of

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.340
a timeless tradition over Kansas fields and
marshes.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.719
Canada and snow goose seasons are open now.
Whitefronted goose season opens again February

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:05.840
5th and the season for all dark geese closes
February 13th. A special conservation order

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.209
allows snow goose hunting to continue through
April 30. Consult hunting regulations for

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.400
further information.
