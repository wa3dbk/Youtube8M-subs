00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.740
In 1952, I went into Shotley Bridge Hospital.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.930
I was five, and I had a patent ductus heart
operation.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.570
Visits were only once a week so I was basically
left on my own down there.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.770
It is very different today because Maggi goes
into the Royal Brompton Hospital and she has

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:41.250
a cot and her mum has a bed beside her so
she is always with one of her parents.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.370
She was very poorly, constantly high temperatures,
runny noses, very slow to feed, quite under

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.959
weight, and then she had a fit, so her mum
was obviously extremely anxious about her

00:00:53.959 --> 00:01:00.039
and rushed her to hospital and that was when
they decided there was more to this than meets

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.079
the eye.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.220
The doctor there did some tests and that was
when they found this pulmonary artery stenosis

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.340
that she has.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.409
So very good for the doctors to find it so
quickly.

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.600
It could have gone on for a lot longer and
then she would have got weaker and weaker.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.260
If they hadn’t have found it so soon, I
don’t think she would have made the recovery

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.659
that she has.

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.530
Oh, it’s wonderful.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.090
The progress that the medical profession has
made in heart surgery since then is amazing.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.399
When I mentioned to the doctor that I’d
had heart surgery when I was younger, he told

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.310
me that that same operation takes twenty minutes
and you’re actually in hospital for seven

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.310
hours.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.560
So it’s very very different today.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.719
-How long were you in hospital for?

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:46.569
Three and a half months.
