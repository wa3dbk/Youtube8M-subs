00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.371
Eat.
You can eat now.

00:00:01.371 --> 00:00:04.611
This is our first meal in Canada.

00:00:06.771 --> 00:00:08.341
It's somewhat sad...

00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:12.771
Taking a bite after a long trip...

00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:15.071
It tastes good because we're hungry, right?

00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:18.681
They are exhausted

00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:20.171
Oh, I'm beat.

00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:23.211
Oh... I want to lie down.

00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:24.891
Now that he's eaten, he's getting sleepy...

00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:28.271
I'm happy because I'm with you, Lihwan.

00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:31.581
But it was tough, right?

00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:33.121
You're not tired?

00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:35.211
Being with you is fun, dad.

00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:36.621
It's fun to be with me?

00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:38.351
Everything is fun.

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:41.301
Really?

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:44.131
I feel touched.

00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:48.561
Lihwan loves being with his dad...

00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:52.051
Now he's acting like a rooster

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.951
I'm going to check on the water.

00:00:56.171 --> 00:00:57.821
You have to get washed up.
Come here.

00:00:57.821 --> 00:00:59.481
No!

00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:01.551
I'm going to bed now.

00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:06.641
Hurry up and come over!

00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:09.211
Hurry! You have to wash up.
Hurry up.

00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:11.691
- No...
- Come here.

00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:14.491
Hurry up. Hurry.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.191
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:18.791
Hurry up.

00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:21.171
- I'm tired, too.
- Pull my foot.

00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:23.781
- Hurry up.
- You have to pull the switch.

00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:26.941
Even if he's tired, he is playing
with his son

00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:28.641
Take that off.

00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:32.141
Hurr up. You have to wash up.
The water's on.

00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:34.951
- Hurry up.
- Pull the switch, please.

00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:36.991
Pull the switch.

00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:38.831
- Sigh...
- Pulling back

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:39.941
One.

00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:42.971
What's that? That?

00:01:42.971 --> 00:01:43.781
Huh?

00:01:43.781 --> 00:01:44.771
Come here.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.741
Being dragged...

00:01:47.411 --> 00:01:49.311
Instead of yelling, he is much better
at dealing with his son!

00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:50.641
Take that off. Hands up.

00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:53.361
That's nice.

00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:55.231
How's the Canadian water?
Nice, right?

00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:57.331
It's nice!
Canadian shower.

00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:09.811
Now, he's a monkey!

00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:11.731
He's jet-lagged
He's going to do the 12 animal signs...

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.391
You're happy?

00:02:13.391 --> 00:02:14.711
Bear hug

00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:17.201
I'm so happy!

00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:18.701
What are you doing?

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:22.501
Are you that happy now
that I've cleaned you up?

00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:25.001
It's an emotional day for Junghwan!

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:27.191
Let's go to bed.

00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:32.621
Lihwan is all over the place

00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:39.371
Why did you change so much?

00:02:39.371 --> 00:02:40.721
Oh, boy...

00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:43.671
But this place is really far.

00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:46.481
We had a really long day.

00:02:46.481 --> 00:02:49.941
But Lihwan, seeing you this happy...

00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:53.351
I was really tired until just now,

00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:58.241
but now I'm feeling much better.

00:02:58.241 --> 00:02:59.711
Really?

00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:04.221
Encore
Then one more time

00:03:05.341 --> 00:03:07.871
I'm tired. Dad's tired.

00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:10.651
You can't get excited already.

00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:13.321
You're really happy, aren't you?
