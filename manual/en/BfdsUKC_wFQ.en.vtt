00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.230
Is it an anthropological artifact?

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.260
Is it costumry?

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.140
Is it an art object?

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.990
The thing is it's all of those.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.940
It really depends on the context that you're
creating for it and how it's being displayed.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.610
Because we have very few museums or exhibits
having to do with Mexican culture, MexicArte

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.610
Museum has always tried to collect in the
different areas.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.970
And so we, since the 1990s, we started collecting
Mexican masks.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.640
What's in the collection?

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.810
There's easily over 150.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.210
What's really interesting about this is that
you're seeing parts of costumes and parts

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.239
of masks because parts are missing.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.810
But most of them, according to their collector,
have been used in a dance practice.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.730
All these masks have a reference to a specific
dance.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.760
The mask represents a variety of roles that
have to do with either morality plays, religious

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.640
plays, or teaching about history, tradition,
pagan rituals.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.439
Some now are only festive.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.859
They're grounded in tradition and culture.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:12.869
And They go back many, many, many years.

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.440
They show the combination of indigenous and
the Spanish.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.939
The customs come and go so there was a combination
of the two.

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:29.740
Certain objects or images or animals or specific
figures that the indigenous held pride in

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.420
all of the sudden became demonized.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.939
If the masks are being produced in the colonized
space, it'll always have the original indigenous

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.399
communities and stenography in it or influence
on it or slipped in.

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.990
So it's really interesting to see a lot of
the coloring that was associated with pre-Hispanic

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.670
gods like black, red, now being associated
with devil masks.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:03.509
A lot of the gods that were jaguars were very
powerful, significant animal, and then later

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.610
in the conversion process, the jaguar becomes
more of a trickster, the jaguar becomes more

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.349
of a reference of danger.

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.860
And a lot of the dance practices can be kind
of broken down into certain categories.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.620
And the dance of the vaqueros falls into an
occupational drama which, talking about a

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.209
specific occupation like the fisherman or
the cowboy in this case.

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:33.280
There is a group of cowboys that ultimately
defeat some sort of bull that is heavily decorated.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.989
And that's the ongoing consistent detail.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.680
So for most of the dances, depending on where
they practice in Mexico, they're always going

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.780
to be a little bit different.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.340
What's interesting about the dance of the
fisher man is the associated fish.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.430
Some dancer would sit in that or stand in
that and that would go around their waist.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.310
And other dancers or performers would go around
said fish and try to catch it.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.580
Usually the dance of the fisher man always
has a specific fisherman and it's a black

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.660
fisher man and that references the African
slave population that was on a specific coast

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.670
in Mexico.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.420
And a lot of the fisher men can be descendents
of the African slaves.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.340
A lot of the materials that you'll see in
this expo are specifically wood or hard wood.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.819
But there's a whole wall right over here.

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.969
They have more of a unique characteristic
and a unique material like leather or clay.

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:41.890
What's really interesting is when animal parts
are used like fangs or hair.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.689
There's a specific mask for dance of malincha.

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:47.590
That's an armadillo shell.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.459
What's different about most mask exhibitions
is that usually they're from an aesthetic

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.849
stand point, so you're just kind of referencing
the design elements that constitute this object.

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:05.379
But this exhibition contextualizes the object
itself, so how it's being used, where its

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.700
being used, it's a very sensorial experience.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.459
The thing is that, you know, our culture is
very complex.

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.780
We have both popular traditions, we have contemporary
art, we have festivals.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.000
And so, this is kind of a snap shot or an
example of one of the things that's part of

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
our culture.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.500
We feel that we are a window to Mexico.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.010
We are connectors.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.560
Many of the people that live here, and the
children, have never been to Mexico and so

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.910
this is a window where they can learn about
their country and their culture.
