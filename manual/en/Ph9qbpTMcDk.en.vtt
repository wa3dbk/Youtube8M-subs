00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:28.429
Continuing the trend of Fight Night Round
3, Round 4 is back in the ring and this time

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:36.210
it is coming in with some brand new punches.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.800
Round 4 comes out with what was at the time,
the most realistic boxing game ever released,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.790
only being surpassed by its sequel.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.240
With the new control scheme, the improvements
to the legacy mode, and the major addition

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.840
of online support, this was a dream for boxing
fans when it was released.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.570
I remember I was looking forward to this game
very much.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.660
I had played my fair spare of Round 3, and
with all the things that Round 4 was bringing,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.190
how could I not be excited.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.880
And Round 4 did not disappoint in the least.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:16.400
This game is not just one of the best in the
boxing game genre, but one of the best in

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.310
the entire sports genre.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.820
This game was made for people who love boxing.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.590
Each fight is brutal, and strategic, just
like in real life.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.280
You can’t just go in and swing your arms
like a mad man.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.719
You actually have to have some rhyme and reason
behind each punch you throw..

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.969
Each fight requires thinking, mixing up counter
punches and timing your bobs and weaves.

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:42.310
And Round 4 gives you a completely different
way to do this.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.789
Instead of the classic style, Fight Night
introduced a new analog control system.

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.600
You move with the left analog stick and throw
your punches with the right.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.340
That’s right, all your punches are controlled
with one analog stick.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.740
To throw a jab you push the analog stick up
and to the left, while to have your fighter

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.219
throw a straight it is up and to the right.

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.990
Hooks and crosses happen when you push to
the side.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.009
And uppercuts are down and swing it all the
way up.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.860
You think this would be complicated and I’d
admit, at first it is.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.500
But soon you will be pulling off combinations
like you have been training all your life.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.510
Jab, Straight, Hook, Right Uppercut.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.750
Man is that satisfying.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.200
The Legacy mode in this game does leave something
to be desired though.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.800
You create a fighter and take him through
a career that hopefully ends in them becoming

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.860
the GOAT.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.790
You will have to schedule your fights carefully,
working your way up the world rankings until

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.890
you can get your chance at a title shot.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.980
Although this is interesting at first, having
to train in-between fights, it will boil down

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.750
to just, fight, train, fight some more, train
some more.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.400
It feels more like a disconnected series of
fights rather than a real career.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.780
What the Legacy mode lacks though, the game
makes up for in graphics and gameplay.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.340
Each fight feel different than the one before.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.140
The game sports an impressive roster selection
with the AI having each fighter behaving like

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.870
their real life counterpart.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:22.840
Ali will want to stay on the outside while
Tyson wants to get in close.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.950
You will literally whence when you see your
uppercut connect and send your opponent to

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.240
the mat.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.920
If you think of yourself as a fan of boxing,
then you don’t need to hear how good this

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.110
game is because you already own it.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:45.940
But if you are on the fence, I could not recommend
this game more.
