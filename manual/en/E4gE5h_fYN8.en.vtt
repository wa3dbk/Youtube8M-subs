Hi. I'm Karen Grete from Scandinavian Today.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.380
I'm going to show you how I make

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.290
the Norwegian egg coffee. I enjoy coffee
every single day especially in the morning

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.800
and this is an interesting way of making
coffee so I thought some of you might like

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.290
to do it and here we go.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:31.890
What you'll need for the coffee is three
tablespoons of coarse ground coffee and

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.270
three cups of boiling water. I'm going to
use a whole egg, and besides that,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:46.760
you would want about a quarter cup of cold
water and you also want one cup of cold

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.920
water. And, of course, and I have my
coffee cup here.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.390
So, the first step is to mix coffee and
egg and a little water.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:05.630
So, here we have the coffee, so I take
three tablespoons of coffee grounds

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:16.134
freshly grounded. Like that. Now, I mix in
a quarter cup of cold water.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:33.200
In here and I'm adding the whole egg .
Some people add the eggshells,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.160
as well. I'm not going to do that, so it's
up to you if you would like to do.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:49.460
Just mix it up. So as you see, the water
is boiling and I'm going to pour the egg

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.410
with the coffee in there and I stir it and
I turn it down. And I'm going to let it

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:04.780
cook for about three minutes at very low
flame. Want to make sure you get

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:15.460
everything in there. And I have been told
that this kind of coffee is very popular

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.650
with American-Scandinavians in the Midwest.
So this, I think, is quite interesting and

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:31.710
the coffee is going to be very tasty. So,
I'm sure you can tell that the coffee

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.670
grounds are at the top, sticks together
with the egg, and the longer you boil it,

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.330
the stronger the coffee will be. But after
three minutes, I turn off the heat and

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.920
I'm pouring in one cup of cold water. And
now, I'm going to leave it like that for

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:04.580
about 10 minutes and the coffee is almost
done. So, the coffee grounds went to the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:12.620
bottom of the pot and I'm now going to...
actually, I like to pour it through a

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:24.215
strainer, so I will just do that, and then
I can taste my delicious coffee.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.960
And here, we have all the coffee grounds
and I have just about four cups of coffee

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:51.080
now. So, I can pour my delicious Norwegian
egg coffee and I'm going to enjoy it with

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:59.140
a piece of my Tosca cake, and I think it's
going to taste really great.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:06.680
Here it is. Very good, has absolutely no
bitterness in this coffee,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.460
whatsoever. It's a nice way of making
coffee. Very nice. It's good.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.310
