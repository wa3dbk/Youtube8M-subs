00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.520
Hello and welcome to my crib!

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:13.440
So you saw it before it was done, and...tadah!

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.840
So this is my favourite part - for most girls
as well, I think!

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.039
Shoes...!

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.250
Ahhhh!

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:32.020
And this is what was supposed to be the lounge
area, but now it's kind of like a study area,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.899
so there's a writing desk.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.760
So if this gate looks familiar, it is!

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.260
It's the gate you saw in the previous video;
it was the gate to my front door.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.590
It didn't work though, because for some reason,
the doorway became very narrow.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.789
So we had to take it off when the furniture
came in, and then I realised that it looked

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:50.789
better without the gate.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.219
So we brought the gate in, gave it a fresh
coats of paint, and volia!

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.559
It is now a wall display!

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:58.980
This is the living room area.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.909
So if you're wondering where the TV is - because
I realise a lot of people need to live with

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.570
TV - well I think electronics are ugly, so
I've kept it hidden.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.350
Welcome to 'The Museum'!

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.490
This is where I store most of my vintage finds
and it's also where I have a lot of my own

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.399
treasures; like an old cross-stitch, old paintings,
favourite books, basically everything and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.189
anything that I love goes here.

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.460
So this is one of my treasured vintage finds,
which some people think is just junk.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.040
It's basically an old baby's cradle that was
restored.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.090
So you can imagine it was longer, and they
just kind of cut it off here and painted it

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.549
this kind of powder blue.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.860
So I love it, it's where I sit down to put
on my shoes.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.860
This is the dining area.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:59.619
Now if you noticed, the last time I brought
you in here it was just one floor, but there's

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.490
now an upstairs.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.220
So this is my bedroom!

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.739
My wardrobe...which looks quite neat; I'm
quite proud of myself.

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.310
So this is one of my favourite places in my
home.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.340
It's where I sit to read, I sometimes sit
here to do work...and I love it because I

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.010
get a bird's eye view of my entire house and
my beautiful lights.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.069
It's just very, very chill.

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:30.599
This is the kitchen where not a lot of cooking
happens because I don't really cook.

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:37.750
And I like to keep my electronics hidden so...
washer and dishwasher...and the fridge.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.550
My brother said, why would you keep you fridge
hidden?

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.340
It makes it harder to take food.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.340
Such a guy!

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.129
This is my bathroom.

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.730
Now there's a very 'vain' mirror - tadah!
- which basically makes you look good!

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.420
I am obsessed with lights.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.730
Every single light in this house has been
pain-stakingly chosen by me.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.670
Like this one, I found in Chatuchak in Bangkok
and I carried it back.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.140
You see the main living room lights.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.140
the star lights.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.470
These were lights that I wanted to get for
my old apartment, but I have never been able

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.470
to find.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.520
So when I finally found them on this site
in the US I got them shipped back.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.959
I got every one of the voltages changed to
fit the Singapore voltage.

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.940
So the dining room light was from my previous
apartment and I was pretty obsessed because

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.439
I couldn't find a light that I liked, so basically,
for that apartment, I went six months with

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.180
just a stub where the dining room light should
have been.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.629
So of course I had to bring it back to this
house!

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:32.730
So now you've seen my crib.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.409
