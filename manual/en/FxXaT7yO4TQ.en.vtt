00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:13.820
ANNE THOMPSON, reporting:

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.740
The Arctic can be a harsh and forbidding place.
But this ice-covered ocean, the Earth's smallest,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.890
is feeling big impacts from a warming world
with scientists recording unprecedented changes

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.429
in the balance of fresh and salt water.

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.779
RICHARD KRISHFIELD (Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution): The Arctic is a key. I mean,

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.510
it's one of the places that is very sensitive
to climate change. It's likely to respond,

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.181
you know, very extremely to climate change.

00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:46.730
THOMPSON: Rick Krishfield is part of a scientific
team documenting what's happening in the Arctic

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.449
Ocean. His annual trips to record water temperatures
and the amount of salt in the water are supplemented

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.050
by daily emails from buoys he left behind,
sending data twice a day to his laboratory

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.499
at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute
in Massachusetts.

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:07.200
The buoys are deployed in an area called the
Beaufort Gyre. It's the dominant current in

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.520
the Arctic, slowly moving and mixing the waters,
including a massive amount of fresh water

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.750
from northern rivers and the Bering Strait.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.310
THOMPSON: What's happening up in the Arctic
Ocean, some 5,000 miles north of Woods Hole,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.149
could have a big impact on the climate here,
and along the Eastern Seaboard of the United

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.189
States.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.829
In the Arctic, cold, fresh water sits on the
surface of the ocean, protecting the polar

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.860
ice from the warmer water below. The clockwise
circulation of the Beaufort Gyre traps that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.170
freshwater in place up north. But periodically
the Gyre weakens, releasing some fresh water

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.149
south. If the Gyre releases too much fresh
water, it can flow into the North Atlantic

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.409
and act as a barrier, keeping warmer Gulf
Stream water from releasing its heat into

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.840
the atmosphere. Arctic Group leader Andrey
Proshutinsky says too much fresh water there

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.690
could impact the climate of the entire northern
hemisphere, putting a chill in North America

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.690
and Europe.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.690
Dr. ANDREY PROSHUTINSKY (Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution): And that's why we have to know

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:22.700
how much fresh water we have in this upper
layer. If we have too much, heat cannot penetrate

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.709
to atmosphere, and atmosphere is getting colder
and climate is cooling.

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.930
THOMPSON: So, the fresh water, in effect,
is a blanket?

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.909
PROSHUTINSKY: This is--yeah, this is--works
like a blanket. So if you interrupt this flow

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:44.400
of heat, or cover it with blanket of fresh
water, we will observe cooling.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.129
THOMPSON: In his younger days, Proshutinsky
flew on some of the earliest Soviet missions

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:54.790
to unexplored areas of the Arctic. Science
has come a long way since then, but doing

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.280
research in the Arctic is still extremely
difficult, and people still can't make observations

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.590
there year-round.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.310
THOMPSON: To track the daily course of fresh
water, scientists and engineers went back

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.409
to the drawing board. They developed new instruments
to give them information they could only guess

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.180
at until now.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.110
The team at Woods Hole developed the ITP,
or Ice-Tethered Profiler, a yellow buoy that

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.220
they've successfully deployed on the Arctic
ice year round. It's neat, compact, and only

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.030
occasionally attracts the stray polar bear.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.500
RICHARD KRISHFIELD: Polar bears are known
to frequent whatever buoys and things that

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.950
they can find on the ice. And they're gonna
grab em and theyre gonna bite em, and theyre

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.620
gonna see if they're edible or not. And this
guy, apparently, you can see, punctured it

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.000
with his claws a few times here. And then
he ripped some chunks out of it to see whether

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.730
it tasted good or not.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.349
THOMPSON: The ITP sends an instrument 700-meters,
or about 23-hundred feet, up and down a wire

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:58.590
deep in the Arctic water, taking measurements
every 25 centimeters, or about 10-inches,

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.700
recording water temperature and salt content.
The data shows that fresh water has been accumulating

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.140
dramatically in the Arctic Ocean over the
last twelve years.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.430
KRISHFIELD: The redder contours mean that
it's more fresh water. The bluer means less.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.590
THOMPSON: Wow, look at the difference there,
2005 and 2009, just in four years.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.590
KRISHFIELD: Huge.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.950
THOMPSON: A build up Proshutinsky finds alarming.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.940
PROTUSHINSKY: Ocean accumulates fresh water
and releases, accumulates and releases. But

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.600
if it is unbalanced, it's possible that too
much fresh water will be released. And in

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.060
this case, we can have some dramatic changes
in climate.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.980
THOMPSON: Is the Arctic Ocean out of balance?

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.920
PROSHUTINSKY: Right now, it's at a very unstable
situation.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.810
THOMPSON: Scientists admit they don't understand
everything about the impact that Arctic fresh

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.040
water could have on global climate. But they
do know that how the ocean responds to the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.130
threat of climate change will depend on the
delicate balance of air, sea and ice at the

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.280
top of the world.
