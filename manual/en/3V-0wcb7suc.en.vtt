00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:08.429
Now practical application, that's what's going
to be the turning point for your experimenting.

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.820
Learning how to use the fundamentals that
I'm showing you in a way that you can remember

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.410
that's going to be helpful, or have a point
basically to your practicing. So instead of

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.820
just using the one five progression, we're
going to use two, five, one. It's going to

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.269
get a little bit more complicated for those
who are just learning. Those who are experienced

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.820
are maybe playing something just a little
bit off. I'm going to show you how to do it

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.640
in the key of B flat, two, five, one progression.
And creating the gospel bounce feel. So here

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.080
we are, and what I'm going to do is, on the
two, I'm going to use the tri-tones of two

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:53.640
and use the gospel bounce feel on the five
and come back to one. So here it is, using

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:10.910
my right hand just to calm, just to keep space
here

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:22.720
with my right. So what I was doing here with
my left hand, at B flat, from the six, five

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:31.890
and seven, five, six and flat seven. Went
to two of B flat, one two, I'm falling into

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:47.301
three of seven of two, went to five which
is F. Came back to the one. So when you play

00:01:47.301 --> 00:02:06.140
it all together. You know that spans across
a couple of different styles of music, whether

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.700
it be blues, gospel, or some sorts of old
school rock, Elvis style you know? Just whatever

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.970
style you're going to be playing in, just
make it your own and have fun with it.
