Atention:
This video has spoilers

00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.316
watch only the 
parte you have played.

00:00:05.377 --> 00:00:07.687
Configure the 
subtitles on youtube options

00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:21.915
Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman.

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:24.680
Rise and shine

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.930
Not that I 
wish to imply you have 
been sleeping on the job

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.452
No one is more
deserving of a rest.

00:00:34.582 --> 00:00:39.632
And all the effort
in the world would
have gone to waste until...

00:00:41.142 --> 00:00:46.192
well, let's just say
your hour has come again

00:00:52.923 --> 00:00:59.163
The right man in the
wrong place can make all
the difference in the world

00:01:00.323 --> 00:01:03.334
So, wake up, Mr. Freeman.

00:01:04.554 --> 00:01:07.645
Wake up and smell the ashes

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.252
No

00:01:18.082 --> 00:01:19.232
You need me!

00:01:23.974 --> 00:01:24.564
You did it!

00:01:26.382 --> 00:01:27.352
Come on Gordon

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.032
We've got to get out of here.

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:30.482
Maybe we still have...

00:01:35.652 --> 00:01:37.943
Time, Dr.Freeman?

00:01:41.563 --> 00:01:45.023
Is it really that time again?

00:01:45.963 --> 00:01:49.093
It seems as if
you only just arrived.

00:01:50.323 --> 00:01:55.294
You've done a great
deal in a small timespan

00:01:56.144 --> 00:01:58.524
You've done so
well, in fact that

00:01:58.604 --> 00:02:03.084
I've received
some interesting
offers for your services

00:02:03.794 --> 00:02:06.774
Ordinarily, i wouldn't
contemplate them, but

00:02:07.244 --> 00:02:10.255
These are extrordinary times

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:16.275
Rather than offer you
the illusion of free choice

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:20.485
I will take the
liberty of choosing for you

00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:26.125
If and when you
time comes round again

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.104
I do apologize for
what must seem to you
an arbitrary imposition

00:02:33.416 --> 00:02:34.446
Dr. Freeman

00:02:35.506 --> 00:02:40.046
I trust it will all make
sense to you in the course of

00:02:40.746 --> 00:02:41.527
well

00:02:41.847 --> 00:02:43.257
I'm really not

00:02:43.407 --> 00:02:45.058
at liberty to say

00:02:46.308 --> 00:02:47.708
In the meantime...

00:02:48.498 --> 00:02:50.198
This is where I get off.

00:03:12.102 --> 00:03:13.102
Tell me, Dr.Freeman

00:03:13.172 --> 00:03:13.802
if you can

00:03:14.392 --> 00:03:16.192
You have destroyed so much

00:03:16.683 --> 00:03:17.903
What is it, exactly

00:03:17.903 --> 00:03:19.233
that you have created?

00:03:20.394 --> 00:03:21.734
Can you name even one thing?

00:03:23.397 --> 00:03:24.627
I thought not

00:04:27.186 --> 00:04:30.287
We'll see about that

00:04:37.988 --> 00:04:39.488
behold!

00:04:39.798 --> 00:04:41.448
The extract!

00:04:41.528 --> 00:04:42.318
Ah, yes!

00:04:42.398 --> 00:04:44.519
Miraculous secretion!

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:45.539
Make haste!

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.520
Join now as
we imbibe the extract

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.080
A human is needed

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.120
Agreed!

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.010
Join us, Freeman!

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:02.709
We weave

00:05:02.905 --> 00:05:05.665
the Freeman's life with hers

00:05:06.412 --> 00:05:07.242
Yes

00:05:07.592 --> 00:05:08.962
There is a quickening

00:05:09.862 --> 00:05:10.952
Almost vortal

00:05:11.052 --> 00:05:12.932
this bond between you

00:05:30.048 --> 00:05:32.678
Doctor Freeman

00:05:34.318 --> 00:05:37.909
I realize this
moment may not be the most

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:40.499
Convenient for
a heart-to-heart

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.229
But i had to
wait until your friends

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:48.359
Were otherwise occupied

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.301
There was a time they
cared nothing for Miss Vance

00:05:55.961 --> 00:06:01.271
When their only experience
of humanity was a crowbar

00:06:01.601 --> 00:06:05.241
coming at them
down a steel corridor

00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:12.263
When i plucked
her from Black Mesa

00:06:13.584 --> 00:06:16.985
I acted in the
face of objections that

00:06:17.065 --> 00:06:21.825
she was a mere child and
of no practical use to anyone

00:06:22.885 --> 00:06:26.989
I have learned to
ignore such naysayers

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:33.141
when quelling them
was out of the question.

00:06:35.671 --> 00:06:41.383
Still, I am not one
to squander my investments

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.223
and i remain
confident she was worth
far more than the initial

00:06:46.633 --> 00:06:47.453
appraisal

00:06:48.513 --> 00:06:50.625
That's why i must now

00:06:50.816 --> 00:06:52.436
extract

00:06:52.876 --> 00:06:53.886
From you

00:06:54.026 --> 00:06:57.226
some small repayment owed

00:06:57.316 --> 00:06:59.447
for you own survival

00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:04.080
See her safely to White Forest

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.331
Doctor Freeman

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.940
I wish i could do
more than keep an eye on you

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.900
but i have
agreed to abide by certain

00:07:14.487 --> 00:07:16.417
restrictions

00:07:18.787 --> 00:07:19.587
well

00:07:19.867 --> 00:07:21.008
now

00:07:21.388 --> 00:07:23.028
Listen carefully my dear

00:07:23.998 --> 00:07:27.428
when you see your father

00:07:29.247 --> 00:07:31.427
relay these words

00:07:32.317 --> 00:07:37.618
prepare
for unforeseen consequences
