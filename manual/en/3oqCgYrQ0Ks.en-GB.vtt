00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We'd like to wish you good luck, and wear
the rose with pride.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.100
That's it. Come on in.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.000
Are you ready to test yourself against the
best?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I can't hear you. Are you ready?! Are you ready?!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.330
I have come down to Twickenham to train with
the England rugby team. No, I'm not joking.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.820
And yes, I hear you. She can't catch a ball
for sugar. So luckily today, it's all going

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.500
to be virtual.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.500
You've seen them tackle.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.900
Blast through defences.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.800
Now for the first time ever, O2 lets you train
with the England rugby team.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.000
Let's see what you can do.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Oh my God. That is so weird.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.800
Haha!

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.000
-Tackle.
-Ow!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Catch.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.000
Train.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.500
Drive.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.500
O2 and the revolutionary Oculus Rift technology
take you into the heart of the England rugby team.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.000
It's brilliant having you on board. This will
make sure you deliver.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It's so weird!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.200
That is the weirdest thing I have ever witnessed.
Out of this world.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.300
It's quite cool though, isn't it? To actually see
what our training sessions look like, and

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.000
you're kind of dodging out of the way and
stuff like that, so it's good.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And is that what a real England training session
is like?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.800
Very similar. We're not normally in a kit.
We're in kind of a blue kit, but I think that's

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.300
trying to give it a kind of match scenario.
But yeah, you've got big people running at

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.000
you trying to avoid and kick the ball and
stuff, so it's great for the fans to see it

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.400
and be involved in the game.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.000
Totally. The one thing I really love about
the game is you can't fail.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
-Yeah.
-You can't drop the ball.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.600
You don't actually have to catch it, no. Which
is quite nice. Yeah, it's a game for everyone,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.000
which is exciting.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.600
Exactly. I even think my granny is going to
be quite into this.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.700
Yeah, hopefully, unless she thinks someone
is going to attack her from behind or something

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.300
like that.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.300
So what is the best thing about being an England
rugby player?

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.000
Getting to play here, really. In front of
80,000 people. It's pretty exciting to run out.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.200
And what would you say is the toughest thing?

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.600
Probably facing some of the big opposition.
Yeah, you get some pretty big guys, especially

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.000
like the Samoans and stuff coming at you.
It's always insightful.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.200
Do you have a kind of a ritual you do before a
match? So, do you have a pair of lucky socks?

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.700
I like to have a spaghetti bolognese the night
before a game, so that's probably my one I have here.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.730
So is there a rule, because you hear these
kind of rumours, that you can't see your girlfriend

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.000
kind of three days before a match, so nobody
gets distracted? Is that just rumours?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.800
That is rumours, yeah. The girlfriends are
allowed to stay in the hotel the night before

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.000
and the night after a game.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000
If you could invite a celebrity to come and
train with you guys, who would it be and why?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Matt Damon. I'll say Matt Damon because he
was in Invictus, so I'd like to see what he's

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
actually like there on the pitch.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
If you could invite a girl to come and train
with you guys, who would it be?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.200
Um... Who wouldn't get me in any trouble with?
Who would I invite? Do you want to be invited,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.000
do you? Is that what you're asking for? Is
that the gag?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.800
No, I'm not just asking for an invitation.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.700
I hear Penelope Cruz was here watching last
game, so I'll say her.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.100
Well, thank you very much for your time. We've
had a great day training with you guys, and

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.200
um next week? Potentially be here?

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.000
Do you think you're ready for the next game
that will be up against Wales? Will you be

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
picked for the team?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.600
You know, I think I'm going to be picked for
the team, if I'm being honest. I do. I think

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.600
my skills are good enough that, you know...

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.000
We've just had it in. You're not picked for
the team. Thank you for talking to us.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.300
-I can be the tour mascot.
-Yup, perfect.
