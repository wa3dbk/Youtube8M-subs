00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.110
In this clip we're going to talk about the
proper way to remove and replace an electronic

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.110
cooling fan. In this step we're going to talk
about the proper service procedure for removing

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.110
our mounting bolts from the electronic cooling
fan to the radiator. What I have here is a

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:25.430
ten millimeter socket, and my three eighths
drive ratchet, aim right down here. Right

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.890
there is a mounting bolt. Most electronic
cooling fans have four of them. They're lefty

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.280
loosey, righty tighty, you want to be careful
when removing and installing them because

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.070
they do screw into the plastic of the radiator.
We're going to continue unscrewing it with

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.930
our ratchet, the upper ones are always a piece
of cake to get at once you have the necessary

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.789
components out of the way. However, the lower
bolts may be a little more difficult, just

00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:00.800
due to the room constraints inherent in a
front wheel drive vehicle. Once you got a

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.799
finger tight, go ahead and remove the mounting
bolt and place it in your magnetic tray for

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.869
later re-installation. Now down here is one
of the lower bolts you can go ahead and begin

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:20.670
removing it. It may be necessary to get access
to this bolt from the underneath, on most

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.420
vehicles if you have the right tool set up
you can get at it from the top. We're going

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.319
to continue unscrewing the bolt until it's
finger tight, and then continue unscrewing

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:38.770
it by hand and remove it. You're going to
want to put the finishing touches on it by

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.409
hand, just to make sure that you don't drop
the bolt. There are a lot of cracks and crevices

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.399
on the vehicle that a bolt can hide in, and
you don't want to have to run to the hardware

00:01:51.399 --> 00:02:09.009
store or walk to get a replacement bolt. Alright,
and there's the lower one. You're going to

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.079
have two more on the other side of your electronic
cooling fan. You're going to want to go ahead

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:20.629
and repeat that procedure for the bolts on
the other side. That is the proper way to

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.829
remove the electronic cooling fan mounting
bolts.
