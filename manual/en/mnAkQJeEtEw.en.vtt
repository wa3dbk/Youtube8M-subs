00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.290
My name's Anna Lau, we are in the clinical
microbiology lab at the National Institutes

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.779
of Healths, we're in the clinical center,
this is the hospital of the NIH where all

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.680
the patients come do their research protocols.
And then we run the microbiology labs. They're

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.660
looking for infections diseases, agents and
ways that we can help treat these patients.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.059
We see a lot of bacterial diseases, infections,
we see a lot of fungal infections, so they're

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:53.789
the two main ones that I focus on. I was born
in Sidney, grew up in Sidney, went to college

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.420
in Sidney, studied premed, and then in my
second and third year I took a class of microbiology

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.890
and infections diseases and just fell in love
with it. And then from there I did nine months

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.040
of just intense research in a hospital in
Sidney. So you got to see, like the work that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.400
you were doing and impact. And then I came
over here for my fellowship and then I've

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.550
been offered a position to stay. Okie dokie.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.850
[Speaker 2:] All right so we will do that
and get it to you.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.210
[Speaker 1:] Perfect.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.690
[Speaker 2:] Thank you!

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.180
[Speaker 1:] You're welcome! So I take consults
during the day from the technologists and

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.190
so this is where I prepare my micro rounds
for the infectious diseases staff and clinicians.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.700
[Speaker 3:] They're from micro-bacteria,
they wanna know if it can wait till Thursday

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.600
because they're behind.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.650
[Speaker 1:] No, it cannot.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.550
[Speaker 3:] 'Cause I have it right here.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:49.090
[Speaker 1:] We can do that. Thank you. Top
left, I'm impressed that you guys know where

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.460
it is without marking it.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.560
[Speaker 3:] It's because-

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.400
[Speaker 1:] I see, I see.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.910
[Speaker 3:] we got here earlier.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.240
[Speaker 1:] Perfect. All right, thank you
very much. Hey Melissa, okay this looks odd.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.240
[Speaker 4:] So, I got four sets of blood
culture bottles so they labeled them all four

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.470
with-

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.500
Speaker 1: Same labels.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.440
[Speaker 4:] Different sites.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.659
[Speaker 1:] Oh, I think I know about this
culture. Thank you very much! Okay! You know

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:20.040
we're in an era now of multi-drug resistant
organisms so these are bacteria, fungi, viruses,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.409
that the antibiotics that we have no in the
world aren't big enough to combat them. One

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.769
of the ones that happened here in the clinical
center in 2011 was, it was a bacterial outbreak

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:37.959
called Klebsiella Pneumoniae, so this particular
bug carried this enzyme called KPC that basically

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.430
ate up all the antibiotics that the patients
were being given. So no matter what you do

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.189
to treat these patients they're are no antibiotics
that are effective. We're looking into rapid

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:54.030
detection for these bad types of bacteria
and early detection of potential outbreak.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.370
This for the mold database that I built. So
we're just gonna take a little bit of this,

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.099
put it into this tube that contains like beads
of ethanol, and then we're just gonna extract

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:17.159
the proteins out of it. So we're just gonna
pick up a little bit of the mold. And we wanna

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.579
take it from the edge, 'cause that's like
the youngest part, and that's where we're

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:27.779
gonna find the most abundant proteins. Let's
kind of pick it off and stick it into the

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:44.870
tube and then just mush it up. All right,
let's find a plate. So that yellow stuff that

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.150
I just dropped off were the old proteins from
the run before. So we have a clean plate.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:59.069
We extracted it, which takes about 20 minutes
or so. So here it is, that's the extracted

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.529
protein in there, and there's the squished
up mold that's in there. In the solution,

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:07.340
that's where all the proteins are. So what
we're gonna do is just take one micro-liter,

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.019
it's just like that much-

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:09.279
[Speaker 5:] Right.

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:13.450
[Speaker 1:] In volume, it's hardly anything.
And then I'm gonna spot it directly onto this

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:22.389
plate. In here going up this tube is the big
vacuum, so it's really, really powerful vacuum

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.000
that the proteins are just gonna fly through
to give you your finger print. And on the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.949
top there's a detector. And then there's a
massive, powerful laser that will hit the

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.580
proteins that are spotted onto that plate
and then make them fly through the vacuum.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.699
We're gonna put our new one in, and then close
that up. And stick it back in, and I'm gonna

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:50.740
set up the program. Here's our target plate
that we just put in, so if I scroll over there

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.180
so you can see that the camera is going to
pass over two, three. And this is our protein

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.639
that we just spotted on with the yellow crystals
on top. We know that there are like lookalike

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:06.669
molds, so they masquerade around like, see,
see the lasers hitting the protein and it's

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:07.789
giving us this spectrum.

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:08.229
[Speaker 5]: Wow.

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.080
[Speaker 1:] That's being collected. The light
blue line on top, that's the sum of all the

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.150
finger prints it's collecting, and then the
little one on the bottom that's moving, that's

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.780
the current hit. Every time it hits it's gathering
50 good spectra, and it's gonna at itself

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.310
up so a thousand good fingerprints, and then
it'll move on to the next spot. We run it

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.419
against the entire database so, and the mold
one is the one that I developed. And then

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.319
we're gonna highlight these guys and hit play,
and hopefully it'll give us a good ID. So

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:44.460
here's our results, and it's listing you the
top 10. Green means it scored greater than

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.909
two, three is the maximum. And then following
that we have these guys that are scoring in

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.979
the yellow range, and they're pretty good
but they're not as good as greater than two.

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:57.349
And then anything that's red means that it
was a poor identification. And all the green

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:03.169
peaks here showing you where there's an exact
match in the database. And so that's how we

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:08.479
do identification now. Literally within a
few minutes. You know in the clinical micro

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:13.919
world especially where we are at NIH, we have
a lot of close interactions with not just

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.539
the micro people. We have the infectious diseases
staff that come down here to tell us about

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:23.970
the patients. We have hospital epidemiology
who's worried about potential outbreaks, and

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.439
so whenever there's a bad bug they're down
here asking more questions. Is it related

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:33.460
to this bug that we saw last week, and so
that's what get's me pumped up. To see that

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:39.370
you're really impacting the way that not just,
you know, a section works, or how a person

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.409
works. But as how a hospital works, and it's
really impacting patient care. Which is, you

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:49.280
know, the reason why we do this stuff. Get
out there, see what's out there, get hands

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.419
on experience if you can. Talk to as many
people as you can, the field is never ending,

00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:00.509
like it's always, always evolving, we're developing
new technologies to combat these diseases.

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:11.110
But I think that there are always room to
grow.
