00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:16.509
Teach your dog to jump up in front of you.

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.050
Practice multiple jumps. I need to teach jessie a hand signal so she can anticipate when the jump is coming.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.559
Unlike Lucy who does the cue almost as soon as it is given.

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:32.020
"You are a little frog!" Laughing.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.020
Practice until the dog is doing consistent height jumps and ideally, jumping at the same time as you.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.590
Getting comfortable with the rope. Throw a treat or use a hand signal to get the dog over the rope.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.290
Dog jumps over and returns under the rope.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.270
Hold it with two hands.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.510
Gently throw the rope towards the dog.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.510
Transition to the rope coming from behind the dog.     Putting them together.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.310
Good girl!

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.310
I rewarded her anyway since she showed no fear when the rope touched her.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.480
But I don't reward if there is no effort to jump.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.480
With sensitive dogs, it is important to avoid 'poisoning' the rope.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.910
Lucy has a natural knack for when to jump.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.370
She is worried about the rope at first though. Look at how high she tucks her back legs.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.930
I pretty sure she used my hands as the cue.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.259
It takes practice to develop your timing.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.259
Reward the dog if you goof up.

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:38.779
If your dog is at physically sensitive, reward her if the rope hits her.

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:45.129
Adding Number of Jumps in a Row

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.599
First holding the rope.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:53.930
Yay! Good girl!

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.790
Then using the rope.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.079
Two jumps

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.529
At first allow a delay between the jumps

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:03.719
Three jumps

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:15.319
Five jumps

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.609
Remember to throw in fewer jumps once in
awhile so the game does not always get more difficult.

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.069
Kind of the a snakes and ladders game where you slide back to the beginning.

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:35.479
Avoid doing too many jumps in a training session as it takes awhile to build up the muscles and may decrease the dog's enthusiasm.

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:45.669
Wait until the dog is at least eighteen
months old to train this to prevent joint damage.

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:48.559
Nine jumps!

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.769
Now speed the sequence of jumps starting back again with 2, then 3, 4, back to 2, and up to 5.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.819
You can see by my body language, I am compensating for a rope that is a little too short.

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.429
