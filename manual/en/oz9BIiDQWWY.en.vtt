00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.959
I know what it's like to not have any hope
out there, where everybody is telling you

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.789
that there is nothing else for you to do and
then get this treatment done whereby there

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.289
is the opportunity where something good can
happen for your child. It will help you, it

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.000
will not take anything away from you, so if
you're able to do it please do.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.220
We are from the United States and his condition
is benign congenital hypotonia, which is primarily

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.569
weak muscles, weak external muscles, which
prevents him from having the strength to walk

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:46.350
and do a lot of other activities that we're
used to.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.739
I noticed his condition when he was about
22 months old, primarily not being able to

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.399
meet his milestones of pretty much being able to walk.

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.649
I can't play most of the sports that most
kids do and I can't act like a regular kid.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.540
Most of the time they do pacers, which I can't
do or when I do, do them I'm really slow and

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.920
I feel sort of embarrassed by doing that and
I can't play kickball or any of the regular games 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.200
so it just doesn't feel very good.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.680
He has a neural muscular disease or a neurological
condition. I don't think the west has many

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.220
solutions to that.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.030
I feel very lucky to be here at Better Being
Hospital for the stem cell treatment because

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.570
I feel this hospital brings along with it
a lot of great things, whether it is the doctors,

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.980
whether it is the physical therapy, whether
it is the science behind the acupuncture,

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:58.980
it's just great. The people here, the staff
here, everybody here is just wonderful, like

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.160
Saif says, this is the only place here he
wants to be.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.790
My mom sometimes brings it up with how she
sees what's happened, and when I tell her

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.590
what it used to be like and what it is and
she says "No Way!" but where my leg used to

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.830
not even be able to get up like one or two
centimeters, but now it can go up one or two

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.740
inches or something.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.200
M: What about remember when you were able
to swim it was before you can swim for a very

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.280
little time and now you can swim for how long?
S: Yeah, my energy has just gone up the roof.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.851
M: Up the roof! For an hour, two hours he
can be in the pool. Before it was just 15

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.540
minutes or so and he would fatigue, but fatigue
has just flown out of the window now!

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.320
M: So what is the best part of your treatment?
Is it the aqua-therapy? The swimming?

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:15.200
S: My favorite is the ending where basically
you leave and then once you're done, you see

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:22.099
the changes, my favorite is the change that
happens after the treatment.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:32.280
What I say is that for stem cell treatment,
kids may feel like they're getting really hurt

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:40.500
But once the pain feels like it's not going
to end, but after a while it feels regular.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.350
Sometime you think that it took something
away from you, but really, it just took it

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.410
away and gave you something better and something
new.
