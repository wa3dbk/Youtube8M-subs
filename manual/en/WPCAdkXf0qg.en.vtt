00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.609
I am making this video today. To explain to the world something
that

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:13.900
has been 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.759
given attention

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:17.699
by many men throughout history

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.009
it's the number

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.000
six six six

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.350
it's the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.769
number of the wild beast

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.689
the number of its name

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.529
it has in fact

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.890
been calculated

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.890
by a very wise and righteous man

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.610
named Sas Gavril

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.830
who lives in romania

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.890
and so

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.959
my intent

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:41.410
is to explain to the western world

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.700
that this calculation has been

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.410
completed

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.960
and understood

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.810
and so, hopefully by the time you reach the end of this video

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.730
you will understand that

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.960
all those things

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.600
the doom sayers have been saying

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.049
for centuries are

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:01.130
starting to reach their conclusion

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.050
and that we are in fact

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.550
living in that history which
the bible calls

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.190
the time of the end

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.640
so here is the explanation

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.620
perhaps the first thing
that we should do is help everyone

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.789
understand that very famous scripture

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.570
that describes  the number six six six

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.600
it can be found in the bible

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.240
every bible

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.620
and in the book of revelation

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.700
chapter

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.280
thirteen

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.160
and I am going to start in verse 16

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.520
so get your own bible and read along with me

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.250
in verse 16 it starts

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.189
and it puts under compulsion all persons

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.790
the small and the great

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.759
and the rich

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:44.640
and the poor

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.159
and the free and the slaves

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.270
that they should give these a mark in their right
hand

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.840
or on the forehead

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.479
and that nobody might be able to buy or sell
except the person having the mark

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.659
the name of the wild beast

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.800
or the number

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.369
of its name

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.640
here is where wisdom comes in

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.140
let the one that has intelligence calculate
the number of the wild beast

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.259
for it is

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.639
a man's number and its number

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.829
is six hundred

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.149
and sixty six

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:18.829
so there it is, a very famous scripture
which has caused

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.799
a great deal of controversy and curiosity

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.899
throughout

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:25.159
it's history

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.509
almost two thousand years of history since being
written in the bible

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:30.249
so, now

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.579
we should talk about

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.119
where to start

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:35.439
understanding

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.799
how to calculate this number, you are probably very familiar
with a famous prayer that Christians say

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.729
almost every day

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.209
it is called the lord's prayer

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.969
or the daily prayer

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:51.679
and in this lord's prayer, Jesus
instructs us how we should pray

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:54.849
and so one of the first things that

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.689
Jesus tells us to pray for

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:58.179
is that we should keep

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:00.290
God's name holy

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.899
so here we have names

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:04.879
names are very important

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.599
what Jesus says is "holy be thy name"

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.010
Let your kingdom come

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.779
so

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:14.970
hopefully Christians also understand

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.529
that

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.829
in Jesus Christs baptismal commandment

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.430
which is at the end of the last chapter of
of Matthew

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.339
Matthew Chapter 28

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:26.400
and in that commandment, Jesus Christ's law

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.139
he says we should

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.429
baptize people

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:33.109
in the name of the father

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.209
and of the son

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.769
and of the Holy Spirit

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.260
so now we have

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.260
two other names

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.769
that a very

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.459
very important

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.189
so we know we are looking for a name

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.179
the name of the wild beast

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:51.499
so, we already know that there is two names in the baptismal commandment

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:53.129
one is Jesus Christ

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.319
and the other is the name of the Father

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.650
to further understand the importance of names

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.889
in the bible. I would ask you to consider

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.139
the lord's prayer

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.129
and what Jesus said

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.459
about keeping God's name holy

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.459
So, if Jesus is concerned

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.959
about God's name staying holy

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.319
then what is he really concerned about

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:17.669
that concern is that

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.669
there might be people

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.379
who would defame, 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:22.759
blaspheme,

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.569
or use God's actual name

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.199
in a way which would

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.490
bring disrespect to God

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.270
so one of the most important things

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.640
then for christians to know

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.929
so he doesn't make a mistake

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:40.050
Is God's

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.729
actual name!

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.120
so it's interesting that most people do not

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.020
realize what God's name is

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.419
so

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.300
because we're looking for a name, the name of the
wild beast

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.389
it would be a good thing to understand

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:54.639
first of all

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.349
what God's name is

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.199
So here it is

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.759
Jehovah

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.959
now you know

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:07.759
If you are not convinced then I suggest that you pick up the bible

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.759
preferably an older bible

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.930
and go to Psalm 83

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.130
and read it in its entirety, in the last verses
of Psalm 83

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.580
you will find God's name

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.939
if you do not find it there and it just says lord

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.199
the actual name has been removed

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.239
and that's something that's just happened
in recent editions

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:29.090
get an old copy of a Kings James bible

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.370
and look for God's name

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.270
what we are really interested in
is

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.049
a wild beast

00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:36.779
so

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:39.719
if a beast has gone wild then what was it before

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:40.449
it was

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.419
a domestic beast

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.110
a good beast

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.889
so

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.720
the actual bible

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.870
it's main theme

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.469
is about

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:53.529
God's Kingdom, the arrival of his Kingdom

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:58.439
and Jesus Christ in the Gospels
said that his kingdom

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:59.909
would be undermined

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.129
by Satan

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:03.720
that it would be sown

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.289
with Satan's seed

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:06.800
and these would grow into weeds

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.029
that would grow along with the seed that Jesus
Christ had sown

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:12.599
his Saints

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.270
so

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.789
.

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:19.819
in God's actual kingdom then

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:22.139
if it goes wild

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:23.849
could it be a wild beast

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:26.519
and would this wild east defame

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:29.139
God's actual name!

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.009
interesting to think about

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:32.889
so even in

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:36.050
the modern world names are very important

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.839
the name of a company

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:39.850
the name of a product

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.990
it's all given a great deal of importance

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.759
in this commercial world that we live in

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:47.500
so

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.619
if God's kingdom is on this earth

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:52.610
at the present time

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.439
would it have a name

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:57.669
and what would it be called?

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:02.079
something that we should be very carefully
watching for then is

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:03.729
people

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:05.509
who are using God's name

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:08.199
and so if God's name is Jehovah

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:10.679
that immediatly brings everyone's attention

00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:12.699
around the entire world

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.549
Jehovah's Witnesses

00:07:14.549 --> 00:07:16.129
so

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:17.999
could it actually be true that

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:20.719
Jehovah's Witnesses are blaspheming or

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:23.360
undermining, disrespecting God's actual name?

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.800
Jehovah     (see part 2)
