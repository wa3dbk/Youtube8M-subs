00:00:01.095 --> 00:00:03.080
I was inspired to write the book thief

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.053
Because of just memories of sitting in my kitchen when I was a kid.

00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:09.090
Hearing stories my parents told me.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.083
And it was like we were all glued to our seats.

00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:17.069
Hearing stories of bombings and getting up out of the ground

00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:20.050
Out of the bomb shelters in Munich and in Austria.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.080
There was one day when my mother heard a noise.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.013
She was six years old.

00:00:24.013 --> 00:00:27.013
And she heard this noise from the Main Street.

00:00:27.013 --> 00:00:28.053
And she ran with the other kids.

00:00:28.053 --> 00:00:31.003
And they thought it would be cattle coming down the Main Street.

00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:32.063
Of this village where she lived.

00:00:32.063 --> 00:00:34.026
But it wasn't cattle, it was people.

00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:36.050
And there was an old man who couldn't keep up.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.083
He was staggering over the road.

00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:42.030
And it was a teenage boy who went into his house,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.096
Got a piece of bread and gave it to this man.

00:00:45.096 --> 00:00:48.000
Who fell to his hands and knees,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.083
Grabbed him by the feet, or grabbed him by the ankles.

00:00:52.083 --> 00:00:55.012
And cried into his feet thanking him.

00:00:55.012 --> 00:00:56.046
And then a soldier came.

00:00:56.046 --> 00:00:58.046
Ripped the bread away.

00:00:58.046 --> 00:01:01.062
And whipped the old man for taking it.

00:01:01.062 --> 00:01:04.013
And then chased the boy, beat him to the ground,

00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:06.043
And whipped him for giving him the bread.

00:01:06.043 --> 00:01:09.083
And it was that story that really inspired the book.

00:01:09.083 --> 00:01:13.004
I think because on one hand you've got pure beauty.

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:14.095
Which is the boy giving the bread.

00:01:14.095 --> 00:01:17.020
And on the other you've got pure destruction.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.096
Which is the soldier doing what he did.

00:01:19.096 --> 00:01:21.070
And you bring those two things together.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.053
And you've got humans.

00:01:23.053 --> 00:01:25.059
And what we're capable of.

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:27.063
And so I heard stories like that.

00:01:27.063 --> 00:01:30.046
Stories of my dad not wanting to go to Hitler Youth.

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:33.083
And people who didn't want to hang their flags in their windows.

00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:36.096
And I thought, I'm going to write about those people.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:39.079
I wanted to write a 100 page novella.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.059
And it just turned into a book.

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:43.020
Ya know, I got a bit carried away.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.046
And it turned into a book.

00:01:45.046 --> 00:01:48.029
That was a bit longer and a

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:52.023
And a book that just now means everything to me.

00:01:52.023 --> 00:01:54.076
I decided to use Death as the narrator of the book.

00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:56.079
Purely because there's that expression

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:59.043
That war and death are like best friends.

00:01:59.043 --> 00:02:02.090
So I thought who better to tell the story set in Nazi Germany.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.086
Because death was everywhere at that time and place.

00:02:05.086 --> 00:02:10.023
And I thought well what's the opposite of this all powerful death.

00:02:10.023 --> 00:02:12.069
I thought vulnerable death.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.040
What if Death was afraid of us?

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.013
What if Death was haunted by humans?

00:02:17.013 --> 00:02:18.063
And that was the big question.

00:02:18.063 --> 00:02:19.086
That was the breakthrough.

00:02:19.086 --> 00:02:22.009
Because I thought not only is it unexpected.

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.096
It makes sense as well.

00:02:23.096 --> 00:02:26.000
Because Death is on hand to see.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.090
All of the terrible things humans do to each other.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.009
And I realized what the book was about at that point.

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:35.096
And it was about trying to find beautiful moments in an ugly time.

00:02:35.096 --> 00:02:38.003
Probably the most asked question about the book.

00:02:38.003 --> 00:02:41.009
When it comes to where should this sit on the book shelf.

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.016
Is is this a young adult book or is it an adult book?

00:02:44.016 --> 00:02:47.097
I just think well I didn't sit down to write

00:02:47.097 --> 00:02:49.093
A good young adult book or good adult book.

00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:52.086
I really tried to write someone's favorite book.

00:02:52.086 --> 00:02:56.030
The other thing to remember is I thought nobody would read the book.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.019
Ya know,  a 500 page book set in Nazi Germany,

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.079
The narrator's Death.

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.043
You think, how do you recommend that to your friends.

00:03:03.043 --> 00:03:05.006
I thought no one's going to read this.

00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:07.063
I thought well I might as well do this exactly how I want to do it.

00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:10.003
And follow my own vision for the book.

00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:12.063
And write in exactly the style I want.

00:03:12.063 --> 00:03:14.023
That's when it really took off.

00:03:14.023 --> 00:03:16.062
So I think half of writing a book

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:19.045
Is just forgetting that there's even a world

00:03:19.045 --> 00:03:21.063
That exists beyond the book.

00:03:21.063 --> 00:03:23.019
To be a writer I think

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.086
Has nothing to do with being published in a lot of ways.

00:03:26.086 --> 00:03:30.059
If a ray of light came out of the sky

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:31.083
And said to me

00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:35.036
Alright, your next book will never see the light of day.

00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:36.059
It won't be published

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:38.023
You won't be paid a cent.

00:03:38.023 --> 00:03:41.003
Nobody will ever read it.

00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:43.050
And the question is would I still write the book?

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.073
And the answer is definitely yes

00:03:45.073 --> 00:03:47.097
And that's what makes me write my next book.

00:03:47.097 --> 00:03:49.050
Knowing that that is true.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.080
For me writing should be fun

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.079
And it should be, should be like you can play with words.

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.062
And I think that's what I like most about writing.

00:03:59.062 --> 00:04:01.043
Is just playing with words.

00:04:01.043 --> 00:04:05.086
And getting a sense that an author is enjoying writing.

00:04:05.086 --> 00:04:07.050
And just having fun with it.

00:04:07.050 --> 99:59:59.000
And playing a little bit as well.
