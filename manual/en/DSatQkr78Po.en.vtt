00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:08.759
Two, one. We have ignition and liftoff of
a Delta two rocket and Wise, searching for

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.460
stars and galaxies never seen before.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.920
Where Wise is really going to pay off is in
measuring the infrared radiation from asteroids,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:31.480
whereas previous studies of asteroids have
primarily only been in reflected light. And

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.160
with that we can know big these asteroids
are, some of which are potentially hazardous

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.050
to the Earth. So the ones that are in orbits
close to the Earth's orbit could in the future

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.680
hit us.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.730
In visible light, an object that is small
and shiny reflects the same amount of sunlight

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.321
as an asteroid that is big and dark. But when
we look with an infrared telescope we are

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:58.290
seeing heat that's emitted from more sides
of the asteroid, so we get a much better,

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.500
true measurement of the object's size. And
this is important because it allows us to

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.820
tell whether or not we're dealing with an
object that's this big or an object that's

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.830
this big.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.220
This movie shows us a bird's eye view of all
the asteroids and comets observed by the NeoWise

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.370
project from the start of the survey in January
2010 until mid-September. The planets in our

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.640
solar system are shown in blue dots and their
orbits are shown in the dashed lines. The

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.210
green dots show the known Near Earth Objects,
both asteroids and comets, that NeoWise has

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.890
spotted so far. That includes new near Earth
objects that we've discovered, and these are

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.780
the red dots.
