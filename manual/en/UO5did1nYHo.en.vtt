00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:07.620
O.k. now I'll show you how to apply the side
panel. We have our Velcro closure panel which

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.940
is going to be fitted on the bottom; I'll
lay it here, on the bottom of our cushion

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.280
cover. Now this one I'm not going to have
wrap around because of the shape of the pillow,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.570
and because the pillow's very soft; the, the
pillows on the back portion of the couch are

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.369
very soft and they'll be much easier to put
in. So I'm only making the Velcro run along

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:43.460
the bottom and not up the sides at all. So
what you'll do first is you want to sew your;

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:54.109
your regular side panels to the, the Velcro
panel and you do that by placing the two pieces

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:00.309
together; right sides together. And we'll
sew a 5/8 seam allowance to join those two

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:08.420
pieces. O.k., we're going to sew the Velcro
panel is very thick here because you got two

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.030
layers of Velcro and several layers of fabric.
So when you come to that portion, you want

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:23.570
to be very careful and go very slowly so that
you don't break any needles; and you can move

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:32.130
the hand wheel by hand to get over this large
section if you feel like your machine is having

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:47.990
difficulty getting over it. Next we'll apply
that, the side section to the bottom; we'll

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:57.409
start at the bottom of our cushion. So I have
my Velcro panel with the side panel attached

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:05.609
to it and I'm going to start right at the
corner and you'll sew with a zipper foot to

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:15.810
accommodate the piping that we have and start
5/8 of an inch from the end so that you have

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.540
room to go around the corner later, o.k. And
when you get to the corner, go right; right

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.280
to the corner, feel for that; that piping
and kind of push it out of the way, put your

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.650
needle in and lift the foot; pivot the fabric.
Now it's a little bulky because of the Velcro,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.730
just push that out of the way and make sure
that everything is nice and flat on the bottom

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:57.700
here. Now if you want to make it a little
easier, we can take it off and just snip right

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:08.340
at the corner just about a 1/2 inch. And that
will help the fabric bend around the corner.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:21.370
We'll place it back on; feel for the, feeling
for the piping and checking to see that, that

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:32.150
this the fabric; the, the side panel is lined
up with the edge of the top panel. When ever

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.880
you go on and off you want to make sure you
do a few back and forth stitches to secure

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:44.420
and knot that. You want to continue all the
way around and go around the next corner in

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.099
the same way.
