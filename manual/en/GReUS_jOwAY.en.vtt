Hi everyone, Scott Lewis here for Wirefly.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.600
Today, I'm here to unbox the Samsung Galaxy
Note 3 for Verizon.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.130
I understand that the Note 3 has been out
for awhile but I actually got one in for some

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.680
different smackdown review videos so I thought
it would be a good time to do a quick unboxing

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.050
video.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.010
Just looking at the outside of the box, it's
very much like the Galaxy S4 mini that we

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:32.300
just unboxed a couple of minutes ago but this
is the Note 3, quite a bit larger.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.190
Take the top off and there's the Note 3.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.090
Inside the box here I'm going to guess is
pretty similar to the S4 mini that we had,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.860
which is the instruction manuals.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:59.530
Quite a large thick sync cable.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.040
This is for the Galaxy Note 3.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.180
We have the charge block.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.260
We have the battery, now the battery in the
Note 3 is going to be a 3200mah battery, it

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.210
is a very large battery but it's a very large
phone, it definitely needs a lot of battery

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.160
to make it run.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.310
It looks like a little puller, not sure what
this is for.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.000
I'll try and find out and leave it in the
description of the video but it looks like

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.400
it comes with some pins and a puller maybe
it's to take out the SIM card or something

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.400
there.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.470
Maybe as we dig into the phone we'll find
out what that's for.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.700
All right I wanted to zoom in a little bit
closer so you can get a little better look.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.700
Let's go ahead and pull the back cover off
and we'll put the battery in the Note 3.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.260
Right here you can see the Micro SIM card
and then right on top is where you put the

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.720
Micro SD card so it's kind of layered in there.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.480
I can see the S pen once again sticking out
a little bit and the camera.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.450
The camera on the Note 3, the primary camera
is going to be 13 megapixel primary camera

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.450
that's a very good camera so if you're looking
for a good camera in a smartphone, the Galaxy

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.250
Note 3 is fantastic as well as the S4, the
S4 mini, all of the Galaxy line of phones,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.950
the new additions have great cameras.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.590
I'm just going to pull the screen protector
off here.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.400
Navigating the Note3 is just like any of the
other Samsung Galaxy phones.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.510
We have the two virtual buttons with the home
button, the real button in the middle.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.750
Up on top is the 3.5 mm headphone jack, power
and sleet button on the right hand side here

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.450
and then you volume up and down on the rocker
switch on the left.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.980
The bottom is that unique charge port for
the Note 3.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.790
We went through the setup process with the
Samsung Galaxy Note 3.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.880
I wanted to make sure I showed you the home
screen, while it was all starting up and loading

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.540
everything and updating everything I took
a minute to Google essentially what this is

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.791
and it's actually a replacement tip puller
and replacement tips for the S pen so if you

00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:16.010
break your tip on your S pen, they do give
you it looks like four different or four new

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.920
tips plus the puller.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.910
That's what the tweezers are for.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.050
Now just to compare the Galaxy Note 3 with
the Galaxy S4 and then maybe the S4 mini,

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.020
you can see how much larger the Galaxy Note
3 is than these other two phones.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.910
Now the S4 is no slouch, it's a five inch
display and the S4 mini with a 4.3 inch display

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.850
so the Galaxy Note 3 is quite a bit larger
than both of these phones here.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.790
It has a 5.7 inch super emulated HD display
with screen resolution of 1080 by 1920, giving

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.850
an overall pixel density of 386 pixels per
inch.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.769
That makes the Galaxy Note 3 a great phone
for sharing and watching video with friends

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.900
and family and it also has a great speaker,
not only is it great for sharing video because

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.280
of the large screen but also the sound quality
coming out is nice and loud and very crisp

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.670
and very clear.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.849
When you're sharing those videos with everyone,
you'll be able to hear them as well as see

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:12.950
them and share them.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.220
Now on the front of phone here, we have a
two megapixel front facing camera, very high

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.419
quality, great resolution for taking selfie
pictures as well as doing video chats, Skype,

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.770
anything like that.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.839
Overall weight on the Galaxy Note 3 is 5.93
ounces so it's quite a hefty phone but it

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:36.309
doesn't feel very heavy in your hand and it's
because of its size that you would think that

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:39.449
it weighs what it weighs so it has a very
nice feel.

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.990
Also the back, it kind of looks like a stitched
back leather cover but it is a polycarbonate,

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:50.090
it's a plastic back as we can see when we
pull it off here.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.360
It's a hard piece of plastic but it has a
very high quality look so it doesn't look

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.379
like cheap shiny plastic.

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:03.479
It looks like a nice piece of stitched leather
back on the phones so it's very nice.

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.830
There's multitasking on the Note 3, you can
do that while you're sending text messages,

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.289
you can surf the Internet, really nice when
you are in landscape mode because you can

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.240
have both of them going at the same time here.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.790
Like I said the Galaxy Note 3 is great for
sharing and doing multitasking and that's

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.719
mainly because its powered by Snapdragon 800
processor, it's a 2.3 gigahertz processor

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:29.919
and 3 gigabytes of RAM and it also has 32
gigabytes of onboard storage to store all

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.430
of your pictures and video and multimedia
content.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.889
If 32 gigabytes isn't enough for you, we did
show you where there's a spot to add a micro

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.930
SD card to expand storage by up to 64 additional
gigabytes.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.680
Let's take a look at the S pen for real quick
and then we'll wrap up our unboxing video

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.789
here.

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:50.900
We have the S pen, as you pull it out you
get the error command window that comes up

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.210
here and you can select some different things
so you can do like screenshots, you can make

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.939
notes right on the screen so there's some
really neat things that you can do with the

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:01.939
S pen here.

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:07.520
It even has a little button do it multiple
commands or some different commands.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.860
We'll get into the S pen a lot on the full
review of the Galaxy Note 3 so I looked forward

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.289
to doing that and we'll also put the Galaxy
Note 3 up against maybe its brother, the Galaxy

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.210
Mega in a Wirefly smartphone smackdown.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.419
Stay tuned for that and that wraps up our
unboxing.

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:23.800
My name is Scott Lewis for Wirefly, thanks
for watching.
