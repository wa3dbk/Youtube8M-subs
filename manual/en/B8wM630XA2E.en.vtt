00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.830
I'm going to discuss the different things
that are necessary to use to be an electrologist.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:15.050
First of all, now we've got to drape with
sterile supplies for one. We're going to put

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.119
a disposable cap on the client, if just no
matter what the hair is because we don't want

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.640
shedding hair in our work or a problem with
hair in the way either. So we're going to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.700
put that on her. If a client has super long
hair I'm going to use one of these bands around

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.180
to bring the hair back because you never can
tuck that hair, if it's a lot of it, into

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.540
one of these caps without pulling the hair
out of the way, especially like an Indian

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.280
client that has a hairline that's real heavy
drawn forward. So I find these to be very,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.600
very useful, but after I'm done with using
this one one client it's going to go into

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.050
the wash. Same with these drapes. I do a ton
of laundry and I usually, in my office, I

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:07.709
have a sheet or I drape this with a fresh
linen, here now if I have a naked buttocks

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:14.340
or anybody undressing on this table because
that would be contamination. And then I work

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:23.829
with gloves as you can imagine, always, and
we clean with cotton swabs and alcohol. Everything

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:30.399
in my shop we use a product, these wipes,
and these, these kill everything. These kill

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:36.740
AIDS virus, Hepatitis, you name it, herpes
whatever. You're not going to get any kind

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.340
of illness with this. So everything in my
shop is wiped down with this. I'm going to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.380
take this throughout my, you know everywhere,
the lamps, everything that I'm using that

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.469
a client could touch, myself included. The
phone, everything, and basically then we're

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.819
going to go on to the electrology machine.
This is a wonderful machine. It has two different

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.979
sides to it. There is machines that are just
high frequency which are radio waves and then

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.739
we have the sterile probes, we have our timer
which tells how much we're earning and to

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:18.069
clock our work. So we charge by this timer,
and we have at the end of the work we use

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.819
a cool aloe gel, and sometimes if I do a lot
of work I use ice packs because we want to

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.699
soothe the skin when we're done with the work.
