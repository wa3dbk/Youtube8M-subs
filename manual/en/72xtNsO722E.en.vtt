Justin: What's up, guys?

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.820
Justin with americanmuscle.com, coming to
you from the 2014 SEMA show here in Las Vegas.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.220
The hottest after market show in the entire
world.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.770
Now guys as you can see, I'm surrounded by
2015 Mustangs.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.500
That's because they're the hottest car at
the show this year for the third year running.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.980
It's great to hear as a Mustang fan.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.140
Now guys as you might expect, AM has a huge
presence at this year's show for the MMD V-Series

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.140
car upfront.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.670
Our Comp Orange 2015 on the Ford Star booth.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.630
The SCT Bama car running on dyno outside all
day long.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.840
Of course we're really happy to be here to
see Chip Foose unveil his 2015 Mustang with

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.720
some select MMD by Foose parts on there, and
of course we cannot forget about our boy,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.590
Vaughn Gittin, Jr., sliding around his 2015
Spec 5 RTR Mustang for the very first time.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.110
Guys, like I told you earlier, AM is all over
the place here at SEMA 2014.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.400
Here we are again in the Forgestar booth,
Ford 2014.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.260
They were here last year with the Matte White
MMD car, of course, and they're so nice they

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.369
brought us back again with a Comp Orange GT,
sitting low on a Forgestar F14 wheels, new

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.860
for 2015.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.140
Nice little drop here and blacked out headlights,
and some other goodies of course as well.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.580
Now this car, you might have seen it before.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.540
Laid down 412, 382 at the rear wheel on our
dyno jet with the help of a Bama Performance

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.950
Tune, and a JLT cold air intake.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.490
Guys, you know what we're going to do next.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.830
We're going to get this thing back to the
shop.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.120
The Bama Performance team is going to work
on this car, give it a ton of power.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.760
So you're going to have to stay in tune for
that, but again, guys, as you can see, AM

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.020
SEMA 2014 doing it big.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.280
All right, guys, we're out here at SEMA 2014.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.280
We're actually at the Ford outfront.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.380
In front of that, with Kenny from SCT Performance.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.870
Now, Kenny, obviously a lot of fun here at
SEMA as always.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.650
We're actually standing in front of a pretty
cool car, a 2015 GT.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.640
Why don't you tell us a little bit about it?

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.030
Kenny: Well, I'll tell you what, this is really
exciting.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.090
This is one of the first 2015 Ford to come
off the assembly line, and it's the very first

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.940
one to have the SCT tuning on it.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.420
So it's just neat to have it here and obviously
it made a 2300 mile road trip to be here.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.760
We put it on a dyno.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.770
As you know, they make about 360 horsepower
coming off the assembly line.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.340
We've been dynoing it, we've been messing
with tuning a little bit, and coming up with

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.420
numbers like 409 with the biggest one of the
day, and I don't think we're even close to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.860
where we're going to be by the end of the
day.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.860
Justin: No kidding.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.879
All right now, as for the car itself we are
looking at the JLT intake, four little exhaust,

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.709
obviously the MMD wheels which we love to
see of course, and a little Bama Performance

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:19.969
level on there.

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.379
This car really responds well to Mods?

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.379
Kenny: Absolutely.

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.200
And you know in their basic Mods, there're
stuff that people can do in their drive way

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200
shaped through mechanics.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.030
You don't have to be a major tech to be able
to put these stuff on here.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.030
Justin: There you go.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.190
I know it's been a big road trip but you got
the car painted white on top.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.599
What's the story behind that?

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.829
Kenny: Well, like I say, the car came all
the way from Florida.

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.049
All the 2300 miles that it took to get here,
they thought it would be cool to stop along

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.480
the way on the road to SEMA, and get signatures
on the car.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.129
That's 2300 miles worth of signatures.

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.579
There's actually some celebrities on there,
but there's also a pretty much just day-to-day

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.920
people that walk up and go, "Man, that's a
cool...

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.230
Is that the new 2015 Mustang?" and they'd
have them sign it.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.249
We're going to have it down tomorrow, and
throughout the next few days, we can get a

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:01.319
lot more signatures.

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.569
That thing might be black by the time we get
done with it.

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.569
Justin: Very cool.

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:05.569
Maybe I can swing by tomorrow with my John
Hancock on that.

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:06.569
Kenny: Absolutely.

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:07.939
We've got to get it on there.

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:08.939
Justin: All right.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:09.939
Sounds cool.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:10.939
Kenny, again thank you.

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:16.879
No offense, but a pleasure hanging out with
you and have some fun out here in SEMA, huh?

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.150
We've had a hell of a week.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.480
These guys are ripping around.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.290
We're going to go home and get some sleep,
but at the meantime if you guys like what
