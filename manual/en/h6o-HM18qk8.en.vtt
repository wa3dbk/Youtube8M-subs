00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.620
On behalf of Expert Village, my name is Carolyn
Travisano and I'm here to tell you about painting

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.000
on feathers. This is basically the final stage
of this particular feather. You can see how

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.350
it went from the beginning stages. This is
actually the second step here to the final

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:24.539
stage. I mentioned earlier about making the
neck a lot darker and adding your shading

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.340
in and using different colors, and this is
why. It just brings out more definition and

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:38.730
it pops the face out. Right here, I have going
through the beaded area basically just different

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.150
colors, little dots of color. Then throughout
the feather area in the beading work and the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:56.960
jewelry, I've used a very fine paintbrush
with very little and very watered down paint

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:05.550
to go in and add detail into the feather.
Also in this stage, you notice how her hair

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:15.240
is black and it's basically a solid black
shade. In this stage, I took the white, watered

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.250
it down. When you're adding the detail in
the final stage, you want to use a very watered

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.240
down paint. Unlike before when we were using
it thicker to lay down a solid painting area.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:38.760
We watered down the white and I'm going back
in and I'm adding detail into the hair to

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.300
give a little bit more highlight. You don't
want to use a solid white necessarily. You

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.860
can go in and add a little bit of black in
it so it's a little bit grayer. When it's

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.799
catching a highlight, it's not a white highlight.
It's a highlight that has color in it. Whether

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:03.960
it be light or dark, it has natural color.
We're going in and adding the gray. There

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:15.730
we go. The feather has these little things
that come off the bottom, fluffy feather parts.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.041
We want to add that into her feathers as well.
We're watering down the paint and making a

00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:27.260
very light stroke to give it the feathering
look.
