00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300
This movie... this movie

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.000
It was supposed to be bad. Like, really bad.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.500
And it was supposed to be stereotypical and stupid and Twilight was supposed to get a boyfriend..

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.500
But.. It was good?!

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.560
It’s just good. Like, legitly. Oh, first..

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.760
Spoilers!

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.600
The high school tropes that I thought would go along with this movie..ya know,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.400
The boy meets girl storyline, and the high school dance 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.770
and..that thing in the trailer that looked like a makeover scene

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.000
“Are you programmed to be thinking what I'm thinking?... Make over!"

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.000
But for reals, Sunset Shimmer’s motivations were interesting and believable, and they also tie in with canon pretty well.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.000
By the way, I was wrong about this not affecting canon. So very wrong.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:05.000
And the references, there were so many JUST FOR US. To the point where there were SPECIFIC references to past episodes. 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.800
It just... Wow, movie. Wow. Just wow.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
McCarty also did a great job characterizing the mane six as humans. Like, Fluttershy volunteers for the local animal shelter, and Pinkie Pie organizes the dance

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.000
well, you just kinda have to see the movie to really get what I’m talking about here. I can’t really articulate it better. It’s one of those thing you just have to see.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.450
But now... the bad stuff

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.730
Brad, I mean Flash Sentry...I mean Brad, is most definitely crushing on Twilight, and vis versa. It doesn't help that he's a "dude"

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.330
- What? -
- Dude! I love this guy! He's totally like the most relatable character in the whole show, man! –

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.500
Man! I don’t want any canon mane six romances! Do you know how messy those are gonna be. Damn it! 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:54.900
“Answer to #EquestriaGirls question I have a feeling i'll be getting a lot today: Flash Sentry is not a character in #MLPFiM season 4"

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.450
Oh..nevermind then.They also didn’t kissed. Which helped..a little. Just a little.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.560
I think I got all I had to say about that out of the way. But one other thing that was bothering me:

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.900
wHERE THE F*** IS DISCORD?!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.200
I mean, Cadance was there, and Luna was there, and Celestia was there

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.400
"And you, and you, and you... and you were there"

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:24.000
I mean, my god. I’m getting impatient. And if getting John De lancie was a problem, then he could've been there like in the background, and I would've been okay with that.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.400
But no. I can't have nice things.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.600
I feel like he’s just in the basement of Canterlot Castle somewhere, and he’s like

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.900
Celestia, can I come out now?

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.000
And she's like... No

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.500
- Please -
- No -

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.900
- But -
- Soon -

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
- Buuuut -
- I SAID SOON! -
