What's up is your boy Cristian Barberena and today I will be showing you 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.270
How to connect you iPad 2 using a A/V adapter to your High Definition TV 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.569
so let's get started

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:14.419
The A/V Adapter is 39.99

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.680
and it's compatible with the iPhone 4

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.109
iPhone 4s, iPod Touch 4th Generation

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.970
iPad 2nd and 3th Generation

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.839
one of the benefits of having an A/V Adapter from Apple is that it does

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.679
come with a 30 pin cable power input

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.470
so you can charge your device while playing
movies, games

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.760
or while you are doing a presentation for work

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.790
so the first thing we need to is connect the HDMI cable 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.000
to the back of your TV

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.180
then the other end of the HDMI cable you are going to connect it

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.100
to the A/V Adapter

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.550
now you're going to be ready to connect
your A/V Adaptor to your iPad

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.750
like so

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.660
and noticed the blue bar

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.020
well on your TV now you going to select the right
input

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.760
here's a few examples of what you can do
with the A/V adapter

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.760
you will be able to surf the web using Safari

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.920
display you personal pictures and videos
you have recorded

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.260
play movies with the Netflix App

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.740
and now for the first time you will be
able to use HBOGO

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.510
please make sure to have to latest iOS install on your device

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.219
as well

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.630
as the latest update for the application you wish to use

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.270
using the adapter

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.270
this would be a great time to LIKE MY VIDEO

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.719
you can also play games

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:10.079
but please NOTE

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.749
that not all games will be compatible

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:19.749
please read the developer description
for the App for more info

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:25.099
just so you guys can see the "YOUTUBE" App does work

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.479
however notice how is not covering the whole screen

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.879
well there is going to be a easy fix for that, on your TV remote control

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.489
there's gonna be some options were says
"widescreen" "full screen"

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.229
so on this

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:42.229
I will be putting "ZOOM"

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:45.219
now will go ahead and press play

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:47.519
expand that

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.299
and there you go as you can see it covers the whole screen

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:56.479
just to give you an idea let's put it on "Normal" which

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:00.599
that pretty much just deface the purpose of the big screen

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.699
alright so I hope I was able to answer some of your questions if not

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:05.579
