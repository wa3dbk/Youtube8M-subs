00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:28.439
TheZone is the place, my home away from home,
Smiles always shine, and I never feel alone.

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.600
No it's not the mountains, or the peaks that
touch the sky,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.160
But the spirit of a child flying high.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.391
I watched in amazement again and again,
Precious Jewish children coming closer to

00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:46.391
Hashem.

00:00:46.391 --> 00:00:48.570
Praying and learning all while having fun,
The journey of my life has just begun.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.460
Oorah you're my spirit, Oorah you're my soul,
The warm hand I hold onto, in a world that's

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.489
dark and cold
Oorah you've ignited the spark that's within

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:59.489
me,
Oorah you are my new family.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.489
Oorah you're my spirit, Oorah you're my soul,
The story of my future, waiting to be told.

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.129
Oorah you have shown me all that I can be,
Oorah you are my new family.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.990
I smile proudly, as I hold my siddur tight,
And read Modeh Ani for the very first time.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.990
Though I learned the Alef Beis just one short
week ago,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.990
Amazing things happen in TheZone.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.990
There is someone I look up to, who teaches
me what's right,

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.480
Giving me a brand new perspective on life.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:31.479
I never knew learning Torah can be so great
,

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.600
Until the day I met my Torah Mate.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:51.140
Oorah you're my spirit, Oorah you're my soul,
The story of my future, waiting to be told.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.600
Oorah you have shown me all that I can be,
Oorah you are my new family.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.960
Everyday was special, but one rises above,
TheZone has shown me what Shabbos can become.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.420
With my Shabbos Buddy, who I hold so dear,
I will keep Shabbos through the year

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.920
Oorah you're my spirit, Oorah you're my soul,
The warm hand I hold onto, in a world that's

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.590
dark and cold
Oorah you've ignited the spark that's within

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.960
me,
Oorah you are my new family.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:52.030
Oorah you're my spirit, Oorah you're my soul,
The story of my future, has not been told

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.030
told.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:04:29.560
Oorah you have shown me all that I can be,
Oorah you are my new family.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.210
Oorah you're my spirit, Oorah you're my soul,
The story of my future, waiting to be told.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:05:11.620
Oorah you have shown me all that I can be,

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.770
Oorah you are my new family.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:35.610
Oorah you are my new family.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:06:34.720
Oorah you are my new family.
