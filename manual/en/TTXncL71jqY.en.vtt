to tell us about your longest wheelies

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.680
the current Guinness World Record 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.309
10.56 miles in an hour

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.360
i'm not going to be trying to beat that today

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.880
but I am going to give you some tips so that you can try

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.879
make sure your back brake is not just working but working really well

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:25.250
you can cheat a little bit

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.210
or at least help yourself

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.079
by adjusting your saddle height to a middle position

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.690
to keep your centre of gravity lower and help with your balance

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.190
make sure that use a low or easy gear

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.630
the lower the better in fact 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.250
begin at a slow or rolling speed and keep your weight central

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.490
Turn your cranks

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.900
or your pedals to a two o clock position push down hard on the pedal and simultaneously

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.880
pull up on the handle bars

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.920
it's going to take a few attempts to figure out exactly how quickly and easy the front end comes up

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.880
start off cautiously the last thing you want to do is fly off the back of the bike

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.110
as you get more confident try getting
closer and closer to that balance point

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.650
you try to lift the front wheel to that point where it takes minimum effort to stay 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.580
balanced on the rear wheel

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.380
once you find this balance point the back break is your friend

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.369
put it on full and it will stop your back wheel dead

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.360
and bring the front end back down to the ground, eventually the aim is to get to that

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.690
balance point and keep it

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.120
by using a combination of dabbing the rear break and pedalling harder once you've begun to master the

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.850
forwards and rearward balance points

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.380
you will then need to control the side balance which you can do in two ways

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.070
firstly by using your knees, feet and overall body weight

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.479
secondly by turning the handlebars in the opposite direction

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.750
to that which you're falling, just make sure you can straighten the handlebars when you come back down to earth

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.380
and when you have finished your wheelie try not to hit the ground too hard with your front wheel

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.030
you are on a road bike after all. For more of this kind of thing subscribe now.
