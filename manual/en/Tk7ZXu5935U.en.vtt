00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:17.363
It answers. Thats because it is so nice weather

00:00:17.853 --> 00:00:21.879
It is easter, no more fog and very calm weather

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:29.830
Kristian and I will not miss this chance. We are going out on 
 our bikes. We are going on a little trip to Langeland

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:38.066
From her to Langeland on curvy roads. Thats what we want

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.099
What do you think Kristian? 
Yes the mold on Langeland is waiting on os

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:49.111
Lets go!

00:00:50.173 --> 00:00:52.734
I'll just fire up my bike

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.070
Where are we Allan?

00:02:34.728 --> 00:02:36.630
We are in Spodsbjerg 

00:02:37.568 --> 00:02:41.700
We are here to se the ferry

00:02:42.236 --> 00:02:45.540
we where watching the ferry and waved to 
 some people But they did'nt waved back

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.000
Cheeky!

00:03:25.356 --> 00:03:31.020
The lark is singing and we are in a rapefield or a mustardfield 

00:03:31.858 --> 00:03:35.800
Maybe you know the difference - we don't know 

00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:38.730
This is a rapefield but how does a mustard field look like then?

00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:46.230
one thing we know is that it smells like spring

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:53.990
We are close to an old dolmen called Rene Dolmen

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.870
A place not far from Ristinge 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.500
be careful, it's a long way down

00:04:53.566 --> 00:05:00.260
Where are we now?
We are at a place called Dovens Cliff

00:05:08.102 --> 00:05:15.300
Oh its so nice to finnaly be able 
 to drive in this awesome spring weather

00:05:17.721 --> 00:05:22.000
One more sign on the early spring - THE ANEMONES!

00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:25.950
They are in bloom at the moment 

00:05:27.735 --> 00:05:30.100
and its nice

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.430
isn't the path of love?

00:05:43.833 --> 00:05:46.150
It was a mouse

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:50.600
a little mouse on its motorcycle

00:05:51.568 --> 00:05:53.130
a little motorcycle mouse

00:05:54.638 --> 00:05:57.640
I would like to spend some more time on Langeland

00:05:58.514 --> 00:06:00.930
we odd to take an outdoor trip here somewhere 

00:06:01.496 --> 00:06:04.870
I know there is a shelter somewhere here in the woods

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:14.770
we could come here.
Yes and park the bikes out there and walk in

00:06:16.624 --> 00:06:20.220
it has a fireplace so we can make out fish dinner

00:06:21.826 --> 00:06:24.060
thats always a good hoppy
