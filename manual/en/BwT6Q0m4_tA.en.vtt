Hi, I'm Phil.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.919
I'm a food and diet writer, and welcome back
to my Lighter Option series.

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.370
In this episode I'm going to make a really
easy apple and berry crumble.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.990
It's proof that you can have a sweet treat
that's still healthy.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.680
[Music]

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.040
This apple and berry crumble is a much healthier
option.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.020
The apples and berries cram in loads of vitamins
and soluble fiber, and the oats give a fiber

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.660
boost as well as being a slow release carbohydrate.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.610
Before you start, preheat your oven to Gas
Mark 4, 180 degrees.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.660
So heat a pan over medium heat.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.160
Add four cooking apples and about five tablespoons
of water.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:52.120
And leave it over a low heat for about five
minutes until they begin to soften.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.670
While the apples are cooking you can mix up
the crumble.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.719
So I mix together 180 grams of porridge oats,
50 grams plain flour, and the same of caster

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.309
sugar, and 50 grams of low fat spread.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.440
This really helps cut down on the amount of
fat you would normally get in a crumble.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.700
Give that a mix with your fingers until the
texture is crumb like.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:23.450
Add one to two tablespoons of water, just
to help it form clusters.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.240
And now your crumble is ready to scatter over.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.450
This is a great pudding for winter months.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.940
It's perfect comfort food without all the
calories and fat.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.729
OK, now the crumble is ready to scatter over.

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.240
Now the apples have started to soften and
they're nicely cooked.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.240
Add in four tablespoons of honey,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.360
and the mixed berries.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.640
Just heat that through for a few minutes so
it takes less time to cook in the oven.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.479
For the full list of ingredients, have a look
at the description box.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.380
Once the berries have warmed through, just
spoon it into your dish.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:10.360
Spread it evenly, and then scatter over the
crumble.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.130
You can make this with any of your favorite
fruits, summer berries are perfect, pears,

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.540
peaches, whatever takes your fancy.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.440
Once you've scattered all your crumble over,
it's ready to bake in the oven for about 25

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.540
minutes until golden brown.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.010

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.980
Once the crumble has baked for 25 minutes,
it's pale golden and crunchy and ready to

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.340
serve.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.750
It makes four generous portions, each with
two portions of fruit.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.500
So there you have my apple and berry crumble,
great to served with a scoop of low fat ice

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.500
cream.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.012
This is the last in the series, I hope you've
enjoyed it and have been inspired to cook

00:02:49.012 --> 00:02:50.380
some really great healthy dishes at home.
