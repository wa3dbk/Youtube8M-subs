00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:25.119
It’s been about a month since I reviewed
this game on the Xbox 360.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.359
This…empty husk, of a video game.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.439
And fortunately, in that short time, I managed
to completely forget about it.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.520
That’s the good thing about reviewing games.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.190
Every day, there’s a new stack to play,
so it’s easy to move on.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.280
Even from something as terrible as How To
Train Your Dragon 2.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.970
But the thing is…subconsciously, it’s
always there.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.570
Deep in the recesses of your mind, it’s
there…just waiting for the right time to

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.570
strike.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.670
Usually, it’s a night terror, or some diarrhea.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.800
This time, it’s the other version.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.559
Holy sh*t, it’s worse than I remember.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.339
It’s How To Train Your Dragon 2.

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:12.810
I mean…this game sucks…on a level that
very few games ever have.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.070
I really mean that.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.229
You know, a lot of games suck…but How To
Train Your Dragon 2 belongs on the all-time

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.229
list.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.220
This is like Superman 64 2014, it’s that
bad.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.750
And actually, the game’s a lot like Superman
64.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.579
That’s a mistake I thought no video game
would ever make.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.770
It’s like the plot to a bad horror movie.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.659
You know, the ones where everyone knows about
the demon that killed everyone, but there’s

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.180
always that punk kid who decides to open the
tomb.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.250
Superman 64 is the demon.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.130
How To Train Your Dragon 2 is the punk kid.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.119
You and I, we’re the hapless victims.

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:55.300
And you know the worst part…before the game,
like, crushes your entire sense of being,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.930
the worst part is that it lies to you first.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.820
Like, it starts off by giving you a glimmer
of hope.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.601
The game starts, and you’re riding a dragon,
flying over the ocean, you’re told to shoot

00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:10.500
another dragon, with your fiery dragon breath…and
you think, “Wait a minute, this could be

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.500
fun.”

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.379
“This could be like Star Fox.”

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.569
Only Star Dragon.

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.220
Or I guess Cloud Dragon, since dragons can’t
fly in space.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.410
Point is, this f*cking could be Cloud Dragon.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.020
But then a couple minutes later…oh, you
know what it is?

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.900
(Rings) It’s f*cking Superman 64 2014.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.290
Alright, so how do I explain this?

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.340
I guess…this is a collection…of, like,
five games…on one island.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.930
And it’s so much worse than it sounds, because
almost every goddamn game involves flying

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:45.930
through rings.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.810
There’s a race…where you fly through rings.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.180
There’s a game where you have to pick up
sheep…but you also have to fly through rings.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.030
In fact, there are so few differences between
these games…I honestly can’t tell them

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.030
apart.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.049
Seriously, there’s shooting vikings, there’s
picking up sheep, and then there’s all these

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.810
indistinguishable flight missions.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.340
And guess what, they all involve flying through
rings.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.850
It’s like Pilotwings’ evil twin.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.690
F*ck You Wings.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.640
And you know, it’d be one thing if these
games were playable.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.720
They are not, they are broken.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.600
This entire game is broken.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.849
The controls are shockingly bad, the AI’s
all over the place…but it’s so much more

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:24.849
than that.

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:25.849
It’s basic things.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.470
Like, the camera will sometimes just…detach
from you.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.909
You know, because who needs to see their character
in a video game?

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:39.000
There are technical problems, horrible graphics,
bad music…it seriously feels unfinished.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.140
Like halfway into development, someone stood
up and said, “You know, we’re not gonna

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.420
make this any better, guys.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.420
This sucks.”

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.060
So everyone just went home and forgot about
it.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.420
Which you can sympathize with, but…hey,
next time you do that?

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.480
Don’t forget to push the red button.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.450
It should say “delete” on it.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.739
Or “history eraser,” or something…point
is, don’t just walk away and let something

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.409
this awful do the same.

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.530
Blow up the goddamn building.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.459
I mean, and it’s just the one island.

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.819
It’s like one level.

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.209
With games that barely work.

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.319
You just fly around, land on these perches
that start minigames…and they’re all the

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.319
same.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.210
And sometimes, they give you a cup, like a
serious of missions to play for points…and

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:23.660
no joke, those are some of the worst moments
I’ve ever had with a video game.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.520
‘Cause most of the games?

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.860
Just flying through rings, you guys.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.590
I’d rather throw it, through a black hole.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.781
But hey, go watch our review of the Xbox 360
version to hear my very first reactions to

00:04:36.781 --> 00:04:38.110
this game.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.590
This has been fun, but…this is more like
the nightmare that happens after the fact.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.650
You’re already scarred, now you’re just
reliving it.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.560
It’s How To Train Your Dragon 2, for the
PlayStation 3.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.550
I’m not saying it’s the worst game ever,
but…

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.860
Easily top 50, maybe top 30.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.210
Hopefully, I’ll just forget about it again.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:08.970
I don’t want to talk about it anymore.
