Hey, I'm Tim Gipson, and I'm going to talk
about cleaning grout in tile. Now, tile is

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.300
a great feature to have in your kitchen, but
in new homes, and particularly where you have

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.510
a kitchen and a dining area tied into a very
open space it's a high traffic area in your

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.650
home. So, you'll find many times that the
grout lines, and particularly with the light

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.041
grout such as this will become soiled over
a period of time. So, it's a little bit of

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:31.800
work, and there's a couple things that you
want to have. You want to have a bucket. You

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.980
have a couple cleaning products, and the two
that that I have here that tend to work very

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.390
well; you can use an OxyClean or a baking
soda. And you want to have a good stiff bristle

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.569
brush such as this, or something you might
actually use in your sink for scrubbing dishes,

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:53.810
such as this. Now also, when you're doing
a very large area here; to protect your hands,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.929
and even though that these are very friendly
chemicals it's it's a good idea to have some

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:04.500
rubber gloves as well just to protect your
hands for doing a very large area. The next

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.159
thing, and I don't have them on now, but if
you're doin' a large floor area like this

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.350
it's usually a good idea to save some wear
and tear on your knees to have some kneepads

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.009
on, and that'll help save you a lotta', a
lotta' pain and potential trouble from doin'

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.110
that. Now, when you're usin' these type of
products and to get it down in here it's really

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.941
a good idea as you're mixin' this up, as you
dump this into your water you don't want it

00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:37.439
to be a real liquid. You want to get more,
more of a paste consistency, so that actually

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.229
when you put this down into the grout you're
almost lettin' it sit in there like this in

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.900
a paste. And then, you want to let this sit
for a few minutes before you actually start

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.040
scrubbing this, and then, once you get let
that sit a little bit, and let it work into

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.410
the grout you can just come back in and do,
do a nice scrub. And then you can come back

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.680
with a sponge and actually clean this up.
Now, if you want to keep from havin' to do

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.890
this every couple of months, once you clean
this and once you let it dry for at least

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.420
forty eight hours, then you can come back,
and you can actually treat these grout lines

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.530
with a grout sealer. And what the sealer does;
you put on a couple of applications and it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.200
keeps moisture and dirt out, so now, when
you sponge mop it's very easy. It'll keep

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.400
that dirt on the surface, and keep it from
actually going down into the grout. So, I'm

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.640
Tim Gipson, and that's how to clean grout.
