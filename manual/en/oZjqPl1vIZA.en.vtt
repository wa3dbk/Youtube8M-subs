00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.890
- We're here in Central Pennsylvania

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.030
with our good friends from
the Spring Lane Hunt Club

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.900
hunting pheasants with
the two lucky winners

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.870
from the Clarion County Youth Field Day

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.118
and Wired Outdoors starts

00:00:09.118 --> 00:00:11.364
- [All] Right now.

00:00:11.364 --> 00:00:13.947
(upbeat music)

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.760
- Hello and welcome to Wired Outdoors.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.150
Each year we love to go to
our local youth field day

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.370
called Clarion County Youth Field Day.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.370
And over 400 kids just loving the outdoors

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.350
and each year one of the prizes,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.690
we take two kids along
with us to our good friends

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.900
at Spring Lane Hunt
Club on a pheasant hunt.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.210
This year's lucky winners
were Ethan and Alex.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.500
So let's get right to the action

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.273
and see if these two can get
their very first pheasants.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.790
Okay, here we are,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.520
this is one of our favorite hunts of year,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.050
it's our youth field
day hunt where we take

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.174
two lucky winners from the
Clarion County Youth Field Day

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:13.063
and this year we have
Alex and we have Ethan.

00:01:14.482 --> 00:01:16.870
And I know Alex from before,

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.320
and he's a real quiet kid,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.928
and Ethan just had your tonsils out, when?

00:01:20.928 --> 00:01:21.761
- Tuesday.

00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:23.100
- Tuesday, just had his tonsils out.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.760
So they're not gonna
be real talkative kids

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.731
but I know they're really,
really excited to be here.

00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:29.100
We're here with Brian and
Spring Lane Hunt Club,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.402
you see us, we've come here every year,

00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:33.100
so we're gonna get to it,
we're gonna go hunt some birds.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.933
What are we gonna do?

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:34.920
- We're gonna go out and have some fun.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.840
We've got two labs, a pointing
lab and a flushing lab.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.810
And they're gonna go
out and find some birds

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.490
and give these guys a good
time to shoot some birds

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.323
and have some fun today.

00:01:44.323 --> 00:01:45.156
- Absolutely.

00:01:45.156 --> 00:01:47.410
Well, the kids are ready
to go so let's get started.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.410
(upbeat rock music)

00:01:52.916 --> 00:01:54.200
- [Man] Oh, a bird!

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.115
- [Man] Shoot it!

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.923
(gunfire pops)

00:01:57.923 --> 00:01:58.756
Good try.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.210
Good job, Ethan, that's
the way to let it clear.

00:02:05.674 --> 00:02:07.649
- [Man] Bird, bird, bird, bird!

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.482
(gunfire pops)

00:02:08.482 --> 00:02:09.665
(man laughing)

00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:10.940
- [Man] Oh, hold up.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.773
(dramatic music)

00:02:15.132 --> 00:02:16.867
- [Man] Oh, bird, bird!

00:02:16.867 --> 00:02:17.740
(gunfire pops)

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.940
- [Man] Oh good try bud.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.140
We knew he was in there, huh?

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.965
Get ready.

00:02:25.965 --> 00:02:26.980
- [Man] Bird!

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.230
- [Man] Nope, nope, nope.

00:02:30.772 --> 00:02:32.229
- I told you not to
shoot that one, didn't I?

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:33.345
And you listened!

00:02:33.345 --> 00:02:34.845
Good, good, good.
- Good job.

00:02:36.034 --> 00:02:41.034
- That one paid attention
to the safety talk, I think!

00:02:41.252 --> 00:02:42.980
- [Man] What'd you think of that round?

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.971
At least you got some shooting!

00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:44.804
- Yeah!

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:54.152
- [Man] Bird!

00:02:54.152 --> 00:02:56.735
(gunfire pops)

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.753
- [Man] You're getting
all the hens over there.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.090
- [Man] Bird, bird, bird!

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.240
- [Man] Good job, Alex.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.163
Good job.

00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:22.508
- [Man] Ready?

00:03:22.508 --> 00:03:23.548
- [Man] Shoot him!

00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:26.070
(gunfire pops)
Good shot!

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.123
Alright!

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.870
That's the ones you like,
the straight-away ones!

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.120
Hey, he even gave you a thumbs-up, bud.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.713
Good shot, buddy, way to go!

00:03:36.805 --> 00:03:38.200
Is that your first pheasant?

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.661
Nice!

00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:42.661
(upbeat rock music)

00:03:44.476 --> 00:03:45.309

Hey, good shot bud.

00:04:09.957 --> 00:04:10.860

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.375

00:04:16.874 --> 00:04:19.253
Way to wait, bud. (laughs)

00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:29.320
- Yeah, that's a good head shot, him!

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.063
You want him or you want me to carry him?

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:32.896
OK.

00:04:37.153 --> 00:04:38.986
- [Man] Get him ready.

00:04:39.973 --> 00:04:41.806
Bird!
- Shoot it Alex!

00:04:44.802 --> 00:04:45.885

00:04:46.727 --> 00:04:47.894
Oh, good shot!

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:20.879
- [Man] Oh, close.

00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:24.814
Ah, you're gonna get him bud.

00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:26.578
What do you think of pheasant hunting?

00:05:26.578 --> 00:05:27.495
Good stuff?

00:05:28.547 --> 00:05:31.130

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.063
Good shot.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.273
- We were doing a sprint-type hunt.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.340
First pheasant?

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.180
- Yep.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.013

00:06:21.884 --> 00:06:23.500
(laughing)

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.800
- How you feeling, alright?

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.633
You did great, man.

00:06:25.633 --> 00:06:27.970
Alex, awesome.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.790
OK, it is the end of our hunt here

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.870
and we had an absolute blast today.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.130
Tons of birds, the kids
got lots of shooting.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.000
Did you guys have fun?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.833
