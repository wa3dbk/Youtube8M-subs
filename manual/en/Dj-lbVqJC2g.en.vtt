00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.590
Hey everybody! Elysia here from Si Boards
and we have just come up with our brand new

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.720
product: the Power Rope Ball. We've taken
our amazing medicine ball of super high rebound,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.330
solid urethane perfection, molded a hole through
it, and laced a rope through it.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.249
(0:17)
So, what you'll see in traditional power balls

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:23.079
is that the rope is exposed, but we've taken
care of that. We have a nice plug on the top

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.179
here and the rope will never hit the ground,
so when you're doing really big swinging motions,

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.480
and the top of the ball is hitting the ground,
your rope is protected.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.760
And we can adjust the rope length. You can
change out the rope if you want something

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.059
a little bit stiffer like a traditional rock
climbing rope. We use a sailing rope that

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.050
is a little dynamic and softer on the hands..
It's got the most amazing rebound, just like

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.050
our balls.
(0:51)

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.629
So what's the difference in the function?
The traditional air filled rope ball don't

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:03.059
return very well, and when they don't return
very well, the directory path of the ball

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:15.750
coming off the wall is a little unpredictable
and can come back to your face.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:34.350
(1:18) The Difference is Amazing!
As far as the sizes, check this out! 2 ½

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.790
pounds, which is our traditional 5" ball,
is perfect for small shoulder movement that's

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.390
light and quick, and really responsive.
And then we have our 6 ½" ball, which is

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.330
5 ½ pounds and is perfect for your general
athletic moves, one handed more powerful moves.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.840
It's super awesome.
And our large, 8 ½" ball, which is 12 ½

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.060
pounds, it is amazing for super big, powerful,
rotational moves. Split the rope, do some

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:20.960
other diagonal moves. It is so much fun.
