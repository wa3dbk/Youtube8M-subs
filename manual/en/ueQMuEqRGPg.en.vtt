00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.735
-If a cop stops you for anything
and he asks to search

00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:07.720
your vehicle, say no.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.690
Don't give him consent.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.640
If he asks to search your
person, say no.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.270
If he asks to search
your house, say no.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.100
You have a Fourth Amendment
right against unreasonable

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.650
search and seizures.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.160
If you consent, you've
given up that right.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.530
I can't tell you how many times
as a cop, I would stop

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.840
somebody for maybe equipment
violation, no front license

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.110
plate, broken tail light.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.700
I stopped them because I knew
there might be something in

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.780
that vehicle.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.870
It was a way to stop the car,
pull them over illegally.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.190
I didn't have a reason to search
the car, but once they

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.320
give me consent, all
bets are off.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.520
You've given up your right, now
I'll tear that car apart.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.910
And if you have something,
they're probably

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.310
going to find it.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.390
As an attorney, I'd represent
these people, and they would

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.500
give their consent to search.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.660
I'd ask them, why
did you do that.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.320
Why did you allow the
cop to search you,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.960
to search your vehicle?

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.270
Well, I thought he'd
search it anyways.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.370
Let him search it.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.490
Don't give him consent, but if
he's going to search it, he's

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.460
going to search it.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.670
But then it's my job as an
attorney to try to keep the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.530
evidence out.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.180
If there was an illegal search
or seizure, I'll file a motion

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.130
to suppress that search and say
he had no cause to do it.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.370
Because if you give up your
Fourth Amendment right to

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.690
unreasonable searches and
seizures, you can't complain.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.390
If you do not give consent,
then what happens is the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.280
burden is placed upon the
prosecution to justify the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.850
warrantless search.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.350
Because he didn't
get a warrant.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.880
And I tell people this.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.570
If a cop came knocking
at my door--

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.860
and I'm a retired cop and
I'm an attorney--

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.420
and he says, hey, I want
to search her house.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.110
OK, I know I was in the business
with you guys, but

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.220
I'm not going to let you come in
and walk through my house.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.700
It isn't going to happen.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.575
Even if I have nothing at all,
you're not going to do it.

00:01:52.575 --> 00:01:53.180
Go get a warrant.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.420
And when you get a warrant,
come back, and

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.560
then come on in.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.730
Until then, don't give it up.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.980
Don't give up your right.
