00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.050
hey youtubers is Charlie so huge news
Daniel Bruhl was just confirmed as one

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.030
of the new villains

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.100
in captain america: three so this is
gonna be video about the top by people I

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.460
think he could be playing

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.369
and how that might fit into the other
phase three movies. Marvel has not

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:17.590
confirmed who is playing

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.860
but variety is reporting that he's going
to be a secondary dolan

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.440
in captain america: but the main villain
a Doctor Strange

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.240
I think right away there's like a clear
pic but I'm gonna go through my top five

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.390
picks and they do break down each
character

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.090
the one everyone talking about obviously
is Reds goal he could be playing

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.200
a new version upgrades goal it's widely
believed

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.399
the Hugo Weaving isn't going to return
to the Red Skull role like he's not

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.270
going to return to the Marvel Universe
that was a one-off deal for him

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.760
but the care tourette's coca totally
come back Daniel Bruhl

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.250
totally amazing actor totally think you
could pull it off if you don't believe

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.860
me

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.930
just watch rush he's amazing as Nikki
louder

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.350
just an amazing actor in general so here
we go topics

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.699
number five doctor foster's this is my
least likely pick but doctor about this

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.620
was associated with Hydra

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.009
you can be given is like an evil Sigmund
Freud which certainly would link him to

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:08.920
the mine gem

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.039
im Hydra has been doing in the events
leading up to eat a Voltron

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.579
he also was a big part of the death of
Captain America comic book story line

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.409
in its rumored to be party the
inspiration for Captain America 3

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.439
I mean it civil war but the death of
Captain America

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.579
came right after that don't know how
they're gonna dress that in the movie

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:26.270
universe

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.389
I don't expect Chris Evans the dye but
it only possible we get is an element to

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.649
that

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.749
in the movie since bounced as is a
lesser character

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:37.249
I think it's possible that they could
use that character but he might just be

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:38.719
in the TV universe

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.469
based on the time line at those I don't
expect a whole lot a huge 100 characters

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:43.729
in the Netflix series

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.249
nearly pounding their own agency SHIELD
right now number four

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:51.919
Nicholas geist geist also has some loose
ties to the doctor strange universe

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:55.130
if it's a little bit better and Captain
America stories because he gets tied up

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.389
with Winter Soldier

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:00.450
in the comics he ended up getting stuck
in a robot exo skeleton

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.619
just to keep himself alive that feels
like more by MoDOT type storyline

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.679
so that's also why he's towards the
bottom my list

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.879
but he is a really big character did
they have not used in the movie universe

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:11.450
yet

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.960
there was an art during marbles perot
cage during those

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.510
makes for he tried to remake the world
in hydrous

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.410
image using a lot a mystical artifacts
along with blood front door

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.470
in love the other more mythical
characters from the Marvel Universe

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.630
that feels like more of a reality
Genting in the kennedy that during our

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.590
team to the galaxy

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.710
so again much less likely been to my
other pics

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.830
number three barron's email you're
starting to get to it some other more

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.880
likely characters

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.270
parents email one of the biggest
characters in the Marvel Universe

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.370
underneath Read's goal as both
bare-bones trucker

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.380
is mostly known for Masters a feeble I
would totally love it

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.340
if they do that in the movies thus far
we've only seen Hydra characters we

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.130
haven't seen in

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.400
evil virgin the Avengers yet it would be
pretty badass to see a super-villain

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.820
team-up

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.510
in a Captain America movie any the
character that's big enough to be wanted

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.990
the current head the Hydra

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.070
they actually mention the heads up I
drawn agency SHIELD this week

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.030
right now the only ones that we know are
confirmed heads are bare bone structure

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.710
as well as doctor Whitehall the mo is in
a character the movies is introduced yet

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.790
so that means that he's still alive
somewhere floating around

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.980
the comics have used him so much did at
some point he's going to have to be in

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.840
one in the movies

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.920
at least in some way does the other
think that makes him

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.690
slightly less likely you know they might
top two picks by the fact that there are

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.770
better candidates

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.510
they're both Hydra characters and big
Doctor Strange villains

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.540
CEO's always been more by Captain
America bill and been a Doctor Strange

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.570
villain

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.030
so he be a likely candidate for the main
villain of Captain America 3

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.280
and Daniel Bruhl dick character that i'm
talking about. is supposed to be the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.250
minor villain

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.340
of Captain America 3 in the main dawn
Doctor Strange

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.750
which is kinda funny which means we have
to set our sights a little bit lower

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.920
number two Red Skull just explain

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.000
by red school is my number to pick you
know my number one pick

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.820
is because I just I don't feel like this
is a slam dunk

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.710
I do think that was the red school again
Hill Toli peer in a future Captain

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.070
America movie at some point

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.860
but I think because you go beatings
contract is kind of up in the air

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.740
in the not sure if you ever going to
come back to play em the risk and

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.010
leaving them on the side

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.790
as the lotto you ask questions about how
he still alive what happened to meet the

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.310
into the first Captain America movie

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.669
just remember this the tesseract is the
Space Jam

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.250
it teleport's matter tip you know who
knew

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.070
is where so he's floating in space for
all we know in the thing that a lot a

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.440
big creators talk about

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.650
are that supervillains like epic dawns
never truly die

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.060
it'll never truly go away there's no
final debt the other strike against them

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.860
is that he's almost too big a character
to be the lesser bill and up a Captain

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.640
America movie

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.400
if you like any movie he stepped into he
would automatically become the big deal

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.870
in UHV

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.820
and might number one pick the pretty
obvious choice bear Morneau

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.200
the reason I think bear more dough is
the best pic

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.180
is because he's not quite as powerful or
is famous

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.700
or infamous is a bread school are some
of the other big huge Marvel villains

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.480
but he is one of the biggest Doctor
Strange villains if not the main

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.620
Doctor Strange vigeland so if Brady's
right in Daniel Bruhl

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.930
is playing a character that'll be a
lesser bill in captain america: but the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.730
main villain

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.830
in Doctor Strange if you like its a
pretty clear pic

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.990
there more to go all the way be totally
awesome to see

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.000
your mom who is the main going to the
doctor strange movie but since he's a

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.640
godly

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.870
demonic construct I feel like is just a
little too

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.550
outlandish for a first movie outing the
billing needs to be

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.160
a physical person that you could punch
with your fist if you needed to

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.240
not the Doctor Strange is going to be
that kinda movie but just think about it

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.410
this way did you brought

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.720
can't wait to see him as a villain in
captain america: but imagine

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.050
he gets his hands on the soul gem at the
end to that movie

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.290
gains the power he needs to become the
big bad

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.960
in Doctor Strange in that movie becomes
the battle for the soul gem

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.260
tested that theory but I feel like it
most possible one

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.490
all these pics regardless of whether or
not the soldiers involved

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.380
and just the idea Daniel Bruhl against
Benedict Cumberbatch

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.940
just sounds so amazing let me know
though which these guys do you think

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.740
he's playing already think he's playing
someone else

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.740
just remember he can be a minor Billman
Captain America

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.220
but he has to be the main don't in
Doctor Strange if you've ever heard the

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.130
term big bad

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.060
it's actually something from just means
but the that's when the term was coined

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.690
it were normal billing is typically
outmatched by the heroes in this case

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.050
Captain America and the Avengers Doctor
Strange

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.990
somehow they obtain knowledge in item
some sort of power

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.849
making them in insurmountable threat for
the heroes that's why they're called the

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:36.539
big bad

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.100
you know bad to big bad

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.300
add like normally the Red Skull is a
huge threat

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.730
but imagine him with the power the
tesseract a ball things in the Marvel

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:45.320
Universe

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.650
they can make a normal bill in almost
invincible I think

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.520
the Infinity gems are the best pic
regardless up what goes on in captain

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.380
america: 3

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.910
I think Doctor Strange will featured the
soul gem it just seems like a natural

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.600
fit for that kinda story

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.980
the sole is a much more mystical idea
than what the movies adult was so far

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.920
Doctor Strange is opening that up still
a whole lot more really big pastry stuff

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.860
to talk about some minutes but you will
pry be

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.520
