00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.259
Nancy Sea Siler: "This is my cousin Elkie"

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.359
Nancy Sea Siler: "What do you think we should do? How about the Brigitte Bardot...

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:12.460
you know the Angelina Jolie look? 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:19.460
With the eyes, the lashes, the brows"
Elkie: "Sounds good".

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.429
Start with Concealer 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:29.880
Put concealer on the inner of the eye to keep the eye bright

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.950
Cover any blue tones

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.830
Next use a taupe eyeshadow 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.609
for definition

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.300
Don't wipe on

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.300
You want to tap and push eyeshadow on lid

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.820
Elkie: "I have an itchy lip"

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.820
Use a soft angle brush

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.320
and put eyeshadow under eye

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.410
Use a grey eyeshadow above socket 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.410
So you can see the depth when your eyes open

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.800
Don't forget to blend eyeshadow edges

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.040
to define brows use a firm angle brush 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.960
I'm using a blonde eyeshadow 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.390
It looks softer not like you have eyebrows 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.850
like Bert and Ernie on Sesame Street.  

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.850
Which is preferable...

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.050
To define the ends of your brows we're using 'Fling' by MAC

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.190
It gives you that nice end on your brow

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.280
so they extend out

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.280
Use hair gel and a clean mascara wand.

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.950
Next Bobby Brown Black gel liner and an art store brush.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.060
get the angel right, the best angle can start from either
 
0:02:23.060,0:02:29.749
the tip of your nose or the side of your nostril
to the edge of your brow, 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.749
make sure you get the liner right down to
the lash line and then what you want to do

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:39.309
once you have the line right is make sure it's edge is straight

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.400
as in no feathering on the line 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.490
When you are older and eyeliner looks bad

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.490
don't be sad, 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.119
use liquid liner

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:07.119
open your eyes and then mark the angle 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.199
put a small amount of gel liner under the eye
connecting the lines together

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:24.199
remember only to apply on the very outer of the eye

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.449
Don't forget to draw a line from the inner eye 
right to the top 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.319
so the line looks seamless

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.679
VOGUE

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:45.999
Now we're going to clean up our base under the eyes 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:47.819
and put moisturiser on

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.709
Next- Foundation makeup

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.589
within acrylic foundation brush apply to the 
centre of face

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:02.109
and work your way to the outer of the face

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.749
then with a clean natural fluffy brush buff the
product into skin

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:12.549
If you don't have a foundation brush 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.579
use your fingers 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.909
put concealer under the eyes blending in with your fingers. 
Then conceal 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:23.530
around your nose or where there is any redness

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.330
and on any blemishes or pimples

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.979
to set makeup and to take away shine

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.189
use loose powder, only put where needed

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:43.349
so it doesn't look too much

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:50.349
with a light film of loose powder on your ring finger, 
set the concealer under your eyes. 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.520
Use a peach blush on the apples of the cheeks 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.020
blending up into the cheekbones.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.289
make sure you blend very well.

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:16.360
For this look, the thicker the lash the better 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.449
so we're starting with our first coat of black mascara

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.050
A makeup artist trick, while mascara still wet 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.259
loose powder on a brush and coat lashes with it

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:46.139
That will make your lashes appear thicker

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.149
Ladies don't forget to curl!

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:55.149
It makes lashes to appear longer.

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:05.369
now the second coat of mascara

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:13.219
comb through to get any chunks out 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:20.219
while your mascara is still wet.

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:30.619
Now we need individual lash extensions

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:40.669
they are like little mini wigs that you put on 
top of your lashes

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:47.669
and sometimes they get away from you!

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.960
I had a bad cold.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.830
use tweezers to put place, on outer ends of your lashes

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:04.280
use black eyeliner on the very outer of the lower rim of your eye 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.569
final coat of black mascara 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:14.379
use a lip liner one shade darker than natural lip colour 

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:21.379
and then tap in some lipgloss 

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:25.550
Nancy Sea Siler: "Give a big fat kiss!"

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:42.099
"Do you feel like Brigitte Bardot?"

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:43.879
"Oui!" 
"While with my laugh I sound like Mutley the dog!"
