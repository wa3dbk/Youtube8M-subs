00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.890
Today on our 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee well
be installing the Westin Safari Light Bar

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:13.460
with installation kit part number 30-0005-1135.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.040
To begin our installation well need to remove
the black plastic cover that covers the sway

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.530
bar here.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.080
There are four fasteners holding it in place.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.010
Well remove the fasteners and set them off
to the side with the cover as we will not

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.140
be reinstalling it.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.660
Now, the holes where the fasteners came out
of are actually threaded and they are the

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.660
holes that we will mount our brackets to,
to hold our bar in place.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.790
At this point well go ahead and clean the
threads out of the ball holes here using a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:02:28.140
brass penetrant and the nylon tube brush part
number 814092.
