00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.991
- My name is Dr. Thomas Carr.

00:00:01.991 --> 00:00:05.374
I am a professor at Carthage College.

00:00:05.374 --> 00:00:08.124
(powerful music)

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:15.173
When I was two years
old, my parents gave me

00:00:15.173 --> 00:00:18.055
a book on dinosaurs, and I was captivated.

00:00:18.055 --> 00:00:21.709
But I was particularly entranced by T-Rex.

00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:23.998
And that interest, since it happened early

00:00:23.998 --> 00:00:26.686
in my childhood, very early, that stuck.

00:00:26.686 --> 00:00:29.799
And I've been working on
these animals since 1993.

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:31.903
I did an impact study on them.

00:00:31.903 --> 00:00:36.559
I worked on aspects of their
growth for my masters thesis,

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.720
and really ran with that torch for my PhD,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.243
where I focused on transfer
growth and evolution

00:00:45.243 --> 00:00:48.538
and how we can use growth to
learn about how animals evolve.

00:00:48.538 --> 00:00:50.881
In some ways growth
actually replays evolution

00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:54.095
and that is the aspect
that excites me the most

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:57.947
about vertebrate paleontology
and that's also the topic

00:00:57.947 --> 00:01:02.331
that I train my students
in, in learning how to learn

00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:04.754
about how dinosaurs grew up and how we can

00:01:04.754 --> 00:01:06.803
learn about evolution from that.

00:01:06.803 --> 00:01:10.083
Along the way, I've described
several new species,

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:13.834
genera and species of dinosaurs,
particularly tyrannosaurs

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:17.170
and dome-headed dinosaurs
called Pachycephalosaurus.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.602
And most recently I have named

00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:24.326
Teratophoneus curriei, the
Cur-ries Monstrous Murderer

00:01:24.326 --> 00:01:28.244
from Utah, Bistahieversor
sealeyi which means

00:01:28.244 --> 00:01:30.989
Sea-lies destroyer from the place of

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:32.870
the Adobe formations,
which is from New Mexico.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.697
Alioramus Altai, the other branch from the

00:01:35.697 --> 00:01:39.543
Altai mountains of Mongolia,
it's a Mongolian tyrannosaur.

00:01:39.543 --> 00:01:42.535
And also Appalachia-saurus
Mont-gom-er-ian-sis,

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:45.365
the Montgomery Can-i-ties
Appalachian lizard,

00:01:45.365 --> 00:01:47.384
which is from Alabama.

00:01:47.384 --> 00:01:51.189
Carthage Institute of Paleontology
is essentially the lab

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.356
of the museum; this is a
Carthage specific enterprise.

00:01:56.448 --> 00:02:00.198
And at the helm of the
CIP is Dr Megan Seitz.

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:04.774
And what she will be doing down the road

00:02:04.774 --> 00:02:08.094
is training students in
those lab techniques.

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:10.678
Since 2006, I've been leading expeditions

00:02:10.678 --> 00:02:13.038
to south eastern Montana
to dig up dinosaurs

00:02:13.038 --> 00:02:15.878
from the very end of the age of dinosaurs

00:02:15.878 --> 00:02:18.535
in a unit of rock called
the Hell creek formation,

00:02:18.535 --> 00:02:21.581
which was laid down right
before dinosaurs went extinct.

00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:23.618
And that means that we find bones of T-Rex

00:02:23.618 --> 00:02:27.785
and triceratops; it's the
classic acme of dinosaur times.

00:02:29.097 --> 00:02:31.160
We go out there for a full month,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.089
and part and parcel of that
experience is a field course,

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:36.611
which is offered to Carthage students,

00:02:36.611 --> 00:02:40.612
where we spend a week at the
college, in the classroom,

00:02:40.612 --> 00:02:42.629
where they get their background training.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.829
And then we all go out
together to Montana,

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.886
to dig for two weeks.

00:02:48.886 --> 00:02:50.131
At the middle point, we go to the

00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:53.365
fantastic Museum of the
Rockies in Boseman Montana,

00:02:53.365 --> 00:02:55.664
where they have one of the best exhibits

00:02:55.664 --> 00:02:59.158
of the Hell Creek formation
anywhere that I have seen.

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:01.987
So it really puts the
entire thing together,

00:03:01.987 --> 00:03:04.787
in terms of relating what
we find in the ground,

00:03:04.787 --> 00:03:07.075
what the students find in the ground,

00:03:07.075 --> 00:03:09.805
and what existed millions of years ago.

00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:11.523
So what I provide students is

00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:13.644
a very solid background in anatomy,

00:03:13.644 --> 00:03:16.300
in particular comparative
anatomy of the vertebrates.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.990
That's the gatekeeper to
the rest of the program.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.077
That's followed by a series
of specialised courses,

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:24.380
including our field course,
where we take students

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.940
to dig up dinosaurs in Montana.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.060
A series of other courses
that is focused on

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.337
the theory and practice
of evolutionary theory

00:03:33.337 --> 00:03:36.152
and how that relates to the fossil record,

00:03:36.152 --> 00:03:39.355
particularly dinosaurs and
other back-boned animals.

00:03:39.355 --> 00:03:42.442
This culminates in two experiences,

00:03:42.442 --> 00:03:45.045
the first is an independent
study research project,

00:03:45.045 --> 00:03:48.270
where students actually do
real research on dinosaurs,

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.955
with me as their mentor,

00:03:50.955 --> 00:03:54.022
and that's an unusual
thing for students to get,

00:03:54.022 --> 00:03:56.587
and that's a one-on-one,
semester-long experience

00:03:56.587 --> 00:04:01.487
that always results in a
presentation that is worthy of

00:04:01.487 --> 00:04:04.845
presentation at the annual meeting of

00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:07.238
The Society for Vertebrate Paleontology.

00:04:07.238 --> 00:04:11.238
Most of my classes now
are pretty much hands on.

00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:16.933
Even in lecture, they tend to be hands on.

00:04:16.933 --> 00:04:20.658
So I want to involve
students completely in

00:04:20.658 --> 00:04:24.453
the learning experience, to
the best extent that I can.

00:04:24.453 --> 00:04:26.411
I like to think that
the students get a lot

00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:28.715
out of the courses that I teach.

00:04:28.715 --> 00:04:31.524
Particularly in terms of the content

00:04:31.524 --> 00:04:34.363
and format that I present material in.

00:04:34.363 --> 00:04:38.530
I hope that my courses do
stand out as content-rich,

00:04:41.093 --> 00:04:44.843
as interesting, and that
their view of things

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.040
have changed somewhat in terms of either

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.790
the main technique, method or narrative

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.781
that the course presents.

00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:55.925
Last semester I taught
a human evolution course

00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:58.543
which I hope really
changed students' views

00:04:58.543 --> 00:05:02.411
of being human. The take home
message of that course is

00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:05.868
that the answer to question,
what is it to be human?

00:05:05.868 --> 00:05:09.376
It's hardly anything except
a relatively large brain

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:12.184
and a long lumbar region, that's it.

00:05:12.184 --> 00:05:13.261
We're hardly any different from

00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:15.296
our closest extinct relatives.

00:05:15.296 --> 00:05:18.490
I hope that students
recognize that they're part

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.958
of the natural world and
that they see the world

00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.791
through the narrative
of evolutionary history.

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:30.792
