00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.909
Hey, guys.

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:08.500
Justin with AmericanMuscle.com, super excited
to be standing in front of one of our many

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.830
2015s.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.900
This is our 2015 Ford Mustang GT performance
pack with the 50th anniversary appearance

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.900
pack.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.750
Now guys, this would just be my first quick
impression of the car along with the initial

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.880
dyno numbers and track times of the GT, so
be sure to look for detailed review coming

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.880
your way very soon.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.140
Of course, subscribe if you haven't done so
already.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.970
But again, this is just so awesome, right?

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.560
These things are finally here.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.110
I feel like we've seen this thing come a long
way since last year.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.790
We've all seen the early renderings.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.790
We all heard the rumors.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.650
We saw the release in New York, and now, it's
finally here in our studio, and I for one

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.650
couldn't be more pumped.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.960
So again, let's dive in head first.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.280
We'll give you a quick first impression of
the car.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.420
Let's start with this appearance pack.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.800
Now again, the 50th anniversary pack does
have this trademark grill here throwing back

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.420
to the early sixties mustangs.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.800
Not a huge fan personally, I'm more of a fan
of the fangs with the factory GT grill, but

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.800
it works.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.800
It's very cool.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.220
Now, the 50th anniversary pack also includes
trim around the tail lights and a nice badge

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.710
on the deck lid panel along with some other
interior bits that I'll show you guys in a

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.909
minute, but let's dive under the hood because
obviously, that Coyote motor is back this

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.350
year with some nice little improvements from
the Boss 302.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.130
Now again, the power added so far, 435, 400
at the crank with this motor, doesn't look

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.340
fairly different under here from the S197s,
obviously some new plastic in that air box

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.430
looks to be about half the size of the S197,
but overall of course, we're going to dive

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.430
in.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.220
We're going to throw some power at this thing,
see what it can do, but let's over to the

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.220
side of the car.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.029
I'll show you guys some of those interior
bits and talk a little bit more about those

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:32.180
dyno numbers and track times.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.799
Of course, one of the big things with the
performance pack, guys, these massive six-piston

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:36.799
calipers here.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.740
The Brembo's absolutely huge, biggest we've
ever seen on a mustang and definitely my favorite

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.950
part of the performance pack.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.499
Now again, guys, you can see the fast back
lines of the car really does sleek and black

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:48.740
in the shop, but we'll open it up a little
bit.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.889
We'll take a look at some of the 50th anniversary
interior stuff.

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:55.380
You can see it's kind of embossed in the seats
here, very comfortable seats.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.380
I tell you.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.459
For not being a Recaro, these seats really
do grip you good.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.439
There's some great bolstering going on, and
they're comfy as you know what.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.549
They're actually like sitting in a big La-Z-Boy.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.570
But I think one of the biggest stories here,
guys, with the 2015 is just the interior with

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.900
leaps and bounds above my S197 in just about
every way, totally refined, totally modern

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.100
and again, just a nice step forward.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.129
Now, so far the car drives great with the
IRS and again, I'll get into that more with

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.190
our breakdown, but my initial impression of
the car just rides much better than my S197.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.350
However, it doesn't do burnouts as good as
my S197.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.829
This thing wheel-hops like crazy.

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.540
I mean right off the truck, you'd get a nice,
smoky burnout with the thing, and it wheel-hops

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.629
quite a bit, so we'll fix that in the after-market.

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.239
Don't worry, but in the mean time, just giving
you my thoughts on that.

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.489
So that's it for the interior, guys.

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.469
Again, much better than the S197, at least
in my opinion, but let's get to the numbers

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:44.689
you guys all want to hear, right?

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.160
Dyno numbers and track times.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.640
Bone stock, coming off the truck, this thing
laid down 370 horsepower and 353 pound-feet

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.799
of torque at the rear wheels.

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.840
Now, my buddy, Paul, from Bama Performance
was at the helm during those dyno runs and

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.379
him and his crew are already working on tunes
for this thing, so be on the lookout for those

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.670
very soon.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.340
As for those track times, well guys, we did
have two S550 Mustang GTs down at the track,

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.939
both this black car along with our competition
orange Mustang GT and the best time of the

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.010
night between those two cars was a thirteen-one
at 110 miles an hour.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.010
All right, guys.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.120
Well, there you have it for my quick breakdown
of the 2015 Mustang GT, my initial first impression

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.739
along with those dyno numbers and track times.

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.140
Now again, guys, this is just the tip of the
iceberg.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.829

review coming your way very soon and subscribe
