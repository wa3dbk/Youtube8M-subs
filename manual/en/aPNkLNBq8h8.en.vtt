Hello CoolToys friends. This is

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.970
the Build a Minion: Pirate and Cro Minion.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.000
There are two toys in one package.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.340
On the back of the package there is a list of the parts for Pirate and Cro Minion.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.369
You can also see in the back

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.880
that you could collect different Minions.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:34.469
Lets open the package.

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:53.980
 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.129
This is sticky, this part is sticky... right here in the front.

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.469
Let's take out first the Cro Minion

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.070
Hmm! Nop! I think it is stuck.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.200
from the back.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.000
It is stuck from the back.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.380
Lets see what we have here!

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.119
This is a sword

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.409
with the hand. Ups! The kerchief

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.750
for the pirate, the double eye goggle,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.900
the bottom part of the minion pirate,

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.450
and this one

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.689
we have here the one and only

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:44.960
 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.049
YAY!

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.630
Cro Minion

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.929
So here it is. The Cro Minion has

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.000
the body as you can see, one eye

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.960
and also

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.280
has a tail. Lets see the tail.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.910
Lets see here. Lets get the tail out and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.599
one hand.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.819
This hand actually belongs to

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.360
the pirate. Now, the Cro Minion

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.410
I am going to put that tail on it so it is completed.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.410
Tail up!

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.920
A little lace in the back,

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.130
and in the front you can see it has the club with the hand,

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.079
you can take it off like that,

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:49.389
put it back on if you like!

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.010
This minion has very good movement in its arms.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.910
You can move the arms front or back.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.889
You can also move the hands all around.

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.819
Ok? And you can hit!

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.359
Ok.

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.459
It also has a little hair here

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.540
with the bone as a decoration.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.709
Ok! So this one

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.550
is the Cro Minion.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.260
Lets put together the pirate now.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.750
Lets take out the hand of the hands of the Cro Minion

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.130
the bottom

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.200
along with its tail. Yay!

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.270
And here with the bone

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.300
We have the upper body.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.850
We are going to use this upper body

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.600
to form the pirate.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.810
See!

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.450
Lets do the eyes, and the

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.860
kerchief. Cool!

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.459
Nice Minion!

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.530
How about one hand

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.169
with the sword

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:36.100
There! Yep!

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.120
There! And the

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:47.090
other hand.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.130
If you need help putting the hands on just ask one of your parents.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.930
It will be easy for them.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:09.169
So we have

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.210
You have the Pirate and the Cro Minion.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.259
Two toys in one pack.

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:23.400
under next to you we are going to have

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.180
On our next video we are going to have Kevin and Steward here. They need some help from us.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.389
They need us to help them put together the supervillain jet

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.870
from Megabloks Minions

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.560
and it is a lot of fun, believe me. See you on our next video.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.919
Thank you for watching CoolToys.
