In Surface Stories we follow inspiring
people who accomplish their dreams.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.440
Today in Surface Stories
we look at Taco's story.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.760
The idea for VANMOOF came about...

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.840
while my brother and I were cycling
through New York.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.520
You have to be in another city
to see how nice your own city is.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.320
We saw how nice it is that everyone
goes to work by bike in Amsterdam.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.400
We talked about how great it would be
if it was the same all over the world.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.240
That's how we came up with the idea
of improving the Dutch city bike.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.680
My brother and I designed a prototype,
and we built 100 of those.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.080
We gave them to friends
who used them for one whole winter.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.040
This provided us
with a lot of interesting feedback.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.720
A lot of things went wrong,
but that's how we work at VANMOOF.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.960
We're continuously moving,
changing things, improving them.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.800
A lot of things go wrong,
but right as well.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.280
What's nice about these times, is that
companies conquer the world really fast.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.880
Some Japanese blogger writes about
you, and you start selling bikes in Japan.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.400
That way you become
a global bicycle brand in 5, 6 years.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.360
My brother moved to Taiwan
4 years ago to run our office there.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.440
Most of the bike's design
is done in Taiwan.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.040
I run our Dutch office.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.640
One of my favorite moments was cycling
to Paris with my dad on a VANMOOF.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.200
To ride with your dad through the grain
fields near Paris on your own bike...

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.120
that's really a fantastic moment.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.080
