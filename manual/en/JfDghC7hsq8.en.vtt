00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.890
Now, I'm going to show you some options you
could use your spheres. One of them is to

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.960
create a finial. What I have here it's a precast
part of a column crown and it has a circular

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.360
area, so you could just set the sphere on
top of it or mortar it, or you just set it

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.400
inside of it because it has a nice entrapment
area. So this is pretty much what you end

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.660
up looking. Something like this, if you have
a shrub and you have the garden hose that

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.829
come and hit the shrub, you put a piece like
this that's going nowhere. But it's going

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.359
to stop the garden hose from hitting your
shrub. So that's one example. The other one

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:52.249
I showed you this one here, it was designed
to be made as a fountain, so that's the area.

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:57.539
What I have here, it's a saucer that I have
cast earlier. Another casting this was wet

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.500
cement. I'm going to use it to elevate the
sphere inside of it and you put your pump

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.590
under this piece here and you hook it up to
the sphere. And as you see, I'm not going

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.329
to put it towards the side because it's still
mortared and fresh, you know. But you would

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:30.789
put it with the opening up and you would end
up with something looking like this. Okay?

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:37.939
And you will have a bubbling fountain inside
a saucer. Another way you could also use your

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.880
sphere, what I have done before is you could
put it on top of a pedestal like this one

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.560
instead of the saucer. You could put the sphere
on top of it, it looks great. Spheres they

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.499
make an architectural element in the garden.
They are used on top of pillars as an architectural

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:04.659
element as a finial similar to this one. You
could create a combination of them, put them

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:12.251
next to each other, different sizes. They're
just a beautiful shape in the garden. You

00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:18.590
could color them stain them or put mosaic
on them. There is many way you could customize

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.980
them and the sky is the limit.
