MURRAY: Hi, I'm Murray
from Sesame Street,

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.720
and I'm looking for
the word on the street.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.100
What's the word on the street?

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.154
LITTLE GIRL 1: Adventure.

00:00:07.154 --> 00:00:08.320
MURRAY: What's an adventure?

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.279
LITTLE BOY 1: It's an
exciting thing to do.

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:12.070
MURRAY: Have you ever
been on an adventure?

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.200
LITTLE BOY 2: When
I went camping.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.129
LITTLE BOY 1: We went
on a whale watch.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.570
FEMALE 1: I went and hiked
the Inca trail in Peru.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.570
MALE: Finding the
longest subway train

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.900
and staying on it the whole
way until the last stop.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.880
MURRAY: Whoa, that would
be a great adventure.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.670
Adventure.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.346
That's the word on the street.

00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:31.858
GINNIFER GOODWIN:
Hi, I'm Ginnifer.

00:00:31.858 --> 00:00:32.729
ABBY CADABBY: And I'm Abby.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.562
GINNIFER GOODWIN: And
we're here to tell you

00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:35.530
all about the word--

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.100
BOTH: Adventure.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.720
GENNIFER GOODWIN:
Now, an adventure

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.581
is an exciting thing to do.

00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:41.497
ABBY CADABBY: Oh, boy.

00:00:41.497 --> 00:00:43.810
I do love to do exciting things.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.389
GINNIFER GOODWIN: That
means you love adventure.

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:47.430
ABBY CADABBY: It is true.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.211
I do love adventure.

00:00:49.211 --> 00:00:50.252
GINNIFER GOODWIN: Me too.

00:00:50.252 --> 00:00:53.919
Hey, let's pretend we're
on an adventure right now.

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:55.210
ABBY CADABBY: Oh, that's great.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.224
Let's pretend that we're rowing
across a really wavy sea.

00:01:00.224 --> 00:01:02.160
GINNIFER GOODWIN: Whoa, whoa.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.096
These waves are huge.

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:06.032
ABBY CADABBY: Oh, and
look, there's a pirate.

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:07.115
GINNIFER GOODWIN: Pirates?

00:01:07.115 --> 00:01:08.696
This is so exciting.

00:01:08.696 --> 00:01:09.990
This is an--

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.522
BOTH: Adventure.

00:01:11.522 --> 00:01:12.730
GINNIFER GOODWIN: Oh, oh, oh.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.580
Now, let's pretend
we're climbing

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.630
to the top of a
fairy tale caslte.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.681
ABBY CADABBY: Yes.

00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:20.993
GINNIFER GOODWIN: Whoa, oh.

00:01:20.993 --> 00:01:22.118
ABBY CADABBY: Hey, look it.

00:01:22.118 --> 00:01:23.100
There's knights.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.580
GINNIFER GOODWIN:
Oh, and a troll.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.443
ABBY CADABBY: Oh.

00:01:25.443 --> 00:01:27.842
Oh, yes and a dinosaur.

00:01:27.842 --> 00:01:29.300
GINNIFER GOODWIN:
Oh, Abby, I don't

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.360
think they are dinosaurs
in fairy tales.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.390
ABBY CADABBY: No, I
mean there's a dinosaur.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.755
[STOMPING]

00:01:38.422 --> 00:01:40.130
GINNIFER GOODWIN:
That's a real dinosaur.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.964
DINOSAUR: Yup.

00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:42.950
GINNIFER GOODWIN:
Well, Mr. Dinosaur,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.264
what can we do for you today?

00:01:44.264 --> 00:01:45.680
DINOSAUR: Oh, I
was just wondering

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.800
if you guys would like
to play tag with me.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.370
GINNIFER GOODWIN: Playing
tag with a real dinosaur.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.134
Now, that would be
really exciting.

00:01:55.134 --> 00:01:56.300
ABBY CADABBY: You know what?

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.340
That would be an adventure.

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:02.030
DINOSAUR: Tag, you're it.

00:02:07.422 --> 00:02:09.940
ALEXA: Hi, I'm Alexa.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.868
I'm an "ah" "ah" astronaut
going on a letter

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.844
A, "ah" "ah" adventure.

00:02:17.844 --> 00:02:22.272
Adventure and astronaut
both start with the letter A

00:02:22.272 --> 00:02:25.723
and make the "ah" sound.

00:02:25.723 --> 00:02:27.695
Let's look out
the window and see

00:02:27.695 --> 00:02:33.939
what other things start with
the letter A. Over there I

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.555
see an acrobat swinging
from an asteroid.

00:02:37.555 --> 00:02:39.527
What do you see?

00:02:39.527 --> 00:02:43.344
I see an alligator
eating apricots.

00:02:43.344 --> 00:02:45.804
Now, I'll go around the moon.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.692
Shh, do you hear what I hear?

00:02:52.692 --> 00:02:55.644
An alien is playing
an accordion.

00:03:00.564 --> 00:03:06.960
I absolutely adore
an A adventure.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.360
ERNIE: Hey, old buddy, Bert.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.776
Hey, what do you
say we go outside

00:03:09.776 --> 00:03:11.420
and play some ball,
old buddy, old pal?

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.695
BERT: Not now, Ernie,
I'm reading my book.

00:03:13.695 --> 00:03:15.180
ERNIE: Gee, gee,
Bert, you'd rather

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.360
read some book than play ball?

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.550
BERT: It's not just
some book, Ernie.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.110
It's a really good book,
and I want to finish it.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.160
ERNIE: Well, Bert, what
could there possibly

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.130
be in a book that's as
good as playing ball.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.330
BERT: Well, Ernie, let
me put it this way.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.120
[SINGING] There's a tigers in
my book and a lion in my book.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.370
There's a sneaky alligator
I can spy on in my book.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.830
Sometimes, all I need
is a book to read.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.840
And there are pirates in my
book on an ocean in my book.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.284
There's a sorcerer with secret
magic potions in my book.

00:03:55.284 --> 00:04:01.510
And to learn where the story
will lead, I just read.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.130
On a quiet day, I could
go outside and play,

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.140
but there's
adventure in my book.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.730
So exciting in my book.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.755
Turn the pages,
see the pictures,

00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:16.070
read the writing in my book.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.970
Yes, sometimes all I
need is a book to read.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.880
And that's why I want to read
my book right now, Ernie.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.100
Ernie?

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.030
I'll play ball
with you later, OK?

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.530
ERNIE: Ball?

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.070
Who said anything about
playing ball, Bert?

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.376
Scoot over, pal.

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:37.970
BERT: Ernie, what are you doing?

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.080
ERNIE: Well, Bert, that
book sounds so good,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.170
I want to read it with you.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.860
PIRATE: Aye, we wants
to read it too, matey.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.920
LION: Yeah, can we start
from the beginning?

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.004
TIGER: Yeah, where's the
part about the tiger?

00:04:49.004 --> 00:04:50.879
ALLIGATOR: I'd like to
see the illustrations.

00:04:53.448 --> 00:04:54.900
LION: Turn the page.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.490
ERNIE: Well, it is
your book, Bert.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.026
MURRAY: What is an adventure?

00:05:00.026 --> 00:05:01.650
FEMALE 2: Something
that you experience

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.369
that you've never
experienced before.

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:04.910
LITTLE BOY 3:
Something insane to do.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.980
LITTLE GIRL 2: There's
a lot of new things.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.930
MURRAY: Is it exciting
too or boring?

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.040
FEMALE 3: Super exciting.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.706
FEMALE 4: Something
that's not expected.

00:05:11.706 --> 00:05:13.430
MURRAY: What was your
greatest adventure?

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.388
LITTLE BOY 4: Going on
a trail ride on a horse.

00:05:15.388 --> 00:05:18.270
You get to see
mountains, forests.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.410
LITTLE GIRL 3: I
went snowtubing.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.440
You get in this tube thing and
then you go down a big hill.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.780
LITTLE GIRL 4: You don't
always have to go places.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.780
MURRAY: No, you can have an
adventure in your own backyard.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.821
LITTLE GIRL 5: Adventure.

00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:29.897
MURRAY: That's the
word on the street.

00:05:29.897 --> 00:05:30.980
DWIGHT HOWARD: I'm Dwight.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.550
ELMO: Oh, and Elmo's Elmo.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.258
DWIGHT HOWARD: And
we're here to tell you

00:05:34.258 --> 00:05:35.900
all about the word strategy.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.610
ELMO: Yeah, strategy.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.930
Tell them what a
strategy is, Mr. Dwight.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.290
DWIGHT HOWARD: A strategy is a
plan to help solve a problem.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.110
ELMO: A plan to help
solve a problem.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.900
DWIGHT HOWARD:
That's a strategy.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.160
ELMO: When do you use
a strategy, Mr. Dwight?

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.550
DWIGHT HOWARD: Well, I use--
