Howdy folks hows it going welcome to my virgin
kitchen today i'm showing you how to make

00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:12.759
normal size reese's peanut butter cups.

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.590
Looking good right and they taste amazing
too which is obviously the best thing about

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.080
it and you know what the cool thing is normally
you only need 3 ingredients but because the

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.869
other day I made my own homemade peanut butter
I only needed two so if you wanna have a go

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.730
at making this hit pause now and write that
massive ingredients list down this is how

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.730
you do it.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.870
Quarter fill your saucepan with cold water
then under a low flame put a mixing bowl on

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.241
top of it shove in the chocolate then stir
it until it gradually melts together and it's

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:39.241
super smooth.

00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:44.039
With your chocolate melted arrange some cupcake
cases onto a tray now I use the standard size

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.199
ones but you can get these little diddy ones
or you can get the massive muffin ones that

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.420
sounded wrong but you know what i'm saying
or you could obviously do that huge giant

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.489
mould thing that James did in the other video.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.949
So what you want to do is start to add a little
bit of chocolate into the bottom of all of

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.320
those just to cover that initial layer and
give it a base.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.269
With all your bases done you're gonna plonk
it in the fridge for fifteen minutes just

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.330
to initially set.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.860
Once the fifteen minutes is up and your base
is just firm enough to hold the peanut butter

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.040
spoon down the peanut butter now I must point
out i'm using the homemade stuff as I say

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.650
so it was a little thicker and I could get
that consistency I wanted the stuff you buy

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.610
in a store you might want to thicken that
up a little bit and actually sweeten it too

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.400
with some icing sugar so that's where that
3rd ingredient would come in.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.280
So get your peanut butter all around the edge
don't let it touch the edge just give it a

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.680
little gap all the way around just kind of
like a little disc on top and then it's ready

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.670
for an extra layer of chocolate so pour that
melted chocolate on top and completely coat

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.770
it spoon it around so that it's nice and level
then whack it in your fridge to fully set.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.850
It's gonna need a good 45 minutes to an hour
in there to completely firm up once they are

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.460
ready unpeel them from your cases and that
is it all done looking good and they've even

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.860
got that ripply edge look around the side.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.700

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.790
and all that stuff.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.380
But that is it, told you it was easy, hope
you give it a go, that is how you make your

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:09.470
very own homemade reese's peanut 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:27.940
butter cups.
