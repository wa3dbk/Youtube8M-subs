00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.830
So now we're going to try a large, exterior
hip circle.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.330
Step out right underneath your hip bones,
so nice and wide, keep the knees slightly

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.570
bent, chest up, arms out, lower abs engaged.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.430
We're gonna shift the weight all the way out
to the right, and again all the way out to

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.170
the left.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.150
Once again, all the way out to the right,
and all the way out to the left.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.170
Keeping the knees slightly bent, and once
again do not let yourself bounce up and down

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.770
in space.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.280
And slide out, and out, and out, and out.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.550
Now turning sideways, keeping the knees slightly
bent you're gonna push your hips all the way

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.930
forward, and all the way back, and as you
push forward make sure that your chest does

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.219
not lift so you're not pointing chest up,
but you're actually staying neutral, the same

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.500
way you normally are when you're standing.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.670
And when you shift all the way back, as well,
you wanna keep the neutral lift.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.070
As you push front, you're going to feel your
upper abs get engaged, nice and tight.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.970
And as you push back, you want to make sure
that you're dropping the tailbone down, engaging

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.300
the lower abs, so you're not arching your
back, you do not want to release it back,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.300
keep it neutral.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:28.360
And sliding forward, and back, and forward,
and back.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.800
Now we're going to combine those into a hip
circle.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:39.530
Pushing out to the right, pushing forward,
pushing over to the left, and back.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.270
Out to the right, forward where you should
feel your upper abs, left, and back and you

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.890
should feel the contraction in your lower
abs.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.920
When you connect them you create a hip circle.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.080
Now this hip circle is traveling outside of
your normal alignment so when you're standing

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.740
neutral, this is your normal alignment, but
when you push into the large hip circle you're

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.560
going to come outside of that.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:27.860
Let's try that with music.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:53.640
Let's try going in the other direction.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.730
So that's how you do a basic, large, exterior
hip circle.
