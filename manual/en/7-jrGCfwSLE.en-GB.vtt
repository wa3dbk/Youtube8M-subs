00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.720
Welcome to PowerDrift folks,
Now I'm here at Mahindra's off road facility

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.620
in Igatpuri to experience what it takes to
scale mountains.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:22.750
To be king of the hill and to help me do that,
this is my steed, the all new Mahindra Thar

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.180
4x4.
The Thar was launched way back in december

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.020
2010 and was a successor to the famed MM540.
Bits and pieces of other Mahindra jeeps were

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.620
also borrowed to create this all new off roader
that was just as happy muching highway miles,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.360
as mud.
It was well recieved by off road enthusiasts

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.250
as well as customers looking for a lifestyle
vehicle.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:01:01.250
Although the car looks the same Mahindra has
made numerous changes to the car, to make

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.820
it more appealing to it's customers.
For example on the inside the dashboard now

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.610
gets two tone finish, this three pod instument
cluster is new, the steering wheel is new

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.110
as well as the gear knob.
The whole floor pannel with the two cup holders

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.160
is new and last but not the least, the seats
are also redesigned to be more comfortable.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.880
If you look here the whole door pad has been
changed as well to have this small little

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.170
arm rest for comfort.
The subtleties continue on the outside as

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.330
well, at the front the headlamps get clear
lenses, the front bumper has been redesigned,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.450
and the wheel arches have also been redesigned
to accomodate larger tyres for offroad.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.640
The changes on the side are limited to just
this redesigned foot rest which gets really

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.000
slipery when it's wet,
and at the back the bumper has been redesigned

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.349
and so has this canopy.
But the biggest mechanical change on this

00:01:54.349 --> 00:02:00.300
car is under here, the rear diff now gets
a lock up function, to get you out of those

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:08.580
sticky situations.
And here under the hood is the same 2.5 litre

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.910
CRDe engine, it remains unchanged because
it doesn't need any change.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.380
It's got 105 horsepower and 247 Nm of Torque
and drive the rear wheel in the 2W drive more

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.950
and all 4 wheels in 4W drive mode through
a Borg Warner transfer case.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:32.000
All of that jabbering out of the way, let's
go and do what we came here to do, let's have

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:50.510
some fun in the slush.
There are 2 courses where you can see what

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.350
the 4W drive can do, Omkar is driving and
I'm just here for the ride, let's see what

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.820
it can do off road.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:13.400
And here this obsticle is called bone yard
and the water is deep.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.780
Oh yeah...

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.270
The car made it look easy.
That was pretty scary !

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:41.260
But the way this car goes, that was amazing.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:50.400
So it's finally my chance, my turn to drive
and I've just been instructed that if I'm

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.190
on the left hand side of the track,
the car might topple over, so I have to be

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:13.650
in the centre.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.700
It was really exhilarating to experience a
Thar in it's element, that is off road on

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.900
tracks.
It's just amazing what this car can do, I

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.510
can't wait to get my hands on this car for
a longer period, but that is a story for Thar

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.930
review.
