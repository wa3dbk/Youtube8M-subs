Hey what's going on YouTube?

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.480
This is El Tiro.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.710
Today's Tutorial Thursday is going to be on
a concept called Catching Waves.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.090
So this can be really quick, really easy but
can be applied in multiple ways in your freestyle

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.330
to make it really cool and diverse.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.840
So this freestyle is under the assumption
that you know how to wave.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.160
And today, we're going to use examples of
simple kinds of arm waves and body waves.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.830
So the concept is you have this ball, this
ball of energy.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.460
And right when it flows to your body, it's
going to wave.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.680
So for example, if I'm holding my waving ball
of energy right here, I'm going to toss it

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.440
up in the air.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.790
And I'm going to actually look it up.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.140
It creates that animation effect.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.140
It's up there.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.360
I'm going to do a quick grab with my left
hand, and pop!

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:11.100
Grabbed it and I'll start to wave on my shoulder
down to my fingertips, like so

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.330
So I have ball of energy wave
To make your waves have a cooler effect, what

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.140
we're going to do is we're going to hit after
we end that wave.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.040
So for example, toss that up, grab, I'm going
to wave and I'm going to hit at the end.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.430
That little effect will actually do a lot
of damage into making your wave look super

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.140
cool, super dope, super awesome.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:44.980
So for concept, from start to finish, we have
ball of energy, toss up, pop, wave and hit.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.220
A couple of different directions, you can
just really mess around just want to make

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.220
it fun.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:58.360
Grab, toss, left hand snatches, wave, pop
up, maybe it goes to your foot and up, grab,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:14.489
you can wave going down, pop, swallow it,
spit it out, whatever you want to do, you

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.670
know.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.840
Using your ball of energy, it's a really fun
concept.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.120
In fact, a lot of my popper friends, when
we are ciphering and getting down together,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.280
we pretend we have this ball and that's what
we kind of pass and kind of dance move on,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.090
so I would be like popping it down and then
pop, wave and then I'll kind of throw it at

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.090
him.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.780
So hopefully, he'll start you know using that
same concept.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.420
So there you go, cool tutorial Thursday on
catching waves.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.900
In fact, here's my ball for you.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.700
There you go, wave with that.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.310
So I would love to see you applying this concept
in a video response to this video.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.599
If you do, I will hook you up with a shout
out.

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.819

to dance, you can check out my website, www.brambilabong.com.
