00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:02.083
-Man, where is Orange?

00:00:02.083 --> 00:00:04.000
This is supposed to be a surprise party.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
-Well, surprise. He never showed up.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.583
-Maybe he's stuck in traffic.

00:00:07.583 --> 00:00:09.083
-Bro, we live in a kitchen.

00:00:09.083 --> 00:00:10.635
-I can't believe it.

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:12.458
It's his birthday party and he's not even here.

00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:14.500
-Umm...there's no one else here.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.792
-That's not true.

00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:16.833
Midget Apple made it.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:18.167
-He means Little Apple.

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:19.583
-Whoa, where'd that come from?

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:21.042
-Midget Apple's inside the cupcake.

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:22.375
-Little Apple!

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:23.625
-Why would you do that?

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:25.333
-Well, duh. It's a birthday party.

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.292
He's gonna jump out of the cupcake and sing to Orange.

00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:29.083
-You don't do that at birthday parties.

00:00:29.083 --> 00:00:30.083
-You don't?

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:31.083
-No.

00:00:31.083 --> 00:00:32.500
-Does this mean I can come out now?

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.500
Hello? Hello?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.000
-Hey, sorry I'm late for the party.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
-Hello?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.708
-Hi, I'm Marshmallow.

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:39.708
Will you be my friend?

00:00:39.708 --> 00:00:42.333
-Get me out of this cupcake and I'll be your best friend.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.333
-Yay!

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.375
Let's sing a song, best friend.

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:46.042
-Dude, I'm stuck in a cupcake.

00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:47.542
-Oh, I don't know that song.

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:48.542
I'll make one up.

00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:49.667
[tune of This Old Man] Marshmallow's here

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:50.875

-Hey, what are you talking about?

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.042
I'm not late, I'm an orange. [laughs]

00:00:57.042 --> 00:00:59.417
-Hey, you're here!

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:01.208

00:01:01.208 --> 00:01:02.792

00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:06.208
-Happy birthday!

00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:07.833
Wait, whose birthday is it?

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.279
Wow, I've never been to a birthday party before.

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:14.750
What are we supposed to do?

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.125
-It's your birthday, Orange.

00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:17.417
You can do whatever you want.

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:18.417
-Really?

00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:19.417
-Totally, buddy.

00:01:19.417 --> 00:01:20.750
-Then I want to do target practice.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.500
-Umm...okay.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.000
-[hacks, spits]

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.208
Bull's-eye.

-Hey, I just bought...

00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:28.708
[grumbling, screams]

00:01:28.708 --> 00:01:29.917
-Whoa, double bull's-eye.

00:01:29.917 --> 00:01:31.250
[laughs]

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.875
-[high-pitched voice]: Not cool, dude. Not cool.

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:34.917
-[laughs] You sound like Marshmallow.

00:01:34.917 --> 00:01:36.583
-Yay! Let's sing a song.

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:37.583
-Stupid helium.

00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:39.583
-Guys, why don't we just open some presents?

00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:41.292
-Can we start with the cupcake?

00:01:41.292 --> 00:01:43.417
-Orange, [clears throat]

00:01:43.417 --> 00:01:47.000
[normal voice]: Orange, we all decided to pitch in and get you something you always wanted.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.167
-Ooh, is it a laser-guided stud finder?

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:50.208
-Uh, no.

00:01:50.208 --> 00:01:51.458
-A hot tub filled with fondue?

00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:52.792
-No, that's gross.

00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:54.500
This is something you've always wanted.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.500
Remember?

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.667

-Ooh, is it my birthday?

00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:02.417
-No, it's not your birthday party.

00:02:02.417 --> 00:02:08.325
-[repeating]: I want my Wii pony.

00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:10.625
Oh, it's a pogo stick.

00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:11.625
Yay!

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:12.625
-Oh, for the love of--

00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:13.625
it's a wee pony.

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:15.333
-[giggles] That tickles.

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:16.375
Stop eating me, pony.

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:17.375
[giggles]

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:18.542
-Wow, he's pretty small.

00:02:18.542 --> 00:02:20.625
-Well, you wanted a wee pony.

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:22.042
-He knows how to play Nintendo?

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:23.875
-No, he's a pony.

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:26.583
-Oh, well, I wanted a pony that could play Wii.

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:27.833
-Oh, for crying out loud.

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:29.500
-Hey, what about me?

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.958
It's getting a little hot in here.

00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.583
-Uh-oh. -Whoa! -Oh, crap.

00:02:32.583 --> 00:02:33.833
-Oh no, my best friend's on fire.

00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:36.167
-Quick, blow it out before it burns Midget Apple.

00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:37.583
-What's Midget Apple doing in the cupcake?

00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:39.000
-It's Little Apple!

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.326
[screams]

00:02:41.326 --> 00:02:44.375
Get me out, get me out!

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:47.875
-Aah.

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:49.458
-Phew, that's much better.

00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:50.875
-Is it getting hot in here or is it just me?

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:52.958

I just wanted to drop by and say happy birthday--

00:03:21.042 --> 00:03:22.333
Oh, crap.

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:25.000
