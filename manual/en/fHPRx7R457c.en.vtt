Hi! This is Elise McMahon for Expert Village
and we are talking today about how to teach

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.570
your dog a reliable stay. If you would like
to find out more about my services, you can

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.780
visit my website at canineheadstart.com. So
we were talking now about introducing the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.770
stay and we have discussed the very first
time you start even to use a behaviour that

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.270
your dog is familiar with. Now that we have
introduced that concept, we can use another

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.870
position that your dog might be less familiar
with and that would be the down or the stand

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.079
for most dogs. So I am going to just show
you how to do that with both of those behaviors.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.620
Munchkin this way… good girl… I am going
to ask her for a different position. Ursa

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:57.579
sit… down… good girl… .stay. I am going
to just again stay by her and reward her for

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:04.170
holding that position. I am not challenging
the situation by trying to move away from

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:13.829
her. I am giving her frequent rewards and
then I release her. Okay good girl. Now we

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:29.670
are going to do it in the stand. Here sweetie…
Ursa… stand… stay… good girl… good

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:38.840
girl… now the stay requires the dog… good
girl okay. The stand stay requires that the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.899
dog not move her feet from the position that
you put them in. Not every dog owner is going

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.499
to be that specific but that's really what
we are asking for when we ask for a stand,

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:57.390
stay. You put them in a position and they
hold that position. So you can see that we

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.310
have moved from working with an easy behaviour
for the dog working with the sit into working

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.109
with a slightly more difficult behaviour for
the dog which is holding the down and holding

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:12.930
the stand and in the beginning of working
with this you are just going to stay right

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.000
there with your dog.
