00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.779
Today on our 2010 Scion XB, we'll be installing
the Tow Ready T1 Connector, part number 118468.

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.560
First, we'll open up the rear cargo door then
we'll remove the floor liner jack storage

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:21.099
cover, the center foam compartment, and two
interior trim compartments.

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:30.189
Next, we'll go ahead and remove the rear threshold.

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.370
After that, we'll remove both access panels,
one behind each tail light assembly.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.530
As you can see, this is now giving us access
to the rear tail light assembly and wiring.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.329
We'll go ahead and take our Tow Ready connector
and the yellow and brown wire connector and

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.719
feed it up from underneath the trim behind
the driver's side tail light assembly.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.539
Then we can press in the locking tab from
the manufacturer's connector and disconnect

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.860
the wiring from the bolt and socket.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.079
Now, we can go ahead and plug in line with
our Tow Ready connector and matching up the

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.320
manufacturer's connector with the Tow Ready
wiring harness.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.480
My next connection will be the red power wire.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.860
The red power wire will attach to the black
power wire provided with our install kit using

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.630
one of the yellow butt connectors.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:04:19.790
We'll strip back both ends 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:57.700
of 
the wire, add 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:06:15.660
the butt connector, and crimp them down.
