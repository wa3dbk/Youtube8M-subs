Hi. I'm Mike Meyers with Zion Wilderness Survival
School, I don't know why I can't get that

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.849
right, for Expert Village. We talked earlier
about being prepared for any sort of a wilderness

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.769
outing. But no matter what you do, it doesn't
mean that you can't get yourself into difficulty.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:25.161
You can't get lost. It happens all the time.
So, the key thing is what are you gong to

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:29.960
do once you realize that you are lost. You've,
you've walked up onto this hill. You look

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.710
around. You have no idea where you are or
reasonably no idea. First thing I recommend

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.739
is sit down. Find a nice shady spot, a nice
rock. Get your water bottle out. Take a swig.

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:48.899
If you have some snacks, maybe even eat some
snacks. Calm yourself down. Don't allow yourself

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.890
to get panicked and just taking off in some
direction hoping that's going to be the right

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:02.129
way to go. Sit down. Think. Think about your
predicament. Look at the weather, at your

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.369
location. Hopefully, before you ever left,
you told somebody where you were going and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.460
when you expected to be back. And that person
is somebody who's responsible enough they're

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.189
going to call the rangers or the police or
somebody and tell them that you're lost, that

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.369
you never came back like you said you would.
If you've done that, then the smartest thing

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.400
probably is to stay right where you are. Because
you're probably close to where you should

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.299
be. If you start wandering about looking for
your way out, you could make it even worse.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.110
And, if a search pattern develops, and they're
out looking for you, and you start wandering

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.680
around, you might leave one area and go into
an are they've already searched. Now, they're

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.759
searching the area that you left. And, you
get yourself into sort of a ridiculous pattern.

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.890
If you happen to hear somebody in the area,
maybe a helicopter flies over, one of the

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.220
items you should have in your, in your pack
is that emergency signaling mirror. Another

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.880
item you might use, remember that solar blanket,
notice that it's very shiny. It's large. You

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.619
can lay that down on the ground. Even if you
put it over yourself to keep the sun off of

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:16.140
you, it's still reflecting. So, it's a signaling
device. Find a nice, open, flat area, the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.750
best you can. If you can use rocks, put boulders
together or logs or a combination of both

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:34.950
to spell out the letter "X", better yet is
three Xs. Groups of three is a SOS technique.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.410
Sometimes you can use brush, anything that's
going to stand out on the landscape. You need

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.530
to use something that's significantly different
colored than what you're standing on. Otherwise,

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.890
it's just going to blend in. Stay put. Look
for somewhere where you can hunker down. Get

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.410
out of the sun. Get out of the rain. Get out
of the wind. But, try to put your signaling

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:04.510
devices out in the open where people are going
to see them. And, again, don't panic. Inventory

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.650
your gear. That's the last thing that I tell
people. Sit down and lay all your gear out

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.730
in front of you kind of like we did in a previous
episode. And, ask yourself, "What do I have?

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.290
What am I going to need? And, what can I do
with what I've brought with me?"
