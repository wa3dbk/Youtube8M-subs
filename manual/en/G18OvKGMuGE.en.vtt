00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.640
The Recruiting business isn't easy,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.390
the competition is fierce

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.980
and countless things can affect your
success:

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.600
like a lack of trust in client
relationships,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.960
not enough quality job orders, or inaccurate or non-existent feedback from your clients

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.359
not enough quality job orders, or inaccurate or non-existent feedback from your clients.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.960
Would you like the ability to work
smarter,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.660
adapt and succeed over the long term,
while utilizing their current resources

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.429
you already have?

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.049
Welcome to the Candidate Exchange:

00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:31.569

entrepreneurs who know what it takes to

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.520

We help you to capitalize on existing applicant resources.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.740
Let us explain:

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.420
What percentage of your applicant
database and previously sourced resumes

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.870
are used for placements?

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.860
The answer is very small. Now with the Candidate Exchange those unused resumes can become

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.640
placements and bring in

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.710
more recruiting fees.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.999
We supply the clients and job orders

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.410
You fill the open spots with your database of applicants.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.280
That's right, we get the job orders and
you fill them. What it costs to join?

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.530
What about free? There are no costs of fees associated with being a member.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.900
