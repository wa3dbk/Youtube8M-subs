00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:17.720
Arong Puppymung, where have you been?
Where is Subin?

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.190
Puppymung: I haven't seen her. 
Maybe she has overslept?

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.340
Arong: Oh, do you think so? 
I really hope she's alright...

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.250
Puppymung: Arong, take a look - 
I made a paper plane! Arong? Hey...

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.920
Arong: Puppymung, let's go check on Subin.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.869
Puppymung: Oh, alright...

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:37.300
Subin: If you'd watched where you were going,
you wouldn't have bumped into me!

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.890
Frong: It was all your fault! You bumped
into me because you were running so fast

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.000
Arong : Subin! Subin!

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.680
Subin: Arong

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.919
Arong : Hey, Subin! What's going on?

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.419
Subin: He bumped into me 
while I was running down the road...

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.560
Frong: She knocked me down, 
and my map flew away!

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.220
Subin What?! You walked into me 
because you weren't looking!

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.760
Arong: Alright, settle down now, 
that's enough from both of you.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.680
Frong: But what about my map!?

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.280
Subin: Ughh!

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.790
Frong: Huh? Wait, may I see that paper plane?

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.640
Puppymung: This? Sure, here you go...

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.100

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.009

Yay!

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.559
Friends: Huh?

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:26.859
Frong: This is it - the map I just lost!

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.000
Puppymung: It is? I though it was just a piece of paper, 
that's why I used it. I'm sorry.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.349
Frong: That's alright - thanks to you, 
I have my map back!

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:34.879
Subin: Hmmm...

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:40.870
Frong : Oh...I'm sorry I was mean to you.
I was just upset that my map was gone.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.860
Subin : That's O.K. I should've been more
careful. It was my fault, too.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.820
 I'm sorry I got angry.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.290
Frong: No, I'm sorrier!

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.510
