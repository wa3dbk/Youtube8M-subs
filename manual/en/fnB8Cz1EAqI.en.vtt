beautiful along with two related scripts
doors but was never use

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.910
in games radar

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.340
they moved on as one of the top 12 we
are displayed in games ever

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.450
moved on is designed to be used by
people with little

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.230
are no programming experience but with
some artistic talent and patience to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.570
learn

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.340
of course having some programming
background is give you a bit of a head

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.650
start however

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.070
if you're just looking to play with
calorie content only did knows how to

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.160
unzip files and edit the text file

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.700
the game only comes with one or two
characters already pre-installed

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.220
so for educational purposes I'll give
you a short example on how to install

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.310
more characters and getting them to
appear on the game's interface

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.370
for stop this intellect but its official
website to obtain the latest version ok

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.340
Mugar

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.230
second find the move on character your
choice

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.870
more per website you'd like

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.539
third once the file is downloaded well
the complete folder

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.000
but the character to the church folder
very quickly

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.430
go and make sure that the boulder ni is
the same name as the death row

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.290
which I believe is case sensitive

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.400
or go to the data folder in open up the
file select adapter

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.220
with no pet

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.680
once you open up the file scroll down to
that insert your characters line

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.550
and type in the name of the characters
all their below and save the file

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.459
now it all went well our character that
we just

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.489
added should appear on the selection
screen in this same technique would be

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.180
done with adding stages

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.420
in spring bash brown

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.330
one like I'm the only flaws but I found
with this game

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.880
that a crash dummie constantly using the
old versions due to bad bigger Asian it

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.739
also takes a while to load depending on
how many stages

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.110
impaired because you have installed i
download a free factor him

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.160
which had about 800 characters and 200
stages the new

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.590
the new

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.970
another thing that kinda button was as
bright side

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.040
allow them to be bigger or smaller what
they're really supposed to be

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.640
which kinda felt outta place one else
playing on overall

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.640
I really like the concept that the key
even the user freedom important role the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.250
roster is a really neat idea

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.350
so pure panic to debating and I
definitely recommend you check this one

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.690
out considering it's free

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.690
healing up much to lose good

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.310
 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.300
p yeah okay

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.300

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.170

on

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.030
