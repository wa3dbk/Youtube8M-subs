00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.200
TheFNDC.com presents Drinks With Diablo:

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.200
The Green Gummy Bear.

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.200
Hallelujah!

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.000
That's right; we're coming back to you on Drinks With Diablo.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.800
We're bringing you the Green Gummy Bear.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.000
And what you're going to need for this one today:

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.900
Midori melon liqueur,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.888
orange vodka, or Absolut Mandarin.

00:00:25.888 --> 00:00:28.333
We've got Skyy Blood Orange vodka.

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:31.000
And lastly, 7-up.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.050
So let's get busy.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.050
So it's half an ounce each of your orange vodka

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.050
and Midori.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.050
[ shake with ice ]

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.333
Pour it out into your shot glass.

00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:00.333
And then top it off with some 7-up.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.333
&gt;&gt; Inferno: You're going to explode.

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.222
&gt;&gt; Dîablø: Am I?

00:01:04.222 --> 00:01:05.222
Nope.

00:01:10.777 --> 00:01:12.100
Alright, there we go.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.500
The Green Gummy Bear! 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.100
Whoo-ooo!

00:01:20.444 --> 00:01:22.100
Mmm. Interesting.

00:01:23.888 --> 00:01:25.444
It kind of does taste like a gummy bear.

00:01:25.444 --> 00:01:26.888
It really, really does.

00:01:26.888 --> 00:01:30.100
Okay, obviously the Midori is giving it the green color,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.000
but the orange vodka is giving it the gummy bear flavor.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The 7-up helps to even it out,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and complete that taste.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.555
The Green Gummy Bear:

00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:40.111
simple as can be.

00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:41.970
Midori, Orange vodka, and 7-up.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.000
