00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.300 position:84%
LARRY HOWELL: So this is a 1/20th scale prototype of a

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.200 position:63%
solar array for a solar panel for space…

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.700 position:98%
MILES O'BRIEN: The inspiration for this design is origami - the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.000
Japanese art of paper folding.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.400 position:89%
LARRY HOWELL: With these origami concepts, we can compact

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.200 position:95%
them very small for launch, and then once you get into space,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.130
right, they can be very large.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.130 position:83%
MILES O'BRIEN: With support from the National Science

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.570 position:94%
Foundation, mechanical engineer Larry Howell and his team at

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.570 position:98%
Brigham Young University combine this ancient art with the latest

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.130 position:88%
engineering tools. The result? New creations, from space

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.430
hardware to home furnishings.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.570 position:95%
LARRY HOWELL: We do things what we call compliant mechanisms,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.600 position:97%
which are things that – that get their motion from things that

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.100 position:77%
bend and deflect, instead of hinges and bearings.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.670 position:84%
And, eventually we realized origami – it's moving – is

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.830 position:75%
getting its motion from the deflection of paper.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.100
It's a compliant mechanism.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.230 position:89%
MILES O'BRIEN: And, these folded designs are usually more

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.870 position:80%
flexible, have fewer moving parts, and require less

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.030
maintenance than traditional ones.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.030 position:89%
LARRY HOWELL: Yeah, it will probably have to be tilted or

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.030 position:58%
something, so it has a stable state….

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.670 position:94%
MILES O'BRIEN: And, what works for paper, can also work with

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.500 position:56%
fiberglass, acrylics, even titanium.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.230 position:92%
LARRY HOWELL: This is a 3D printed titanium. We worked with

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.900 position:84%
NASA Marshall Space Flight Center… with no bearings or

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.570 position:97%
hinges, friction… cause it looks really crazy, but it has a very

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.930 position:97%
important precision motion. And, here is that same device, but

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.700 position:80%
shown in a thruster, so there's the thruster that's

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.000
positioning a satellite.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.170 position:80%
MILES O'BRIEN: Howell's origami-inspired inventions

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.000 position:84%
include medical devices - like artificial spinal disks

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.200
and injectable forceps.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.200 position:95%
LARRY HOWELL: One of the ideas is what we call Oriceps, where

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.530 position:94%
you can have this very small device, but then can morph into

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.330
a pair of forceps.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.600 position:91%
ROBERT LANG: Fold the two top flaps one toward us one away

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.270
from us…

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.000 position:86%
MILES O'BRIEN: Howell works closely with origami artist

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.570 position:97%
Robert Lang, whose art is guided by math and engineering. And,

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.030 position:89%
industrial design students collaborate with Howell's team

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.000 position:77%
to create trendy furniture and consumer products.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.500 position:91%
NICOLE CROSS: And, this right here is inspired by origami.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.200 position:94%
This is a traditional butterfly chair with just a variation.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.830 position:97%
LARRY HOWELL: So, I think a lot people when they hear you know –

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.500 position:94%
origami - really? But, we're talking about applications that

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.000 position:94%
can really make a difference in the world, to do things that

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.500 position:94%
have never been done before, because we have this connection

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.170 position:98%
of this learning that comes from origami and then this connection

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.170
to the engineering.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.800 position:98%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, whether it's catching solar rays in space or

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.300 position:97%
devising a better way to inject DNA into a cell, these engineers

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.030 position:91%
make it look good on paper - and more. For Science Nation,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.030
I'm Miles O'Brien.
