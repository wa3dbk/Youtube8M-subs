00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.049
E3D's v6 hotend introduced a boatload of changes
from the earlier v5 models, which improve

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.090
its performance, reliability and looks.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.139
I'm Tom and today i'm going to show you how
to put it together.

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.309
Before we start, if you want to know to know
more about what i think about the updated

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.600
design and what changes were introduced, check
out my review right here!

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.880
So, as with the previous versions, the E3D
hotend still comes as kit for you to assemble.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.260
When you open up your package, you'll find
the heater block, the heat break, a nozzle,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.650
the heat sink, a heater cartridge, a thermistor
with ferrules, sleeving, wire and heat shrink,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.129
the fan shroud, a fan, a bag with screws and
a hex wrench, and, if you bought a bowden

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.329
version, you'll also get the bowden connector
and the bowden tubing.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.960
You'll also need a Philips number one screwdriver,
a 16 and 7mm wrench, a pair of pliers and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.070
something that makes hot air, either a lighter
or a heat gun.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.300
So let's get to it!

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.780
We'll start out with assembling the metal
parts.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.520
So, take the heat break and screw it into
the heatsink until it's just finger tight.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.610
Keep in mind that the heat break is a somewhat
fragile piece and should be treated carefully.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.750
Then screw the nozzle into the heater block
from the side that is closest to the holes

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.220
for the thermistor and heater cartridge.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.640
When it's all the way in, unscrew it by a
quarter turn.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.750
Then screw the heater block with the nozzle
onto the heat break.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.250
Again, just finger tight.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.530
Make sure the nozzle stays at the quarter-turn-out
position, because you actually want the nozzle

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.530
to seal against the heat break and not against
the heater block.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.520
Next up, we tighten everything down.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.280
Use the 16mm wrench to support the heater
block and tighten down the nozzle, but don't

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.450
over-tighten it, you want to be able to unscrew
the nozzle should you need to.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.180
Then let go of the heater block and grab on
to the heatsink and tighten the nozzle a bit

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.180
further.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.600
This will actually tighten the heat break
inside the heatsink.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.640
Next up, we'll install the thermistor.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.280
Now, instead of having to deal with Kapton
tape as with the v5 and previous designs,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.860
the v6 now uses a glass fibre sleeving and
a clamping screw to hold the thermistor in

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.240
place.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.709
So to insulate the thermistor's legs, we'll
cut a piece of sleeving that's about a centimeter

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.299
shorter than the thermistor's legs and slide
it onto the thermistor's legs along with a

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.099
piece of heat shrink and a ferrule.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.700
Strip about a centimeter of the connecting
wires' insulation and bend both the bare ends

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.640
of the thermistor's legs and the wire into
small hooks and hook them together.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.900
Slide the ferrule over each connection and
crimp it down - you can also use your pliers

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.379
beforehand to compress the hooks and make
the ferrule slide over them more easily.

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.800
If your sleeving is long enough to reach into
the ferrules, make sure that it sits as close

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.780
to the thermistor's head as possible before
crimping it down.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.579
Slide the heat shrink tubing over the crimped
ferrule and use your heat gun or lighter to

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:50.579
shrink it.

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.959
So, next up, we can install the thermistor
into the heater block.

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.769
Slide the thermistor all the way into the
matching hole in the heater block, then push

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.389
down onto the sleeving to make sure that it
sits all the way at the thermistor's head

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.980
and bend the legs over so that they are flush
with the heater block.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.060
You can also bend the legs beforehand to ensure
that the sleeving stays right at the thermistor's

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.060
head.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.450
Spread those legs until they clear the threaded
hole below them for the clamping screw.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.050
Then grab the included hex wrench, the short
M3 screw and the washer and screw down the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.470
thermistor's legs.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.379
You should tighten this screw fairly well
to reduce the risk of it coming loose.

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.150
It's probably also a good idea to check and
re-tighten this screw after a couple of hours

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.129
of printing.

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.090
When screwing it down, don't hold on to the
heatsink, but only to the heater block or

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.219
you'll risk bending the heat break.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:45.849
Next up, we'll install the heater cartridge,
which simply slides into its hole in the heater

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.060
block and then gets clamped down with the
long M3 screw.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.059
Try and center the heater cartridge in the
heater block.

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:57.459
So all we have left now is the fan.

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.069
Screw that onto the fan shroud and push it
over the heat sink.

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.109
If you have enough space above the hotend,
you can install the fan shroud upside down

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.519
to get you a bit more room around the heater
block.

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.599
If it doesn't fit upside down, use it the
other way around, though that way you'll have

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.639
to pull it off the heat sink when you're working
on the heater block or the nozzle.

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.530
Now, if you're using a bowden hotend, you'll
also need to install the bowden coupler, which

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.500
simply clips into the top of the heat sink.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.021
When installing the bowden tubing, make sure
to push it all the way down into the heat

00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:29.250
break.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.500
To release the tubing, hold down the bowden
couper and pull the tubing out.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.900
Now, before you start printing, you should
hook up the fan to 12V, select the right thermistor

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.639
in your firmware, run PID autotune and then
heat up the whole hotend to about 280Â°C.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.430
Once it's all heated up up, tighten the nozzle
down one more time.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.430
This makes sure that nothing is going to come
loose even when things are expanding and contracting

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.820
as they heat up and cool down.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.460
E3D's hotends require very little to no maintenance,
but should you need to remove the nozzle,

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.979
you can simply heat up your hotend and unscrew
and replace the nozzle by itself.

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.490
It's probably a good idea to unscrew the heat
break a bit first to reduce the chances of

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.930
damaging it.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.240
Always hold on to the heater block when tightening
or unscrewing the nozzle.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.560
And that's it, we're done!

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.699
Happy printing!
