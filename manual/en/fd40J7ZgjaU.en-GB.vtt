00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:23.250
The Skoda Octaiva has a huge boot, seem, and
plenty of space for a family, and that's why

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.939
people normally associate it with words like
comfort and practicality. However with this

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.399
one performance and fun also apply... because
it's the hot VRS model.

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.320
Under the bonnet is the same 2.0-litre turbo
petrol engine you get in the Golf GTI- and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.339
that makes it fast. Surprisingly fast.

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:57.239
With 220hp on tap the Octavia VRS can rocket
from 0-60mph in 6.6 seconds and on to 154mph.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:05.241
As in the Golf GTI the engine is really smooth
and responsive. And pulls hard even from very

00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:26.920
low down in the rev range. It's sound pretty
good too.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.640
The car comes with a special membrane to pipe
engine noise into the cabin. It's activated

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.159
in sport mode which also weightens the steering
and sharpens the throttle response while individual

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.400
lets you mix and match settings.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.899
Considering the size and the performance the
VRS is still quite economical as Skoda says

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:55.740
it will do almost 45.6mpg. But if that's not
enough then there's always the diesel model,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:06.810
which can return over 61.4mpg yet can still
do 144mph and 0-60mph in 7.8 seconds.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.050
Whether you go for petrol or diesel power
all VRS's come with a variable ratio steering

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.820
for faster responses. And it means you can
go round tight turns without having to take

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.941
your hands off the wheel.

00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:27.840
The VRS is still pretty comfy even though
it gets lower stiffened suspension over the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.720
normal Octavia for improved cornering and
added grip.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.830
You really do notice the benefit as it just
corners faster and flatter than the standard

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.980
car. Some clever new electronics also help
improve the handling too by braking the inside

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.060
front and rear wheels when you are going round
a bend to help slingshot you round. In some

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.920
ways though you do need it because ultimately
the Octavia VRS's extra bulk over the Golf

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:21.980
GTI means it's just not as agile and it 
doesn't feel quite as keyed into the road

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.850
as the RS Megane.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:40.670
You can get the DSG -- dents performance and
economy. Finally there's the design. Despite

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.300
some sporty tit bits the VRS doesn't feel
that exciting inside. For instance the new

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.660
sports seats don't stand out like the two-tone
versions in the old car.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.580
And while the VRS may have a boot spoiler,
twin tail pipes, a new grille, some larger

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.700
alloy wheels and coloured brake calipers it
doesn't look like as racy as a Vauxhall Astra

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.320
VXR.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.310
Still some people will find the wolf in sheep's
clothing approach appealing plus the Octavia

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.410
VRS is cheaper than pretty much all of its
rivals. And it should be very reliable too

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.539
as Skoda came second in 2013 driver power
owner satisfaction survey. In fact seeing

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.870
