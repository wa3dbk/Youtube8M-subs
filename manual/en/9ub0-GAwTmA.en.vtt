Hi this is Gary Schutt and I’m going to
talk to you about tap harmonics. Tap harmonics

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.470
are when you take your tapping finger on your
right hand, either your first finger or your

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:16.190
middle finger and you play your note on your
left hand, today we’re going to use C on

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:23.359
the 5th fret G string, we’re going to take
our tapping finger, this is how we tap harmonics,

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:31.239
it’s different from regular tapping which
is tapping in the middle of the frets to get

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:37.920
your note, what you want to do is tap right
on the fret, but don’t press on the fret

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.550
because you will bend your notes sharp and
it will sound all terrible, you want to lightly

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:53.780
bounce off the fret which will give you a
nice harmonic. No C not, tap on the G note

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.800
12th fret G string, it’ll give you a G,
if you tap an octave from your C, you’ll

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:09.590
get another C, if you tap on an E you’ll
get an E. So you will get all the harmonic

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:19.600
notes of the major chord when doing this,
you have your root, 3rd, 5th and if you know

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.350
where everything is, then you can do whatever
you want. Or, you can just experiment by hitting

00:01:26.350 --> 00:02:05.029
anywhere and hope you come up with something.
Another cool trick is to trill, let’s say

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:11.810
we’re going to use our open G string and
the 2nd fret G string A. You trill really

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:19.030
fast and you take your tap finger and you’re
going to lightly rest your finger on that

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:29.260
string and move it up and down between the
picks.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:41.250
And this works basically on any of the strings.
And it’s a really cool sound.
