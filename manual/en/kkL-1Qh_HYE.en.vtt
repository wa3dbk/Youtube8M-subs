00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:07.439
There's something very meditative about fly
fishing.

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.840
There's something special about the experience
when you're one with nature.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.639
You sort of become part of the experience.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.521
And that is something that really drives you
to want to come back again and again.

00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:22.110
Trout fishing is so cool because they're little
fish with big fights.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.189
Or big fish with even bigger fights.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.820
And they're so beautiful, especially in the
fall.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.190
The male's have orange bellies... and they're
just a lot of fun to catch.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.550
Maine Lodges are magical.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.620
You go into the Maine Lodges for the first
time and you really don't want to leave.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.929
It's wild, it's beautiful, and it's away from
everything else.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.909
It's a place to really unwind and unplug.

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:56.140
AMC's fly fishing experience is unique because
the ponds aren't crowded.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.729
You can be alone on a pond fishing, or you
can have someone help you, guide you, train

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.550
you, teach you to fly fish - all the fundamentals.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.230
And it's quiet, there's a chance to see moose
and deer.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.530
What people need to bring with them when they
come to the lodges is a sense of adventure.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.850
They don't need to bring a fly rod, they don't
need to bring a boat, they don't need to bring

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.850
anything.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.200
We can provide almost everything they need
here.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.549
And if they have a sense of adventure then
we can get them out there and they can have

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:25.549
a great time.

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:26.880
Yeah, it's really beautiful here.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.619
It feels great, and I enjoyed every minute
of being here.

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:31.619
My cabin is wonderful.

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.840
I just love it.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.479
They just aimed me at the place where there
were fish.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.909
And, honestly, I'm not that great a fisherman.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.689
I just happened to find a great place to fish
and it was marvelous up here, and we just

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.100
caught fish like more than I've caught in
the last year.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.170
I was a little worried that I'd be able to
get anywhere near being able to master fly

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.170
fishing.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.500
It was surprisingly enjoyable and easy to
accomplish learning how to fly fish.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.749
The Appalachian Mountain Club owns 66,000
acres-plus of land here in the heart of the

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:12.030
100-Mile Wilderness, and they've protected
it against development, and they set it up

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.940
as a perfect recreation area for people who
want to come to Maine to get away, to get

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.040
outdoors, and to do things that really make
you connected to the world itself.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.040
Once you're connected to the world itself
then you understand why it's important to

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.000
take care of things, and that's what we're
all about here.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.790
We're here to teach you, to give you that
space, and to have you help us conserve this

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.700
land so that it's there for our kids and for
our grandkids.
