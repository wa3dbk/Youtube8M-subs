00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.120
Here's an overview of the different
types of gears found in the EV3 kit.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.260
Most of them are named after

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.559
the number of teeth that they have
smallest tier is an eight-tooth gear.

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.390
There are two

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.390
12-tooth gears,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.700
There is a 16-tooth gear,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.000
a 20-tooth gear, 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:56.000
a 24-tooth gear,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
a 36-tooth gear, and

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.000
a 40 tooth gear.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.900
Within the first set of gears,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.900
I'll highlight a couple of these. The ones I've
highlighted there

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.540
are beveled gears. Beveled gears have

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.160
rounded edges to the gear. This means not
only

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.970
can it fit together like this, but it can
also fit together

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.750
at angles up to ninety degrees,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.300
and still function. This allows the gear

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.300
to change the direction of motion. Additionally,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.380
there's a worm gear, a knob wheel,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.550
a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.580
pulley wheel, which also functions

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.140
as a wheel if you put rubber around the
outside edge,

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.940
and a small

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.150
turntable gear.
