Hey everybody!  This is Randy Santel, "Atlas" with Atlas &amp; Zeus Promotions and

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.740
proud owner of FoodChallenges.com

00:00:23.634 --> 00:00:28.754
Very excited today!  Had a good day in Chicago in The United States yesterday.

00:00:30.073 --> 00:00:36.233
I beat the 5lb burger challenge.  Today I'm all the way over in Coalisland, Northern Ireland.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.960
I'm at Yankee Star Grill house.  I'm taking on their 50 States Burger Challenge!

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.980
This is the first European challenge to kick off my 2015 UK &amp; Ireland Tour.

00:00:51.774 --> 00:00:58.014
I've got 25 minutes to beat this monstrous burger, with 36 ounces of beef, bacon, pulled pork,  

00:00:58.014 --> 00:01:01.620
delicious looking cheeses, awesome bun and some onion rings, and then we've got

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.400
this side order of fries.  I've got 25 minutes and if I finish I get a free shirt, I'll get a sweet present

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.800
from the restaurant for winning.  Only one person has beaten it, and its my friend Mark Coney

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.900
who finished in just over 22 minutes.

00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:19.493
Lets get this challenge defeated!

00:01:32.286 --> 00:01:38.446

over the next two months.  Lets get the first one down in record time!

00:01:45.794 --> 00:01:46.914
