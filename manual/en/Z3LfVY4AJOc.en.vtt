Hi! My name is Ann and I am here to talk about
management. What is management? It is something

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.790
you need to learn to do at home where you
are going to teach your son or daughter how

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.349
to be a successful kindergarten student by
learning certain rules. Learning for example

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.579
that there is a special place in your home
where you are going to do homework, that there

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:32.430
is a special time of the day or evening where
you have decided to put aside to do the homework,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.410
that you go over rules with consequences.
For example if you do not do your homework

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.370
what were the consequence be for your child
or if your son or daughter does not behave

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.760
in school, what consequence will he have at
home or she will have at home if they do not

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.150
follow the rules at school. An easy consequence
could be for example a timeout of one minute

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.170
or another consequence could be that you cannot
watch TV for one minute and remember when

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.909
children are small one minute could be an
eternity. These are the kinds of time management

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.890
and organization within your home, that you
want to start looking at so you know what

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.450
to do when the situation arises and you have
to look to discipline to solve the problem.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.039
Thank you so much.
