I'm grateful to the YMCA because coming here has literally changed my life, my body, to do

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:16.340
things in the pool that I've never, ever
done before. I'm very very blessed to be able to

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.000
come, and I look forward to it because it
changes my body,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and there is no pain in my body when I swim.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
With Clint's help I've been able to swim without any life preserver.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
What really got me was he said

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:01.090
that when he was in the water, it felt like heaven, and that got to me. So I was like, I gotta

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.830
meet this guy. How are you doing today, Bill? Terrific. My favorite place to come. Getting

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.650
in shape, and the crew is like family. We
love working with Bill, and it brings you

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.500
up. You can have the worst day in the world,
and Bill will show up, and he just brings

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.650
up your day. When Bill comes in the middle
of the wintertime, he looks like he's a rock

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.970
star or some sort of celebrity when he comes
in the exercise room because of his black

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.670
fur. They all want to touch it. Everyone just
kinda flocks. As well inspire other people.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.200
He's not going to sit around and wait for
something to happen. I'm marching up and down the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:51.090
pool, doing laps, and the most wonderful thing of all is the staff. They're great. So this is

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.570
the only time you'll catch Bill not smiling,
when he's focused and working.  You keep going, Bill.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.740
Coming up on 40 minutes. He's walking about six miles every time he comes. And definitely,

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.000
he just loves to go into the lobby and tell everyone about the record he broke that day.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Double digits. Work it, work it, work it.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I feel in my heart that I'm a small Arnold
Schwartzneger because I have muscles on top of muscles .

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But the greatest thing is when I come into the door of the Y, I know I'm home.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I'm home to another wonderful family.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.410
I don't think Bill realizes that I think the Y needed him more than he needed the Y. He's just

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.000
a great, great man. I am blessed to know him.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.700
Even my pastor said I would be walking in the pool,

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.010
and that's exactly what we did. Walking. It was like getting a brand new body and going to

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:07.840
heaven when I walk. Thank you, thank you Lord for the YMCA, because I love this organization

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.500
and its people with all my heart.
