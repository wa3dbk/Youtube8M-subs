00:00:21.962 --> 00:00:23.642
Got room...for one more?

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.700
They call him...

00:00:34.903 --> 00:00:35.783
The Hangman.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.040
When the handbill says "Dead or Alive"

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.948
the rest of us just shoot you in the back from up on top of a perch somewhere

00:00:42.948 --> 00:00:44.894
and bring you in dead over a saddle.

00:00:45.207 --> 00:00:48.087
But when John Ruth "The Hangman" catches ya...

00:00:49.517 --> 00:00:50.157
you hang.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.260
Get in boys!

00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:59.353
This here is Daisy Domergue.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.230
She's wanted dead or alive for murder.

00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:04.975
When that sun comes out

00:01:05.428 --> 00:01:07.428
I'm takin' this woman to HANG.

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:11.149
Is there anybody here

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:13.047
committed to stoppin' me

00:01:13.657 --> 00:01:14.777
from doin' that?

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.330
Well, well, well...

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.314
Looks like Minnie's Haberdashery's about to get cozy for the next few days!

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.680
Yes it does.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.240
One of them fellas

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.860
is NOT what he says he is.

00:01:38.822 --> 00:01:40.262
Move a little strange

00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:41.491
you gonna get a bullet.

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.179
Not a warning, not a question.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.800
A bullet.

00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:53.402
Now we're talkin'!
