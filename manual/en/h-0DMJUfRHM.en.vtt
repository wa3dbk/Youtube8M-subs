Nate: Hi, this is Nate Storey with Bright
Agrotech.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.700
Today, I'm going to talk a little bit about
whether or not conventional hydroponic solutions

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.480
are safe.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:23.390
As many of you guys know, we have both organic
and conventional farms.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.529
We're growing organically with our aquaponic
production in this greenhouse here.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.470
We've got also a conventional farm down in
Colorado where we're growing with hydroponic

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.620
solutions.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.040
The question arises a lot, and a lot of people
ask us this question because they know we've

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.710
got our hands in both parts of the industry:
Are conventional hydroponic solution is safe.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.680
A lot of people will say, well you're growing
with chemicals.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.010
That' can't be safe.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.440
I always have to talk with folks and make
sure that they understand that yes, we are

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.440
using chemicals, but we're also using these
chemicals in our organic systems.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.900
The question is not the chemicals being used
because the plants absorb certain nutrients

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.570
in certain chemical forms.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.140
That's just how plants work.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.200
They take nitrate whether it's synthetic.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.450
They take nitrate whether it's mined.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.780
They take nitrate whether it comes from the
decomposition of proteins and the oxidation

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.780
of ammonia in our aquaponics system.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.670
It's all the same thing.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.740
The reality is yes, we're using chemicals,
but we're always using chemicals even in our

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.770
organic systems.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.790
The real question here is source.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.460
What is the source of these chemicals, and
how comfortable are we with this source?

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.409
A lot of the folks that purchase organic,
including a lot of our customers, we eat mostly

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.580
our organic produce because we're up here
in Laramie and this is where our farm is.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.090
When we're down in Colorado, we're eating
a lot of our conventional produce.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.580
The reality is that it tastes very similar.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.010
Oftentimes, believe it or not, the conventional
stuff is a little bit more nutritionally balanced

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.619
simply because the plants have all the nutrition
they need.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.500
At the end of the day, I feed my family both
things.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.229
I know that both things are very safe.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.049
I know that both things are grown by me, are
grown by my people.

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.939
I'm very comfortable feeding both conventional
and organic hydroponic produce to my family,

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.349
to my child to my wife.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.920
At the end of the day, nitrate is nitrate.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.050
There's no difference between nitrate that
we get through synthetic processes and nitrate

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.770
that we get through organic processes.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.219
That's always the big question.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:42.049
Whether you buy organic or whether you buy
conventional, probably the more important

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:50.489
question to ask is what is the pesticide exposure
from eating this product, and was it grown

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.090
sustainably, and was it grown locally?

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.159
At the end of the day, for me nutrients are
not the big question.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.760
Nutrient sources are even not the question.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.290
A lot of conventional nutrients are actually
produced more sustainably than some organic

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.670
nutrients.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.169
We want to be thinking about our organic nutrients
in the same way that we think about oil, as

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:13.190
the same that we think about a lot of our
other finite resources.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.859
Really, what I'm saying is this is way too
big of an issue to really get into in a single

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.290
five- to seven-minute YouTube video.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.510
You as a consumer need to do your due diligence.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.010
You need to do a little research.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.199
You need to understand that even in organic
systems, a lot of the time we're mining rock

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.209
phosphate.

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.920
We're mining guano, Chilean nitrate, you name
it.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.459
There's all of these different forms of these
same chemicals that are used in organic systems,

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:47.599
that are mined, that come from natural sources,
that are currently being harvested unsustainably.

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.109
As a grower, I have to think very carefully,
not just about the safety and the quality

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.090
of my product and what my customers want,
but also where I'm sourcing a lot of my nutrients

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.090
from.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.159
There's a great argument to be made for conventional
over organic in some areas.

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:09.549
There's a great argument to be made for organic
over conventional in some situations.

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.709
Keep that in mind, and understand that nothing
is as clear-cut as it seems.

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:20.259
When it comes to nutrients, there is a very
great middle road for both organic and conventional

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.259
producers.

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.669
As far as your health is concerned, you have
nothing to worry about.

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.810
We've been eating conventional hydroponic
produce for a very long time, and it is pretty

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.720
darn safe, especially the way it's being practiced
now.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.990
Thanks so much for watching.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.250
If you find this information useful, check
out the Vertical Food Blog.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.280
We'll go into a little bit more detail on
the subject over there.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.690
At the end of the day, our goal is to just
give you good, fair-balanced information from

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.490
a guy that farms both organically and using
conventional solutions in hydroponic systems.
