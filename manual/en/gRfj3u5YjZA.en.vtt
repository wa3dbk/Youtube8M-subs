00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.360
Gritty Urban Saga so a group

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.410
at least it claims to be a group might be one
guy

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.070
um a group by the name of Derp has chosen
to attack

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.749
several companies web sites and servers

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.360
chosen to do DDoS attacks which

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.770
um it sounds very sophisticated but

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.910
basically they just overload these
servers

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.580
to the point where um they get denied
service thats basically what it means denial of

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.090
service

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.649
so um they took down EA's website they
took down the

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.769
League of Legends servers um they did a
lot today

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.289
this is probably not the first time I haven't
looked

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.710
their past very much because i dont want to give them a lot of creedance

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.239
so basically this is what they've done
and

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.679
at this were I go off on my own because
there's a part of this story that really

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:54.519
upsets me

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.309
more than the actual on DDoS attacks
that they're doing

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.309
on this the part kinda upsets me is where
they say it's all for the lulz

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.290
um which just meaning laughs and things
but lulz

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.280
lulled me to sleep because they these
are obviously people

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.500
or a person that's a lot of time on
their hands

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.039
and and as sure you guys have seen Dark
Knight um

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.789
he just wants to watch the world burn basically there's
no

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.140
reason behind it and there's definitely

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.479
people doing this who have talents with
computers not that

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.079
DDoS attacks are the hardest things to do but
um

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.460
it does take a little bit of effort a little bit of time
that these people

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.829
could be using to create their own website later
do something good

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.140
where that they could actually on make some
money off this

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.380
not get thrown in jail as they were
tweeting out

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.609
I'm now this is the part that really
starts to upset me about this whole story is that

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.380
when I checked their tweets because
they were actually

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.509
as they were doing this they were
confirming that they were about to take

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:57.509
down EA's site

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.990
they're confirming they're about to take down a
league of Legends servers um

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.210
and as these things went on there's
their followers

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.460
continue to rise actually took
screenshots here

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.920
um to show that yes the actual followers
continue to rise by the minute

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.280
you could see four minutes later five
minutes later

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.870
11 minutes later this kept going up by
the hundreds on

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.510
and this is the part that bothers me is
yes there are always going to be people

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.390
here and there

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.409
who want to uh hurt someone uh want to do
something

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:31.640
just that's funny to them and then they
don't have any regard for what other

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.069
people are doing with their time

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.319
but to for hundreds of people

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.909
to start following this group now um
that's just

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:45.670
that I don't like that that's sort of
hero

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.730
hero worship basically there are people
out there who

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.840
not only want to hurt people but they also

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.230
applaud other people we're doing these
things and i think thats the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.540
the wrong way to go about this and I
hope

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.780
I hope the police come in and during one
of their tweets that they said that they

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.890
had to leave the Starbucks they were in
because the police started asking

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:06.540
questions

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.370
so on I don't know how safe they are in
doing these attacks

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.379
but but I should hope that the police
get ahold

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.659
these guys and stop them because you
know with all the attacks that have been

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:18.709
happening with the

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.340
Target the PlayStation Network
everything I just

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.959
really think that there needs to be a
precedent set that really

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.459
lets people know that it's not okay and
to do these things and it's not for the

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.150
lulz

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.189
nobody's gonna be a lulzing for you when
you're in jail

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.269
and you're not gonna be able to hack your way out of there so

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.370
an yes oh these Derp guys yeah

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.290
you named yourself aptly Gritty Urban Saga
