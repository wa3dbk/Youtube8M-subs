Hello! My name is Aaron Moon and I’m here
today on behalf of expertvillage.com. Another

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.500
rudiment in the same family as the flam’s
is the flam tap and the flam tap is basically

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:30.150
a flam with one extra hit, so it’s… So
I’ll do that a little slower for you, it’s

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:41.730
the same thing the hand that’s starts off
is going to be doing the last hit so it’s…and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:57.469
that’s your flam tap. The last rudiment
and there are countless rudiments to do so

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.629
I’m only going over a few today but the
last one I’d like to share with you is the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:10.110
paradiddle. Now the paradiddle is kind of
like the game where you rub your stomach and

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:25.270
pat your head, it’s meant to work with your
right and left hand and create unity between

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.570
the two and it’s easiest to say which hand
is hitting while you’re doing it. So without

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.689
even playing it’s going to be right, left,
right, right, left, right, left, left, right,

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:45.979
left, right, right, left, right, left, left
so it sounds like…paradiddle, paradiddle,

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:58.270
paradiddle that’s the name. Now I was doing
that with my right hand on the base and my

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:09.619
left hand on the rim you can do it with both
hands on the rim, you can do it with both

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:23.810
hands on the middle base.
Yeah, that’s the paradiddle there’s a

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.580
double paradiddle which is basically right,
left, right, left, right, right, left, right,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:47.720
left, right, left, left which is just an extension
and I’ll leave you with that one… Thanks

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.920
for joining me I hope this helped out and
I hope you enjoyed the hand drum the Djembe.
