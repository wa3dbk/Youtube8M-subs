doing you exactly

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.249
absolutely

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:53.000
find out why did it happen dot com slash
membership

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.600
president obama i read this morning

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.220
signed

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.140
whistleblower protection bill

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.220
i actually think that this is a good
thing for u_s_ workers

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.440
who uh... need more protections

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.540
federal employees specifically for
exposing fraud waste abuse in government

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.340
operations there were a number of
restrictions previously on

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.020
whistleblowers like for example you are
protected

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.840
if you art at the first person to blow
the whistle about a particular

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.290
fraud waste ur abuse incident well how
do you know if someone else's blown the

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.370
whistle at the time that you're thinking
about wong the whistle doesn't work very

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.020
well

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.730
so this new bill is basically a
thirteen-year

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.220
by supporters of whistleblower rights

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.570
and the law closes a number of these
loopholes which have been created by

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.830
precedent set by court rulings and a
number of protections that have been

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.959
removed now whistle-blower laws make it

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:46.860
you see

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.890
to punish supervisors who try to
retaliate against government workers

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.459
maybe easy's an overstatement maybe
easier

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:55.370
is that right

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.200
terribly

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.930
the new legislation is gonna go beyond
just restoring some of the protections

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.689
it's going to

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.589
expand whistleblower rights it will
clarify protections for example

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:08.769
whistleblowers will be able to challenge
the consequences of government policy

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:09.500
decision

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.319
that's very good

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.259
specific protections would be given to
certain employees including government

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.170
scientists

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.290
who challenge censorship i think that
that's fantastic course and workers at

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.490
the tea essay who provided airport
security would also be covered under the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.989
the whistleblower law for the first time
namin todd what's your reaction to that

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.400
what what exactly could there be

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.230
from the t essay that would be important
for them to be covered under

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.669
whistleblower protections what could
they be blown the whistle on

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:38.099
uh... i have no idea

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.230
abid seems difficult to say but this is
a nightline approve of this this is

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.219
agood transparent move to try to make

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:47.269
uh... leader to try it and not

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.659
attack the messenger of someone who's
blowing the whistle on

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.739
obviously illegal activity well that was
my initial reaction

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.019
uh... i'm not so convinced of it now
list for a couple of different reasons

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.499
don't some two specific reasons actually

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:01.759
patriot act

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.269
and andy a

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.749
and what i mean is this

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:11.229
don't some aspect of the patriot act and
andy a supersede and nullify

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:15.489
some of these specific whistleblower
protections in the sense for example

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.609
indefinite detention as allowed by the
end dat

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.279
this is wide latitude

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:24.869
to say listen this person who is a quote
whistleblower

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:28.559
they are not being retaliated against
for being with some blowers it's simply

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.589
that the information that they put out
there

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:34.839
is broadly under the scope of something
that

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.700
could affect national security

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.750
we need to investigate their involvement
we need to investigate a lot of things

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.640
here and we're indefinitely detain this
person couldn't that argument be made in

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.179
adults angelino five the whistleblower
protections by notice is only one

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:50.789
overlapping area

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:52.909
but it's still a concern

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.709
right i suppose it would

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.099
i mean a

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.439
unfortunately that the patriot act

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.479
uh... allows for

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.609
basically

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.769
are uh... our government to do anything
they want essential anything they want

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.110
under number front

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.220
i think you can be a whistleblower and
go through the proper channels at the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.590
same time and not be a whistle-blower

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.060
are going to the media you know what i
mean certainly on so i'd think

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.569
if there's discretion

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.280
you may not have to worry about things
like that but i guess it depends on the

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.469
nature of what's going on i'm concerned
about whether some of those provisions

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:28.999
in n_b_a_ would would essentially no
apply some of the provisions of this

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:30.210
whistleblower protection bill
