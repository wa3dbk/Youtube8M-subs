Hi, I'm Katie Bowers and we're going to be
going through some kickboxing moves. I'm going

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:19.689
to begin with a wide horse stance. I will
have my feet parallel with the knees. Keep

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:26.920
abs and gluts nice and tight. Start with a
shoulder roll to warm up - this will be a

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.200
long process. With the shoulder roll, you
will not use your elbows your will use your

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.579
shoulder. The shoulder will lift up and pump
synovial fluid into the muscles. Continue

00:00:38.579 --> 00:01:01.250
to breath; do not hold your
breath. Continue to keep the abs and gluts

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.560
tight and notice that the heel is picked up
off the ground each time I am turning. This

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:15.320
is a very key element throughout all the kickboxing
moves. If you do not lift your heals off the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:30.259
ground, you will start to tweak your knees.
Begin to rotate the shoulders and continue

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:50.870
to pick up your heels from the ground each
time you rotate your shoulders. As you continue

00:01:50.870 --> 00:02:09.300
to warm up, you will make the circles bigger
remembering to lift your heels off the ground.
