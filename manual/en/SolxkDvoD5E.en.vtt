00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:05.029
You may have seen her on Comedy Central, Jay
Leno, Conan, Jimmy Kimmel.

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.490
When Maria Bamford steps onto the stage, pretty
much nothing’s off limits.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.290
And forget about being politically correct.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.610
She’s fearless.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.270
Maria will be appearing on the new season
of “Arrested Development.”

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.810
I spoke with her earlier this year.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.810
Okay, you just finished “The Special Special
Special,” which one can buy on the internet.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.650
On the internet, $4.99 at chill.com.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:37.030
I decided to do a comedy special, and I didn’t
want to go anywhere.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.830
And the people that I generally want to please
in my life are my parents.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.370
So why not go straight to the source?

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.930
Did a hour-long stand-up special for my parents
in my living room.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.720
I fear this scenario: you lose everything,
including your mind, except the part of your

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.510
mind that knows that knows that you lost everything.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.460
They’re the only audience members except
for some sound man, and the boom operator,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.140
and then there was a keyboard player.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.070
There’s an opening act, Ms. Jackie Kashian.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.670
And that was really helpful because, you know,
I don’t wanna go out there cold.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.670
Not in front of your parents.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.079
Not in front of my parents.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.079
And they were great.

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.700
They did, I have to say - full disclosure
– I did pay my parents.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.750
So they are a paid audience.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.820
Kind of changes the –

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.640
It does change a lot.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.929
But it was non-union, so.

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:32.549
So you released this only online.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.549
How come?

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:34.750
Yes, only online.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:43.770
Well, that was the business model, inspired
by Louis C.K. and Aziz Ansari and Rob Delaney

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.280
and many others now.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.079
That, instead of waiting to be asked to do
an hour-long special on Showtime or Comedy

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:01.659
Central or whatever, to just be able to do
it yourself and hope that your fan base is

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:02.659
big enough.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.020
And I’m a very niche comedian.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.619
I’m an orchid of comedy.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.290
Only under certain environments does it.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.890
Oh, it’s a little too cold!

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.600
And so, but yes, I think it can really work
for a lot of artists.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600
Did it work?

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.600
Yes, oh yes!

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:30.220
I earned three times the amount that I would
have earned from a, for example, Comedy Central

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.810
special within the first two weeks.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.661
In your “Special Special Special” and
in your comedy in general, you touch on some

00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:40.590
pretty raw issues: mental illness, your mental
illness.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.820
Yes, that’s my favorite topic of this time.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.820
Whoa, I don’t get it!

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.250
Apparently she’s supposed to be funny.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.480
I just think she’s schizophrenic.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.950
Oh clearly that is not my mental illness.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.130
Schizophrenia is, of course, hearing voices
not doing voices.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.880
I am bipolar, too.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.210
I do, yeah, I just get really passionate about
that issue.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.260
There’s been mental illness in my family.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.010
But then as a nation we’ve been.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.240
I think one of the current statistics is over
7,000 U.S. veterans are dying of suicide every

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.030
year, and I think the reason for that, at
least in terms of my experience – and this,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.320
of course, without any scientific information
to back it up – but, you know, I live in

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.160
Los Angeles, you know, which is the hippie-dippy
capital of the world where you could ask for

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:38.130
help presumably anytime, and I had trouble,
you know, going for help to be hospitalized

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.290
at a point when I was at risk to myself because
it was so shameful.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:54.010
And I am thinking of doing a new app where
it’s like a travel guide for psych wards

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.190
because there’s a real difference in quality
between the psych wards, yes.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.070
You’re out of it so…

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.220
It’s like a trip advisor.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.850
A trip advisor kind of thing, because it’s
a miserable, awful experience but sometimes

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.220
there are some that are better than others.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:18.719
I thought that would be funny and fun, because
there is such shame going around.

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:26.449
I had a really hard time finding anything
of where to go or how, information on it.

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:31.870
And you’re not exactly in your right mind,
so to speak, in the moment.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.870
Exactly!

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.210
You’re feeling terrible, so yeah.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.270
So when you bring these issues up on stage,
and in this particular case, in front of your

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.640
parents, what are you doing there?

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.050
Are you telling them things that you can’t,
you don’t feel like you can tell them offstage?

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:59.000
No, they know the whole thing, and my mom
had manic episodes, so she’s been hospitalized

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
before.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.279
So they have only been supportive.

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:11.509
And yeah, I mean sometimes I guess, yeah,
I think I do do a little bit of passive aggressive

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:17.319
stuff like I had a friend who was very spiritual
who came to visit me in the hospital and has

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:22.690
that belief where you know when you say, “I
have the flu.”

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.819
And somebody says, “You know, I just don’t
get sick anymore since I started standing

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:26.819
in my truth.”

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.460
You know, and it’s like, “Oh, come on!”

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.379
And I had a friend visit me in the psych ward
saying, “Maria, this place is so negative.

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.159
You know, you’ve gotta get out of here.”

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:42.580
And I’m like, “Yeah, I would, but my brain’s
going off like a jackhammer untethered, and

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.310
they 5150’ed me and took away my shoelaces.”

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.370
“No you need to get into nature.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.699
Like go up to Big Sur.”

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:50.699
“Right?

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.789
Like so I can get off a cliff or like go slowly
into a cold body of water, never to be found.”

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:01.360
“You know, I just think maybe it’s your
time, you want to move on to the next world,

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.360
you know.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.680
And so I’ve come in to say ‘good-bye.’

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.650
You’re ready to move on.”

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.190
“Okay, you’re horrible, and please come
visit me tomorrow, and you’re horrible.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.729
Hey why don’t you bring that little ray
of sunshine over to the children’s hospital.”

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.930
“You wouldn’t have to make a wish if you
believed.”

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.099
You know, that’…

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:19.280
That’s is horrible!

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.849
But that’s a very classic thing that either
people put it into terms of, you know, like

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:29.520
you can get yourself out of it, it’s not
a genuine illness, it’s a moral failing.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.639
And/or the moral failing, as in spirituality,
like, “Oh, you’re just, you know, you’re

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.279
blocking your chi, you’re not being honest
with yourself about some thing.”

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:44.250
Which I go, “Well, there are some elements
of that which may be helpful, but at the point

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:50.720
that somebody has a plan and is gonna, that’s
ridiculous.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.629
And that the brain isn’t an organ like any
other part of the body that can malfunction.

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:58.129
Well Maria Bamford, thank you for coming in!

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:59.779
Thank you for having me.

Development” in the spring, and also you
