[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:24.575 --> 00:00:25.200
-Hey, everyone.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.255
I'm Mindy from "Cute
Girls Hairstyles."

00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:28.510
And today I'm here with Kamri.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.010
-Hi, guys.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.426
-And we're going
to teach you guys

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:32.159
have to do a Scissor
Waterfall Combo.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.950
So I saw this technique
a little while ago,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.140
and knew that I wanted
to film it for you guys.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.970
Since then, I've
seen pictures of it

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.207
and a couple tutorials
floating around the internet,

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:41.290
and they're all fantastic.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.782
But you guys keep
tagging me and telling me

00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:44.962
that you want me to do it.

00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:46.670
So we're going to mix
it up a little bit,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.555
put it into a combo, and
film it for you guys today.

00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:51.805
To begin this braid, I'm
going to go ahead and pick up

00:00:51.805 --> 00:00:54.790
a piece of hair, basically
from her ear to her part.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.165
So it's a pretty
good-sized piece of hair.

00:00:57.165 --> 00:01:00.400
And we're going to
divide that in half.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.410
And then you're going to divide
those pieces in half again.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.090
And you want it to
be pretty much even.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.108
So just do your best to
get them fairly even.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.110
You now have four.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.340
You have the top, two
middles, and a bottom.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.630
We're going to take
those two middle pieces

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.330
and we're going
to switch places.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.060
So you just cross them
over, one over the other.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.560
And then you're
still going to hold.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.070
So now you still have
your four pieces.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.528
And this is what I'm going to
call top and bottom, and then

00:01:29.528 --> 00:01:30.790
my two middles.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.760
At this point, you want to
bring the top into the center.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.083
So you just switch
those two, and you're

00:01:37.083 --> 00:01:40.790
going to bring your bottom
into the center, as well.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.760
This is just how you
start this braid.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.610
After this, it gets really easy.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.660
So you have, again-- you have
your top and your bottom.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.160
And you have your
two middle pieces.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.534
And at this point, you can
combine your two middle pieces

00:01:51.534 --> 00:01:52.730
into one.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.880
And you have your
top and bottom.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.190
And you want to bring that
top piece over the two

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.220
middle pieces and combine
it with the bottom piece.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.320
So for right now,
it's one strand.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.200
And that is how you start.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.877
That little piece right there
is how you start the braid.

00:02:08.877 --> 00:02:11.210
Now we're going to pick up a
piece of hair from the top.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.751
This is where the
waterfall comes in.

00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:16.950
We're going to take it right
in between our two pieces

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.420
and then drop it down.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.310
She'll hang onto it.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.090
So we didn't bring that
into the braid at all.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.330
It literally just
went through the hair.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.897
And we still have
our two pieces.

00:02:26.897 --> 00:02:28.730
Now you're going to
take your middles again.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.240
Split them back into two.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.810
And take this piece that
you still have combined,

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.950
pop it in the middle,
and then you're

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.920
going to take that top piece
again, and wrap it over,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.250
and combine it with
that bottom piece.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.850
And that becomes
your first stitch.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.460
So I'll do it again,
so you can see it.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.740
You're going to take a
piece of hair from the top,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.880
run it right down the
middle of the two,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.100
and have her hang onto it.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.690
So we still have our two outside
edge pieces, and our middles.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.530
Split the middles, take
your outside pieces,

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.930
put them in the center, and
wrap those outside edges

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.380
back together.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.380
And that's your next stitch.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.500
And you're just going to
continue this pattern,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.565
repeating for as
long as you like.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.130
Now, for me-- when I get to
about halfway back on her head,

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.870
I'm actually just going
to take this, and just

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.270
use those three pieces
and run a couple

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.990
stitches of a normal braid.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.350
Only just to hold
this tight while I

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.860
work with the other side.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.370
So we won't really end
up using this braid.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.070
This is purely just
to hold the hair.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.490
And you can have
her hold it, you

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.310
can use an elastic,
whatever you need to.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.950
You can go ahead and
let go of those pieces.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.170
And you can see,
when she lets go,

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.547
that it drops-- the waterfall
braid effect right there.

00:04:02.547 --> 00:04:04.130
You can even pull
these apart a little

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.940
bit, if you like to show the
middle piece a little bit more,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.307
and highlight that, too.

00:04:08.307 --> 00:04:10.265
Now I'm going to go back
and do the other side.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:20.950
OK.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.940
When you have both
of your pieces done,

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.390
I'm going to teach you a trick.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.390
I'm just going to
take the two ends

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.960
and secure them with a little
cheap, black elastic right

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.500
here.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.650
Just even a couple
times is fine.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.700
This just allows your
hands to move freely,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.680
without anything loosening up
from this part of the braid.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.190
Because we don't want
that coming loose.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.330
Now, just to be fun, we're
going to put it into a combo

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.750
by turning this end
into a fishtail.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.300
So I'm just going to split
the one piece into two,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.420
to create two, and
the inner fishtail.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.080
So I've completed the fishtail.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.840
And I went back and
pancaked it, and just

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.780
made it look kind of
messy, and fun, and soft.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.260
And now the trick here is
that you can take this elastic

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.560
and just-- at least with mine--
you can use a pair of scissors,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.900
or you can just break it.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.150
And that's going to relax
that whole top section, too.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.590
So that it almost just looks
like the braid goes right

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.290
into the fishtail, which
is kind of a fun look.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.998
So you can just
soften that all up.

00:05:37.998 --> 00:05:39.850
And it'll just go right in.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:40.590
OK, guys.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.950
Let's see the final spin.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.115
So we have the braid
into the fishtail.

00:05:46.115 --> 00:05:48.230
And I want to show
you-- on this side,

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.944
I have pulled the loops
apart a little bit.

00:05:50.944 --> 00:05:52.610
So you can see the
lines coming through.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.750
It looks a little bit
more like a ladder braid.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.170
And on this side I
haven't spread them out,

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.470
so that looks more
like a tight braid.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.710
So you can do either one.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.960
The only difference is just
pulling those little loops

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.750
apart.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.329
So whichever way you
prefer, you can do.

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:08.370
There's lots of ways of
playing with this hairdo.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.490
You can do a DIY version,
like I did today on my hair,

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.670
and just use it as
an accent braid.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.810
Or anything you want, really.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.844
Let your imagination
fly free with this one.

00:06:18.844 --> 00:06:20.260
I'd love to see
your re-creations,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.540
so make sure to do hashtag

same hairstyle.

-Bye.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:43.090
-OK.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.970
And when you have
all your flips done,

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.150
then I like to just go back
and play with her hair,

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.290
or do little curls.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.350
And so it's soft
and cute-looking.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.850
You can--

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.294
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:06.626
-What?

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:10.070
-Stop.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.134
Hey.

00:07:16.134 --> 00:07:16.634
Hey now.

00:07:16.634 --> 00:07:18.042
Hey.

00:07:18.042 --> 00:07:18.542
Stop.

00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:24.743
-I hit the camera.

00:07:24.743 --> 00:07:25.700
I need one.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.110
-I could do a straw-stache.
