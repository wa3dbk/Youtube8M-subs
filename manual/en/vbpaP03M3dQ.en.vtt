00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.260
Roar.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.510
It's Cougar Town time.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.030
Sorry about that.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.190
I'm Beth Hoyt.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.965
This is "My Damn
Channel LIVE."

00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:17.860
It looks so different.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.830
Everything is different.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.560
Are you crying?

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.150
Because Grace was in, like,
a metal box yesterday.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.140
She's in LA.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.910
What's going on?

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.825
Beth is up against a wall.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:26.990
You guys, I'm here to take
you through this.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.050
I'm a very good tour guide.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.110
I gave tours in a submarine
in Manitowoc,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.689
Wisconsin for a summer.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.470
Anyway, that's a
little factoid.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.200
But what's happening is that
it's Tuesday, and we just kind

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.120
of want to, like, hang
out with you.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.670
I do.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.180
I just want to, like, get
personal and talk about, like,

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.140
what you're commenting
on and talk to you.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.270
And just, like, we wanted to
change the room up and get,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.620
like, a close-up view of
all this cool stuff.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.550
Look at this thing.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.030
Did you ever see this before?

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.830
Have you seen this?

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.560
Now you--

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.250
are you scared?

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.510
Did that scare you?

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.030
I am freaked out
by this thing.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.110
That's something my uncle
would have in his house.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.730
Let's look at--

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.500
OK, so what I want to talk
about is I tweeted out

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.550
wondering if you guys hate-watch
anything, like

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.200
maybe what I did this weekend,
which was when

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.990
I was near a TV--

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.020
I don't have TV, so,
like, this was--

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.350
I couldn't turn off the Miss
USA pageant because I was--

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.420
and there was--

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.420
and then I just,
like, wanted--

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.630
I tried to turn it off,
and I couldn't.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.540
I fought against it.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.970
I was like, oh, they
make me feel so--

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.500
I watched the entire thing.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.850
Go Rhode Island.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.170
She won.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.680
So I was wondering what you
guys hate-watch, and let's

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.300
talk about that.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.920
And first we have a tweet from,
from BlindFilmCritic.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.640
Oh, this, OK.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.040
Oh, "Glitter." Hate-watches
"Glitter." "I don't think they

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.090
wrote that movie to get laughs,
but there are millions

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.310
of them all the way thru."

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.770
Yeah, I hate-watched the crap
out of that movie, and I kind

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.750
of want to do it again
right now.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.060
That's a very good example.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.380
You guys know what I'm
talking about now?

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.855
Yeah.

00:01:54.855 --> 00:01:57.445
Have you seen "Glitter?"
Oh my god.

00:01:57.445 --> 00:02:00.230
It's so bad.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.090
Here's a comment.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.440
This is from bsheep.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.750
"I like to hate watch any bad
singer thinking they're

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.190
amazing." Yeah, that's also
a really good one.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.840
It's really good.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.750
How much are you hating this?

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.440
Although the difference is I
didn't think that was good.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.740
So that's good.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.260
I didn't think that.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.150
Um, you know, let's look
at another tweet.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.730
This is from "mom-e-wrath"
or momewraith.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.830
"movie extreme ops.extreme"--

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.770
what is happening?

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.580
Can I read?

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.630
"movie extreme ops.extreme snow
athletes vs terrorists,

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.750
special kind of bad i can't not
watch it.silos entrance

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.740
was great though"

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.500
What just happened?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.590
Can I see that again?

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.700
"movie extreme ops.extreme snow
athletes vs terrorists,

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.160
special kind of bad i can't not

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.930
watch it." I get it.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.410
This is very meta.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.960
This is very meta, that that
comment was like a hate-read.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.440
Right?

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.320
So it was like, I dare you to
not read this whole thing out

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.950
loud, acting like you know
what's going on.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.050
Hm.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.383
That's something, though, that
you guys all know what that is

00:03:09.383 --> 00:03:11.340
and I don't, right?

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.560
What just happened?

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.430
Movie terrorists.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.390
I like that.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.790
Silos?

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.510
We used to have a silo
in my backyard.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.710
I grew up in Wisconsin,
but not on a farm.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.205
It was an old silo, and
I used to climb up it

00:03:20.205 --> 00:03:21.135
when I was a kid.

00:03:21.135 --> 00:03:23.910
And then my mom would be
like, get down, Bobo.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.965
And then I would act like I
was going to hang out up

00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:27.300
there, but I came down.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.740
I came down every time.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.660
Let's look at another comment.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.330
This is from "bro fis foster,"
brifoster13.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.030
"How do you get sick abs.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.660
I need to knowwwwww." All
right, brifoster 60--

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.790
13.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.120
First of all, you need
to do whatever

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.010
Jillian Michaels says.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.590
Just do it.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.670
She knows how to do it.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.810
I don't--

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.330
I try.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.060
I do the same ab exercises all
the time, which is, like, a

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.900
lot of the bicycle.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.640
I have, like, one,
one ab, one ab.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.130
But to get the six pack--

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.160
sick abs, that's
what you want--

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.830
you got to just take the
things away from

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.570
the top of the belly.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.230
That's a hard thing to do.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.810
So you've got to not eat the
things that make the things

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.829
grow on top of the abs, and then
just keep-- just crunch

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.440
constantly.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.440
Speaking of sick abs, though,
do you know who you should

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.840
look at actually?

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.880
Mark Malkoff, My Damn Channel's
Mark Malkoff did--

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.760
he does-- he does all of our--
he does all these crazy

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.410
challenges.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.790
He did a one-month six pack ab
challenge, and he succeeded.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.540
So you should watch what he
did or find out his tips

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.075
because it worked for him.

00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:39.310
So that's a great--

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.310
I just gave great advice.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.940
OK, but it's really
Mark Malkoff's.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.040
Also, Mark Malkoff just did a
challenge with Netflix to get

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.040
the most out of his Netflix
subscription, and he tried to

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.250
watch 250 movies in one
month, which sounds

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.830
like my dream, right?

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.680
Isn't that awesome?

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.910
I would love to do that.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.060
He shows how it wasn't the
easiest thing to do.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.950
Let's watch Mark watching
250 movies.
