Hey everyone, it's Colleen Patrick-Goudreau from joyfulvegan.com

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.934
Welcome to Vegan POV

00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:15.894
Today I want to address something that we often hear people say

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.440
"In nature animals kill other animals and eat them, so it is natural for us to do so as well."

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:23.653
"It's the natural course of things. It's nature."

00:00:24.115 --> 00:00:27.875
Here's my point of view. This one confuses me a little bit

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:31.414
because I have to ask which animals are you referring to?

00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:33.335
If the assertion is

00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:36.654
in nature carnivorous animals kill other animals and eat them

00:00:37.294 --> 00:00:39.294
so it is natural for us to do so.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.794
Then I would say - yeah. The first part of that is true.

00:00:42.794 --> 00:00:45.734
Carnivorous animals do kill other animals to survive.

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:47.455
That's natural indeed.

00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:50.974
However, humans are not physiologically built as carnivores

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:54.574
so why should we do what the obligate carnivores do?

00:00:54.574 --> 00:00:58.995
after all they would die without the consumption of flesh and we thrive

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:02.554
But that's not usually what the assertion is

00:01:02.554 --> 00:01:07.353
It's often phrased just as "animals eat other animals so it is natural for us to do so as well."

00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:15.893
And to that I would ask "why are we eliminating all the plant-eating animals for whom it is not natural

00:01:15.893 --> 00:01:21.914
to eat other animals? Why don't we use the plant-eating animals as our model as the barometer for our behaviour?

00:01:22.195 --> 00:01:28.195
Why do we align ourselves with the carnivorous lion rather than the vegetarian elephant?

00:01:28.774 --> 00:01:34.454
We never say "well animals don't eat other animals so it is natural  for us to do the same" or

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.940
"animals eat only plants so it's natural for us to do the same"

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.920
We don't say that. When people make the generalisation

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.994
"Animals eat other animals so it is natural for us to do so" they are leaving out hundreds of species

00:01:48.034 --> 00:01:54.594
of animals who don't eat other animals. And in fact there are more herbivorous animals in the world

00:01:54.594 --> 00:01:55.715
than there are carnivorous ones.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.860
But the herbivores are never used as the example of what is natural.

00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:05.235
And they're certainly never used as the model for us to follow

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.020
Why? Why not?

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.054
Well, from my point of view, I think we don't use them as the model

00:02:13.054 --> 00:02:15.894
because it is not convenient for us to do so.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.300
When we want to keep doing something that is construed as shall we say ethically problematic

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.740
,then we usually seek to find a way to justify that behaviour

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.193
and in this case behaviour we aren't compelled to by nature

00:02:30.413 --> 00:02:35.773
but behaviour we enjoy or is familiar or we find convenient or we feel entitled to

00:02:35.773 --> 00:02:39.835
so we align ourselves with the animals who are compelled to eat flesh

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.635
rather than with those who aren't

00:02:42.635 --> 00:02:45.294
and if I may quote Benjamin Franklin, he said this wonderful quote 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:55.680
"So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature since it enables one to find or make a reason for one has in mind to do"

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.714
I love that quote. He knew human nature so well.

00:02:59.714 --> 00:03:03.834
But also, it's worth saying that our consumption of animals doesn't even come close

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.500
to animals consuming other animals in nature

00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:08.395
We are not part of any cycle of nature.

00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:11.916
We artificially breed animals in order to kill them

00:03:11.916 --> 00:03:16.374
much before their time, much before their natural lifespan is up for sure

00:03:16.875 --> 00:03:20.235
And last time I looked, lions were not breeding gazelles

00:03:20.235 --> 00:03:25.594
the carnivore herbivore balance in nature is one that is complex and fascinating

00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:31.475
and artificial breeding and animal husbandry practices have nothing to do with it.

00:03:31.674 --> 00:03:38.674
It is just another excuse we use to justify behaviour we know we don't have any physiological requirement to participate in.

00:03:39.394 --> 00:03:45.634
From my point of view, as creatures of conscience, ie creatures not driven solely by instinct

00:03:45.634 --> 00:03:48.977
we have the capacity to choose compassion over convenience

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.834
and principle over inclination.

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:56.535
