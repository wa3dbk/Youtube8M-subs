00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.649
hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.639
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. You know

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.570
juices is making some people angry, juices is supposed to cool down and keep you

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.139
healthy

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.850
so we're going to make one simple soup
today we're gonna make chicken tomato

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.390
and egg drop soup for the vegetarians
you skip out the chicken and then you'll

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.650
have a nice tomato egg drop soup so first
I'm going to cook some chicken stock

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.200
now for this I cut chicken into small
pieces add a pinch of salt some

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.450
cornstarch and mix this up and then
we're gonna add some egg white

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.820
just half a few teaspoons should be good enough and then mix this, see this way of mixing the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.700
egg white along with the chicken and
then we're going to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.500
slowly cook in the stock because you
add this egg white on top it acts as a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.739
very nice coating and keeps your chicken moist

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.739
especially when you're having soup lot
of time when you go to some restaurant

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.870
the chicken in the soup is very dry and it
gives a very irritating feeling for me I

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.869
like the chicken to be nice soft and
moist

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.189
that is the reason you add some egg
white like this and then drop the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.740
chicken pieces in this boiling stock for
the vegetarians you can skip this method

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.320
and you can have a nice vegetarian soup
but for the vegetarian soup also make

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.720
sure you add vegetable stock

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.040
let it simmer for like five to seven
minutes and the chicken will be nice

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.600
soft and tender you know once this chicken floats on top that means the chicken is

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.990
almost tender now we're going to make
this egg drop soup just like we're going

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.040
to make our rasam

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.689
this is a stock in which chicken is there
in this i'm going to add a couple of

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.939
ingredients add some salt

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.409
be careful because while making stock i
added some so pinch of salt and tomatoes

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.119
I removed the seeds if you want you can
keep the seeds also here

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.180
I've got red chili sauce

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.899
this is a commercial bottle sauce this
is tomato ketchup

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.369
this is

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.330
hot chili ok if the chili sauce is hot
enough then you don't need to add this

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.280
but my chilli sauce is

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.299
you know very mild and now you can see
this color

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:24.239
turning a little bit reddish in this add
some soy sauce some people like it very

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:24.810
thin

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.950
some people like it slightly thicker you
know i like it slightly thicker so I'm

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.569
going to take some cornstarch just
around one teaspoon add some water

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.640
and just make a thickening here my
tomatoes are getting cooked

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.180
you don't want the tomatoes to be fully cooked you want you know them

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.890
to be seen

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.549
otherwise it will become real rasam before I add the cornstarch i'm just

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:48.750
going to taste it

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.930
Ah! what good flavors in this i'm going
to add this cornstarch, for some people

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.290
this is still not thick enough you know the
egg when you add it will give it

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.430
slightly thickening effect also but if you
want a little bit thicker than this you

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.510
can make it slightly thicker but this
should be perfect for me

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.530
now the soup is nice flavor,  the chicken is all floating up

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.700
it's very well cooked now in this, take eggs beat them and see how it is boiling now

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.510
simmer the flame

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:32.220
it shouldn't be boiling vigorously when
you add the eggs and pour it from top you

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.750
can add the egg yolk also but since i
have used egg yolk somewhere i'm just

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.680
adding

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.790
eggin good my egg drop soup is all ready

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.440
also you can add some chopped coriander to make it a little more Indianish

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.609
wow this should be perfect now look at
this my Indianized chicken tomato

00:03:53.609 --> 00:04:00.239
egg drop soup......perfect

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.540
ahh

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.599
huh

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.239
you know in the soup I always search for
some of this chicken pieces, try adding

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.829
the chicken the way i added to the soup
into any soup you make and you see how

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.259
nice soft and moist your chicken will be. Dear friends I hope you enjoyed learning

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.910
how to make this basic chicken tomato
egg drop soup you can make your own

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.780
variation you can add a lot of chopped
vegetables into this to make it even

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.580
