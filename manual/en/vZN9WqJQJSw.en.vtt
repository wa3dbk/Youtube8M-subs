00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.650
In this video, I am going to show you how
to setup and run the Giatec Surf™ device

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.920
for measuring the surface electrical resistivity of concrete.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.180
Surf™ has two main components:
A test apparatus, and a measuring device.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.359
Surf can adapt both ASTM and AASHTO standard test procedures;
 it can also be used for a

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.279
customized four-point electrical resistivity measuring device.

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.900
First, I need to ensure that all cables are
properly connected to their corresponding channels on the device.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.189
Now, I turn on the device by holding the power key.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.620
I need to prepare my concrete sample as a
100 mm (or 4 in.) diameter cylinders with

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.700
total height of 200 mm (or 8 in.), like this.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.940
The specimens can be either cast concrete or drilled concrete cores.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.150
When you are ready for testing, remove the
concrete from the curing container, and remove

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.100
the excess water on the surface to achieve
saturated surface dry (SSD) condition.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.100
Place the concrete sample in the test apparatus like this.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.350
Be careful not to push the specimen too hard.
Then close the lid.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.600
From the main menu on the device, you can
select the appropriate test method.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.680
If you want to perform a customized test,
you can easily select custom mode from the menu

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.360
Now, you are ready to start the measurements.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.990
Simply press the "Start" key from the
menu to run the test. The device starts collecting

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.670
data from the 4 sets of electrodes in two
rounds, and the average electrical resistivity

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.450
for 8 measurements are printed out on the LCD.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.370
For more information regarding test setup,
please see the device setup section of the Surf™ "User Manual".

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.880
I should mention that data logging can be
carried out with Giatec Surf™ data monitoring

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.140
PC software using the USB connection.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.790
The software provides a full control over the device.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.390
It can also generate report files that are compatible
with the guidelines of ASTM and AASHTO.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.979
Thank you for watching this video.
