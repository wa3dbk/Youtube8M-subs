00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:07.749
the steps of the addressee brought to
you by post ada web hosting

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.830
is down the men in this case the west is
from utah and he recently got arrested

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.220
for disorderly conduct because he had
the audacity to pays twenty five dollar

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.150
medical bill in pennies

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.360
he was arrested which

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.020
he was arrested yet still with
disorderly conduct

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.590
okay so first of all this medical bell
was a bill that he did not agree with

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.470
okay he did not believe if you need to
pay that they'll be sent fine he does

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.250
not mean a pianist on the topic

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.960
he shows up set up a doctor's office

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.250
he has twenty up five hundred pennies
with them

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.850
going dumps them out he didn't even role

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.080
he didn't know when needed dump them out
onto

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.920
the desk and asked about the woman at
the desk to count them

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.390
so he could pay his bill

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.860
now he harrison for disorderly conduct
because of course is being as smart as

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.980
here you know he's trying to make a
point tape series right let's say you

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.129
seriously want to pay this twenty five
dollar bill with pennies and okay you're

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.990
nice enough to have them rolled before
you go to by the office you're not doing

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.840
anything wrong there right now they
can't you couldn't possibly get arrested

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.070
for drug with them by the way if you
just insisted on going to a jury trial

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.910
that i doubt there's not a jury in the
country that conflict

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.040
rectangular

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.369
and that they probably be outrageously
sympathetic to

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.170
anything she would prefer of wrongful
arrest

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.830
you might be like that it would not
right for the first or with other

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.320
but now i wanna bankers alright look if
you campaign with pennies and why do we

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.130
have ten letter or others

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.970
that is a whole other issue an issue
that we've discussed during a postgame

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.950
show where jr says it was just a penny
select

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.430
but my sense of what we should be

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.440
is eliminate them from currency

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.840
