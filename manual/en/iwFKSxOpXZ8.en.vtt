00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
My one year here in Apache has been an amazing experience

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.480
Living on campus is probably one of the most best experiences you can get

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.780
Welcome to Apache-Santa Cruz

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.320
Located on Highland Avenue

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.260
Apache-Santa Cruz is home to 348 residence

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.940
This co-ed hall has 3 floors of double occupancy room and community style bathrooms

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.580
My favorite part about my room is my bed because

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.300
it's a place where I can always feel home; it's comfy

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.540
My favorite part of my room is the shelf space to put all my things on

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.120
Like my movies, CD's; things like that

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.920
My favorite part of my room will probably be my deocrations

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.500
The study rooms are really cool

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.580
They're quiet, they're comfortable, they're very spacious

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.440
You can fit multiple people in here

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.740
We got white boards

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.860
You're able to do your work and keep it social too

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.400
When I am in the basement , I usually come down here to cook food and stuff

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.680
The kitchen facility is really nice

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.500
We have two ovens

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.740
So, a lot of people can be in the kitchen cooking at the same time

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.940
My favorite part of the basement would probably be the game room

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.480
Pool table

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.640
There's a ping pong table

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.060
And right there, there's the vending machines

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.120
When I first came here. I was a little bit  thrown off by the 50's style dinner

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.100
But after a while, you kinda get used to how cool it is

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.900
I do homework down the in diner sometimes

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.000
It's nice to just get out of the room

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Not to go all the way to the library

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.880
It's a nice open space downstairs

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.120
You can concentrate and do your work

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.560
Some people will grill in the front and back court yards

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.060
We got a bunch of space for that

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.340
It's also nice to sit out in the Arizona weather and do you homework

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.700
My favorite part of the location is

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.580
The closes is the classes

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.420
But I mean the football stadium being next door is also a huge plus

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.300
I think the best part about the location is probably

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.000
Being close to the Rec

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.320
And there is the Highland Market right across the street

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.900
My hall definitely feels like a family

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.500
And I feel like Apache is really community based dorm

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.480
Apache-Santa Cruz is a place where you feel home
