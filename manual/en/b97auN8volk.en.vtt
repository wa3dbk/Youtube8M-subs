00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.191
The weather is very inspiring,
so we've brought a car that matches it...

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.986
...a Ford Mondeo.

00:00:35.036 --> 00:00:38.674
Let's wait how long it takes Ford to call us
to complain about that remark.

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:45.989
But seriously. This time we're not driving
a car like this because it is economical.

00:00:46.038 --> 00:00:51.888
I'm fed up with slow and boring cars.

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:54.203
Of course, the environment is important.

00:00:54.224 --> 00:00:59.619
That's why I'm proud to tell you
that this car's got a green B-label.

00:00:59.664 --> 00:01:05.300
It's dark green, C is light green
and after that things get really bad.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.671
So bad in fact, you can't even
drive it through the forest anymore.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:11.611
Although, there is some connection
between trees and CO2 I think.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.890
They convert it to oxygen or something.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.264
But of course I'm not a climatologist
who can really explain it.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.114
This Ford Mondeo is interesting
for two reasons.

00:01:26.214 --> 00:01:29.140
The engine; a 2-liter EcoBoost.

00:01:29.234 --> 00:01:32.620
It's got 240 hp, that's a decent amount.

00:01:32.802 --> 00:01:36.686
A version of this engine
will also be in the Focus ST.

00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:39.991
This really is a Mondeo ST...

00:01:40.038 --> 00:01:42.133
...although it's got a different name.

00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:45.940
It's also got some technology
that'll be in the Focus ST...

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:51.682
...like the sound suspensor.
It makes it sound a bit louder.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.986
On the inside it's very quiet.

00:01:57.027 --> 00:01:58.521
I'll shut up.

00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:02.074
You don't hear a thing.
When I give some gas you hear a little noise...

00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:04.496
...but it's on the outside where it sounds nice.

00:02:12.638 --> 00:02:14.484
That was the first interesting thing.

00:02:14.543 --> 00:02:18.343
The second thing is
the PowerShift transmission.

00:02:18.376 --> 00:02:21.471
Volvo, a previous subsidiary of Ford,
also uses it.

00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:23.587
I'm quite interested to see how it performs.

00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:27.715
It's got a double clutch with wet plates,
or so it says in the press release.

00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:28.977
Who cares?

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:35.668
The front runner in that area
is of course the Volkswagen Group.

00:02:35.712 --> 00:02:39.711
And I have to admit that those are a bit better.

00:02:39.757 --> 00:02:43.263
This gearbox is fine,
but sometimes it can't keep up.

00:02:43.376 --> 00:02:45.736
Sometimes there's little bump
when changing gears.

00:02:45.893 --> 00:02:51.769
Also, when it's in sport mode
and I want to accelerate in first gear.

00:02:51.847 --> 00:02:54.483
And you know how I do that, enthusiastically.

00:02:57.926 --> 00:03:02.674
That causes wheelspin,
so the ESP kicks in to keep me on track.

00:03:02.688 --> 00:03:06.180
But when the ESP is working,
it's too busy to change up...

00:03:06.203 --> 00:03:08.513
...so it just hits the rev limiter.

00:03:08.701 --> 00:03:10.108
After that it finally changes gear.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.414
There's just not enough
computing power on board...

00:03:13.478 --> 00:03:15.376
...it can't do two things at the same time.

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:44.445
With its 240 hp the Mondeo Wagon
does 0-62 in 7.8 seconds...

00:03:44.476 --> 00:03:46.918
...and has a top speed of 150 mph.

00:03:46.995 --> 00:03:50.367
It's also got 350 Nm of torque.

00:03:50.453 --> 00:03:56.209
Combine that with this gearbox
and you'll always have enough power.

00:03:56.326 --> 00:04:00.553
The nice thing about Fords is
that they always handle just fine.

00:04:00.563 --> 00:04:03.760
This Mondeo is no exception,
although it's a big car.

00:04:03.801 --> 00:04:05.982
It's a lot bigger than a Focus.

00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:10.027
You do feel that a bit,
but still it's a nice driving machine.

00:04:10.257 --> 00:04:13.790
It doesn't understeer quickly,
there's enough traction out of corners.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:15.649
Even though it's wet and slippery.

00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:19.683
You can hit the throttle early
and it just keeps going.

00:04:20.887 --> 00:04:24.507
A small drawback with
nice cars like this one, is the price.

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:29.440
The base model is 47 grand.

00:04:29.484 --> 00:04:33.604
That does give you nice wheels,
the automatic gearbox and some other stuff.

00:04:33.823 --> 00:04:39.475
But this one is also equipped with
all the safety features they took from Sweden.

00:04:39.562 --> 00:04:43.980
It's got active cruise control,
collision warning, blind spot detection.

00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:48.955
It's also got premium audio,
which really does sound premium. It's great.

00:04:48.983 --> 00:04:54.789
I could listen to music from my iPhone
via bluetooth streaming.

00:04:54.806 --> 00:04:58.830
I've really enjoyed that,
it even made me stay in the car longer.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.486
I won't even say what it costs
after you've added all those things.

00:05:05.853 --> 00:05:07.797
Fine, it's 57 grand.

00:05:07.863 --> 00:05:09.987
Who is this car for then?

00:05:10.212 --> 00:05:13.562
It's for people who've outgrown a Golf GTI.

00:05:13.616 --> 00:05:19.991
People who need more space
to hurry to the Ikea and fill the boot.

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:25.244
Or if you need to transport
other big packets of wood quickly.
