00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:06.840
Hi Antoine!

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.470
Hello.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.020
Welcome to the Rennes Tattoo Convention. Is it your 1st time here?

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.100
Yes it is.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.420
Quite a bit of traveling, because you work in 2 different tattoo shops.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.160
Yes; one in Anvers and the other one in Neufchâteau (Belgium).

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.120
In the countryside.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.380
I find it hard to remain on the same city.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.920
So working in 2 shops is the opportunity for doing different things and travel.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.360
And not remain in the same place;

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.160
This need for diversity stand out of your tattoos.

00:00:39.823 --> 00:00:41.823
You're a versatile person.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.960
Yes, it is my main objective.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.040
Many people tell me that I don't have my own personal style but I don't really care.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.400
My goal is to ink people.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.920
All I want to do is become a good tattoo artist.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.980
I've been raised in street shops;

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.560
Where I did a lot of lettering. I didn't work in private studios.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.980
I used to do from 4 up to 8 tattoos a day.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.541
So you meet a lot of peaople.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.920
Of course. And you can do a lot fo things.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.040
This is really important to me. The ability of doing many different things.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.340
And now, where I work (The Iguana) where the other tattooers are specialized in portraits;

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.260
and there's so much demand.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.940
They can't keep up.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.200
So they gave me advices and I work as well on portraits now.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.940
So it's about giving and receiving.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.060
Absolutely; and that's the only way it should be.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.660
So technically, what is the main challenge when tattooing portraits?

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.320
Well; there's absolutely no mistake allowed.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.300
Every single dot has to be exactly where its supposed to.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.680
There' a lot of tattooer in every studio where you work.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.520
Yes, yes. And they are always guest tattoo artists.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.200
I also do myself a lot of guest in other shops. I travel a lot.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.080
And I love to do it.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.560
Traveling for work is great. We make money and at the same time take a little vacation.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.820
And it allows me to learn a lot of new technics and points of view.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.320
I feel the need to look at what's happening elsewhere.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.080
Did you know early that you'd become a tattooist?

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.920
Not at all.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.380
I've only been inking for 4 years.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.140
I was a piercer for 12 years before that.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.100
And for 10 years I was selling tattoo machines as I was piercing people.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.760
And when I say 4 years I mean that it became my full-time job.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.000
I asked everybody and they gave me their permission to do it.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.680
I've always been in this universe.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.080
I remember when I was a kid and I saw tattooed people from head to toes.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.680
They were my parents' friends; they were fully inked.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.240
In a time when it was unusual.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.520
In the late 1980's.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.260
So when I think of it; that's where it all came from.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.040
During your last trip, where did you go?

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.260
I don't even remember...

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.786
So travel so much; you can't recall.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.840
Yeah that's right. Actually I got back from Anvers.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.740
In the Black Lotus studio.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.940
Just before that I organised the Arlon Tattoo Convention.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.500
With the guys from the Iguana tattoo studio.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.500
And I can't remember the rest. I have plenty of stuff sorted out.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.260
I'm lucky that my lovely wife is taking care of everything.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.080
She's in charge of my schedule.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.260
Since this morning, every tattooer we've interviewed  said;

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.940
I'm so glad my wife, or girlfriend is dealing with my planning.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.392
Yeah, that's right.

00:03:31.392 --> 00:03:33.220
She's doing everything.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.300
I tell her that I have a convention or something and she'll write it down.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.040
This allows le to concentrate only on my work.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.580
We should organize an event with Tattooer's wife awards.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.580
And mine would totally deserve one.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.840
Because without her; I'd be totally lost...

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.900
If tattooing reduced life expectancy; would you still do it?

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.780
Of course.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.120
I have so much fun that I could die tomorrow.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.140
If you had an accent for the rest of your life, which one would it be?

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.179
Belgian!

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.820
That's too easy for you...

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.740
But I'm a french man living in Belgium.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.382
Yes but even tho...

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:12.220
I've learned to talk flemish you know.

00:04:12.573 --> 00:04:14.573
And I caught the accent a little bit.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.080
Can you show us?

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.899
No; I can't do that!

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.280
Yes you can!

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.709
I can't do that...

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.360
* speaks flemish with style *

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.800
Which means?

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.160
It means "Hello to my friends from Flanders."

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.900
Underpants or boxer shorts?

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.960
Boxer shorts.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.500
Da Vinci or Einstein?

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.540
Da Vinci

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.720
Tomatoes or mozzarella?

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.749
Wow; tough one!

00:04:36.778 --> 00:04:38.778
I'll go with tomatoes.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.700
Well thanks a lot!

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.949

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.040
We could go on tour with you.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.972
Thanks a lot.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.700
