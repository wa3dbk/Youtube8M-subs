Hi, I'm Ruchika, on behalf of Expert Village.
Moving on to our chin area, and forehead area

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.980
and hair shading, we have to go on to the
chin area. If I've got a chin which is very

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.180
much visible; got a dimple out here, I can
move along and carve out here to highlight

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.630
my chin area. That will look more caricature
of my chin is little dimple, and very fine

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.150
feature I've got. Then we can move on our
forehead area. We can make it broad, we can

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:38.690
make it small. Then we can explore our eyebrow
area according to our forehead. Then we can

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:46.360
put the hairstyle, you can make a flimsy hairstyle,
or you ca put a small hairstyle, or you can

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.800
just remove the hair. Use the shading very
correctly according to our ear line and your

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.750
eye line. You can just highlight the features
very creatively. Then you can move onto your

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.840
chin area again to highlight the features
around the neck area. Because caricature is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.719
all about distorting a portrait, not the whole
body you can cover. You can cover the face

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:18.240
very expressively, then taking the details
in the body area or another body part. So

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.069
you need to just cover the face; you need
to give the detail of the face only. That

00:01:25.069 --> 00:02:07.869
will give a complete caricature look, cartoonish
and stylish, yes. We have discussed a lot

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.560
about the caricature. Now I?m going to tell
you what a caricature is. A caricature is

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.700
just a distortion of a image, or a particular
pictorial graphical presentation of a person's

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.739
face. You can even go through a whole body,
but try to maintain the details of the face.

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:32.971
Caricature is just a funny expression to give
a cartoonish style, or a particular portrait

00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:40.970
thing. You can distort it and make it funny.
You can find a great difference between a

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.689
cartoon and a caricature. A cartoon can be
an imaginary character, but a caricature can

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:51.680
be a person's portrait which is in a distorted
form; they make you laugh. Caricatures are

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:01.230
mainly used in editorials, like a politician's
caricature. You can go through our magazines

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.720
also. Our director does lots of experiments
with the faces of celebrities. You can check

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.230
out the very cool features.
