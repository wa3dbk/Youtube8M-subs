Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to another episode of minecraft theory

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:06.740
If you missed the last episode click here to watch it

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.680
I am Sober

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.660
This episode won’t be very serious

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.060
cuz this time I am going to talk about village

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.660
I am going to compare the village in minecraft with our real history

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.660
and determine which age should the villager live in

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.834
This time we will use Wikipedia and Minecraft Wikipedia quite a lot

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.800
So sit back, fasten your seat belt

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.560
We are ready to take off

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.540
First, they know how to farm

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.800
If you type in farming in wikipedia and look for the history of farming

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.380
 You can find that human is already farming in 12000 years ago

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.540
at Neolithic Revolution

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.900
So, we can say that the villager live in the age that after B.C 10000

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.380
Well, they doesn’t look
like that ancient

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.200
So next, there are some furnace in the blacksmith of the village

00:00:52.255 --> 00:00:54.415
That means they know how to smelt

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.700
 According to wikipedia, human knows how to smelt at least 8000 years ago

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.740
Well then we can adjust the timeline a bit now

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.160
Now let’s take a look at the structure of the village

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.580
In Minecraft Wikipedia, it says this little house with some book shaft in it is a library

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.320
Huh?

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.060
Well, whatever. The first library in real world is at the end of prehistory

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.160
About 4600 years ago

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.580
So that means they are living in about B.C 2600

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.580
Another thing is horse armor can be found in the chest in village

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.685
And the first metal horse armor on earth is used in the second year before christ

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.060
Okay, you guys are cleverer than I expected

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.180
Also, there is a church in a village

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.440
Sort of make sense according to the preivous video’s theory

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.620
Click here to watch it if you have no idea what I was talking about

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.440
Mmm…...

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.440
Wikipedia?

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.540
it says the first church was founded in A.D 233

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.900
So far I believe I have included all of the feature of village

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.580
Compare to the real world, the age that the village should have

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.160
 in minecraft should be about A.D 250

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.420
Anyway, this is the end of this episode

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.780
I am so sorry for uploading the video so late because I am recently working on

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.200

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.140
