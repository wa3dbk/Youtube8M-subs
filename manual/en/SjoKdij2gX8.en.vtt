00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.780
Ohhhh do I have a show for you today.
It's time for Food Snot.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.360
I'm Tom Cote and I am the Food Snot.
You know what I love about coffee?

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.519
Absolutely everything! Yeah I'm kind of

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.520
a coffee fanatic. If I had to choose
between coffee and

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.260
oxygen - I would choose oxygen but then
after I chose the oxygen...

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.820
I'd go make myself a coffee. What?? What's the oxygen going to do? Smack me???

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.500
OUCH!

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.540
The reason I am here today is
because

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.739
I will be reviewing Monsters Mean Bean

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.739
Java Monster. It's a coffee energy drink.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.440
but first for some history

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.110
Monster started making energy drinks way
back in the late

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.539
eighteen hundreds, and by the mid
nineteen forties...

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.760
every living man, woman, and child were
consuming

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.780
14 to 16 Monster drinks per day

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.360
but the strange thing is their energy
was still running low

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.460
so Monster said let's add some coffee to
these energy drinks

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.150
and we'll have these peasants climbing
up and down the walls and ceilings

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.790
begging for mercy  - but did they beg
for mercy?  No

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.290
they actually begged for donuts ...
and that leads us up to the present

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.050
I think I just made all of that up!

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.430
okay so let's give this stuff a try.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.220
okay so it has a coffee taste to it...
but

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.479
it's super sweet - it's actually - 
it's too sweet

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.360
it taste like melted coffee ice cream.
it's a very mild

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.530
wimpy coffee taste and again way too
sweet

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.450
but let me try it again...

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.480
Nah ..  this ain't working for me.
This stuff is

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.840
all sugar and no flavor. I don't
recommend it. If you want a Monster buy

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.420
this one! It's my favorite and I drink it
almost daily

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.620
but if you want a coffee?  Drink this .. but
don't drink this stuff.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.980
There is nothing mean about this bean!

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.330
don't mix energy drinks with coffee flavor.
That's just stupid.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.540
Look, if I'm gonna drink anything with a
coffee taste, I want it to taste

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.590
real good and give be endless boosts of
energy

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.670
I want to do a five minute mile in three
minutes

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.290
I wanna out run a llama. I want that
coffee to turn me into an

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.580
aging - bald - superhero!! And if it doesn't
do that

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.080
get it away from me. So Java Monster .. get
away from me OK?

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.530
okay thanks for watching ..  until next
time I am the Food Snot signing off but

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.420
first I want you to remember something - 
the moral to this story

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.700
if you are ever in need of energy and flavor
and the only thing nearby is a Monster

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.340
Java

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.810
you are in deep deep trouble ... that wasn't
really a moral but

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.930
don't get me started. So long.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.140
