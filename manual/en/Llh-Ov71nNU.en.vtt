00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.520
Are you ready for what's probably the biggest
event your church will host?

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.420
Vacation Bible School is one of our favorite
topics at Shindigz.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.600
And with over 23 million kids attending VBS
this year Shindigz is anxious to make this

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.539
the best outreach your attendees will ever
experience, in just 5 simple steps.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:30.890
1) Pick Your Theme- It sets the tone for everything
and what better than our exclusive Wacky Wilderness!

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.309
This one of a kind adventure is where amazing
adventures will soon occur at your church

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.710
as you share God's word.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.890
2) Attract Attendees- Now that you've got
your theme you need to spread the word.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.719
Let everyone in the community know your church
is hosting VBS and when it will be held.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:49.719
I love our yard signs.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.870
They are sturdy, vinyl and can be used inside
or out.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.620
Same is true for our banners.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:03.390
They come in all sizes and have grommets on
the sides for easy hanging on the sides of

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.150
buildings, stands, rooms, you name it.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.939
Pintables are also great, like our tickets.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.850
Simply list all of your information, send
it home and all the details will be right

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.310
in front of your guests.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.810
3) Decorate- The fun part with Wacky Wilderness
we've made this job easy.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.700
Use our personalized arch to welcome your
campers to your kingdom and guide them through

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.220
your different stages with the personalized
directional sign.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:42.150
Maybe it will lead them to the Tree of Life
or take them down the path of un-nesting biblical

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.150
stories.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:56.670
And no Vacation Bible School is complete without
a shimmering waterfall flowing with love and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.729
glistening in God's love.

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:08.893
For the background I used our green gossamer
and added strands of festooning for fun, Affordable,

00:02:08.893 --> 00:02:10.220
easy and amazingly alive.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.330
4) Food and Favors- The kids favorite of course
and you'll love them because each Shindigz

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.330
item can be personalized.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.650
Your logo will look amazing on our cupcake
wrappers, candy bar, lollipops, water bottles,

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.040
DIY bags and so much more not to mention all
the favors.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.890
Even better these personalized travel mugs,
candy jars, water bottles, frames and so much

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:44.010
more go home with your campers so they'll
always remember the great memories at your

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.010
VBS.
5.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.380
Wearable's- You've got to have wearable's
to get everyone acquainted and break the ice.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.110
Our glow necklaces come in many different
colors.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.790
Kids love them and they're a great way to
break kids into different groups.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:09.330
And because you're in the jungle, you're going
to need a hat and binoculars to complete the

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.340
look.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.159
Celebrate your church, your community, your
children with vacation Bible school, Wacky

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:24.489
