00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.250
We went to the Aru Island in Indonesia to
photograph the greater bird-of-paradise.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.710
It did take several hours by boat up a channel
and then hiking in through the forest to get

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.710
to the location.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.581
And then of course, the whole time I was thinking
what is this location going to be like, is

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:44.201
it going to be possible to get a good picture,
are we going to have a good view?

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.430
Many birds-of-paradise display on the ground
or near the ground in the lower part of the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.350
forest, and those of course are a little easier
to photograph and film.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.739
The greater bird-of-paradise displays up in
the treetops, and when we got the site it

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.650
was immediately apparent that I was not going
to have a good enough view from the ground,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.650
to shoot from the ground.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.791
And I knew I was going to have to climb up
in the tree, make some sort of platform and

00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:12.659
a blind up in a tree in order to be able to
photograph the birds.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.820
All right, here it goes.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.420
All right, we got the rope over.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.980
For Tim, having the ability to be an expert
tree climber and taking his 6'7" frame up

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.840
into a tree and sitting in a cramped blind
and then waiting for seven or eight hours

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.270
for a bird to show up and get the images - there
are very few people on the planet who can

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.539
probably do that.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.700
A good example of that is the work that we
did on greater bird-of-paradise.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.660
All right.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.200
Here's the lek right here.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.500
See these branches right here.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.880
This is the main display perch, and the secondary
perch there.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.380
And there's my blind over there, where I've
been shooting from.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.520
And right here is my leaf camera.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.480
And now we had two ropes up two different
trees and the first thing Tim had to do was

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:46.349
climb the tree in the dark, get the camera
set up, climb back down, go over to the other

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:52.069
tree, climb that tree, get in, set up his
big camera, set up the laptop, plug everything

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.629
in and basically pray it was all going to
work because there wasn't any more opportunity

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.691
to climb back down and fix it if it didn't
work because the sun was coming up and the

00:02:58.691 --> 00:03:00.411
birds were coming.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.930
Ever since the beginning of the birds-of-paradise
project I've been sort of dreaming of a shot

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.930
where I could see a bird in the foreground
and be looking out over the rain forest in

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.250
the background.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.680
And I saw the shot download to my laptop and
I said that's it, and I knew I had it.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.299
That was a real exciting moment where I had
sensed that sense of success after all these

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.140
years of sort of dreaming about a shot like
that.
