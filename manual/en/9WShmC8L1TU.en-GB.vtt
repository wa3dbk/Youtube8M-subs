00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.690
Opening cases is a great way of getting children
into gambling and knife collections. To avoid

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.750
throwing away lots of real money, I'm using
this simulation to see how long it takes to

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.420
get a pretend knife. You can find a link to
this simulation in the description of this

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:28.660
video.
How about that. Beginner's luck.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.700
Just 12 dollars in I got a second classified
weapon. I can assure you that this doesn't

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.050
normally happen with such frequency. I'd also
advise people to look up basic probability

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.290
before getting carried away with case openings.
A word of warning- this carries on for another

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.660
20 seconds or so. If it's any reassurance,
have a look at the amount of money spent going

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.140
up on the side of the screen. I think it's
great that Valve have developed a way of making

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.660
money without giving big spenders an advantage
in-game- if anything, these brightly lit,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.870
special skins make them easier to be spotted
by enemies. I just wonder how much money people

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.760
who unlock several knives from these case
openings must have spent altogether and how

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:13.390
much they hate themselves for it.
Oh ja! A hardened case! Sadly, I could have

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.580
got these 3 classified weapons for just over
20 dollars. Heck, I could have bought a couple

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.860
of knives as well and STILL be under what
I've already spent on these cases. Ah well,

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.300
surely my luck will change soon and I'll be
rolling in sharp knives!

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.330
I guess the people who have several knives
must just be really lucky, surely they haven't

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.990
spend thousands of dollars on cases! Nobody
would do that... surely?

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.550
OH YES! That's worth another 15 dollars and
I only had to spend 100 dollars to get it!

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.070
Oh, I don't believe it. This is proof that
it's all fixed. Valve hates me. HATES ME.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.390
After this I'm not buying a case again -
- See, just when I was about to give up my

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:02.100
luck has changed! Time for one more go.
Okay, two.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.840
Oh screw it, let's keep spending more money,
I've invested too much to give in now! The

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.819
worst is over.
Wow, with 3 lucky drops so close together

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.040
I've almost been breaking even... if you forget
about that huge loss before. That's in the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.610
past. It doesn't matter anymore.
WOW, I was so close to getting a Covert drop

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.380
there! Let's keep going until I get one of
those. Poor Valve, the way I'm going they'll

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.890
be bankrupt, having to give me all of these...uh...
virtual skins.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.810
You know what, this is beginning to get boring.
Let's speed this up until I get a PROPER drop

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:55.360
that's worth my time!
As long as I don't have to eat for the next

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.280
couple of weeks I'll be okay... YAY! All of
that was TOTALLY worth it. Just you wait till

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.110
I tell my friends about what I've done, they'll
be so proud and jelly! Let's keep going until

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.099
I get a second covert drop. A winning streak
is just around the next corner- I can feel

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:24.700
it in my bones and I've got my pants of +5
luck on.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.090
Even the appeal of getting these is wearing
off now. Let's speed this up until I get a

00:03:28.090 --> 00:04:11.460
knife! Hold tight, people!
GASP! I'm the best person in the world! It

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.810
only took just under 1,500 dollars to get
a knife! I can now retire from this case quest

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.739
and live happily ever after. Thank you for
watching this, I hope it's been worth your

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.949
while. Do you think that I was lucky? Unlucky?
Try the simulator for yourself and see how

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.580
you fare. And remember, you could be just
three kliks away from owning your very own

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:40.210
karambit. In fact, what if...
...nah. Ah well. Have fun!
