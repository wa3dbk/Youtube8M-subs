Hi everybody, this is Steve with Outfitter
Warehouse. Today I am going to show you guys

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.380
how to use our new Wall Tent Visualizer Tool.
The purpose of this tool, is to help you determine

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.110
the right size of tent for your needs. This
visualizer is designed to give you an overhead

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.680
view of your camping equipment. Including,
stoves, cots, tables and chairs, and how they

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.040
will fit inside your tent. Here at Outfitter
Warehouse, we have received many questions

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.730
from our customers on how to select the right
tent size for their needs. In general, it

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.340
is much better to get a tent that is bigger,
than one that is on the smaller side. I don't

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.500
think that I have ever heard someone complain
that they bought a tent with too much room.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.609
Usually, the inverse is the case, when people
get too little room. This visualizer is designed

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.660
to help remedy this, so that you can make
a more reliable decision in regards to your

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.350
needs. In the top left-hand corner here you
can select your tent size. Ranging from 8'

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.769
x 8' all the way up to 18' x 23', however
if you would like you can also select a custom

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:09.769
size. Ranging from 4' x 4' all the way up
to 21' x 42', then select apply. For the purpose

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.790
of this video, I'll leave it at 14' x 16'.
On the left here, you can add or remove items.

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.329
By clicking on the green text you can add
an item. I'll add a large stove, a large cot,

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.540
and a large table. I can move those items
to where ever I would like in the overview

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.540
window. If I would like, I can also rotate
these items by selecting the blue text. If

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:49.310
I click the red text I can remove the item.
If I would like, I can also go to the bottom

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.350
of the screen and I can rotate all items or
remove all items. If you click on the porch

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.030
tab, you can also add a porch. Ranging from
9' in length to 12' in length, or you can

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.030
add a custom size. Again, as with the tents,
you can add or remove items. These items can

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.230
all be removed. You can also... again select
no porch.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.340
At the bottom of the screen, here
you see a grey text that will show you the
approximate dimensions of the small stove

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.340
the large stove and the other items. Lets
see...

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.340
I think that is about it. I hope this helps. Um... if you have any other suggestions
you're welcome to please contact our customer
