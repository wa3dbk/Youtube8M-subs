GINGER GROVES, BRANSON CABIN RENTALS MANAGER&gt;&gt;
If you're thinking of coming to Branson and

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.080
you've got a family reunion with several people
or maybe an extended family where you've brought

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.590
Grandma and Grandpa to stay as well you're
going to need a really big place to stay.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.180
Those are a little bit hard to come by!

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.490
But here at Thosand Hills and the Cabins at
Grand Mountain we have a lot of family sized

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.970
units. And I'd like to give you a quick peek
at a 5 bedroom Branson cabin.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.610
Here you can see the dining table. We've got
seating for either; we've got extra and ample

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.899
dishes for you while you're here. And this
one has two decks--this is the upper one,

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.800
the screened in one. And if you can hear that
noise in the background it's rained today

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:58.649
and that's the creek that flows behind the
cabin. It's just quite cozy today. Your family

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.539
can stretch out, you can do more than one
thing at once. You can have somebody playing

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.640
cards you can have somebody sleeping you can
have somebody cooking in the kitchen.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:18.180
Your kitchen's going to have full sized appliances.
We've got a washer/dryer for you to use when

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:26.170
you're here if necessary. Your kitchen's going
to have a full sized refrigerator, an ice

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:33.860
maker, a stove and microwave. Help with the
dishes with this full-sized dishwasher and

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:42.770
there will be lots of dishes for you to enjoy
when you're here. So much better than having

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.500
a couple of units and having to run back and
forth!

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.930
Here's a bedroom. We've got to have big king
sized beds. And all of our units are just

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.890
a little bit different, that's a part of the
fun. But there are standards that you can

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.480
expect. They'll all have a television in the
bedroom. In the master every one will have

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.750
a nice whirlpool tub.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:18.910
And of course you're going to have an extra
large living area. The cabins have stone fireplaces,

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:29.820
a sofa sleeper if you need just a little bit
more sleeping area and in this case we'll

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.269
have 2 additional bedrooms downstairs &amp; two
additional bedrooms upstairs.

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:47.100
Again there's going to be two decks, five
bedrooms, three baths, and they're all here

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:54.970
at the Cabins at Grand Mountain, part of the
Thousand Hills properties. We have a tendancy

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.690
to think that life is better at a cabin! Especially
when you have those that you love and your

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.730
family with you. Come by and see us, we'd
love to show you around!
