00:00:02.828 --> 00:00:07.998
We come to what is arguably the hardest joint to skin properly, the shoulder joint.

00:00:08.463 --> 00:00:12.096
The reason is that this joint is articulated in many different ways.

00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:17.246
The vertices in that area often respond to three or even four bones simultaneously.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.170
The key is identifying those bones and applying the proper weights.

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:30.851
There are no strict rules or strict values to be used. Skinning, as you have learned so far is mostly visual, and a bit instinctive.

00:00:31.706 --> 00:00:35.544
First adjust the animation length to focus on the area of interest.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.870
Most of the shoulder animation is taking place between frames 880 and 1160.

00:00:43.996 --> 00:00:49.316
Obviously the skinning at this point isn't working too well but you're about to change that.

00:00:50.064 --> 00:00:52.516
First make sure you are in the Front view.

00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:58.447
Press F3 to switch to wireframe mode, and take a look at the animation.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.870
The shoulder rotates down between frames 880 and 900.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:11.936
However, consider how it rotates up between frames 920 and 940.

00:01:12.448 --> 00:01:18.428
Much of the work is done by the clavicle, although the shoulder bone does rotate a bit also.

00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:24.601
In fact, there is even a slight twist of the shoulder bone, the higher it rotates.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.630
Try it out: lift your hand above your head and feel the slight twist of the shoulder bone.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.730
This is important to get the shoulder vertices to work properly.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:44.360
If you just rotate the shoulder and leave the clavicle untouched, this would result in bad joint animation.

00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:53.169
Before starting the skinning adjustments, notice the FK and IK bone chains.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.810
These won't be used for skinning as discussed earlier, so you might as well hide them from view at this time if you haven't done so already.

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:07.112
The FK/IK branches for the left arm are easy to select around frame 900.

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:12.152
The ones for the character's right arm are a bit harder to select in the viewport.

00:02:12.494 --> 00:02:19.732
Press H and select them from a list, or zoom in and double-click the respective shoulder bones to select them in the viewport.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.790
Hide the selection.

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:30.312
Go back to a shaded viewport (F3), select the mesh and enter Edit Envelopes mode.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:33.320
Let's analyze the situation a little bit:

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.485
At this time, most of the torso vertices are not affected by any of the clavicle or shoulder bones.

00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:47.502
This is expected as you set up the upper torso vertices to follow the upper spine bones earlier.

00:02:48.192 --> 00:02:55.752
As far as blocking out vertices, you may want to make a few last minute adjustments before proceeding.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.280
In some situations as is the case here, loop selection may not work to your advantage.

00:03:07.578 --> 00:03:12.521
So make sure you go around the scene so that the right vertices are selected.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.570
Assign these vertices to follow the shoulder Roll bone 100%.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.680
Block out any other "rebel" vertices in that area.

00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:28.951
Let's explore the clavicle area.

00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:35.691
All these vertices need to be somewhat affected by the clavicle bone, although by different amounts.

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:42.896
The vertices further out need higher percentages than the ones closer to the middle line.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.790
Start by selecting the vertices near the bottom end of the collar.

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:55.514
Open the Weight Tool dialog. At this point, these vertices are affected only by the Spine bone.

00:03:56.142 --> 00:04:04.672
Select the clavicle bone and weight the vertices by a small value, such as .1 or 10%.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.350
Select the next few vertices in line. You will almost certainly need to adjust the back vertices in a moment.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.070
For now, work on the front of the character.

00:04:18.637 --> 00:04:26.517
Use the Weight Tool dialog or the Weighting script to assign an amount of clavicle influence on the selected vertices.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.820
Move on to the next few vertices in line and adjust their weighting.

00:04:38.634 --> 00:04:46.382
Soon enough, you will find yourself going back and forth, adjusting vertices as a group, or almost certainly individually.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.080
This is where the weight script tool comes in handy.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:59.090
As you test the vertices around the shoulder area, you will discover which vertex needs to react to which bone.

00:05:35.248 --> 00:05:42.336
You will also find that some vertices, although far from the center line, need a bit of weighting from the spine bone.

00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:45.981
This helps in "grounding" them a little bit.

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:55.121
Keep on fine-tuning the solution, occasionally glancing at the back of the character.

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.804
Remember this process is fairly intuitive and requires a great deal of patience.

00:06:04.514 --> 00:06:09.759
The more experienced you become at this and the easier it gets.

00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:02.012
As you go below the arm pit, there are a few vertices that need to blend with the arm bones.

00:07:05.444 --> 00:07:10.077
It's best to blend these with the shoulder bone, and not the shoulder roll.

00:07:10.747 --> 00:07:17.317
You only need for these vertices to react to the up/down motion, not so much to the shoulder twist.

00:07:21.777 --> 00:07:28.390
Keep on fine-tuning the solution. Again, a lot of back and forth is required to get to a result that you like.

00:07:29.045 --> 00:07:32.120
Notice that you're only working on one side of the character.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:38.438
When you're done, you can use Mirror Skin tools to transfer vertex weights to the other side.

00:07:38.935 --> 00:07:43.728
However, since you still need to adjust the rest of the arm, hand and fingers,

00:07:44.285 --> 00:07:48.763
you may as well completely finish with one side before mirroring the data.

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:52.320
Exit Edit Envelopes mode and save your file.
