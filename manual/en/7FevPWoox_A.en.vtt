00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:07.599
Hello, my name is Jill Phillips, and I'm co-owner
of Squeals on Wheels, a traveling petting

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:09.120
zoo and pony rides.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.660
My name is John Phillips.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.750
We have horses, miniature horses.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.340
We have miniature llamas and alpacas, chickens,
ducks.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.680
We have bearded dragons.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:26.970
Our website is www.squealsonwheels.us.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.800
Leopard gecko's tails are quite interesting.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.200
They, like other lizards, lose their tails,
particularly as a defense mechanism and also

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.630
because of stress and disease and some other
causes.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.960
The leopard's tail is constructed where is
has actual soft tissue areas where a predator

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.450
that is chasing a gecko that catches it by
its tail, that soft tissue area will separate,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.020
and it's a naturally caused issue with the
geckos.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.010
The tail can actually drop off without the
predator bitting it, and it will wiggle and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.390
the predator will spend some time looking
at its tail while the leopard can get away.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.750
There's the soft tissue area also constricts
its blood vessels immediately upon release

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.390
of the tail, and it doesn't cause any problems
of excessive blood loss.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.050
The tail after it's lost will grow back.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:27.070
It will look a bit different, but it's gonna
be replaced by another tail.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.990
When a leopard gecko's tail does drop off,
you to have a couple of considerations.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.020
You need to keep up a clean area in its cage
so it doesn't get infections.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.830
It's better to have a covering of newspapers
over the bottom of the cage.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.200
It can absorb any droppings or any of the
liquids that comes out of the geckos, and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.560
you must keep other geckos away from him because
other geckos tend to bully or pick on the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.030
gecko.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.729
Also need to watch when feeding crickets.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.420
The crickets will actually go after the gecko
if they're left in there for a long time.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.370
So take any excess crickets after about 4
or 5 minutes of eating with the gecko.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.920
Take them out and feed them again later.
