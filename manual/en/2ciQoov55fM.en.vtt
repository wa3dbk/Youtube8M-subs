00:00:03.101 --> 00:00:04.660
(tape rewinding)

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.471
- [Voiceover] Starting right here.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.140
You say you're a madman.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.720
How long have you been
in this state of mind?

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.920
It sounds pretty wonderful. Heh.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.020
- Oh, since I was nine or ten.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.400
You learn to live with
your crazy enthusiasms,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.320
which nobody else shares.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.580
And then you find a few
other nuts like yourself,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.620
and they're your friends for a lifetime.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.540
That's what friends are.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.280
They're people who
share your crazy outlook

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.920
and protect you from the world, you know,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.680
'cuz nobody else is gonna
give a damn what your doing.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.700
So you need a few other
people like yourself.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.780
(soft music)

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.700
- [Chad] Bradbury tapes, side one,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.860
with Lisa Potts and Chad Coates.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.379
Do you feel you have to be protected

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.960
from the world that surrounds you or?

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.280
- While you're growing, sure,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.120
because you're tender
and you doubt yourself.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.260
Friendship is an island
that you retreat to,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.920
and you all fall on the floor and laugh

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.020
at all the other ninnies
who don't have enough brains

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.980
to have your good taste, right?

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.520
- [Chad] Yeah.
- [Ray] Yeah.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.840
(soft music)

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.180
- Um, these are kind of weird questions.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.940
We had an article in our
newspaper and it said

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.520
Ray Bradbury has never driven
a car or been in an airplane.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.719
Is that true?
- That's right.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.380
What do you think I'm doing
here in the back seat?

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.360
- [Lisa] So you've never in
your whole life ever driven?

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.140
- Never have been behind the wheel.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.220
- [Lisa] Why is that?

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.380
- Oh, it seemed a good idea. That's all.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.860
- [Lisa] Are you scared
of cars or scared of--

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.120
- Oh, I'm scared of myself.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.840
I think I'd be a bad driver.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.160
I'm scared of cars period.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.300
I've had too many friends killed now

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.440
and I've seen too many
people killed in my life

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.060
when I drove across the
counrty when I was 12.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.700
I'm sure that has a lot to do with it.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.680
If you see a few real dead bodies

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.580
with brains on the pavement,

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.740
it does a lot to change your attitude.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.919
It means you can get it, too, you know?

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.820
I've had a lot of relatives killed.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.950
I've had a lot of dear friends killed.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.620
It's stupid. The whole activity is stupid.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.220
- [Lisa] Well, what
about, why don't you like

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.060
to go in airplanes?

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.979
Are you scard of them, too?

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.120
- [Ray] I don't like being up high.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.180
It took me three days to get
to the top of the Eiffel Tower.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.260
(lively music)

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.480
- [Lisa] So you do write, you know,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.020
very realistically, because, you know--

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.800
- [Ray] Well, it's a combination
of realism with fantasy.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.260
But no, I don't like realism
because we already know

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.200
the real the facts about
life, most of the basic facts.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.300
I'm not interested in
repeated what we already know.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.520
We know about sex, about
violence, about murder, about war.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.660
All these things, by the time
we're 18, we're up to here.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.580
&gt;From there on we need
interpreters, we need poets,

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.440
we need philosophers, we need theologians,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.720
who take the same basic
facts and work with them

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.179
and help us make due with those facts.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.780
Facts alone are not enough.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.960
It's interpretation.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.500
(elegant music)

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.560
- [Lisa] We'd like to know how
you go about writing a story.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.980
Like, do you take other people's opinions

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.040
and where do you get your ideas?

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.519
- [Ray] You don't pay any attention

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.112
to anything anyone else says.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.200
No opinions.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.700
The important thing is to
explode with the story,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.960
to emotionalize the
story, not to think it.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.090
If you start thinking, the
story is gonna die on its sheet.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.570
And it's like anything else.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.320
If a athlete is running around

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.880
the high hurdles, let's
say, and he starts thinking

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.879
about the next hurdle, now he's doomed.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.220
He's gonna knock it down.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.739
- [Lisa] Yeah.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.880
- [Ray] People who take books on sex

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.920
to bed become frigid, you know.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.396
You get self-consious.
- [Lisa] Yeah.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.420
- [Ray] You can't think a story.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.140
You can't think,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.140
"I shall do a story to improve mankind."

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.680
Well, you know, that's nonsense.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.460
All the great stories, all
the really worthwhile plays,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.700
are emotional experiences.
- [Lisa] Yeah.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.840
- [Ray] If you have to ask
yourself whether or not

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.680
you love a girl or you
love a boy, forget it.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.179
You don't. You know.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.340
So a story is the same way.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.260
You either feel a story and need to write it,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.120
or you better not write it.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.580
(elegant music)

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.000
- [Chad] Did you have any formal training

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.640
in writing of any type?

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.480
- Not formal, no.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.613
But I am a dedicated madman,

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.519
and that becomes its own training.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.360
If you can't resist, if the
typewriter is like candy to you,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.319
you train yourself for a lifetime.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.980
Every single day of your life,

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.280
some wild new thing to be done.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.959
You write to please yourself.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.940
You write for the joy of writing.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.720
And then your public reads you

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.818
and it begins to gather
around your selling

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.336
a potato peeler in an alley, you know.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.100
The enthusiasm, the joy itself draws me.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.980
So that means every day
of my life I've written.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.418
When the joy stops, I'll stop writing.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.060
(lively music)

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.720
- [Lisa] In most of your books, like, well,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.600
"The Martian Chronicles" is about Mars,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.080
but even "The Illustrated Man,"

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.299
everything that happens
in outer space is on Mars.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.240
I was wondering, are you
really preoccupied with Mars,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.497
or why are you?

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.760
- [Ray] Oh, I think
because it's closest to us

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.580
and you grow up with a
romance of Mars, you know.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.880
When I was a kid, some of the
earliest clear photographs

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.600
of Mars were being published

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.020
from the Lowell Observatory in Arizona.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.473
And since it's the nearest
planet and we know,

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.740
we've always had this
feeling that someday,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.920
if we went anywhere, it would be

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.000
to the moon and then to Mars.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.720
And that's the way it's turning out.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.938
We'll be landing there in a few years now.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.980
- [Chad] I think we'd
better turn the tape over

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.780
- [Ray] Alright.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.854
- [Chad] It's pretty
close there to the end.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.770
- [Ray] Okay.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.168
(tape rewinding)
