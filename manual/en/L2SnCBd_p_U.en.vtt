00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.550
What's up guys, hope you're doing well.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.840
So we're at the University of Central Florida
doing my first social experiment.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.380
I've seen a couple of YouTubers do this before...but
I've never seen a black man do it.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.800
So, I call this: Black Man Staring at People.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.610
Hello.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:31.149
How are you today?

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:46.929
What's up?

00:00:46.929 --> 00:01:01.690
Do you want the computer?

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.370
I'm sorry.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:21.720
Can I help you?

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:31.730
Nah, I'm good.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:38.410
What's up?

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:52.380
You need something?

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.360
No.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:13.340
Oh, ok.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.320
Huh?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:34.300
What happened?

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.280
What?

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.270
Yes?

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:58.990
Can I help you?

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.090
What?

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:14.470
This is incredibly awkward.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.510
That's all I got for you guys this week.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.890
Make sure to leave a comment down below about
which social experiment you want to see next.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.760
As always, new videos every Sunday.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.200
No Jugamos Juegos.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.920
Throw me the alley.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.730
I'm a grown man.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.790
We're just staring at people and seeing there
reactions.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:50.569
Well you got me cause I was so creeped out.

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.270
What did you think was going on?

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.969
I did not know at all.
