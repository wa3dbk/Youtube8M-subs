00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.160
Rome. Nature and the Ideal. Landscapes 1600-1650
5 July to 25 September 2011 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:14.400
The Prado is presenting the exhibition Rome. Nature and the Ideal. Landscapes 1600-1650. 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.120
It has been organised by the Museum itself in collaboration with two French institutions: 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.040
the Louvre and the Réunion des Musées français.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.080
This is an exceptionally ambitious exhibition that includes more than 100 works

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:35.800
in the form of around 85 paintings and 20 drawings. 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.040
It represents the first time that landscape 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.400
has been the subject of such an extensive and detailed focus. 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:54.840
The principal theme of the exhibition is thus 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.440
the development of landscape painting between 1600 and 1650,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:07.920
which were the crucial years for the rise and evolution of this genre in Europe.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:16.840
Rome became a remarkable experimental laboratory and the starting place for ideas that spread across the whole of Europe. 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:27.040
Within the city, painters of 19 different nationalities 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:39.320
exchanged ideas and innovations on landscape painting, making trips to the countryside around Rome 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.480
in the first systematic practice of plein air drawing and even painting 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.240
in order to capture effects of light and atmosphere. 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.360
These artists also exchanged ideas on the formulation of the intellectual concepts 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.520
behind this new type of painting through which their first-hand studies of the natural world 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.920
were subsequently translated into a more intellectualised vision of reality

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.600
that came to be termed the classical landscape. 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.720
In works of this kind the atmospheric effects mentioned earlier were to some extent intellectualised 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.920
to become elements within depictions of biblical or mythological narratives. 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:39.920
In addition, these works have an underlying philosophical content that relates to the quest

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.920
for an arcadian existence lost to mankind as the result of civilisation.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.280
The genre of landscape painting was the result of the simultaneous presence in Rome of various artists 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.200
from different parts of Europe and Italy. 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.840
Among Italian artists one of the most important was Annibale Carracci from Bologna, 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:06.240
who worked alongside a group of his pupils and followers, most of whom were also Bolognese, including Domenichino. 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.200
The latter associated with a number of northern artists such as Paul Bril and Adam Elsheimer,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:25.320
all of whom were involved in the evolution of landscape painting. 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:34.840
This, then is the scope of the exhibition, which starts around 1600 with the work of these pioneering figures, 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:44.040
the construction of new themes and of the theoretical bases of this new genre. 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.840
The exhibition then moves on to the middle of the 17th century with the achievements of the two leading names in this field, 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.120
Claude Lorrain and Poussin, both of whom were French. From notably different starting points, 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:05.760
both artists took the ideas and concepts that were developed in the early years of the century 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:14.960
to their furthest consequences.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:23.240
These concepts evolved at this time were not in fact superseded until the second half of the 19th century 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.640
by artists who devised radically different theories to bring about a complete shift in direction

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:35.680
in relation to the ideas that had emerged in the first half of the 17th century.

00:04:37.800 --> 04:37:00.040
