00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let’s have look at setting defer and due

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
dates in OmniFocus for iPhone. 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If we go over to the Inbox you can see I have a number of tasks

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that require action. Some of these tasks do

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
not need to be started until a specific date in the future.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
For example, “Tidy living room” cannot be started

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
until I have the time next weekend. It doesn’t

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
make sense that I see this task every day in my Inbox should I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
check on what tasks to accomplish for the day. It would

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
be better if I could set a start or defer date for that task

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that appeared when that date arrived. This is where

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
defer dates come in. To set a

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
defer date, tap on the task, then choose

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
“Defer Until” from the list. From here

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
we can use the date picker to choose a future date and time.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
There’s also a set of buttons

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
below the date picker that pushes the date forward by a day,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
week, month or year.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The later button pushes the date

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
forward by a random amount and the clear button clears

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the field of all defer dates. We’ll set our

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
defer date to a week from today, next weekend.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Going back to the inbox

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
we see that the task is no longer visible

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The task will appear here 1 week from now to remind us

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
to complete that task. Pulling down

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
down on the screen reveals the hidden toolbar.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Tapping in the “View” button takes us to View Options

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
where we see the view is set to “Available”.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Let’s change it to “Remaining” and note that the tasks appears

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
in the Inbox but appears greyed out, signaling

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that it is not available, whether through being in a sequential

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
project or, in this case, not until

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
a specific date. Due dates

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
are  points in time where actions absolutely have to be

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
done by. Looking at my Inbox, I realise

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that I will run out of milk by tomorrow afternoon.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It is essential that I buy milk, therefore, by tomorrow morning.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
To set due dates in OmniFocus for

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
iPhone is remarkably similar to the process of defer

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
dates. Let’s go into our “Buy milk”

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
task to find out how. If we

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
tap on the “Due” field we are presented with an indentical copy

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
of the defer options. We can choose

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
to have our task due by choosing from the date picker,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
we can clear, or use one of the presets.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
For this task we are going to use the date picker.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I am going to set our task to be due at

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
10am tomorrow. We’ll confirm by tapping

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the “Due” field again. Going back

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to our Inbox shows that the status circle on the right hand side

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
has changed to amber. Text also

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
indicates when that task is due. This gives

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
us a great visual representation of due and overdue

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
tasks by simply scanning the perspective.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Moving over to the Forecast perspective for a moment

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
now shows that 1 task is due on Sunday,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
indicated by an amber number above the day.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Tapping on that day show what tasks are due.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Forecast view will be discussed in more

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
detail in a future movie.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Setting dates in OmniFocus 2 for iPhone gives us confidence

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
that our tasks will show up when needed, and remind

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
us of tasks that are due for crucial time sentitive events.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
In the next movie, we will look at

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.766
repeating tasks.
