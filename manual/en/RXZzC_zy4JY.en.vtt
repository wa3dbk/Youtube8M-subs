00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.439
this is the most amazing origami story.

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:05.820
you have to fold a square piece of paper.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:12.120
make 17 things in the process and in the end
make a boat. this story is about babloo.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.120
babloo during summer vacations is supposed
to go to his grandma's place and he finds

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.000
that there is a very fine lake over here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.269
babloo thinks it would be very nice if he
had a boat to sail. grandma gives him some

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.580
money and he goes to the market.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.810
and as he is walking by he sees a very fancy
store and finds this salt paper box.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.650
he falls for it and buys for his grandma.
as he saunters further down the road he finds

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.750
a store selling ready made garments.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.360
all kinds of fancy dumpers, jackets, clothes.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.380
he sees a very nice jacket with a collar and
two long sleeves.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.690
it had a beige color so he thinks that grandma
is going to like it very much so he bought

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.530
this jacket for his grandmother.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.120
as he goes down further.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.270
he finds a store selling a pair of very nice
trousers.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.480
he buys this pair of trousers for his grandfather.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.960
down the lane he finds big stores having boats
for sale.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.650
babloo enters it, but all he finds is that
the store is selling steam boat with two funnel

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.800
like chimneys.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.080
he says what will i do with a steam boat.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.500
i need a small boat for my small lake. so
babloo walks further down and now he comes

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.640
down to an antique store selling all kinds
of period furniture.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.320
he finds this teak table.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.520
he thinks that grandpa is going to love this
and also he buys that.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:56.409
now he is very tired and he finds a windmill
and he brings some water there he finds other

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.740
store which is selling twin boats.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.510
he is not interested in twin boats either.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.659
so he walks down further and he finds another
store selling boats.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.039
when he enters inside he finds out that this
store is selling only sail boats.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:18.629
but he just wants an ordinary boat which he
can oar. now he is carrying this table and

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:19.629
he feels tired.

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.930
he finds a farmer with a rooster.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.450
farmer is ready to exchange the rooster with
the table.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:33.190
but as soon as babloo get holds of the rooster
it flies away and babloo is very very dejected

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:42.240
because he had spent all his money buying
the salt paper box, jacket, trousers, he had

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.270
no money left and the rooster which he exchanged
for the big table has also run away.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:58.370
so he is a bit dejected, his head is hung
down and he is walking down the road and what

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:06.430
he sees is that on one side of the road there
something is lying.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.780
he sees that it is a purse, someone's fallen
purse and babloo is very excited.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.550
he sees inside and thre is some money.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.010
so that makes him very happy.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.470
probably of course he goes to the nearest
garment shop and buys himself a cricket cap,

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:33.000
a very cool cap and then as he is going down,
he passes through this glittering market selling

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.760
all kinds of pretty things and there he sees
a photography shop which has got very lovely

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.819
frames to put photographs.

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.660
he likes one frame very much.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.030
he thinks that grandma will be very happy
to put my mama's photo in it and so he buys

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.060
one.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.090
babloo seems to have forgotten that he had
come out to buy boats.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.540
then he remembers yes, that he has to buy
a boat.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.489
then he sees the biggest boat shop in town.

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.990
discounted boats, boats on sale.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:18.829
when he goes inside he finds a very nice boat
in which two people could sit facing each

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.000
other and the boat had backrest for both of
them.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.190
he thinks this would be a wonderful boat for
my grandparents and this is what he finally

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.110
buys a chinese junk.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:37.500
he is happy with what he had spotted and then
he takes this boat and goes back home.
