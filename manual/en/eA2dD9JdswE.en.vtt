00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.540
I've prepared a landscape, which is a marsh,
a freshwater in the front, and

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.860
a green field of grass.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.609
I've basically added fields of color, and
now I'm

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.400
going to add these strands of grass.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.779
There are literally endless strands of
grass.

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.340
I'm not going draw every strand.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.090
What I'm going to do is just draw
enough of them to show that it is grass.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.110
I'm going to be using color pastels, and I'm
basically making somewhat of a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.910
straight line, and I just let it go free at
the top.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.290
It's this type of
motion; I'm flicking my wrist and I'm just

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:56.250
going to do it in some areas,
enough so to show that in fact, it is grass.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.640
All you really have to do is
show it in certain areas; little concentrated

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.640
areas.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.930
You don't have to
spend the rest of your life drawing every

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.530
strand of grass.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.190
I'm using a basic shade of green.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.570
I'm going to come in with a lighter shade
of green.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.530
Because the light is hitting these blades
of grass, so some of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.690
what we see is a darker shade, some of what
we see is a lighter shade, and

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.070
some of the grass comes straight in the water,
because I'm going to add

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.500
those in, as well.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.909
Again, it's just an up-and-down movement;
I want to show

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.659
maybe there's wind blowing or some motion.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.240
I can create that, as well.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.680
They're just very, very fine lines.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.760
With pastel, if you make a mistake or you
put on a color you don't like,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.810
you can always wipe it right out.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.770
With a marsh, there's actual grass
growing out of the water, so I'm going to

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.090
add that, as well.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.470
Again, it
doesn't have to be solid, solid lines, but

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.240
just these touches.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.369
I'm going to
continue this, adding different shades of

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.840
green along with the lighter
greens.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.740
Instead of just one straight line, I'm almost
making little dashes,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.970
just to show that the strands of grass, the
blades of grass, growing out of

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.060
the water actually have different highlights.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.480
Then if I want to show a
specific area that has a concentrated color

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.790
of grass, I can just use the
side of my charcoal, or the tip, I'm using

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.730
the tip right now, and in a fast
up-and-down motion, almost scribbling right

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.319
through the area to show a
sense of grass.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.160
I'm now going to use a pencil; I'm using a
6B pencil.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.930
I'm going to use the
pencil and draw into the water.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.000
I want to show that the grass above is
reflecting in the water; there's a shadow

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.650
being cast.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.099
You can use pastel;
I'm going to use a pencil.

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.900
You have all these really beautiful long lines
that intersect and intertwine.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.890
It really shows that the grass is reflecting
in the water.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.709
I don't have to go everywhere with it, I don't
have to draw

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.410
every single line.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.440
I'm going to draw enough of the lines so that
you really

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.210
get a sense that this, in fact, grass.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.550
You can see that you can combine drawing materials;
you don't only have to

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.250
stick to one.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.459
You can use as many different materials as
you want, and

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.180
allow them to work together.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.050
Just within this reflection, these very simple
lines; I'm basically just doing this.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.340
When I do that right in the water, it
gives it a feeling of grass and grass being

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.340
reflected.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.280
If I wanted to, I could continue this drawing.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.930
I would continue with some
of the reflections, and I would continue drawing

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.670
more and more detail.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.530
The
last thing that I'm going to do is going to

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.329
take a brown piece of charcoal,
and in the top area, this yellow field of

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:24.639
grass, I'm just going to hint at
some little pieces of thicker, or darker,

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.600
grass showing in the background,
in the distance.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.720
I'm using the tip of my charcoal.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.139
I'm making just a very
gentle upward line.

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.790
There's an area here where the grass is blowing
in the

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.620
wind, so I'll allow it to move and have a
little more motion.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.350
I can take my
finger; I'm not rubbing it in, but I'm dabbing

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.330
it, just so that the lines
are not too, too detailed.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.430
My last step is I'm just going to move through
the drawing, because there

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.020
are some areas that are much darker.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.830
Within the grass, I'm just going to
use some black, and I'm going to bring that

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.720
black right in.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.030
This up-and-
down motion, like strands of grass, just to

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.490
show that sense of dimension
and depth, and then I'm going to rub it in

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.660
slightly.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.050
This is how I would
start.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.900
I would probably continue on with this drawing.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.430
I would continue
bringing in more color, I would continue bringing

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.930
in more strands of grass,
I would continue bringing in an overlapping

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:38.419
of colors and an overlapping of
all of these different elements in the drawing.

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:45.259
I've gotten far enough to
show the sense of grass, and to show how one

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:46.650
would draw grass.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.280
In your own drawing, I would suggest continuing
for as long as you want,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.860
and continuing, perhaps, to integrate pencil
into pastel so that you can

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.650
really show this movement of grass throughout
your whole drawing.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.650
Most
importantly, enjoy the process.
