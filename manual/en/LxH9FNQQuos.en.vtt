00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.646
Looks really colorful!!

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.080
Kind of looks like something you can eat!

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.186
But this isn't going to be

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.040
It's still going to be a fun project!

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.866
You want to know what this is!!

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.706
My names Ray Pajar

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.326
and welcome to Get Crafty Crafty!

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.820
Today we're going to be painting

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.966
wist shaving cream!

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:32.406
technique that you can actually

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.140
kids of all ages

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.233
and it's messy but

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.440
where you could actually have fun!

00:00:40.513 --> 00:00:42.666
Let go ahead and get started with todays project!

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.293
for todays project include:

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.046
some small bowls,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.700
if you don't have liquid watercolor,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.600
food coloring

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.560
can actually work as a great substitute,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.546
for this project,

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.580
a latex glove,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.160
and some crayons.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.906
Today we'll be using the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.420
from Crayola!

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.166
First take your bowl

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.386
with shaving cream.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.453
take your liquid watercolor

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.500
and give a few squeezes

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.606
onto your shaving cream!

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.633
Using your paint brush

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.773
and your shaving cream together.

00:01:31.193 --> 00:01:32.560
You want to do this carefully

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.240
so that you could keep the foaminess

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.466
of your shaving cream!

00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:38.460
Repeat the same steps

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.833
to get other colors.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.880
to draw something cool

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.480
on your paper.

00:01:45.486 --> 00:01:46.933
To paint with your shaving cream

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:48.286
you could either apply it

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.880
and have a little messy fun

00:01:53.953 --> 00:01:56.213
and use your latex glove

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.313
onto your paper.

00:02:02.086 --> 00:02:04.060
Feel free to

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.193
mix and match your colors

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.126
and spread it around.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.586
If you do paint with your fingers

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.353
greater range of control

00:02:16.693 --> 00:02:17.960
the foam.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.593
The shaving cream actually.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.113
because you actually get to blend it in

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.360
on your project!

00:02:30.093 --> 00:02:31.440
When you're working

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.686
your shaving cream paint.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.353
have fun with it!

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.046
Just because I don't want to get any

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.053
If you are using

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.886
using the glove.

00:02:46.953 --> 00:02:48.400
Just because

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.680
when you're using your hands

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.346
it actually allows you to

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.373
technique a little bit more.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.620
create really cool

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.166
patterns on your paper.

00:03:02.773 --> 00:03:04.140
With the shaving cream it's

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.526
really east to clean up.

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:07.760
You just need a quick

00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:10.073
wet nap to wipe your table

00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:12.426
It dries almost

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.260
if you have a thin layer of

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.326
color.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.493
show kids how to

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.693
