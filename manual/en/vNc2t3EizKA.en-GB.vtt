00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.600
Dogs, they're man's best friend, we've heard
of guide dogs, dogs on farms and sniffer dogs,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.150
but not many of us have heard of dogs that
open doors undress you and help disabled people

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.740
with day to day household chores that most
of us take for granted. Midhurst is home to

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.480
Canine Partners a small charity that trains
dogs to carry out such tasks.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.210
Canine Partners trains assistance dogs to
help people who have disabilities, primarily

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.210
people who are wheelchair users, perhaps with
conditions like multiple sclerosis, cerebral

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.609
palsy occasionally people with disabilities
who's would also approach Canine Partners

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:46.269
for an assistance dog. The assistance dogs
help out by doing a range of task work both

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:52.039
around the home and out in town so the kind
of work the dogs will do is retrieving items

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.430
that perhaps someone drops or may need from
around the home like a phone to get help in

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.210
an emergency or an inhaler, the dogs also
do a lot of tugging work to help so for example

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.130
tugging doors open and closed, tugging people's
clothes off, perhaps tugging an item closer

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.160
to you if it's too far away the dogs will
also use their noses and their paws to operate

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.430
switches, so that might be out in town hitting
a lift switch or a pedestrian crossing button

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.300
maybe hitting an alarm phone again to get
help in an emergency so a range of task work.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.780
One person who has benefited from the work
of Canine Partners is Eileen, she and Sailor

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.000
have been partners for 6 years.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.830
The main disability I've got is a rare neurological
condition called stiff man's syndrome it basically

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.820
affects messages going from the brain to various
parts of the body, the muscles, sometimes

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.530
this message that I want, if I wanted to say
move a foot sometimes the message just doesn't

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.560
get to the foot, other times it will get to
a muscle but probably the wrong leg or maybe

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.480
an arm or something, it gets a bit confused.
The impact this has on me is that I can't

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:12.569
do the stuff that I was able to do as an able
bodied person, getting undressed is difficult

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.230
and is very tiring, if I want to open and
close doors then I have a problem because

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.340
I can't get close enough to the doors I used
to always ask a human, you know, can you open

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.620
that door, can you close that door, can you
pick that pen up off the floor. To describe

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:41.420
Sailor, I couldn't do it in a few words. He's
a miracle basically he didn't just change

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.170
my life for the better, he actually gave me
a life, before I got him I very rarely- I

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:56.329
never went to a park, why would I go to a
park, I didn't go out that often, but now

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.280
because I've got him, ever since I've got
him he's got to go out, he's got to go out,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.420
so that means whether I feel like going out
or not we go out and it doesn't matter whether

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:15.780
it's raining, snowing, hailing we go out.
Looking back as to how I was before I got

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.521
him, there's now no comparison, there's just
no comparison. He's fine, he helps me, he's

00:03:22.521 --> 00:03:30.900
a worker but he's also he's part of my family,
he is my family, I don't feel a whole person

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.060
unless you know he's with me.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.099
So with dogs like Sailor making such a huge
difference to people's lives why isn't Canine

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.260
Partners as well known as it should be?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.840
Canine parters isn't as well known as some
of the other assistance dogs charities mainly

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.459
because it hasn't been going as long guide
dogs obviously are the best known and they've

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.430
been around for nearly 80 years now but I
guess they weren't that well known at the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.349
beginning, but we are getting better known.
We've had quite a lot of television recently

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.200
which is the way to really spread the word
to as many people as possible and it's my

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.370
job in the charity to try and raise awareness
in print media and broadcast media and also

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.760
with all the partners that we've got out there
walking around with their dogs they're a walking

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.840
advert for us as well.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.289
Anyone who has a disability who thinks that
they could really benefit from that a dog

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:26.250
could give them would be eligible to apply
for a dog they could either obviously go to

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.819
the website to apply online or just give us
a call, talk through it with us and then the

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:38.160
application procedure starts, we will send
out an application form and then we will go

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.500
and have a home visit and that's when we can
really assess if they understand how our dog

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.509
is going to impact on their life because obviously
having a dog coming in to your life changes

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.879
everything about everything that you do on
a daily basis and it's not going to be right

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:59.240
for absolutely everybody so we need to make
sure that they understand that the dog needs

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.199
exercise every day that is needs grooming,
feeding and all of those things but we also

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.120
then say obviously the benefits that you'll
get from the dog will be huge. And once those

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.560
two stages are passed, you're placed on the
waiting list for around about 18 months that's

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.420
the length of our waiting list approximately
at the minute and then once you're at the

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.970
top of your waiting list and we find a dog
in advanced training that really is going

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.270
to suit your criteria and your lifestyle we'll
invite you in, you work with the dog for a

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.740
couple of days when we're sure it's definitely
a match and you look good together we invite

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.259
you on a 2 week course and train you up on
how to work together and beyond that moment

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.810
we always provide aftercare for the dogs so
you're never left alone with the dog we'll

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.750
go in regularly to check that you're well
and the dog's well and to help you out with

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.750
the training more tasks.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:50.150
I really hope the future for Canine Partners
is growing in terms of helping more people

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.710
with disabilities to have one of our dogs
that's our whole reason for being, there are

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:02.130
1.2 million wheelchair users in this country
and a huge number of those could benefit from

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.240
a Canine Partner, now obviously we can't support
or train dogs for all of them at the moment

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.030
but if we can help just a few more people
to have some independence back in their life

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:17.069
plus the companionship of a dog then that's
really what we want to do we are hoping to

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.310
open another centre up in the Midlands in
the next couple of years and that will allow

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.319
us to train more dogs take more puppies in,
train them and place them with more people

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.919
so that's our aim for the immediate future.
