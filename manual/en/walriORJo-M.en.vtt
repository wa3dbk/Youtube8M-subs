00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.870
Hello and welcome to Todd's kitchen. Todays reacive may look healthy on the outside but when you see the inside its not that healthy

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.520
But it still tastes pretty good, so join me today as i make my version 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:16.520
of chewy flap jacks

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.720
So i have a pot on the stove on a medium heat and to that place in 100 grams

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.329
of butter

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.070
and keep stiring until the butter is melted.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.340
Now that the butter has melted we are going to add in one hundred grams of brown sugar

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.810
Now you can use white sugar if you like 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.530
I just find brown sugar has a much nicer taste

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.100
and then we are going to add in one hundred grams of golden syrup
of golden syrup

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.610
Now if you can't find golden syrup where you live

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.920
I will leave a link at the end of this video on how to make it at home

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.360
So what we are going to do now is continuously stir this

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.820
over a medium heat until the sugar has completely dissolved and everything is 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.340
nicely combined 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.560
The sugar has completely dissolved and is just starting to come to a boil

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.370
So now its time to take it of the heat

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.680
So next we are going to grab our 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.180
porridge oats 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.610
and pour those right in

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.590
Then give it a good stir through until its well combined 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.570
I have a baking dish here and I'm praying it with some

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.260
cooking spray oil

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.610
and next place our mixture

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.890
right into the pan

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.940
and spread it out so its nice and even and uniform 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.760
Once done we are going to place this into a pre heated oven at a hundred eighty degrees

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.490
celsius for twenty five to thirty minutes

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.490
But keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't brown up to much

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.900
I have taken this out of the oven and its still pretty hot so im going to let it cool down

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.810
for a good half an hour then it will be ready to cut up

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.720
So i have just cut them up and they have turned out fantastic

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.010
Now just keep in mind these are darker then normal flap jacks for the simple reason i used

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.480
brown sugar

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.160
and i also used golden syrup

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.410
the more traditional recipe uses

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.740
corn syrup and white sugar 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.010
but honestly 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.819
give this a go with the brown sugar

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.079
and the golden syrup

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:13.169
it really does enhance the flavour it truly truly does

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:20.169
but im going to give one a try now

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.930
That is really good

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.379
That really is a lovely treat

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.929
Those rolled oats mixed with the brown surgar and golden syrup

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:31.400
i'll tell you what, these taste simply delicious 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.659
an they are incredibly simple and easy to make. As i said these are not 100% traditional  

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.809
flap jacks

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:42.229
But they are still flap jacks just with slight changes in ingredients 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:46.209
which really do enhance the flavour so i challenge you to give them a go

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.389
