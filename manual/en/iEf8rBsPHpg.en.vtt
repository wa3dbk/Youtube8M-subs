00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.260
Hello everyone!

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.700
In this video I'll show you how I made a tiiiiny piece of resin.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.480
"DIY TUTORIAL RESIN NECKLACE"

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.960
The piece in question is this:

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.780
Which is a replica of the Vaas necklace made with resin.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.160
For those of you wondering who the hell is Vaas...

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.480
What better way to know who is this character...

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.060
that taking a look at my other video and watch the inspired makeup I did?

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.980
What better way?

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.840
And I absolutly recommend it.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.760
And well, little else to add...

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.020
The truth is that I'm aware that few people, not to say hardly a soul...

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.360
will go search how to make the Vaas necklace,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.120
I hope at least works for someone to know how to make another piece of resin.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.800
And also in a Veeery Cheap way.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.960
And even if you are totally sure that you don't go to make any craft like this in your whole life...

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.760
Stay here, maybe this video entertains you!

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.280
[Crying Baby]

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.600
So either way ...

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.260
(Wait, I see me a moment there...)

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.195
Eeehhh... back to what I was talking about.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.160
I simply hope you like it...

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.094

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.960

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.920

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.180
And that's it!

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.180
I really hope this help you and encourage you to do any piece.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.720
If you make something, I would love to see it, so feel free to send me a picture to any of my social networks.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.435
That would make me very happy!

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.140
