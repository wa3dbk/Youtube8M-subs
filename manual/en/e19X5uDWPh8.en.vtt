00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.480
Typically for cloud droplets to grow they
need a small tiny seed particle to get

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.670
that condensation of the water
started.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.950
And so most people haven't thought of pollen as being a good

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.219
starter for cloud droplets because
generally they're too large and they don't

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.809
last in the atmosphere that long.

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.070
But what we found is when pollen gets wet
it can rupture very easily and make

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.039
lots of small tiny particles

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.159
that can act is good seeds for clouds. 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.960
When we think about the life cycle of pollen

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.529
the tree emits pollen to try to
transmit its genetic material.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.740
So it emits these huge amounts of pollen
grains with the small chance that one of

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.940
those grains might land on a tree
somewhere else,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.510
so it's actually pretty inefficient
system from the tree's perspective.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.610
So a lot of that pollen ends up around the
tree, it ends up in the atmosphere,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.879
it might be transported distances from maybe one to several 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.159
or potentially even hundreds of
kilometers.

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:48.859
Our question is really

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.879
focused on what happens to the rest in
that pollen that ends up in the

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.660
atmosphere before it makes it to its
potential target

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.710
and also before it ends up influencing
humans with seasonal allergies.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.670
We took particles and we put them in what we call a cloud condensation nuclei chamber

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.330
which means that we test to see whether
or not the particles could act like a

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.580
good CCN if they were in the
atmosphere.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.360
So a cloud condensation nuclei is a small
seed particle that acts as a collector

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.659
for water in the atmosphere.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.100
They can be natural from natural sources
like for example what I'm talking about

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.229
today which is pollen

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.989
or they can also be anthropogenic or
caused by humans from different types of pollution

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.900
Clouds are important because they're making
the precipitation and the response of

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.060
precipitation under future climate
warming is still very

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.329
location dependent so in some regions
you might be an increase in

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.860
precipitation and other regions you'd see a
decrease.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.560
One of the things that we're trying to
understand is how pollen can influence

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.360
clouds and precipitation

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.400
under present day and in future climate.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.380
In terms of trying to understand what's going to happen

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.270
for future climate understanding all
these different compounds we put in the

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.310
atmosphere is very important.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.620
So most people are concerned with greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane they're very

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.799
important for absorbing infrared
radiation

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.450
but what are the biggest uncertainties
in this system right now

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.340
is understanding how aerosols and
the pollen as a natural aerosol impact

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.079
clouds. Its pretty well known that
individual trees can put out

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.090
millions of pollen grains and when we
do pollen counts in the atmosphere there

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.019
usually on the order of

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.559
thousands during pollen season. a lot of
times after thunderstorms

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:15.499
A lot of times after thunderstorms

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.730
there's a huge rush in the emergency
room for allergic responses and

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.860
so people call that thunderstorm asthma. 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.769
And so there's been a lot of theories
about why these types of events happen

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.500
and one of them has been that in some
way the thunderstorms are triggering

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.450
this rupture of pollen and that makes it more respirable and that's why you see more of a response.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.200
There's still no clear evidence for
that but

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.670
some of those thoughts had us thinking about
what that would mean for other

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.769
you know for atmospheric systems not
just from the human health perspective.

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.209
And so one of the things that we're
thinking is that this could be important

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.630
in specific regions for example in
the northern mid-latitudes where we have

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.720
a lot of these trees

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.650
that put out wind driven pollen on and also
specifically at certain times of year.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.980
It's not going to be important everywhere at
every single time but during pollen

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.930
season we do think that in some
regions it could be contributing to the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.590
overall number of small particles in the atmosphere.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.260
mostly people have focused on trying to understand

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.540
anthropogenic components and that is
something that is extremely important as

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.170
we look towards understanding what's
happening in future climate

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.130
but to really understand the system as a
whole we need to understand both pieces.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.450
The MESSENGER spacecraft will hit

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.080
the surface of Mercury and crash at the end
of April.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.510
Basically we're out of fuel now we're at
the end of a really successful mission

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.360
what happens
