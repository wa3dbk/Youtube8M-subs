00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.780
Here at the school of Optometry and Vision Science we actually have a large eye care clinic

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.319
 which provides a number services
the public including primary care eyecare,

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.639
ocular disease treatment and low vision
rehabilitation.

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.349
Within those clinical services that we offer
we now offer a new sports vision clinic as well

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.400
and we have the equipment the facilities
that you see in here available

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.430
in that clinic to provide vision
training to the community at large

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.670
Vision training is basically exercises
for the visual system in a sense to help you use it more efficiently.

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.590
Just like weight training we're trying to
improve strength, fitness training we're

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.710
try to improve the general fitness level

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.430
vision training we are trying to improve
how you use your vision system.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.309
Predominantly the big thing I'm interested in is how we

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.399
respond to moving targets, how we process the visual information from moving targets

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.800
and then from there how do we make large
whole body coordinated

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.060
actions in response those targets.  

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.380
One of the areas that I work with is that I work with athletes a lot

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.210
because athletes tend to deal with a lot
of moving information when they play sports

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.789
and they tend to move their whole body. We use an SVT or sports vision trainer

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.660
which is a large board with a number
different lights on it in a grid pattern

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.480
with those lights we can program
different types of patterns whether they are things tips or deflections

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.290
or different patterns to mimic
peripheral vision tasks or essential vision tasks

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.350
Our second piece of equipment is called
a fit light trainer which is also in some ways

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.119
a reaction time piece of equipment but its 8 disks that light up

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.660
and we can arrange those discs on the
floor in front of you are on the wall

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.189
or on different stands and with those disks we can create different patterns again to train

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.089
central tasking skills are peripheral tasking
skills aiming skills and things like that 

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.900
We have a what's called a bassin anticipation timer

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.000
which has a long track with lights that move along it and we use that actually to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
work with athletes and how they
anticipate motion

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.300
whether it be like a ball coming towards
them, or someone moving towards them running towards them

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.040
and then the last piece of big equipment we use really an eye tracker and it allows us

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.220
to track where the athletes are actually
looking, so the position of both their eyes

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.530
as well as what they're looking at. So there are three cameras on that system

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.719
Athletes or anyone wear that when
they're performing a task and see what

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.040
they're looking and how

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.440
they are collecting the information, the visual information they are using.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.740
We are trying to understand what's normal first, from there we can start targeting
specific questions like can we train

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.149
particular vision tasks if we train the
vision and improve vision does it

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.220
translate into performance on the field
or performance and other everyday tasks

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.430
the ultimate goal really understanding
how we can improve vision systems for

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.930
athletes who are healthy and performing high levels

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.349
people maybe who have had vision loss
secondary to stroke or some other

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.800
eye injury or disease or something like
that, can we help them navigate their

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.080
everyday environments better

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.200
through vision training and also can
we help rehabilitate people.
