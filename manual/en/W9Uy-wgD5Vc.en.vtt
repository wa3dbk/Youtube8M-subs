00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.059
In today's video we will see how the follower robot circuit and light works

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:06.779
we will learn to ride.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.480
The sensors that are on the front are monitoring the black line and

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.160
They are accelerating or decelerating motors.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.719
This circuit is used for robots that make functions in industry.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:23.219
It is also used in universities for speed and dexterity skills.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.699
Let's see how it's done.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.620
This is the light follower circuit robot.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.280
Let's learn to ride. The first stage is the sensor,

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.579
we will serve to detect the black line.

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:44.759
In a video we saw how the sensor works. Here is the link so they can see.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.140
In this video we set up the first part of the sensor.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.220
Here is the sensor, all I did was get cable

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.259
so that it is pointing toward the floor.

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:55.640
When the black line passes over the LED turns off.

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.539
When he returns white lights.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.320
That pulse is sending, in this case, this cable orange, which is the point.

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.120
I will remove the LED to continue making assembly.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.379
From that point, which is the transmitter receiver CNY70

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:14.459
I connect a 1k resistor

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.140
to the base of 2N2222A transistor.

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.640
In this case, the transistor has the emitter legs left, center-based

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.420
and right-collector.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.900
Then I connect it to the center.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.579
The issuer that is the left leg goes negative cable.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.920
And the collector, which is the right leg, it is a resistance of 1 kilohm to positive.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.680
The color code of resistance of 1 KILOOHMNIO is brown, black, red and gold tolerance.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.380
I connect the collector to the positive.

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.239
Here we see that in the center, which is the base, is the 1K resistor. The left leg is the emitter to the negative.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.500
And the right, another 1k resistor to the positive.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:49.819
Which is the top bus.

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:52.819
This same point out a signal to the next stage

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.099
which will control the motor.

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:57.119
That connector comes a red LED.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.439
Positive top of the LED, which is the longest, will be connected there.

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:06.939
Says here comes a variable resistor 50 K.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.520
Why I put variable? Because often the car will go

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.960
moving too fast or too slowly.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.719
By varying this resistance I can make the engine turn

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.060
faster or slower, to achieve calibrate if you go too fast.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.800
In this case I will place a 1k

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.240
because I want the car go fast enough.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.620
If you start out on curves because they do not achieve control, I begin to change this.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.340
Or I can adjust the sensors. I have to start playing with it.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.520
You connect the 1k resistor

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.719
and is the base of another transistor 2N2222A.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.780
The issuer of the left cover should connect to ground.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.039
And the collector and get my gear motor. Remember to use a gearmotor

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.019
at least 1 kg force.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.860
If not, you can move them to the car on the floor.

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.479
It is connected between the collector and positive.

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:55.560
And I connect the positive to the collector of transistor.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.479
Let's see what happens when it passes over the black line.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.120
As we can see, when it detects the black line the engine is started.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.000
When the sensor detects that the car veered off the black line,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.520
the engine turns off the rim. And when he goes

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.000
on the black line,

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.140
It means on track and continues to operate.

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.280
The engine must be located on the opposite side

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:24.599
from where the sensor. So while the sensor

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.520
is above the black line, they'll be walking the two wheels. If this gets out,

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.539
It will shut down the engine

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.740
and the motor on the opposite side will continue to function

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:36.759
and bring the car back into the black line.

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:40.120
That way it will work. Remember to give click on "Like" to videos and if

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.139
They have not subscribed to my channel advantage to do so.

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.659
Upload new videos every Wednesday.

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.840
I leave here the link of the video where I explain how the circuit works,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.860
and how to finish assembling the mechanical part of the follower robot. Do not stop them.
