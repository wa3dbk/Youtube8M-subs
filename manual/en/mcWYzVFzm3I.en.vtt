When we're replacing our chain rings after
we've removed them, it's a few little things

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:15.430
that don't necessarily come to mind. One thing
is, it's great to have the right tools. And

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.759
Allen wrench that's got a nice long handle
so you can get some leverage--it also helps

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:29.429
for breaking them loose. And then your special
chain ring tool, which holds the nut that

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.449
holds the large and middle chain rings pretty
securely, so you have something to purchase

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:39.019
on when you're trying to tighten or loosen
them. Because for some applications--for the

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:45.780
width of some of these chain ring spiders--it
can be slightly different from spider to spider,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:56.039
so things don't always go together smoothly.
When we are putting a new small chain ring

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.750
on--normally we'd have all the bolts in, obviously--and,
you want to torque them evenly, so you do

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.290
it in a start pattern. And this goes for almost
any multiple bolt application on a bike. Torque

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.410
here, torque here, torque here, torque here,
and you just sort of do it across from each

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:21.010
other progressively until you have things
up to a good tightness. It's always--you always

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.920
want to put some grease, normal white lithium
grease, or what I prefer to use for chain

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:39.470
ring bolts is a thread locker from--this one's
from a company called Lock Tight. And there

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.580
are different grades of lock tight depending
on how permanent you want the bond. This one's

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.120
a blue lock tight, which is the grade of lock
tight that I recommend for most bike uses,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:59.070
because it's not permanent. It's a fairly
firm, hard to break bond. And what this does

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.750
is by creating a bond that nothing can get
through, it keeps things from corroding and

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.170
also keeps things from vibrational loosening.
If you aren't comfortable using thread lockers,

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.000
you can always use grease, and contrary to
popular opinion, grease is a good thing. It

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.470
keeps vibrational loosening and stuff like
that from happening. So I've put my nut and

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:32.380
bolt back in, I have my five millimeter Allen
wrench in my dominant hand, and in my non-dominant

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.081
hand, I'm just going to put my tin ring tool
in, try to brace it against the rest of the

00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:45.170
chain ring. You see it spun on me there. It
takes a lot of patience doing this. So I've

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.530
got it to a fairly good torque. And just like
when we're putting on the small ring bolts,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.640
we want to do one, two, three, four, and on
this specific crank, the fifth bolt is hidden

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.180
back here, so five, and we want to do them
in a pattern, evenly, to bring them up to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.170
torque so that we don't put anything on sideways--it
allows things to get crooked. So we want everything

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.650
to stay aligned. So then it's a simple matter
of bolting the crank arm back up on your bike,

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.680
and enjoy the ride with new chain rings, or
different chain rings, or just a whole new

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.540
perspective on things.
