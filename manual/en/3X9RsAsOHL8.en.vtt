00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Michelle, I don't understand...

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.410
What don't you understand?

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.400
Mitosis.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Oh, I actually have something that might help you.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.500
Listen.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
P.M.A.T. and the Division

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Interphase, Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.500
Telophase, Mikophase, Keliphase, Michellophase

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Hold Up- I lied about the last three 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500
But get prepared for an interesting story

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.600
Forget the biology- this is history

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.800
Buckle up buttercup, this is perplexing!

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.300
Interphase, consists of three phases:

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.600
G1, S, and G2- hey sis,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600
Do you do karate, cause your body's kickin'?

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.600
No, that's mitosis cause my cells be splittin'

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.300
Forget the math, 'cause one equals two.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.200
One DNA replicates, what do we do?

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.500
Mitosis!

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.700
Yeahhh, mitosis

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Oh, Oh,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.500
Yeahhh, mi'

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500
Mitosis!

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500
Yeah Prophase, as in Preparatory

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.700
Yeah Prophase, as in Preparatory

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.300
From the Greek word, "Pro" for "before it"

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.500
Chromatin to Chromosome.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.500
Good bye nucleoli, see ya' next cycle!

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200
Chromatin then join together

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.100
Mitotic spindle begins to develop

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.500
It's on! To the next step,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The cycle's only startin' so don't leave us hangin'

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.400
In metaphase, things start to align!

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.400
Before division, chromatids combine.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.400
Then split! In anaphase,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.700
Tubules grow shorter and the cell elongates,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Mitosis! Yeahhh

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Mitosis! Yeahhh

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Mitosis

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Mitosis

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Yeahhh

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200
Telophase, as in Tell all your friends

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600
The cycle's finishin' soon to start again

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.700
Further elongation, extrapolation

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Development, reparation, maturation

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.500
Split! In cytokinesis, don't tell me about it,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.800
Just check the cleavage

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
FURROW!

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.300
And away we go! The cycle's just finished.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.500
Hit the flo', don't stop-

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.500
Cause the cycle just began. Process starts over 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.800
As fast as it can, Mitosis!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Yeahh

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.300
Mitosis

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.500
Aww yeahhh
