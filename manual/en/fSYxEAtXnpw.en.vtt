00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.625
Not too long ago I woke up,
and I was in my bed.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.061
I'm, like, all right, well you
got nothing to do today.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:04.331
Why not just spend the day
thinking you have cancer?

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:07.901
[laughter]

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:09.403
And I had symptoms of something.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:11.705
I had these tingling
in my hands,

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.340
and my feet were tingling.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:15.142
So, I'm, like, I better Google
this shit.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:19.313
And any time you Google
symptoms, know in your heart

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:23.483
that all you're doing is looking
to confirm that you're dying.

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:25.319
That's all you're heading for.

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:27.721
So, I start Googling
"hands tingling,"

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:31.592
and I'm, like,
I got a brain tumor.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:34.228
So, I call my doctor up,
my regular doctor,

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:35.729
and I'm, like, I'm in trouble.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.531
My hands are tingling,
my feet are tingling.

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:40.567
I'm pretty sure I probably
have cancer in my brain, right?

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:42.703
And she's, like, what?

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:44.104
I'm, like, my hands and feet

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.873
are tingling,
what else could that be?

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:49.910
And she's, like, nothing.
It could be nothing.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:52.980
And I'm, like, but I want to see
a neurologist because I think,

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:54.915
I'm pretty sure
I have a brain tumor.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:58.519
I Googled it,
and it seemed to add up.

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:00.554
She's, like, I'm not sending you
to a neurologist, all right?

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:03.056
You come back in two weeks
and if this is still happening

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.092
I'll think about sending you
to a neurologist.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.795
I'm thinking, like, oh, it's
gonna be happening in two weeks.

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.064
I'll make sure of that.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:15.536
So, I go back two weeks later
and go, it's happening.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.572
We're on with the cancer.

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:19.973
And she's, like, I don't think
it's anything,

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:21.108
but I'll send you
to a neurologist.

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.143
I'm, like, thank you.

00:02:23.177 --> 00:02:25.078
So, I make an appointment
at the neurologist.

00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:26.647
This guy was--this was insane.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.382
So, I walk
into this neurologist.

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:30.584
He's about 80.
I'm not saying that's bad.

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:33.153
I'm not an ageist,
but he looked over it.

00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:34.621
There's nothing worse
than going to a doctor

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:37.090
and they're, like, bleh, what?

00:02:37.124 --> 00:02:40.727
All right.

00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:42.429
So, I walk in to this guy
and I say,

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:46.466
you know, my hands are tingling
and my feet are tingling.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.569
And I think I'm in trouble.

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:51.572
Swear to you, the guy grabs
one of my hands

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:53.006
and he presses his thumb into it

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:58.145
and he goes,
that one's all right.

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.047
And then he, like,
he does the same thing

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:01.448
to the other one.
And he goes those are fine.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:05.285
I'm, like,
are you even a real doctor?

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.587
And I go what about the feet?

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.055
He goes, take your shoes
and socks off.

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:10.224
I take my shoes
and socks off--takes a pencil,

00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:12.392
and rubs the eraser end
at the bottom of my foot

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:13.594
and goes, that one's fine.

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:15.195
I'm, like, are you kidding me?

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:18.398
I'm, like,
what kind of tests are these?

00:03:18.432 --> 00:03:20.434
I want to see a diploma.

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:22.202
And then I go what about my ear?

00:03:22.236 --> 00:03:24.238
My ear's clogging up.
He goes, oh, we should probably

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:25.973
get you an MRI,
and I'm, like, thank you.

00:03:26.073 --> 00:03:28.242
That's all I was looking for,
was the opportunity

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:29.610
to have an MRI.

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:32.145
So I go to the MRI place.

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:34.481
Have you had an MRI?

00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:36.750
The machine takes up
the whole room.

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:38.452
It's huge.
Big, arcing thing.

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:40.087
Got a hole in the middle
with a gurney.

00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:41.822
It's such a great machine,

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:44.558
an amazing piece of technology,
that the guy that operates it,

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:47.494
he's got to sit in a booth,
like, away from it,

00:03:47.528 --> 00:03:50.097
and do the controls,
like he's NASA,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.232
you know, for the MRI machine.

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:54.101
So, this amazing piece
of technology,

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:55.502
the guy comes out of his booth,

00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:57.971
he lays me out,
he straps me down or whatever.

00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:00.040
He lays me on the gurney
and he slides me in

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.075
and he goes back to his booth
and within 10 seconds

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.945
it starts going
dun-nun-nun-nun-nun-nun-nun-nun!

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:07.281
And I'm, like,
what the hell is that?

00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:08.649
Does it need oil?

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:10.484
What kind of machine
makes that noise?

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:12.252
Then it's, like,
nin-nin-nin-nin.

00:04:12.286 --> 00:04:13.921
I'm, like, what kind
of bullshit machine is this?

00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:15.656
Is there a guy in there
operating it?

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.457
I literally--
when I was in that machine

00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:19.459
I had a fantasy at the end
of the day, a little person

00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:21.061
walked out and went,
that was a rough day.

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:25.766
You're, like,
he was in there doing something.

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:27.935
So, I don't know what the hell
was going on with the machine.

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:29.603
I could Google that
instead of cancer

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:31.271
and I'd know what was going on
in the machine,

00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:33.073
but I like the idea of
a little man working in there.

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:35.108
So, I left it at that.

00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:38.078
So, the guy--

00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:39.947
I'm in there 45 minutes,
and the guy pulls me

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.949
out of the machine and goes,
you did real good in there.

00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:44.384
I'm, like, well, there's a skill
I didn't know I had.

00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:47.554
I can exist in a tube
for up to an hour.

00:04:47.588 --> 00:04:50.691
If I ever need that.

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:53.460
So, now I'm face-to-face
with this dude, this technician,

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:57.464
and I go so
did you see the results?

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:58.866
And he goes, yeah,
I'm the technician.

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:00.634
I saw them.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:03.237
And I'm, like, well, what's up?

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.206
He's, like, I'm not a doctor.
I can't tell you that.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.041
And I'm, like, I'm looking
him right in the eye,

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:10.911
and I'm, like, but you know.

00:05:10.944 --> 00:05:12.312
You're looking me
right in the eye.

00:05:12.346 --> 00:05:14.414
You know if I have a tumor
in my brain.

00:05:14.448 --> 00:05:16.550
You know if I'm dying right now

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:19.052
and you're not gonna
[bleep] tell me?

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:20.354
You're not gonna
[bleep] tell me,

00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:22.656
but you know if I'm dying
or not?

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.858
But I didn't say that.
I probably said, oh, okay.

00:05:24.892 --> 00:05:28.695
So...

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.264
So, I swear this happened.

00:05:30.297 --> 00:05:33.066
I'm about to leave the MRI room
and he goes,

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:35.502
"Take care of yourself."

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:38.539
[laughter]

00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:40.107
I don't know how he talks.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.875
All I heard was,

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.513
"Good luck with the cancer."

00:05:46.547 --> 00:05:49.082
So, now I'm freaking out.

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:51.084
I need to know now
whether or not

00:05:51.118 --> 00:05:52.486
I got brain cancer,

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.254
'cause
I plan to start drinking again.

00:05:54.288 --> 00:05:58.325
So, I wait there for a half hour
and he gives me the results.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.894
I drive them to my doctor's
office that afternoon,

00:06:00.928 --> 00:06:03.397
and I'm, like,
hi, can he look at these now?

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.632
And she's, like, he'll look
at them between 3:00 and 6:00.

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:07.367
I'm, like, what is he?
The [bleep] cable guy?

00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:09.937
This guy can't--
you can't focus in on a time

00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:12.072
and I got to wait
till the end of the day?

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:14.541
So, then the guy
calls me, like, at 6:00.

00:06:14.575 --> 00:06:17.110
He's, like, hello, Marc.
This is Dr. Rosen.

00:06:17.144 --> 00:06:18.612
And I'm, like, hi, what's up?

00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:20.547
He goes, well,
I looked at your MRI results.

00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:21.548
And I'm, like, uh-huh?

00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:22.950
And he goes,

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.053
"You have a normal brain
for a man your age."

00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:28.388
So, good news, but a little
stick, you know what I mean?

00:06:28.422 --> 00:06:31.592
You know...

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:35.128
no cancer,
but I'm not gifted in any way.

00:06:35.162 --> 00:06:37.164
But even after he told me
all that stuff, like,

00:06:37.197 --> 00:06:39.066
he wasn't clear enough with me.

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:40.801
'Cause he's, like, all right,
so, if you need anything

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:43.170
that I can help you with,
please call me back,

00:06:43.203 --> 00:06:44.938
and I go, thank you very much.
And I'm, like, wait!

00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:47.908
No tumors, right?
There were no tumors?

00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:49.810
As if he's going to go,
oh, shit,

00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:51.245
I didn't mention that?
Yeah--

00:06:51.278 --> 00:06:52.880
Yeah, your brain's full
of tumors.

00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:54.715
Good luck with that.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:54.815
Thank you.
