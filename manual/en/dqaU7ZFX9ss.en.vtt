00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
Welcome in the kitchen of

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.750
Today recipe is: "PASSATELLI" PASTA WITH BROTH

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.750
Pour in a bowl the grated parmesan,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.350
the breadcrumbs

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.650
the flour

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.630
that is an ingredient used mainly in my family

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.990
since I know you can make it also with no flour.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.620
2 eggs

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.110
and the nutmeg as much as you need.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.510
Begin to mix all the ingredients first by a spoon

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.100
then with your hands.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.370
Mix it well, there won't be any humps.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.350
Then make a ball and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.040
We will start to make "passatelli" shape.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.820
If you are interesting in "Chicken broth recipe"

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.580
click on the picture and you'll find my channel recipe.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.730
We use this potatoes masher to make "passatelli".

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.060
This is a bit old ^^. Anyway, use the disk with the largest holes.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.850
We use the disk with the smallest holes for mashed potatoes.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.190
So put the mixture ball inside the masher and wait for the broth to boil.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.060
When the broth is boiling, start to push the dough.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.690
"Passatelli" will fall in the broth easily.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.750
We'll use a knife to help the last pieces of dough to fall.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.540
Of course the broth has to be filtered previously.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.480
As you can see right now I'm using a knife to help myself.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.950
Mix the pasta and let it boil one more time.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.150
At that point it will be ready.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.620
So, the cooking time of "passatelli" is really short.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.880
The broth is boiling for the last time, so we can serve our "passatelli".

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.230
It's a perfect dish for winter time when it's cold outside.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:40.470
But I think that a good homemade passatelli plate with chicken broth can be enjoyed all the year.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:47.250
I hope that you enjoyed the recipe. Leave a comment under the video and I'll answer with pleasure!

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.250
ENJOY IT! Bye!!
