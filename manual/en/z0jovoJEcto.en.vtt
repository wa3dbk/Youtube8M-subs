00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.748
So, here's what you need to know

00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:01.902
Jason was bored one day

00:00:02.232 --> 00:00:04.140
so he decided to down a whole load

00:00:04.476 --> 00:00:05.138
of red bull

00:00:05.502 --> 00:00:06.577
and watch youtube

00:00:06.913 --> 00:00:08.880
You may not know this but red bull

00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:11.568
has pretty bad effects on egg insides

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.271
it causes them to jump about and shrivel

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:18.547
so that added to jason's already fragile brain

00:00:18.888 --> 00:00:21.729
coupled with hours of mindless entertainment from the internet

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:24.411
forced Jason to spaz out

00:00:25.047 --> 00:00:26.030
attacking other people

00:00:26.646 --> 00:00:28.668
and uttering nonsensical terms

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:29.806
( The cake is a lie)

00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:30.873
(Arhhh)

00:00:31.188 --> 00:00:32.660
So we threw him in the loony bin

00:00:33.446 --> 00:00:35.008
We all hope he'll get better

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:37.174
but there's no guarantees

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:46.463

00:00:47.438 --> 00:00:49.026
