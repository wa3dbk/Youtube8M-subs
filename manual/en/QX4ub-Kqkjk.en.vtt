00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:10.330
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;ANGELA CARONE: THESE SCULPTURES ARE PT
IN A MUSEUM COLLECTION, WHAT LOOKS LIKE BRONZE

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.530
OR STONE IS ACTUALLY PLASTIC.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:22.869
THESE SCULPTURES WERE ALL MADE BY COSMO WENMAN,
USING A CONSUMER GRADE 3D PRINTER.

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:29.150
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: THIS PARTICULAR PIECE IS, UM, CALLED
HEAD OF A HORSE OF CELINA.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.250
IT'S IN A CORNER OF THE ROOF OF THE PARKING
LOT ITSELF.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.480
THE ORIGINAL IS IN WHITE MARBLE.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.370
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;ANGELA CARONE: THESE HORSE HEADS ARE
BIGGER THAN WHAT IS NORMALLY PRINTED ON THESE

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.059
MACHINES.

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.820
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: I DECIDED TO CUT THE DESIGN INTO A
BUMP OF DIFFERENT PIECES.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.110
THIS IS ACTUALLY 29 SEPARATE PIECES I PRINTED
INDIVIDUALLY AND ASSEMBLED.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.010
AND THESE ARE BOTH LIFE SIZE, ONE TO ONE WITH
THE ORIGINAL.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:02.040
THEY BOTH WEIGH ABOUT EIGHT POUNDS EACH, AND
MAYBE ABOUT 150DOLLARS WORTH OF MATERIAL.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.470
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;ANGELA CARONE: WE ASKED WENMAN TO SHOW
US HOW THE PRINTER WORKS.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.500
WE DECIDED TO MAKE A SMALL VERSION OF AN ARTWORK
SAN DIEGANS ARE FAMILIAR WITH.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.460
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: WE'RE MAKING A MINIATURE TEST PRINT
OF BARBARA HELPWORTH'S 1960 FIGURE FOR LANDSCAPE

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.950
WHICH IS AT THE SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF ART.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.609
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;ANGELA CARONE: HE BEGINS BY PHOTOGRAPHING
THE ART HE'S SELECTED.

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:32.460
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: WHEN I'M TAKING THE PHOTOS, I TAKE
LOW ANGLES, MEDIUM ANGLES, HIGH ANGLES OF

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.860
THE ENTIREï¿½ ALL THREE 60 SIDES SO I CAN
GET EVERY DETAIL.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.380
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;ANGELA CARONE: WENMAN HAS PHOTOGRAPHED
IN MUSEUMS HERE IN THE STATES AND IN EUROPE.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.020
SOMETIMES HIGH HE TAKES UP TO A THOUSAND PHOTOGRAPHS
OF JUST ONE SCULPTURE, WHICH HAS DRAWN THE

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.009
ATTENTION OF MUSEUM SECURITY GUARDS.

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.150
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: THEY'RE USED TO SEEING ENTHUSIASTIC
PHOTOGRAPHERS, I IMAGINE I MIGHT LOOK LIKE

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.829
A PARTICULARLY NUTTY ONE TAKING A LOT MORE
PHOTOS THAN MOST.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.380
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;ANGELA CARONE: THE PHOTOGRAPHS GET RUN
THROUGH A SOFTWARE PROGRAM THAT CREATE AS

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.909
VIRTUAL 3D DESIGN THE PRINTER CAN READ.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.059
THAT INFORMATION IS PUT ON A MEMORY CARD WHICH
IS INSERTED INTO THIS 3D PRINTER.

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:13.939
TURN IT ON, AND IT STARTS BUILDING.

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:20.280
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A HOT GLUE GUN
ON A PRINTER ACCESS, IT CAN MOVE LEFT, RIGHT,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.279
UP AND DOWN, FORWARD AND BACK.

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:26.209
THERE'S PLASTIC FEEDING DOWN TO IT FROM ABOVE
ON A SPOOL.

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.980
AND IT'S DEPOSITING THE PLASTIC ON THE LAYER,
ON A PLATFORM, AND IT'S GOING TO MOVE DOWN,

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.419
DEPOSIT ANOTHER LAYER, MOVE DOWN, DEPOSIT
ANOTHER LAYER, AND BUILD THIS THING FROM THE

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:38.419
BOTTOM UP.

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:44.090
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;ANGELA CARONE: BECAUSE THIS IS A SMALL
PRINT IT WAS DONE IN ABOUT 45 MINUTES.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.529
THE HELPWORTH SCULPTURE IS NOT THE KIND OF
ARTWORK WENMAN TYPICALLY PRINTS.

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:53.549
HE MOSTLY STICKS TO ANTIQUITIES, I ASKS HIM
WHY.

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.730
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: THERE'S LOTS OF THEM, AND THEY'RE COPYRIGHT
FREE.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:08.040
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;ANGELA CARONE: A MUSEUM MAY OWN THE WORK,
BUT IF A COPYRIGHT HAS EXPIRED, ANYONE CAN

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.290
CAPTURING IT.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.939
WENMAN IS HOPING THE SMITHSONIAN SHARES INFORMATION
WITH THE PUBLIC SO THEY CAN DOWNLOAD IT.

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:24.969
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO MASK, DIGITIZE
SCULPTURAL ART, AND PEOPLE WILL DOWNLOAD WHAT

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:29.099
THEY WANT, AND SHARE WHAT THEY ALREADY LOVE
AND WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO SEE, AND OTHER PEOPLE

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.149
WILL REMIX THEM IN INTERESTING NOVEL WAYS.

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:38.699
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;ANGELA CARONE: WENMAN SAYS 3D COPIES
OF ART WORK OFFER PLENTY OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES.

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:45.219
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: JUST TO BE ABLE TO HAVE HANDS ON ACCESS
TO A MODEL WHETHER IT'S AN ART HISTORY CLASS

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:52.019
OR AN ART CLASS, OR A HISTORY CLASS, OR NOW
I CAN FINALLY SHOW MY ART STUDENTS THIS MODEL

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:59.049
UP CLOSE WHERE I WOULD HAVE HAD TO PAY 500DOLLARS
FOR A RESIDENT MODEL FROM THE MUSEUM GIFT

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.049
STORE.

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.729
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;ANGELA CARONE: WENMAN RECENTLY SHOWED
ONE OF THE PRINTED HORSE HEADS AT THE BIG

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:06.439
CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW IN VEGAS.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:12.290
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: AT ONE POINT, I LOOKED OVER AND I SAW
SOMEBODY ACTUALLY HAD THEIR HANDS ALL OVER

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.290
IT.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.589
WAS, LIKE, EXPLORING IT WITH THEIR HANDS.

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:19.269
I'M THINKING, I HOPE THEY DON'T BREAK IT OR
SOMETHING, THEN HE TURNED AROUND AND I REALIZED

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.299
HE WAS BLIND.

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.800
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;ANGELA CARONE: THAT WAS AN APPLICATION
WENMAN NEVER THOUGHT OF.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.060
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: THAT PERSON WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO EXPLORE THE ORIGINAL MARBLE IN THE BRITISH

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.300
MUSEUM, THAT JUST WOULD NOT HAPPEN.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.349
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;ANGELA CARONE: THAT'S WHAT'S SO EXCITING
ABOUT THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY.

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:40.810
IT CAN INFORM HOW WE INTERACT WITH ART AND
HOW WE PRESERVE THE WORLD'S CULTURAL HERITAGE

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.180
FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.779
