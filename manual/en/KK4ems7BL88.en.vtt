00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.540
Hello everyone.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.290
I've been waiting for this game for a while.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.029
Max Payne Android played on mobile.

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:17.029
This is played on the Samsung Galaxy S3.

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:25.559
You can see, it's really fluid.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.180
If you're not familiar with Max Payne games, it's a film

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.429
noir style.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:51.040
I played it in the year 2000, 2001, absolute classic of the day.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.040
One of my favourite games of all time.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.610
I won't spoil the story for you.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.210
The graphics are absolutely outstanding.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.170
Very very smooth frame rate.

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.789
Max Payne was the first game to introduce the bullet type mechanic.

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.159
as seen in Matrix.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:47.349
Yes, Max Payne starts off pretty dark and then gets darker.

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:54.349
This is a man who loses everything and is out for revenge.

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:02.709
The rest of that sentence goes Aarrgh, by the way.

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:17.639
I won't spoil the film noir, I'll cut scenes for you

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.989
pretty epic, well worth having a listen to.

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:26.499
As you can see, the frame rate is really solid

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:33.499
great lighting, looks just a little bit better than the original actually.

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:45.999
It's currently Â£1.99 on the Play Store. Absolute bargain.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.040
One of the first games to really do

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.509
a convincing death cut scene as well.

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:31.930
in a way that kind of didn't suck.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.059
One of the first examples of rag doll physics as well

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:56.059
that again didn't suck.Overall this was in its day  one of the best games

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:59.249
ever made.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.560
It looks so good.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.519
Well, there's a good way to end it!

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:15.179
Go buy it now, it's Max Payne, it's on your mobile phone, it's a classic.
