Hi! I'm Nili Nathan. I'm here with my expert
Anne Brashier, who is a certified licensed

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.630
reflexologist. Hi, Anne. Hi! Today in this
video series, we're going to be learning about

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.310
reflexology and what to expect when you go
to a reflexologist and you're going to be

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:27.470
actually giving me a reflexology treatment.
Yes. I can't wait. Reflexology deals with

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.829
nerve endings in the feet and the hands, and
we'll get to a full reflexology massage. Tell

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.799
me a little bit about your background. Where
did you study massage and reflexology? Well

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:46.390
I got into massage and reflexology as a dancer
and an athlete and I worked at the athletic

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.289
department at my university, and studying
basic Swedish and reflexology there. Then

00:00:53.289 --> 00:01:00.949
I took a full licensed massage therapy course
at Alta College in Los Angeles, and I'm doing

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.430
some continuing education with them just to
keep current on new techniques and new practices

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.490
in the field. I worked for about a year and
a half with a chiropractor and really got

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:22.909
into nerves and glands lymph systems. I currently
work. I do free lance; I have a private practice,

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.470
and I also have worked for about a year and
a half at a small day spa in Manhattan beach.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.780
Wow! That day spa you were telling me, the
one where you do reflexology on the outside

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.689
on the patio. Yeah, it's nice. Next to the
beach. Yeah, it's great. You get a view of

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:46.759
the ocean. It's very relaxing, and it's also
a really fun type of massage because you're

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.490
able to talk with your massage therapist about
what's going on and how it's helpful and how

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.739
you, as a client, can increase the benefit
by lifestyle, really simple lifestyle changes.
