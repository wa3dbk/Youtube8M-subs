00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:04.810
Hey there, this is your Pal Pallie and welcome
back to Git Er Raid.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.390
Here it is, Siege of Orgrimmar, lets go kill
that bad orc!

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.240
First up in the raid is Immerseus.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.190
Giant corrupted puddle guy, yeah that just
about describes him.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.949
The fight is usually 2 tanked and 2-3 healed
although if your dps is really high, I think

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.060
you can get away with 1 tank.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.900
For those of you who followed my PTR guides,
this fight isn't terribly changed from PTR

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.359
so many of my descriptions of mechanics are
the same.

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.150
I'll have some additional detail to provide
having downed it on live now though of course.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.190
The basic premise of the fight is that you
are trying to cleanse this water spirit of

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.190
corruption.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.960
He starts with 100 corruption and around 74
million health.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.890
Every time you bring his health down to nothing,
he splits into a bunch of adds.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.800
For every add you manage well, his corruption
goes down by one.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.820
When all the adds are killed or absorbed back
into him, he will heal up to the percentage

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.110
of health that is his new corruption level
and start fighting again.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.110
So if you kill 20 corruption off of him, he'll
be at 80% when he comes back at you.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.610
Now notice I said for every add you "manage
well" you reduce his corruption.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.900
What I mean by that is that there are two
types of adds, ones that you dps down like

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.970
every other fight, but there are adds that
you have your healers heal up to full.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.890
Those count against his corruption too.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.270
We'll get to that transition phase in a minute,
but lets first talk about his normal phase.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.620
2 tanks are probably required because of Corrosive
Blast.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.360
It does 600k shadow damage and gives you a
stacking debuff that makes you take 100% more

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.460
shadow damage per stack.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.820
I will note that this is a conal ability so
if both tanks are in front of the boss, they'll

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.310
both get a stack.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.310
Thats bad so you at least want the tanks to
be separated by some degree.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.560
I've seen tanks take 2 or even 3 stacks of
this debuff with cooldowns but its probably

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.280
just safest to 2 tank it and swap off.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.619
During this normal phase, every one in the
raid will have to deal with Sha Pools.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.120
Every 6 or so seconds, a pool will spawn underneath
you and tick for 70k damage.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.060
It is completely unavoidable damage that you
just have to move for as quickly as possible.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.650
The only other ability he does during the
fight is called Swirl.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.500
He will spawn a bunch of moving tainted pools.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.870
If you get hit by one, you take some damage
and get knocked into the air.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.010
Just avoid them if you can.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.340
During Swirl, the boss also shoots out water
in front of him that knocks you back.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.819
It hurts but isn't deadly so if you need to
retain your raid positioning, you may just

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.510
want to eat the damage and watch that you
don't get knocked back into any bad pools.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.880
That normal phase continues until you get
his health down to 0 and then he splits.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.930
Dps your priority is to kill off Sha Puddle
adds.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.220
They can be slowed and knocked back.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.860
You'll likely want to be spread around the
room and killing off as many of these as you

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.220
can.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.010
Each dpser can probably handle 2 to 3 each
depending on their spawn points.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.020
I will note also that when you kill off a
Sha Puddle it explodes in a small radius for

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.959
70k damage.

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.840
This isn't too bad but if you eat that damage,
you gain a short buff that helps you kill

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.420
the other sha puddles quicker.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.319
Honestly it works out like I said, you'll
probably only get 2 or 3 taken care of before

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.660
they are absorbed so don't worry too much
about getting the buff.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.550
Healers, here's your fun part.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.190
There are another type of adds called Contaminated
Puddles.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.370
If you heal these up to full, they will merge
into immerseus and remove one corruption from

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.370
him.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.200
It also gives you a healing buff if you stand
near the puddle when it reaches full health.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.020
Its a significant buff so I wouldn't skip
out on this one.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.450
Healers just try to target adds, heal them
up and be nearby when they are healed to full.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.159
Probably best to put yourself in the path
of one as you heal it and then run towards

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.700
it when it gets to full.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.420
The bad part of this phase is that for every
puddle that reaches him, he will explode on

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.450
the raid for a decent chunk of damage.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.840
up to 70k for each puddle.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.310
This can get huge if all of them in the area
are allowed to hit at the same time, which

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.460
is why its at least important to slow and
knockback many puddles and of course kill

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.610
off lots of Sha Puddles.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.870
Obviously this is the time for raid CDs along
with personal CDs.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.840
Everyone should be aware when this phase is
about to end.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.840
After all the puddles are killed or merged
back in, we go back to normal mode and like

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.500
I said, the more corruption you take off of
him by killing or healing adds, the less health

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.470
he starts the next phase with.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.060
His abilities don't change at all and he just
does everything all over again.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.690
Keep killing him and cleansing off the corruption
and you'll eventually win.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.060
Strategy wise, the approach we took was to
divide the raid into 2 5 man groups and just

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.330
take a side.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.410
The tanks would tank the boss up front here
pointing out of the room.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.300
Everyone stayed to the boss' side and just
kept moving for puddles.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.150
Just stay in range of healers and you'll be
fine.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.810
For the split phase, everyone would split
up and some would head to the back of the

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.130
room.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.840
Depending on what puddles spawned where, people
would dps or heal the puddles and after they

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.680
took care of a couple puddles they would start
heading back towards their respective raid

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.160
marker so that they were in range for heals
when the puddles started to merge and explode

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.639
on the raid.

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.980
Honestly, the biggest complication of this
fight is just the sheer size of the room.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.380
If you get too far away from healers or the
group you might die to the simple mechanics.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.889
So just keep around your group and do what
you need to do.

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.000
The size of the room even screws up things
like Bloodlust and raid wide CDs.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.130
On my hunter's group, we had both the shaman
and mage on our side and when they popped

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.840
lust on the pull, the other group on the other
side of the boss didn't get it.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.710
I do recommend popping lust on the pull as
there doesn't seem to be any other good place

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.479
for it but maybe try to be closer to each
other, pop it and then spread out to your

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.500
respective locations.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.320
That should be about it for this boss.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.280
You are going to have to work out how to divide
your raid up around the room, get tank swaps

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.310
going, don't stand in puddles, and then kill
or heal up as many adds as you can in the

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.310
transition.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.039
I'd like to take one second to thank all the
new subscribers and people commenting and

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.850
helping out with these guides.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.630
I'm working to get better and improve these
guides at every iteration so feedback is important

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.270
and spreading the word to other raiders if
you found the guides useful is so awesome

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.610
so keep it up!

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:38.280
I also recently joined Curse's Union for Gamers
so will hopefully see some of these videos

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.670
featured on Curse sites and look forward to
a good partnership.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.729
So as always, thanks for watching and please
comment, like, and or subscribe to the video

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.460
