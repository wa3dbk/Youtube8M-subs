At first,
I thought you knew,

00:00:04.528 --> 00:00:09.466
That you created
the whole ghost thing as
some kind of elaborate trap.

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.169
Then I realized
you believed it.

00:00:12.237 --> 00:00:15.805
It's a passive-aggressive
masterpiece.

00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:22.212
First time I met you...

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.616
All I ever wanted was to spend
the rest of my life with you.

00:00:29.087 --> 00:00:31.088
Not gonna happen now.

00:01:03.587 --> 00:01:06.990
Ooh, too cold, huh ?

00:01:09.127 --> 00:01:11.895
I almost froze to death
laying here...

00:01:11.963 --> 00:01:15.532
Wet, naked,
pretending to be electrocuted.

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:17.901
Hey, coop.
[ whimpering ]

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.837
How ya doin' ?
How ya doin', boy ?

00:01:20.905 --> 00:01:24.474
Let's go get your ball.
Come on.  Come on !

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:26.810

00:01:42.593 --> 00:01:46.496
Jody, it's norman.
If you're there,
pick up, please.

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:49.166
It's norman.
Uh, uh, uh--

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:53.136
[ sighs ]
listen, claire and I had a--

00:01:53.204 --> 00:01:55.372
A terrible brawl.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.508
Could you do me a favor ?
I'm gonna go sleep at the lab.

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:01.144
Could you check on her
in the morning ?

00:02:01.212 --> 00:02:03.580
I'm terribly
worried about her.

00:02:03.647 --> 00:02:05.782
Okay, thanks.
