“Nutrition Education Mandate
Introduced for Doctors”

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.410
Doctors think they know nutrition,

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.030
but studies show that
most of them really don’t.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.209
The majority overstate
their actual knowledge.

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:15.300
So, what’s the solution?

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.609
Obviously, more nutrition training
in medical school, but what about

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.990
for all the docs running around now?

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.509
“…[A]ttendance at lifestyle modification
and chronic disease management workshops

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.329
could form an essential component
of continuing education for both

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.190
medical and nursing professionals.”

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.730
Doctors have to get continuing
medical education credit anyway;

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.410
why not mandate a few hours for nutrition?

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.820
Good idea, said one of my
favorite medical mentors,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.960
Dr. John A. McDougall, who drafted a bill
in California to “require physicians

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.770
and surgeons to complete,
by December 31, 2016,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.110
a mandatory continuing education
course in the subject of nutrition

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.730
and life style behavior for the
treatment of chronic diseases.”

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.019
(Dr. John McDougall)

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:13.789
“I’ve been in the business of medicine
since 1968, so, about 44 years.

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.109
My son just graduated from
medical school two years ago,

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.229
and he can’t remember
a course on nutrition.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.159
But you’re going to hear from other
interested parties that we don’t need

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.340
to have a law that mandates
that doctors get an education

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.710
on something basic like nutrition,
because doctors already take care of this.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.079
That’s plain and simple not true.

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.340
And not only is this a
travesty for the patient;

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.119
it’s insulting to the doctor,
not to be able to deliver this kind

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.749
of a powerful tool for their patients,

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:48.179
to teach them about the
cause of dietary diseases.

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.939
And based on the scientific literature,

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.420
if you correct what’s making
people sick, they get well.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.439
So, as doctors, we’re missing a real
opportunity, and it’s not going to be

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.180
fixed unless somebody
does something about it.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.920
And that is, to mandate basic
education on human nutrition.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.420
Thank you.”
