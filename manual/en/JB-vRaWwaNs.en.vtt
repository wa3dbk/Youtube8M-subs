00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.880
This video shows how to use two monitors with
one computer in Windows 7.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.520
Dual monitors can create extra screen space

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.280
and allow for multiple windows to be shown at once.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.820
To connect a second monitor,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.140
make sure that your computer has at least
two video out ports;

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.040
one for the main monitor and one for the secondary monitor.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.839
Next, identify the types of video connections
on your computer.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.680
Two common video connection types are VGA
and DVI.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.500
Then, secure a compatible video cable to the
video out ports on your PC.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.360
Next, connect the other end of each cable
to a matching port on each monitor.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.540
Make sure the monitors have power, then turn
them on.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.060
Then, turn on the computer.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.509
Your monitors should now be connected.

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:07.409
In the next section,

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.549
we'll show you how to configure display
settings for multiple monitors.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.940
To configure display settings, click Start,

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.020
and then click Control Panel.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.360
Under Appearance and Personalization, click
Adjust screen resolution.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.100
Use the Multiple displays drop-down list to
select a display option.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.000
For example, click Duplicate these displays
to show identical desktops on each monitor.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.060
To stretch the desktop across both monitors,
select Extend these displays.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.340
Click Apply,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.220
Click Keep changes.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.620
When you've applied your changes,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.909
verify the display settings on both monitors
and make adjustments as needed.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.460
And then Click OK.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.940
