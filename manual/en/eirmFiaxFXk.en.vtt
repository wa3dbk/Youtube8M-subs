00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:19.430
Y'know QWOP?

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.430
Sure you do.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.430
Everyone knows QWOP.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.470
It made its presence known as a viral timewaster
on the scale of a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.930
Bejeweled or a Nanaca Crash, and soon had
folks around the world failing miserably and

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.240
falling all over the place.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.240
(I

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.260
myself could never get over that damned hurdle.)

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.080
So we're at least familiar with the ridiculous
ragdoll mechanics that

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.940
made the game so intentionally unintentionally
hilarious.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.829
Well, Incredipede tries to live up to that
strangeness, only

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.460
this time you're not a runner from some third-world
country; you are... um... an eye.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.710
An eye on a circular-looking thing,

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.910
with variable limbs and musculature.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:01:02.200
Kinda like Neemoi from the old Carmen Sandiego
game show, but on steroids.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.110
The general gist is simple: collect fruit,
headdresses, crystal skulls, melons, and other

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.240
strange objects by either

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.079
hitting them or pushing them to the right
over a mystical glowing line of arbitraryness,

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.079
after which you yourself have

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.119
to get across that same line.

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.810
But you're just an eye with strange and oftentimes
counterintuitive physical form; by

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.079
rotating your limbs and muscles one way or
the other with the A and S keys, you have

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.780
to manage the course and not fall

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.780
off the world.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.201
Not that there's much of a penalty, though;
you float, you can traverse lava, and you're

00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:31.201
light enough

00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:35.460
to be carried on a stiff enough breeze...
oh yeah, and you've got infinite lives, effectively.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.460
What you have to do is

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.729
more than just platforming; there's a strong
puzzle aspect at play here as well, which

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:40.729
is apparent in the normal

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.189
difficulty but absolutely hammered home in
the Hard mode.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:53.640
Yes, you get to play Spore or something and
actually build this little... um... thing...

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.740
however you see fit.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.899
Need a leg for

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.039
more stability?

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.039
Make a leg.

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.070
Need it to be functional as well as attractive?

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.720
Attach a muscle to it, so it can propel

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.720
you toward your goal.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.070
Not every course gives you full control over
Quozzle's... yes, Quozzle's... build; some

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.070
start you

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.650
with some base parts and make you figure out
a working muscle system.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.380
But most important is the action itself, and

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.540
managing the swinging, poking, and rolling
to... oh, not that way!

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.819
Oh, Quozzle.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.470
Whatever shall you do.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.780
The music is minimalist, save for the occasional
roving pack of didgeridoos, and the art style

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.780
feels very

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.450
woodblock-printish, like Okami without all
that Japan crammed in there.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.540
There's a level editor included, for really

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.930
putting Quozzle through her paces, and a recording
system allows you to play back your most glorious

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:42.930
moments and share

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.379
them with the rest of the world.

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.670
But the most interesting thing about Incredipede
is its achievements.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.670
There are only

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.850
six, and they're not unlocked by anything
in the game.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.890
Instead, they advocate that you actually go
outside and find a

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.310
bug that you've never seen before, before
returning and clicking the "I Did This" button.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.310
I didn't have the heart to

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.540
break it to them that there aren't any spiders
on the Intergalactic Space Arcade... at least

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.980
there aren't since last

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.150
Thursday when a spider fell onto my burrito
and it and all its kind were made to pay the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.150
dearest price.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.150
We got geese,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.470
though.
