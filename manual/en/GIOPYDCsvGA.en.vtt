00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:10.129
The key to pushing is really positioning and
how you're positioned in order to give birth

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:11.129
to your baby.

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:17.060
Some great positions to use for pushing are
side lying, so lying on your side and allowing

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.140
your leg to come up.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.660
What you're doing in lying on your side is
allowing your pelvis to open in as many different

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.080
ways as possible.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.869
What you don't want to be doing for pushing
and delivering your baby is lying flat on

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:30.869
your back.

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.670
This really makes your body work against gravity.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.930
What you need to remember with pushing is
that you want gravity to be your friend.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.829
So, you want to keep in mind using as many
upright positions as possible.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.680
You also want to remember that the pushing
stage of labor can take a while.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.860
For a first time mom it can take anywhere
from ten or twenty minutes up to three or

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.090
four hours.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.080
The most important thing to remember is that
if mom and baby are doing fine there is no

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.570
reason to intervene.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.510
Another thing to think about when thinking
about tips for pushing is you want to wait

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.239
until your body feels the urge to push.

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.490
Just because your cervix is dilated to 10
centimeters doesn't necessarily mean that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.610
it's the time to push your baby out.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.250
Remember, the baby has to get station minus
3 to station plus 3 before your baby is ready

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.550
to be born.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.420
So wait for your body to feel that urge.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.530
Trust this process.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.460
Know that your body will tell you what to
do.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.530
If you've had an epidural for pain management
you want to do something called laboring down.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.460
This is when you allow the baby to come down
to the plus 3 station right before crowning,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.390
and you wait until the baby has come down
to that place before you start pushing.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.140
Sometimes when you have an epidural your body
doesn't feel the physical sensation or that

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.640
urge to push.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.329
That's why you want to practice the laboring
down technique.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.400
Another really great position to use for pushing
is to be on your hands and knees.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.780
You can be on your hands and knees in the
bed or on the floor if you're having a home

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.010
birth, in the hospital bed at the birth center
or at the hospital.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.740
In the hospital the bed can be adjusted in
a variety of different ways.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.380
You can move the back of the bed up and lean
over the back of the bed with a pillow here

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.549
to rest on so that you can utilize the upward
force and the gravity as your friend to help

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:15.889
bring the baby down.

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:20.720
Another great tip for pushing is to utilize
something called the squat bar or the birthing

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.720
bar.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.380
This is an actual bar that comes and attaches
into the side of the hospital bed.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.440
What you would do is you use the bar to support
your weight.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.350
You hold onto it and you put your feet flat
onto the hospital bed so that you're in a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.670
squatting position.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.130
Another thing you can do with the birth bar
is tie a sheet to it so you can use the sheet

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.100
to hold on to for balance as you find yourself
in a squatting position.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.030
One thing to think about when pushing is to
really trust your body and know that your

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.100
body knows exactly how to do this.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.090
While pushing it's important to remember that
there are a variety of different ways to push,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.070
and that it can take a long time.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.670
Just allow it to take as long as it needs
to in order to deliver your baby.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.670
One thing to remember is that there are a
lot of things that can help you with pushing.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.880
Sometimes your medical support team or your
labor companion will count from one to ten

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.410
in order to help you with pushing.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.380
This can be effective and helpful for some
but not for all.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.970
So, if it's not working for you let them know.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.900
Remember, communication is key.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.130
And these are some helpful tips for successfully
pushing and delivering your baby.
