00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.130
the only thing you'll need for this
project is some popsicle sticks so I'm

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:14.090
staying a glue gun and some glue and
some scissors so the first thing we want

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.849
to do is cut off all the surround part
of the ends on the popsicle sticks

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.720
doesn't really matter if they're jagged
or uneven is make them about the same

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.380
size because you don't want them
sticking out on the ends if you get

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.390
little shards of wood that sticks up do
you just kind of brush that on or you

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.750
can take the end and just sort of go
like this with it

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.609
the next step is to start staining the
popsicle sticks the idea is you don't

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:46.340
want to necessarily paint them like see
how dark that got we don't want to make

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.750
them painted we just want to stain them
so they're not that nice beautiful

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.469
bright color so you're just going to go
through and just do all these I've

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.530
started putting them together and I have
two on the bottom and two placed on the

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.290
top I'm going to place a third beam in
the middle for extra support well now I

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.980
want to just simply take the popsicle
sticks and lie them across so I'm going

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.220
to place some crazy glue right here and
right here and then I'm going to place

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.120
it and you just need to make sure you
space them about the same it doesn't

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.560
need to be perfect because honestly
pallets are not perfect so just put a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.540
little pressure and then it will sit
there and dry here I have two of them

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.700
finished this one was done with a hot
glue gun as you can see it's a little

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.350
bit more messy although that could have
been my fault as well but you can see

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.910
the glue underneath a little bit so if
you do if you go a little bit slower I

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.420
guess I was gonna probably going a
little fast maybe make these not as big

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.780
it'll be a little bit more clean I did
choose to do a super glue with this one

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.570
and as you can see it looks so much
better like you can't see any of the

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.800
glue on the inside it looks exactly the
same

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:12.650
buzzer but it's a lot cleaner this is
our pallet coaster

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.709
