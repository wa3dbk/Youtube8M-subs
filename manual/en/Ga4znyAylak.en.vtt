00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:24.650
So, body pop is very much about having a real
strong isolation, and really sort of focusing

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.159
on a certain area of the body.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:31.979
So, what we are going to look at is standing
with our feet apart, getting a good grounding

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:36.270
and then we are going to use the upper part
of the body to create that, that power.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.590
But that strength is going to come from the
legs.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.649
So, we are going to take our legs low and
then the energy comes through the legs and

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.449
pops out the top and what it means is that
if we do that, we can take it to any dynamic,

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.100
whether it's high or low and we are using
the legs to create that pop in the upper chest.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.050
And it also means that we can incorporate
the arms, we can incorporate the head, we

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.379
can pop any part of our body.

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:09.630
Legs apart, we are going to keep it bouncy
and first of all, we are going to pop the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.460
chest.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.210
So, take it down to a little bit faster.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.730
Down, pop.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.730
Cool.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.730
Good stuff.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.730
Now, turn the other side.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.290
This time, take it down a little bit lower,
and up, pop.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.670
And this time, we are going to do our hit
double.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.320
So, we are going to go pop, pop.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.270
But we are going to need the hands hanging
down.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.270
Okay.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.130
Here we go, down and pop, pop.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.130
Cool.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.030
Now, take it to the other side.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.980
Here we go and pop, pop.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.360
Now, this time, I am going to stand to the
front and you are just going to mirror what

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.360
I do.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:50.610
So, we are going to go over to the right and
pop, sweep over, pop, sweep over, pop, sweep

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.220
over and pop.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.590
You got it.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:01.490
Pop, over, pop, over, pop, over, pop.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.290
And that's how you body pop. .
