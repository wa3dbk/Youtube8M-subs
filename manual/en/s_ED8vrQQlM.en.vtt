00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.800
Hi everyone, it's Jerry. The Lasker Trap is
a trap for black out of the Albin Counter

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.340
Gambit. In it, white can easily fall victim
to an extremely rare and devastating tactic

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.199
involving a mere pawn. Let's see how this
black d-pawn in particular could turn out

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.839
to be very deadly, and along the way pay close
attention to this queen h4 move as it'll

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:33.510
be present in the few of the sub variations
I show. So after d4, d5, and c4 the Queen's

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.510
Gambit. With e5 we have the Albin Counter
Gambit. d takes e, and d4 robbing the queen

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.210
knight of this c3 square. Now a very common
idea is to challenge an opposing pawn that's

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.420
in your territory with one of your own pawns.
The move e3 does just that, however in this

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.070
instance it's already a step in the wrong
direction for white. Bishop b4 with check,

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.920
and after the counterattacking bishop d2,
this threat against the bishop is one that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.710
black can ignore with d takes e. And before
I get into the type of beating white will

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.500
end up taking if bishop takes bishop, let
just point out that the best continuation

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.880
for white is to immediately recapture on e3.
And should that come about, here's how black

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.880
can at least regain the material lost. Queen
h4 with check, and after g3, queen e4. And

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.590
pay particular attention to what exactly the
queen is doing...not only hitting the rook

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.509
and the pawn on e5, but also the one on e3.
Keep in mind the bishop is pinned, and in

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:48.270
short, material...the pawn, will be won back,
and black is doing quite alright. Reverting

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.090
back to this position...if instead of f takes
e, queen a4 were played, we would have the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.950
knight blocking the check. And after bishop
takes bishop, pawn takes pawn would ensue.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.680
King takes pawn, and yet again queen h4 with
check. Pawn g3, queen to d4 with check, and

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.410
however you slice it...no matter where the
king goes, the h1 rook...the a1 rook will

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.410
fall. For example if king to g2 or e2, it's
queen takes b, and then queen takes the rook

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.940
on a. If the king runs home, we have queen
e4, and it's the rook on h1 that falls. And

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.110
lastly, if king f3 we have bishop check, king
g2, queen e4...the rook on h1, yet again,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.140
will fall. Finally, what occurs after bishop
takes bishop from this position is pawn takes

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.760
pawn with check, trying to deflect the king
away from defense of the queen. King to e2

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.410
is the only way to maintain defense of the
queen. But now comes the devastating pawn

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.410
takes knight, under promoting to a knight
with check! This is all very important as

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.590
otherwise capturing the knight and promoting
to a queen allows white one moment to breath.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.890
And in that moment, there's queen takes queen,
king takes queen, and only then the recapture

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.890
and the material is balanced. However, under
promoting to a knight lands a check. And now

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.060
after rook takes knight, we would just have
bishop g4. This is lights out...the queen

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.060
is dead. And the other line would be king
e1, and now yet again, queen to h4. If g3,

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.690
we have queen to e4, and the rook is dead.
And if king to d2, we have a tricky knight

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.800
coming out with tempo, the bishop coming out
screaming down at the queen, black queenside

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.190
castling giving a check to the king, and not
to mention black is still up a piece.
