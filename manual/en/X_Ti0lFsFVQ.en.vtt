Hey everybody, welcome back
to ComputerTV. I'm Sam

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.510
and today I'm going to tell you about
this Mach Speed Trio.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.080
This is a multimedia player,
it's the V430

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.210
and if you don't have a multimedia
player that does you good

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.620
it is time to get one.
This is fantastic

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.010
not only for your MP3s, ok?
This is you know, a new digital world

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.810
we're living in. This is also for your
photos, this is for your videos,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.810
it's going to be a calculator,
it's going to be a stopwatch,

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.590
this thing is fully loaded, ok?
It has 4 gigs of memory

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.090
so plenty of storage
for all of your fun stuff.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.700
You also have a 3 inch LCD screen 
that comes with a 400 by 240 resolution

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.030
so you can watch your movies
and look at your pictures

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.500
and they'll look very pretty,
crystal clear actually.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.790
Also comes with a micro SD slot
so you can have some extra storage

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.030
if you need and last but not least
you have a rechargeable battery

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.390
and when you are fully charged you're 
going to have 8 hours of playback time

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.190
so that's perfect 
if you're like waiting for the bus

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.930
or waiting for your plane
or waiting for class to end.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.570
Whatever it is that you're waiting for
you'll have plenty of entertainment

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.030
on this Mach Speed Trio.
So it's very very easy to navigate.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.640
This is not a touchscreen
multimedia player

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.380
but all of your controls
are up top here, ok?

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.050
So you'll see you have your
right here this is your menu,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.260
oh no, this is your playback.
You have your volume controls,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.750
your fast forward and your rewind
and right here where the 'M' is,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.730
that is your menu, ok?
And if you turn it over

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.090
to the side you'll see
you have your power right here,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.970
you have your micro SD slot right here
and your USB

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.110
and it comes with a USB cable and 
that is how you charge this baby, ok?

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.800
And on the back right here
you'll see you have a speaker

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.070
however this Trio also comes
with a pair of headphones

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.370
so choose how you want
to listen to your music ok?

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.120
Now let's go through the menu.
Ok right now,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.880
I think you can see my reflection,
very shiny and nice.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.940
Now we're going to go through the menu
starting off with music

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.840
and let's scroll next to video
and let's say I want to get into video,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.920
I just click right here
this play button,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.400
it's kind of like an 'OK' and then
let's hit play again

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.800
and let's see some video.
Hope this is rated PG or G.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.600
Oh it's Walt Disney, ok.
It's rated, it's rated G.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.860
So let's pause it
and to get out of here again

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.000

and this will take you back

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.480

Just hit play again
and here you go.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.670
Nice quality, ok?
Hit end to get out of there

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.010

so you can listen 
to some tunes on the go

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.490
even without loading any MP3s on here.
You have a voice recorder,

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.460
explorer is a search function

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.560
