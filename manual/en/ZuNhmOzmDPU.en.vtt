00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:06.099
When it comes to water safety there are two
sets of tools every family can use to help

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:11.179
save lives. It's what you HAVE and what you
KNOW can make a difference. You need to HAVE

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.709
the proper safety equipment such as a plastic
life vest or a ring buoy, you also need to

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.019
KNOW how to swim, and you need to know how
to respond in an emergency situation. Around

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:25.869
your home backyard pool you should have reaching
poles, a plastic ring buoy that is light weight

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.960
enough that even a child could use in case
of an emergency situation. You need to have

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.170
plastic life vests if you're going out boating.
And these need to be approved by the U.S.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.010
Coast Guard and sized accordingly to the child
or adult. The use of these plastic life vests

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.449
can help save lives. Other things that would
be good to have are plastic shoes to prevent

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.399
feet from getting burnt from the pool deck
or the hot sand, a UV sunscreen lotion and

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.609
bottled water and shatter resistant plastic
bottles, an extend-a-phone or a cellphone

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.840
handy in case of an emergency and contact
numbers in a zip-lock plastic bag. One of

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.929
the most important things you can do is learn
how to swim, but no matter how experienced

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.750
you are, you can end up in a drowning situation
so you should never swim alone, parents need

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.240
to pay close attention to the children at
all times and not reading or talking to a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.740
friend or talking on the cellphone. Again
it is a concern that, if an emergency situation

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.500
arises you should never ever come in contact
with that victim. You should always use the

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.590
rule of thumb of reaching out to the them
with an extended pole or a towel, or pushing

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.189
something out to them such as a plastic raft
or a toy or cooler, or throwing a ring buoy.

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.810
We have over 3,500 drownings every year and
knowing what proper safety equipment you have

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.340
and how to use it can help save lives. To

and safe summer.
