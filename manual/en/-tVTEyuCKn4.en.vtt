00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.760
(Thus saith the Lord)

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.560
(Since you refuse to free My people)

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.160
(All through the land of Egypt)

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.760
(I send the pestilence and plague)

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.820
(Into your house, into your bed)

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.980
(Into your streams, into your streets)

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.100
(Into your drink, into your bread)

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.000
(Upon your cattle, upon your sheep)

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.080
(Upon your oxen in your field)

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.040
(Into your dreams, into your sleep)

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.040
(Until you break, until you yield)

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.280
(I send the swarm, I send the horde)

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.840
(Thus saith the Lord)

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.360
Moses: Once I called you brother.  Once I thought the chance to make you laugh was all I ever wanted

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.000
(I send the thunder from the sky)

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.960
(I send the fire raining down)

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.240
Moses: And even now I wish that God had chose another

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.240
Serving as your foe on His behalf is the last thing that I wanted

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.160
(I send a hail of burning ice)

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.280
(On every field, on every town)

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.440
Moses: This was my home

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.880
All this pain and devastation, how it tortures me inside

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.720
All the innocent  who suffer from your stubbornness and pride

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.480
(I send the locusts on a wind)

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.540
(Such as the world has never seen)

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.580
(On every leaf, on every stalk)

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.660
(Until there's nothing left of green)

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.560
(I send My scourge, I send My sword)

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.520
(Thus saith the Lord)

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.640
Ramses: You who I called brother, why must you call down another blow?

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.440
(I send My scourge, I send My sword)

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.560
Moses: Let my people go

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.520
(Thus saith the Lord)

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.200
Moses: Thus saith the Lord

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.560
Ramses: You who I called brother, how could you have come to hate me so?

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.260
Is this what you wanted?

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.800
(I send the swarm, I send the horde)

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.880
Ramses: Then let my heart be hardened
And never mind how high the cost may grow

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.880
This will still be so

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.020
I will never let your people go

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.000
(Thus saith the Lord)

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.600
Moses: Thus saith the Lord

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.400
Ramses: I will not

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:24.920
Ramses: Let your people go
Moses: Let my people go
