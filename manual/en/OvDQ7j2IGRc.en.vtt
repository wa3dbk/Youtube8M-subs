00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.039
Mmmm, crumpets.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.000
Oh hey there.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.730
So I've got the day off work today,
so I figured I'd do something I've been putting

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.210
off neutrally for years
and that is consolidate my superannuation.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.232
Now I don't know if it's the same for you
guys,

00:00:37.232 --> 00:00:39.070
but for me at least when I first started a
new job,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.430
I also signed up for a new super fund...for
various reasons.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:51.210
Tom: Uh hey, my name is Tom, I'm starting
today.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.740
Bartender: Got your paperwork?

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.050
Tom: Yeah yeah, got it right here.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.270
Bartender: What's this?

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.870
Tom: Oh, that's my super fund information.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:13.511
Bartender: Look princess, we got our own super
funds here.

00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:17.560
Tom: Well, I'd prefer if my...my super could
go into my existing fund if that's alright.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.220
Bartender: Shut it.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.390
Tom: Okay.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.191
So by rolling all my super accounts into one,
it'll be easier for me to keep track of,

00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:31.320
I'll only have to pay one set of fees and
I'll have less paperwork to deal with.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.250
Now to do this, I'll need to figure out which
of these funds best suits my needs.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.200
Luckily for me that's pretty easy, because
I have the details for my funds right here.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.620
Now if you've lost track of your super funds,
don't worry

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.550
because they're pretty easy to track down
online.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.520
Now personally I've decided that my current
super fund is the best one for me.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.560
So I'm gonna roll over my old accounts into
my new one.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.320
To do that, first I'm gonna call my old funds
and find out what kind of exit fees if any,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.200
they charge to roll over your account.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.730
Hey, I'm going to ask about exit fees?

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.940
My name is Tom Shearman.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.119
Yeah that’s right, Shearman with an S.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.119
What?

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:18.569
Look I don’t see how it's relevant,
but I'm wearing a white shirt and some...some

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.269
tiger shorts..tiger shorts.

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:30.140
Um, look I'm sorry, I don’t think that's
any of your business.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.560
Whoa hey,
can you please turn down the language a little

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.560
bit?

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.560
I don't think there's any need for that.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.070
Please...stop yelling...just stop...stop yelling
at me.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.170
I'm...look I'm quite fragile.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.590
Look just stop, please...please.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.530
OK look, I'll...I'll tell you.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.690
Uh...that’s uh...they're red, alright?

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:01.800
They're skimpy little...little red ones.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.050
Once you've spoken to your old fund, just
send them a completed portability form,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.490
which you can find on the Australian Tax Office
website.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.630
Now for me, I've rolled over my two old funds
into my current one

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.010
and the total value of that was about $700.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.380
Now since I won't see that money for about
40 years, it doesn't sound like much.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.599
But in both cases,
the returns I was getting weren't keeping

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.870
me up with the account keeping fees I was
being charged.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.870
So the money was just disappearing.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.120
And hopefully in about 40 years time, that
$700 will have turned into a little more.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.660
And a final note, you'll need to send a portability
form to each of the fund you intend to roll

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.660
over.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:46.689
Now this of course, will mean a few extra
phone calls.
