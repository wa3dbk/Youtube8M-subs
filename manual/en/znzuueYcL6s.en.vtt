high-density polyethylene. Our sheds are low-

rays. So put away your buckets of stain and
paint, you will never need to repaint or varnish

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.030
a Lifetime Storage Shed.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.579
Lifetime sheds use blow-molding technology
which allows the walls, roof and floor to

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.570
be doubled walled for added strength and durability.
Many companies only use injection molding,

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.939
which gives weak single wall construction.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.329
Our double walled sheds also have heavy-duty
steel reinforcements to ensure superior strength

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:00.009
and durability, making Lifetime sheds stronger
than any others on the market.

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.619
With an 1,800 (eighteen hundred) pound total
snow load capacity, the high-pitched steel-reinforced

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.950
roof allows for quick drainage of rain and
snow. It also provides a 6 foot 8 inch interior

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.139
height from floor to truss, making it easy
to walk around, stack boxes, and store pretty

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:16.389
much anything!

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:20.000
Lifetime sheds are not only built for strength
and durability, they also have an attractive

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.609
appearance and design to accent the beauty
of your backyard.

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.320
