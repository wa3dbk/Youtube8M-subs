 Good, the recipe today is going to prepare a recipe 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.738
 super easy to prepare. 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:19.640
 It is a very typical recipe of French cuisine and you will see that it is very good. 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.550
 To make them necitaremos: bread, which we use at home. 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.980
 and the amount you want, depending on the amount of sandwiches 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.300
 we want to do. 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.560
 Then slices of ham or ham, 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.150
 grated Gruyere cheese. 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.640
 It is best to use gruyere cheese is why the original used 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.560
 in the recipe, 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.480
 but if you do not have it, nothing happens. Above all, it is to use a cheese that is based 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:48.019
 all right, 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.838
 and gratine well in the oven. 

00:00:52.838 --> 00:00:57.958
 for the rest, that you have at home. And then the bechamel sauce 

00:00:57.959 --> 00:01:00.880
 in another video I showed how to do it, 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.650
 and I'll leave the video link, the link, 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.368
 in the video description what if you want to do it, the you may do. 

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:13.790
 First, we will take two slices of bread 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.920
 and bechamel that have left 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.629
 at room temperature 

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:21.959
 in the untaremos 

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:26.079
 top slice that we will use as a base. 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.929
 And extend well throughout the bechamel sauce 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.200
 Based on our sandwich Croque monsieus. 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.629
 The bechamel, above all, we have to do that is not very consistent, 

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:41.489
 to be manageable but not very liquid. 

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:45.799
 Then, when we already have the prepared base, 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.670
 and well distributed the bechamel, 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.240
 you add the gruyere cheese. 

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:54.329
 All right, 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.659
 everywhere, 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:02.659
 and scratched. 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:07.170
 And now we'll put up 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.170
 a slice of ham. 

00:02:27.968 --> 00:02:30.709
 The good will everywhere 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.658
 And in the other slice on the side to be playing 

00:02:36.658 --> 00:02:38.388
 the ham, 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.588
 as well, 

00:02:41.588 --> 00:02:48.588
 the untaremos with bechamel sauce. 

00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:50.628
 Once, well greased 

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:53.569
 will contact the bechamel sauce 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.299
 with York ham or ham. 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.349
 And clench well to make it all 

00:03:00.348 --> 00:03:01.948
 well divided. 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:05.559
 And finally, as you see it is a very easy recipe, 

00:03:05.558 --> 00:03:10.158
 at the top will get back to spread 

00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:13.348
 the bechamel sauce. 

00:03:13.348 --> 00:03:20.348
 Meanwhile, we preheated oven. 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.329
 And now, we'll put gruyere cheese 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:37.329
 above. 

00:03:40.628 --> 00:03:43.889
 We have in our sandwiches Croque Monsieur 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:49.179
 prepared and placed in the oven tray. The oven preheated to 200 degrees have 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.540

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.598
 and now we will put for 10 minutes to cook. 

00:03:53.598 --> 00:03:57.468
 You will see that, above all, it is important 

00:03:57.468 --> 00:04:01.808
 it is processed cheese and top gratine. 

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:05.899

 to do is enjoy it. 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:13.808
 If, by chance, I stay cold 

00:04:13.808 --> 00:04:17.798
 You can heat them in the microwave and would be just as good. Or even, you dais 

00:04:17.798 --> 00:04:21.000
 oven and would hit great, too. 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.710
