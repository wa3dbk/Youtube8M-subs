00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.980
My name is John McGrath, I'm the Project Manager
for the Crossrail Whitechapel Station works.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.670
The Community Investment Programme (CIP) is
something that we roll out with all the contracts

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.529
on Crossrail.
This particular programme that we're here

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.109
to talk about today is at Senrab FC. It's
being sponsored by Bam Nuttal Kier Joint Venture,

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.259
who are the diaphragm walling contractor on
Whitechapel Station. They've made a particularly

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.480
good job on their community investment programme.
As well as this scheme today, sponsoring two

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.990
of the teams with a new football kit, they've
also been involved with the Salvation Army.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.000
The Salvation Army originally started in Whitechapel,
so it's very relevant.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.590
We've also done a lot of good work over at
the Whitechapel Mission, serving breakfasts

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:59.720
over there and also clothes donations.
When I started my role as the Community Relations

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:07.990
Manager, I worked very closely with the Crossrail
Community Investment Team and a lot of importance

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.150
was actually placed in getting a very robust
community investment plan in place.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.270
It's our life blood. Without local businesses
sponsoring the kits then we'd go and play

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.890
games with old rags, because we can't afford
to buy them, that's the problem.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.590
It's just a local team that anyone can come
to and it provides a lot of opportunities.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.020
They've trained a lot of professionals in
the past.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:46.240
It is very important to put something back
into the community. But was is also important

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.960
is to be able to liaise and communicate with
the local community to find out what they

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.590
actually want as opposed to just giving them
something that we feel "oh, it's OK."

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.080
Crossrail's going to be in the neighbourhood
for the next five years. We want to be part

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.280
of the regenration of the neighbourhood, not
only associated with the station but any worthwhile

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.569
causes that we can identify within the community
we're very eager to get involved in and the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:21.620
Community Investment Programme is an ideal
opportunity to do that.
