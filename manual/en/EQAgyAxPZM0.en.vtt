Hello, and welcome to "Is it a Good Idea 
to Microwave This?" I'm your host, Jory Caron.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:18.100
If you wanna just hold right there for a second... 
 Just don't move... That's pretty good right there...

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:26.069
Let me see if I can get you 
in the shot... *camera snaps* Wonderful, wonderful...

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.100
It's just that film is so expensive to develop nowadays, you know?

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.149
I wonder how they develop film... Maybe they use a microwave!

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:40.633
*theme song plays*

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.333
Jory: Let's go roast some nuts!

00:00:40.267 --> 00:00:42.267
Jory: And, as always, our Sharp microwave!

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:44.501
No, no, they probably don't, actually... Let's do it anyways!

00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:48.767
*theme song plays for real*

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:49.367
Jory: Let's go roast some nuts!

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:50.433
Jory: And, as always, our Sharp microwave!

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:51.967
Jory: It's never a good idea, unless you want an explosion!

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.219
Jory: Stopping, stopping!

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:55.233
Jory: Safety is our number-one concern.

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.733
Jon: Wow! That's a lotta smoke!

00:00:56.372 --> 00:00:58.372
Jory: The masks- they do nothing!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Jory: We also hide behind this big tin foil shield. Nobody likes roasted nuts!

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.700
Ezra: Is it a good idea?

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:04.633
Jory: (laughs) Absolutely!

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.300
Jory: Is it a good idea to microwave this?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
*camera snaps*

00:01:09.355 --> 00:01:15.355
Let's find out! Here at the Jory Caron Laboratory, safety is 
 our number-one concern. That's why we have these masks.

00:01:15.967 --> 00:01:23.967
And, as always, a giant tin foil shield. It's to 
protect our nuts, because nobody likes roasted nuts!

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.900
We have a ventilation system, which currenly is off, but it usually 
 just circulates the air. And we have the Sharp carousel microwave.

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:36.167
She likes carnations and not roses. Why? I'm not sure!

00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:46.270
Jory: Okay, so let's wind it up and tell it to use 
the flash. And we throw the disposable camera in there.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.700
I wonder how long I should put it in there for? I'm gonna say 
two minutes. I'm not sure why- I just really like two minutes!

00:01:56.898 --> 00:01:58.900
Okay, so let's do this!

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:02.730
Jon: Oh! It's sparking!

00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:04.830
Ryan: Oh, that was weird!

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:05.630
Jory: That was probably the flash.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.800
Jon: I think the flash went off, yeah.

00:02:07.567 --> 00:02:09.570
Ryan: Oh! That's awesome!

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:12.430
Jon: It's the flash bulb lighting up. And it probably just went.

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:16.640
Ryan: Nope!

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:19.470
Ryan: This is gonna be like that other light bulb!

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.330
Jon: It's like a light bulb AND smoke!

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:22.870
Jory: And all the benefits of battery!

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.100
Jon: Yay!

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:29.330
Jory: Something tells me we aren't gonna be able to get this developed! Even if it was black and white, I don't think!

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.730
Ryan: It's getting really cloudy!

00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:35.570
Jon: A picture's worth a thousand words, and this 
 is the last picture it ever took!

00:02:36.267 --> 00:02:38.270
Now, it's only worth two...

00:02:39.347 --> 00:02:41.350
Ryan: Oh-ho! It's on fire!

00:02:41.033 --> 00:02:43.030
Jory: Okay, turn it off.

00:02:42.067 --> 00:02:44.070
Jon: No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:45.730
Jory: Well, it's still on fire!

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:47.930
Jon: Did you shut the microwave off?

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:48.870
Ryan: Yeah.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Jon: That's how we do that!

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.300
Ryan: That is NOT getting developed anytime soon!

00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:00.830
Ryan: Jory, that's just more flammable stuff...

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:09.570
Jon: This is just... Whoa! He put out the fire, ladies and gentlemen!

00:03:10.668 --> 00:03:12.670
Jon: Good work, Jory!

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.660
Jory: Yeah, that DID put the fire out, 
but in retrospect, how dumb was that?!

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:25.570
Jory: Well, let's think here... That was a paper towel- paper, flammable- that soaked up 
the oil from the inside of a lava lamp! Don't try that at home!

00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:26.470
Jon: Yeah, you're pretty stupid!

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:30.120
Jory: Yeah, here's a disposable camera. It's a good thing they're disposable...

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.400
Jon: Oh, wow! That is amazing! There's nothing left!

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:44.510
Jory: Let's see if we can find the film... So, is this how you develop 
a disposable camera? No, no, it's not how you develop a disposable camera!

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:56.360
Jory: Is it a good idea to put a disposable camera in the microwave? No! No, it's 
not! It's especially not a good idea if it's the camera you took to Italy!

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.300
Jon: Oh, no! My family pictures! Jory, you're a madman!

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.900
Jory: Yeah! Oh, wait- it has a double-"A" in there. Who knew?

00:04:08.367 --> 00:04:17.370
It's not a good idea! That's pretty much what it is- it's not a good idea! So, 
that's it for "Is it a Good Idea to Microwave This?" I'm your host, Jory Caron.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.220
