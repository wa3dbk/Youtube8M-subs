Some people say a bad game is a bad game,
regardless of circumstance.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.530
I say it depends on the circumstance.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.400
Because sometimes, a game’s faults aren’t
actually faults.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.150
They’re just the products of a certain time,
whether it’s a design trend or a technological

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.900
limitation or what have you.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.900
Case in point?

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.750
In 2013, this game kind of sucks.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:59.920
But in 2001, it kind of didn’t.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.330
So there are two important things to note,
broadly speaking, about Extermination.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.500
For starters, it’s a very early PS2 release...which
means we were years away from people figuring

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.640
out the capabilities of the system, with a
game like Resident Evil 4.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.240
Secondly, it’s a survival horror game from
2001, which means we were years away from

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.970
the genre’s much-needed reinvention with
Resident Evil 4.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.759
The point is Extermination feels kind of old
and looks kinda ugly for reasons that are

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.450
completely understandable and not necessarily
the result of the game’s own flaws.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.620
Then again...Extermination is plenty f*cking
flawed.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.479
You play as a Marine sent to investigate a
distress call from this research facility

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.750
on Antarctica.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.790
Most generic story in history, right?

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.080
If you’ve any of the countless games using
the exact same story, you already know what

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.280
he finds at the research facility.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.539
Extermination plays out like a third-person
shooter built on the mechanics of late nineties

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:02.940
survival horror.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.429
So tanky controls, stop to shoot, backtracking...yeah.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.929
And again, that’s the circumstance, right?

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.349
I mean, this was survival horror.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.900
These mechanics defined the genre.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.710
And considering that Extermination was developed
by some of the original creators of Resident

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.710
Evil?

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.730
I mean, there was no way this game wouldn’t
play this way.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.870
Old fans will defend it, new players will
laugh at it.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.550
I say, hey...it’s a victim of circumstance.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.090
And besides, once you get past the awful graphics
and the outdated approach to survival horror,

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.129
Extermination does a lot of things well.

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.070
For example, it has a clever emphasis on battery
power.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.260
So things like powering machines and even
saving your game drains your portable battery.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.909
Which means if you don’t keep it charged,
you’re going to have real problems.

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:54.470
You can also modify your weapons with attachments,
which feels like a precursor to some of today’s

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.920
gameplay conventions.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.709
So what’s the verdict?

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.609
Is this a good old game or just...an old game?

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.920
Well, again, depends on the player.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.439
Old-school survival horror fans who can tolerate
its genre’s earliest quirks should find

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:13.730
a lot to like here, but if you grew up in
a post-RE4 world, Extermination might feel

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.769
a bit too clunky and a bit too campy to bother
with.

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.670
Just know that...it was 2001.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.339
We didn’t know any better.
