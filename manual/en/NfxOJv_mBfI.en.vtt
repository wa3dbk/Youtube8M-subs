00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.680
EMIL LAMPRECHT: The next trick I'm going to
show you is called siteswap 5-3-1, but I've

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.679
also heard it referred to as high-middle-low
or pattern stack. Now, the reason it's called

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.999
a pattern stack is because the way you throw
the balls will literally stack them in a way

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:20.300
that they fall in sequence, kind of like that.
Now, it's not as apparent with three balls

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.980
but you can do this trick with four or five
and higher numbers so that when you're doing

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.160
the trick, it actually looks like all the
balls go up and fall together. Now, in this

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.360
trick, you're working with timing in a way
that you probably have not done before. It's

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:46.260
very important to learn how high a throw goes
to fall down. Okay. The two most important

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.940
throws to learn for this trick are one, the
vamp, which you would use for a 4-4-1 or shower

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.920
pattern; and two, your high throw. You need
to be able to throw a high three-ball cascade.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.470
If this type of thing is hard for you, you
need to practice it till it's down. Otherwise,

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:10.179
this trick may be far more difficult than
is necessary. Now, the essence of the trick

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:18.890
is to throw a high throw, a middle throw,
and then a vamp. It doesn't look very difficult,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:26.490
maybe, but because you're dealing with timing
in a way that you probably have not before,

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.619
it's going to take a little while for your
hands and brain to get a hold on it. Also,

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.569
you're throwing a different throw every time.
At no time are your hands doing the same thing,

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:42.950
which makes kind of evaluating and thinking
about the pattern while you're doing it very

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.719
difficult. It's often helped some people to
yell, "high, middle, low!" but I personally

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:56.450
don't suggest it. One thing that is very common
the second you start doing patterns with high

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.280
throws is leading. Don't round your shoulders,
keep your shoulders back, keep your head up,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.479
because the second you start bending over,
especially for the vamp, your throws will

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:22.151
either go far forward or you won't be able
to see them well enough to catch them. Start

00:02:22.151 --> 00:02:32.190
one at a time...two at a time...and move on
from there. This is a great trick.
