[Music plays]

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.867
(Narrator) Our story
begins in the warm pool,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.157
the place in the Pacific

00:00:28.176 --> 00:00:31.276
where the trade winds sweep
the world’s warmest ocean.

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:35.276
Here clouds form
as warm air rises.

00:00:35.593 --> 00:00:39.972
Across the Pacific clouds gather
at three large meeting places.

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:43.855
These meeting places
have scientific names.

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.965
There’s the South Pacific
Convergence Zone,

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.615
the Intertropical
Convergence Zone,

00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:51.749
and the West Pacific Monsoon.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.034
These cloud meeting places
move throughout the year,

00:00:55.243 --> 00:00:58.744
causing the usual wet
seasons and dry seasons.

00:00:59.448 --> 00:01:01.701
Some years they move
to different areas

00:01:01.717 --> 00:01:04.664
because of changes in trade
winds and ocean temperatures.

00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:07.706
This in turn causes
changes to rainfall,

00:01:07.746 --> 00:01:09.996
sea levels, and
tropical cyclone risk.

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:15.028
Scientists call these changes
in the air and ocean El Niño

00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:16.346
and La Niña.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.587
In an El Niño event
trade winds weaken,

00:01:19.624 --> 00:01:21.584
warmer water moves to the east,

00:01:21.618 --> 00:01:24.361
and the cloud meeting places
move closer together.

00:01:24.916 --> 00:01:27.783
El Niño brings big changes
to the temperature,

00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:30.056
rain, and sea level
in our region.

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:33.782
In some countries, such as
Papua New Guinea and Palau,

00:01:34.215 --> 00:01:37.136
it can cause dryer weather
and lower sea levels,

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.573
sometimes leading to food
and water shortages.

00:01:43.642 --> 00:01:45.042
[Splash]

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:52.872
During El Niño tropical
cyclone risk increases

00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:57.049
in the east in places like the
Southern Cook Islands and Samoa.

00:01:57.379 --> 00:01:59.778
[Music plays]

00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:02.624
[Wind howls]

00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:05.253
And in countries along the
equator, like Kiribati,

00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:07.494
El Niño usually brings more rain

00:02:07.524 --> 00:02:09.478
and sometimes higher sea levels,

00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:11.509
which then lead to flooding.

00:02:13.648 --> 00:02:16.749
It can also mean a better time
to catch tuna in Kiribati

00:02:16.827 --> 00:02:19.818
as the fish follow the
warmer water into this area.

00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:24.141
El Niño and its impacts
usually last for one year,

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.323
and then things
return to normal.

00:02:26.677 --> 00:02:28.877
But El Niño can last longer.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.779
In some years the opposite
of an El Niño occurs.

00:02:33.013 --> 00:02:35.349
Scientists call this La Niña.

00:02:36.295 --> 00:02:39.445
In a La Niña event the
trade winds get stronger,

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:41.741
pushing warmer
water to the west,

00:02:41.873 --> 00:02:44.338
and the cloud meeting
places further apart.

00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:46.961
In some countries
close to the equator,

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.839
such as Tuvalu and Nauru,

00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:51.861
La Niña can bring less
rain and even drought.

00:02:57.123 --> 00:03:00.055
This can affect locally
grown food sources like

00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:01.888
taro, banana, and grapefruit,

00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:04.675
and sometimes lead
to water shortages.

00:03:05.588 --> 00:03:08.558
In other countries, like Fiji
and the Solomon Islands,

00:03:08.734 --> 00:03:11.478
La Niña usually
brings warmer oceans,

00:03:11.745 --> 00:03:14.609
more rain, and can
cause flooding.

00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:16.930
This can lead to
coral bleaching,

00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.614
waterlogged crops, and
increase risk of diseases like

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:22.624
typhoid and dengue fever.

00:03:23.155 --> 00:03:26.867
In the Solomon Islands La Niña
also causes higher sea levels.

00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:31.134
El Niño and La Niña are
not climate change.

00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:33.835
They are part of the
natural climate system.

00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:37.513
El Niño and La Niña will continue
to happen in the future,

00:03:37.611 --> 00:03:40.816
but climate change may intensify
some of their impacts.

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:43.640
Learning how to adapt
to the ups and downs

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:45.341
of El Niño and La Niña

00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:48.504
will help to prepare for
long term climate change.

00:03:50.404 --> 00:03:54.205
Some El Niño and La Niña events
are more severe than others.

00:03:54.437 --> 00:03:58.276
Your local weather office is always
watching El Niño and La Niña

00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:01.483
to provide temperature,
rain, and cyclone forecasts

00:04:01.677 --> 00:04:05.009
that your island is likely to
receive in the months ahead.

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.767
It’s important to undertake
activities to prepare your area

00:04:08.802 --> 00:04:11.891
for the impacts of El
Niño and La Niña events.

00:04:12.726 --> 00:04:14.633
There are many ways to do this.

00:04:14.911 --> 00:04:16.987
Be sure to keep up to
date with the forecast

00:04:16.988 --> 00:04:18.463
from your local weather office,

00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:22.034
and take time to make plans
for the season ahead.
