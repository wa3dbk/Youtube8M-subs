00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.180
What about the supplies?

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.840
Man your positions! We got enemy dropships deploying in sector 4!

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.200
Close the blast doors.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.800
Ready

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.880
Here they come!

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.840
Open fire!

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.420
Contact captain Ziller, tell him to bring Chewbacca and Carmel to the hanger bay.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.200
Greetings, I am Carmel

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.880
I was selected for the flight task to Mustafar.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.420
Nice to meet you Carmel, I am captain Ziller.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.940
Captain Ziller, we are under attack by Imperial forces

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.000
Chewbacca and Carmel must be brought to the hanger bay

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.380
They both must leave as soon as possible.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.480
Why did we stop?

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.300
I will have to open the hanger doors for you

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.080
the doors are closed right now.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.500
DONT LEAVE US

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.740
Continue up ahead, the hanger is right in front of us.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.340
Good luck.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.940
You take this one

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.080
I'll take the bomber behind us

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.720
Captain, you may open the gates now.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.280
Aren't you coming with us captain?

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.620
It's too late

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.440
I'm afraid I will not make it

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.940
I will have to hope for a miracle.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.100
Thank you for everything captain

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.160
May the force will be with you.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.720
Oh and Chewbacca, good luck on planet Hoth

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.120
Make sure not to freeze your fur off

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.900
Quiet!

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.720
Surrender rebel!

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.220
You are outnumbered!

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.180
Lord Vader,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.280
He is the last rebel in this outpost

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.000
A few speeders and fighters have managed to escape.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.020
Now tell me captain,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.880
Where did the fighters and the Jedi go?

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.660
COUGH COUGH

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.240
Jedi...

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.560
We have never had those here...

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.140
Troopers,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.580
Search the computer data

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.840
Find any special coordinates

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.740
Yes sir.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.720
Send fighters to scan the area.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.980
And you captain,

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.740
You will have a special treatment.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.520
Lord Vader, everything has been erased.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.700
So be it.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.420
Officer, set my shuttle to Mustafar

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.200
We have plans awaiting there...
