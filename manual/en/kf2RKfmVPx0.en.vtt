00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
one, two, three, four!

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.480
Rev up your engines!

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.520
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.940
if your car's check engine light is on, and if it
has a trouble called P0171 Bank 1

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.990
engine running to lean, then stay tuned
because I'm going to show you how to fix an

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.220
engine that's running too lean, now
running to lean means that the engine

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.780
either has not enough fuel getting into
the engine, or has too much air going

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.400
into the engine, and this particular
Toyota engine is known for problems of

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.960
intake manifold gaskets leaking, so we're
going to check that first, so we'll take off

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.420
this plastic cover, and this is the
intake manifold here, the gaskets are

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.440
down inside here, and they'll often leak
and here's how to check them, just get a

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.030
can of carburetor spray cleaner, and with
the engine running, spray the cleaner

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.530
where the gaskets are,

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.039
and if the engine starts to idle weird and
go up and down like this one did, it

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:14.509
means there's a leak and it needs new
intake manifold gaskets, they don't cost

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.420
much, but you got to take some stuff off,
so here goes,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.000
we'll move the wiring harness out of the
way, and pull it up so we can get to the

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.990
bolts that hold the manifold on, then
we'll get the throttle body out of the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.810
way, take the air duct out of the way,
then we on both the throttle body itself

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.569
and move it out of the way, then we take
all the bolts off that hold the manifold

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:47.390
in place, then whole manifold just
Wiggles and comes up, and here's the old gasket

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.020
you can see it's cracked and it's
covered in oil, it's just time for new

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.610
one, now the new one only goes on one way,
there's tangs and the tangs fit in

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.829
little holes that only go one way, and
when you look at the new gaskets, you can

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.939
see they sit much higher, the old gaskets
had gone flush and we're leaking air,

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.630
these high sitting ones will seat and
keep air from being sucked into the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.540
engine, now it just slides back in place
and bolts on, then you bolt the manifold

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.819
back on, and if you're a fanatic you can
use a torque wrench to do the actual

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.530
torque setting, me I just get them nice and
snug and it works perfectly fine, then bolt

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.510
the throttle assembly back on, get it on nice
and snug, and put the air duct back on,

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.940
and put all the hoses back in place,
start it up put the top back on,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.010
then take it for a spin, and after
driving it a while, no more check engine

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.270
light and the car runs fine, and remember, if
you have any car questions just visit

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.450
the Scotty Kilmer channel and I'll
answer as soon as I get done boiling

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.980
this Maine lobster!
