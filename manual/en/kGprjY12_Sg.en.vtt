00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:08.240
We have the egg white and sugar mixture for
our vanilla mousse chilling in the refrigerator.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.030
Right now I am opening my heavy cream with
the wrong end of the carton. Make sure where

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:20.800
it says open to use that end. We need a cup
of heavy whipping cream, right in here. Put

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.779
this in our bowl, there we go. We're actually
making whipped cream. It's so easy and once

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.590
you know how to do it at home, you'll never
buy the canned stuff again, ever. It's so

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.610
worth it. You have a cup of heavy cream. Sometimes
I add just a little bit more because it clings

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.130
to the inside of the cup. I really hate thinking
that I got less than what I was supposed to

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:50.810
get. It bothers me for some reason. And to
make it vanilla, we're going to add 2 tsp.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:01:00.239
of vanilla. That is this one right here. If
you want a much milder flavor, you can add

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.320
less than the 2 tsp. If you're really just
a vanilla lover, than you can put more than

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.200
that. I like right at 2 tsp. That's just about
right for me. You're going to whip it with

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.100
some beaters. If you have an electric stand
mixer, that's fantastic. You'll walk away

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.139
for a few minutes and go back and check on
it. I'm going to use a hand-held. You just

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:26.100
beat it until it starts to form into whipped
cream. You don't want to over-beat it because

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.889
it will eventually turn into butter. Once
you start seeing it make ripples in the cream,

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:35.820
and I'll show you what that looks like, that's
when you know it's right about done. Keep

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.329
your spatula handy so you can scrape down
the sides and make sure everything gets evenly

00:01:39.329 --> 00:02:02.109
beat. You can see how much thicker it's getting.
It's starting to make ripples in the cream,

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:06.490
so it's getting there. That's how you know.
You'll see when I start beating again. You

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:27.510
see that? It's starting to make those ripples,
that's when it's getting there. It's getting

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.090
very close. See how it was rippling very heavily.
If you've ever heard of soft peaks, or medium

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.270
peaks, or stiff peaks, I'll tell you what
that's referring to. When you lift your beaters

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.700
out of the whipped cream or whatever you're
beating, these are called the peaks right

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:50.253
there. Those are the peaks. Depending on how
long you whip the cream. It will get firmer

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:54.960
and firmer and firmer. If a recipe says soft
peaks, they should be very light. It should

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.630
probably drip back down just a little bit.
Medium peaks will be somewhere in the middle.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.420
Stiff peaks, these are pretty stiff. We could
go a little bit stiffer if we wanted to, but

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.530
they're not going anywhere. They're sticking
there. These would be referred to anywhere

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.220
from medium to stiff peaks. I'm not going
to beat it anymore because if I did, it would

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.310
start to get chunky. You don't want chunky.
Chunky is when you start on the road to butter.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.480
We don't want that in this case, and this
is actually just right. So I'll pull out my

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.780
beaters and scrape down the edges and we're
going to combine this with the egg white and

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.450
sugar mixture that we had going earlier when
I folded them together.
