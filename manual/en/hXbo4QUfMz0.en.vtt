Welcome to OnlineSecurityScreens.com.au.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.790
In this video we'll be taking you through
the correct way to measure and order your

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.429
new hinged security door.

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.160
You are going to need a few tools for this
job.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.879
Please ensure you have;
A Metric tape measure

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.350
A Pencil
Straight edge that is longer than your door

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.239
width
The Onlinesecurityscreens.com.au Hinged Door

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:25.239
- Measure Sheet

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:30.999
First, we'll check seven criteria to ensure
your new hinged security door can be installed

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:32.320
properly.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.199
Please download the written help guide for
diagrams.

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:41.410
One: The existing timber door needs to be
hinged on the edge so, not a pivot door.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.300
Two: The new hinged security door will be
an outswing which means it is hung on the

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.440
outside of the door jamb.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.969
Three: The door jamb reveal needs to be 20mm
or greater or have no reveal.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.199
Four: The door jamb needs to be timber.

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.960
You can still install the hinged security
door if your jamb is metal or concrete however,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.880
you will need extra tools and these installation
instructions do not cover door jambs of these

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.220
materials.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.890
Five: Check that the handle of your existing
timber door will not interfere with the new

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.020
hinged security door.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.610
Place a straight edge across the outside of
the door jamb at the same height as the existing

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.480
timber door handle.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.580
Measure the distance between the straight
edge and the existing handle.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.900
You will need a minimum of 20mm, but 23mm
or greater is recommended.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.640
Six: Check that the handle on the new hinged
security door will not interfere with the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.290
existing timber door.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.780
Place a straight edge across the outside of
the door jamb.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.290
Measure the distance between the straight
edge and the existing timber door.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.790
You will need a minimum of 53mm, but 56mm
or greater is recommended.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.560
Seven: Check for any obstructions to the swing
path of the new hinged security door.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.490
Take note of items such as lights, awnings,
walls, stairs and uneven ground or concrete.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.770
If you are in doubt with any of these seven
criteria please take a picture and send it

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.099
to info@onlinesecurityscreens.com.au with
your name and contact phone number.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.900
Okay -- we will now begin filling out the
order details on the Onlinesecurityscreens.com.au

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.489

your hinged security door as easy and efficient

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.689
as possible.

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:31.409
First you'll need to decide on your hinged
door style, type and colour.

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:38.670
Your style choices are SecureView 316 Marine

the Triple lock and 5 Pin Cylinder or Safety

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.830
with a Single Lock and 5 Disc Cylinder.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.159
To choose your colour: Use the colour chart
that can be ordered from Onlinesecurityscreens.com.au

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.270
to match existing window frames or door jamb.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.170
Alternatively, obtain the colour from your
builder or house plans.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.549
Now we need to measure the door opening.

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.670
Remember to record all measurements in millimetres.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.950
For the door height:, Measure the height of
the opening in three places.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.129
The two edges and the centre.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:22.629
Deduct 10mm from the smallest measurement
&amp; record on the hinged door - measure sheet.

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.260
Next the door width:
For the Top: Measure the width of the opening

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.359
at the top &amp; 150mm from the top.

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.890
For Security doors with triple locks deduct
9mm off the smallest measurement &amp; record

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.590
on hinged door - measure sheet.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.959
For Safety doors with single locks deduct
8mm off the smallest measurement &amp; record

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.579
on the hinged door - measure sheet.

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.810
Now the Centre: Measure the width of the opening
at the centre.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.829
For both Security &amp; Safety doors deduct 8mm
from the measurement &amp; record on the hinged

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.549
door - measure sheet.

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.329
And for the Bottom: Measure the width of the
opening at the bottom &amp; 150mm up from the

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.329
bottom.

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.790
For Security doors with triple locks deduct
9mm off the smallest measurement &amp; record

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.400
on hinged door - measure sheet.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.769
For Safety doors with single locks deduct
8mm off the smallest measurement &amp; record

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.880
on hinged door - measure sheet.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.940
Please Note: There can only be a maximum of
7mm difference between top &amp; centre measurements

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.790
and between bottom &amp; centre measurements.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.920
Let's now consider the Lock Side: Stand on
the outside of the timber door.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.630
Looking at the timber door decide on which
side (Left or Right) that you want the lock

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.570
to be on &amp; record on hinged door - measure
sheet.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.620
And for the Lock Height: Measure to the top
of the existing handle on the timber door

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.410
and add 200mm.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.500
Alternatively, measure to the bottom of the
existing handle and subtract 50mm.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.470
The third option is to place the lock at your
desired location, as long as the lock height

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.470
exceeds the two previous criteria, you'll
be okay.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.370
Record desired lock height on the hinged door
- measure sheet.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.290

your existing timber door and you are unable

door at a desirable height, you will need
