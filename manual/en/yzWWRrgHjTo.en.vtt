Hi, my name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of
Expert Village. Today I'm going to show you

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.910
how to make a great holiday lamb rack with
roasted new potatoes. Got my scissors here.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.039
Now, what we're going to do, is I need four
tablespoons for the whole recipe. Four tablespoons

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.420
really isn't that much. It's about pretty
much all of this stalk and part of this one,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.910
so what I'm going to do, is I'll trim this
stalk off here at the bottom. And I'll probably

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:36.079
take, and call this one too. And, what'll
happen, is see you just cut that off, is this'll

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.490
grow back as long as I don't clip too much
off here. And that should be good. Now, I've

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.160
still got, as you can tell, part of my stalk
here, or part of my rosemary bush, and this

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.610
goes back into the flower garden where I found
it. Well, not where I found it, but, you know,

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.061
where I keep it. So, now we're going to take
our rosemary and what we're going to do, this

00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:00.899
is a really easy way to get rosemary, you
grab it, you see how it grows this way? Well

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.450
you take your fingers and you put them just
like that and then you just run your fingers

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.280
the opposite direction and that'll probably
pluck off. It usually does. And you'll see

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.881
that you just basically went through and de-stemmed
the whole thing. Now, on the end, you're going

00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:22.120
to want to pull it apart by hand a little
bit. And you'll get a couple of clusters in

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.420
there, but nothing to worry about. So, like
I said, we just start somewhere around here.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.510
Just give it a, you can go through it a couple
times if you want, just make sure you get

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.150
everything. Just go do it like that, there's
all that, and you can also alternately sit

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.770
here and pick them all off just like this,
but that does take a very long time, so, we'll

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.240
just put that as such. Now, for this last
piece, just going to give it a good tug as

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:55.130
well. And the fresher your rosemary, the easier
this is to do. When it dries up, what happens

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.680
is it'll snap here in the middle and you'll
get, it's just a problem. You want to avoid

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.770
that, too. And your fingers should now be
kind of sticky and they should smell wonderful.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.120
So, there is all of our picked rosemary. Now,
what we're going to do is we're going to take

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.760
our knife, and we're going to chop this up
a little bit because it's just a little too

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:30.231
big the way it is. So, just...one pass probably.
And it'll probably go everywhere when you

00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:42.800
chop it, so be aware of that. And try not
to use the dried stuff if you don't have to

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.510
because it's pretty terrible. It doesn't have
nearly the punch. And now we have right about

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.610
three or four tablespoons of fresh rosemary.
