00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.370
Karen, it's great to meet you. Really nice
to meet you, too. Your character Jane Lockhart,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.270
she's neurotic, she's emotional, a bit clumsy.
Yeah. Are there any similarities between the

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.620
two of you?

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.180
I'm all three of the things you just said.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.180
Really? I think so.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.791
So you found it quite easy to get into the
character?

00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:27.490
This is the closest character to myself that
I've ever played. I feel like normally I have

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.900
to contain those things, keep it all under
wraps, but with this it's vomiting over me.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.900
Vomiting out? Vomiting.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.469
And let's talk about the nude scene. Was it
a bit awkward, especially as it was in front

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.039
of a very hot man?

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:48.960
Well, to be fair, Stanley was not present
when we did most of the nude stuff. So that

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.769
was quite nice because that would have been
really embarrassing. Um, but there was a crowd

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.999
of men there, but it was a closed set and
everyone was sort of respectful, but um it

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:03.260
was just so funny. And also kind of liberating
afterwards. A little bit. I wouldn't suggest

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.940
it for fun though. For a pastime.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.920
In the movie, Jane can't admit to herself
that she totally wants a bit of Tom. Yeah.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.020
Who's your real life guilty crush?

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.659
Oh my God, who is my real life guilty crush?

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:23.560
Um, do they have to be alive? Is that weird?

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.680
Probably Elvis Presley. If I was around back
in the day, I mean, it would have been him.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.590
I mean, it still is him.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.829
Let's talk about what else you're up to. You're
a busy woman, and you've just wrapped up Guardians

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.509
of the Galaxy. Can you explain the drastic
change? Lack of hair, yeah.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.060
What was behind the decision to shave your
head, rather than go for a bald cap.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.729
Well, bald caps always look fake for a start.
And I... Before I even auditioned for the

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.119
role in Guardians of the Galaxy, they said
the actress who plays this has to shave her

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.250
head. So I was like sure, I'll shave my head,
not thinking I was going to get it. And then

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.810
I did get it, so it was like oh this is actually
happening. Um, but it's the coolest thing

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.820
I've ever done. Honestly. It's the best.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.240
Were you scared before?

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.470
I was so scared it didn't feel real. I was
that scared and like my body was like this

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.630
isn't real. I'm going to have hair again.
And then I came off, but Marvel were so nice

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.610
that they made a wig out of my own hair that
they shaved off so I have it. It's just not

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.610
attached to me.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.610
Do you wear it?

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.910
I've been wearing it around, and it's pretty
creepy to wear your own hair.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.570
Yeah. I have to say you look absolutely stunning
without hair.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.570
Aw, thank you.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.290
So, Doctor Who. Are you looking forward to
seeing the 50th Anniversary Special?

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.590
Yes, I can't wait. It's going to be amazing.
50 years! It's the longest running sci fi

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.990
show in the world, and that's amazing. And
uh yeah I'll be tuning in.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.930
Do you miss it? Do you keep in touch with
the Daleks?

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.060
I don't keep in touch with the Daleks. I keep
in touch with the Doctor though, but yeah

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.450
no of course I miss it. Those were the most
fun years of my life ever. They probably always

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.900
will be. Um, so yeah, I miss it so much.
