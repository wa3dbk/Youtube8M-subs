00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:06.240
Bobcat Company, a leader in compact
equipment, is breaking new ground in the

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.310
utility vehicle market. With superior
performance and productivity, Bobcat

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.040
introduces the new 3600
and 3650 hydrostatic drive utility vehicles.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.740
Continuing a rich tradition of customer-driven advancements,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.150
the 3650 will take attachment capabilities to a new level,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.220
as the industry's first utility vehicle
with the capacity to operate front-mounted PTO attachments.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.920
Not only are the 3600 and 3650 designed to handle and haul more materials

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.220
for grooming commercial buildings and grounds, or maintaining personal properties,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.480
but they are the first utility vehicles in the Bobcat lineup

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.540
to offer cabs with heat and air conditioning.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.840
This will provide more
comfort than a typical utility vehicle

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.109
while transporting passengers, and for
completing multiple work tasks such as

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:58.580
hauling, mowing, sweeping. and snow removal.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.880
The new 24 horsepower 3600 and 3650 extend the strong Bobcat line of utility vehicles,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.920
which includes the 3200, 3400, 3400XL,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.880
as well as the Toolcat 5600 and 5610 utility work machines.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.440
Both will meet the need for Bobcat customers who want

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.720
the benefits of hydrostatic drive, while the
3650 also has the capability to operate

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.660
front-mounted attachments that are PTO
driven. PTO technology is one of the most

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.560
simple and efficient ways to transfer
engine horsepower to an attachment for optimum performance.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.000
This ability uniquely positions the 3650 to provide users with a highly versatile machine that fills the gap between

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.160
standard Bobcat utility vehicles and the
larger Toolcat utility work machines.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.340
They'll provide more productivity and
performance without compromising other

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.240
important qualities that customers
expect of all Bobcat equipment:

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.400
durability, serviceability, comfort, ease
of use, and versatility.
