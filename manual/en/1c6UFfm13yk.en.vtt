00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:12.720
The vertical mattress pattern is a far-far, near-near suture pattern to construct.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.320
You grasp the skin edge and you're taking a bite back or far from the skin edge.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.540
Its a full thickness bite through skin into the subcutaneous tissues.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.380
You grasp the needle, reset your needle holders and you're ready for completion of the first bite.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:43.140
Again, this is a far, or a bite thats farther away than the near bite on the far side of the incision.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:01:00.100
So, the first suture bites are taken in a forehand direction. You then reverse the needle set it at the similar location on your needle holders and then you're ready to do the near bites.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.880
These are closer to the skin edge but full thickness in nature.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:18.100
Sometimes you come directly across the incision without taking your needle out in between suture bites.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:30.080
Now, notice that I have grasped the needle with my left hand, my thumb forceps are in the left hand. And now I gather the suture in order to complete the tie.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.980
You can see that the when I tie this that the skin edges will be everted.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:54.780
Now its hard to maintain the correct tension. But both the vertical mattress and the horizontal mattress are everting suture patterns principally used for skin--principally used in areas where there's tension.
