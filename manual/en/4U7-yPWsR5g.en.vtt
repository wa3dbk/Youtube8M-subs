00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:13.705
You’ve been listening
to the beautiful clarinet solo

00:01:13.705 --> 00:01:16.853
from the 1st Act of Sleeping Beauty,
of Tchaikovsky.

00:01:17.986 --> 00:01:19.142
And...

00:01:19.173 --> 00:01:21.018
For me this is kind of fun,

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:23.393
to be up here on stage
to play this solo,

00:01:23.393 --> 00:01:25.393
because during my
28 year tenure here

00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:27.330
I’m usually down there
in the pit playing this,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.361
so it’s kind of fun
to be up on stage

00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:31.080
to play this lovely solo

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.799
also where
the Royal Danish Ballet

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.799
is every night dancing.

00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:38.855
I’m going to start by...

00:01:39.542 --> 00:01:41.999
... making three points
about this solo.

00:01:42.823 --> 00:01:44.201
Very, very important,

00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:46.670
the first point
I’m gonna talk about

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.451
is articulation,

00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:50.670
the portamento
and the shorter articulation.

00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:51.951
Later in the solo

00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:54.701
I’m gonna talk about
the use of rubato...

00:01:55.345 --> 00:01:57.908
... and the use of
non-rubato.

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.701
That’s an interesting
discussion

00:02:00.701 --> 00:02:02.545
about rubato
and playing in time,

00:02:02.576 --> 00:02:04.951
and how that affects
the structure of the solo.

00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:06.513
That’s the second point.

00:02:06.513 --> 00:02:08.232
And then I’m gonna end
with a little...

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.513
... tips on how to practice

00:02:10.513 --> 00:02:12.451
that 32nd notes passage
at the end,

00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:14.857
the little cadenza,
that descending passage.

00:02:15.794 --> 00:02:17.678
But let’s start with...

00:02:18.115 --> 00:02:20.177
... with the articulation now.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.597
As we discussed in
the fundamentals of clarinet playing,

00:02:23.597 --> 00:02:25.160
the long articulation,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.441
I’m gonna call this
a portamento articulation,

00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:29.535
it starts with
these two 8th notes,

00:02:29.553 --> 00:02:31.553
and we want to play
these 8th notes...

00:02:32.097 --> 00:02:34.240
We want to tell a story,
basically.

00:02:34.597 --> 00:02:37.371
So, what do we have to do
to tell a story?

00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:39.215
Well, just as I said
in our...

00:02:39.472 --> 00:02:42.004
... in our introduction,
fundamentals of playing,

00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:43.719
always air first.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.344
So: lead with your air,
release with your tongue.
