00:00:03.352 --> 00:00:06.582
Happy Halloween...

00:00:06.582 --> 00:00:09.007
All you tricks!

00:00:10.154 --> 00:00:14.286
A storm is on the rise!

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:19.749
Come with me!

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.729
See what I see!

00:00:32.817 --> 00:00:37.069
That's right! Get possessed! Get angry!

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:40.558
Get real tricks! Let's get started!

00:00:49.787 --> 00:00:55.792
Go drag on 'em! Glue those eyebrows down.

00:01:33.336 --> 00:01:38.873
Cover those brows! This is how we drag queens do!

00:01:42.947 --> 00:01:50.130
Now put those eyebrows back on and make 'em fierce! Make them diva-like!

00:01:56.424 --> 00:01:59.800
Make sure you blend, tricks!

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:06.140
Get it smoky, get it fierce!

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.590
Blend, trick, blend! It's happy Halloween!

00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:17.400
Get those blacks going!

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.360
Now do all of that to the other eye.

00:02:37.702 --> 00:02:45.360
Now we go drag. Make sure you highlight, and 
 go light. Super light! Super T light!

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:50.750
With your banana powder. Are you bananas? I'm bananas!

00:03:02.846 --> 00:03:06.660
Contour with a darker... color!

00:03:15.462 --> 00:03:23.720
Now set everything. Set it all up, girl. Blend it and set it.

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:35.390
And we gonna contour that nose! Contour!

00:03:35.388 --> 00:03:41.300
We tryna look like Storm. Cartoon Storm. Marvelous X-Men Storm.

00:03:56.751 --> 00:03:59.640
Mascara! Mascara!

00:04:18.053 --> 00:04:21.260
Give 'em them kissable lips, ladies.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.860
No Storm costume is complete without a fierce, white, diva wig.

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:48.440
My name is Storm. You best be warned!

00:04:48.444 --> 00:04:51.540
My name... is Storm!

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.420
Happy Halloween! From me to you! What are you this Halloween?

00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:03.810
My name is Storm.

00:05:05.002 --> 00:05:08.850
You best be warned, my name is Storm.

00:05:09.012 --> 00:05:17.600
I bring the thunder! I make it rain! I make it pour!

00:05:19.032 --> 00:05:25.660
My name is Storm, I make the thunder, I 
 make it rain, I make it pour!

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:31.660
Stay true! Do you, be you, stay true, baby boo.

00:05:32.055 --> 00:05:38.000
What are you gonna be this year? Comment below. Let me know.

00:05:37.997 --> 00:05:46.010
Are you gonna be a bird man? Maybe a cat? Are you 
 going to be a cat for Halloween?! Let me know!

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:51.100
I'm a marvelous, marvelous X-Man.

00:05:51.102 --> 00:05:54.640
Oh, you a man? No! I'm an X-Man!

00:05:58.116 --> 00:06:02.440
Do not be Tyrone Biggums! That's just too much drama!

00:06:02.436 --> 00:06:07.980
I don't want no drama all up in here! No more political drama!

00:06:07.982 --> 00:06:11.690
Just love. Just keep the love, love.

00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:18.110
I love you! Even though I occasionally am 
 stupid. So what?! I'm a human being!

00:06:18.114 --> 00:06:20.150
I am not a god!

00:06:20.427 --> 00:06:25.130
Although I'm an X-Man, a marvelous X-Man!

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.430
But we don't want feelings hurt. Keep the love alive.

00:06:31.913 --> 00:06:37.550
Do you, be you, stay true, baby boo. Be shameless!
