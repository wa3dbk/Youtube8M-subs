00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.500
Is split-muscle training really possible?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.420
With Athlean-X I am going to show you today,
that it is not.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:26.410
[Music Intro]

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:42.899
What's up guys?

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.370
Jeff Cavaliere AthleanX.com

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.010
We are going to talk today about split-muscle
group training.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.710
Whether or not it is really possible.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.489
If you want to train like an athlete,

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.079
which is what we have been covering

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.550
To look like an athlete- it shouldn't be possible.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.600
I am going to show you why.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.560
I am going to take some shoulder exercises
and you can tweak them with just a small,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.500
small change to make them much more than just
a shoulder movement.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.930
So if we started with a front-dumbbell raise,
right.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.260
We can be trying to work through just the
front shoulders.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:31.310
Why do that when we can easily add some core
training on to what we are doing with our

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.810
body--its position in relation to the weight.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.150
So I have a low cable here.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.060
You can hook up a low band here, it can be
at the bottom of a bedpost.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.110
Or wherever you want to anchor it to.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.570
But if I step out just to the side here, OK,
out and front and to the side.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.170
What you are going to see is my pre-position
which stretches and works my core obliques

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.270
just from having to be in that position.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.530
So here with that pre-load I can come up towards
the top.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:12.319
And now work my shoulders here, but at the
same time try to control and decelerate that

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.890
down through my core, my obliques, and actually
in through my low back at the same time.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:27.390
So we can make it a really explosive movement
too, by accelerating it up and having to,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.430
again, decelerate on the way down.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.480
So we can tie our core into everything into
everything we do just by changing body position

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.890
around in relation to the exercise that you
are trying to perform.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.660
So don't just grab your dumbbells out here
and do your shoulder raise.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:56.540
There are so many things at your disposal,
all of which we cover in ATHLEAN-X program.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.230
Next another unique way to get at the side
or medial head of the deltoid.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:09.020
Grab--it doesn't have to be a low cable guys,
it can be a band down low.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.150
Up here and we are going to pull it up towards
the top.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.160
So both thumbs up here towards the top.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.319
This is not an Upright Row where your elbows
are higher than your hands which are sinking

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.500
down in front of your chest.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.440
Because that is going to put yourself into
an impingement position.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.780
Here we are actually coming out, elbows down,
thumbs up.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.739
OK just like that.

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:43.020
From here we can see you can get that medial
head of the deltoid involved.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.410
OK?

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.770
But now why don't we take that a step further
and change the position

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.459
our body in relation to the weight, to the
resistance.

00:03:52.459 --> 00:04:00.290
We take a little bit of an open stance so
that again, in pre-load I am in through here.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:08.040
See just by doing this, reaching across, I
activate a lot more muscles in my core.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.790
Up and across and down.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.430
The focus here is on the left side at the
moment.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:32.940
Again even the low back in that position is
going to have to work.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:41.840
So I work the other side, work back, open
up in here and rotate.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:50.380
Pull up high, work the right side.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.430
[Exercises]

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:03.780
So the lesson here is: split-muscle group
training.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.440
You are going to head to the gym and do shoulders
today, or biceps.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.480
With ATHLEAN-X, yes you can train shoulders
or biceps.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.880
At the same time you are going to get a lot
more worked up because we are going to bring

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.290
the core into every single exercise.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.470
We are going to tie it together, group separate
to work together.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.760
If we do that pull you can guarantee that
you are pulling your biceps as well.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.070
Nothing works in isolation.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.773
It is not going to be that way if you bring
this out into the field.

00:05:33.773 --> 00:05:38.760
It is not going to be that way if you are
going to train here in the gym.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.860
Guys, we are going to keep it rolling here:
2012.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.860
It is all about training like an athlete to
look like an athlete.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.880
As I said last week, that is the new trend
here in weight training.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.620
That is where we are all headed.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.470
If you haven't already, come on board to TEAM
ATHLEAN.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.350

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.160
