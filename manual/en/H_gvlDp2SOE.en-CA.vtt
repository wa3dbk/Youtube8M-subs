00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:24.521
Hi. This machine is my experiment
at building a hollow chisel

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.660
mortiser out of wood.

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:31.161
I started with one of these drill
press hollow chisel mortiser kits.

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.399
I had to cut the bracket for this kit apart
so that I could fit a hand drill into it.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:40.904
I mounted my chisel holder with this
part cut out on a piece of plywood

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:44.443
and it actually sticks into
the plywood, a little bit, here.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:47.780
So that you can push up against the plywood
because you need to apply an awful lot

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:50.483
of force, when you're
hollow chisel mortising.

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:53.984
And then on these blocks here.
I mount my hand drill.

00:00:57.624 --> 00:01:01.124
And there's another block here that
attaches it securely in place.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:06.563
And then
I can put my chisel in here.

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:11.468
And that lines up exactly with the chuck
and it's one of these older style

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:15.405
key chucks. So I can get in
here and tighten that up

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:18.845
with the key.

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:22.346
The chisel holder and drill are
attached to this piece of plywood.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.583
Which has got these rails attached to
here which makes a sliding dovetail.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:30.754
And it slides on this part here.

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:36.927
This whole drill and chisel
and dovetail assembly

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:40.697
attaches to a stand here. This is
actually part of my joint strength test.

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:45.902
And then I just fasten it
on here with a bar clamp.

00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:48.808
The whole thing is an
experiment so

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:51.711
I didn't really want to build
a dedicated stand for it.

00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:55.212
And at the top I've got this part
here which is a little bit loose.

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:58.982
And two big carriage bolts
that attach to my lever.

00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:02.922
And with that I can plunge
the whole mechanism.

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:05.291
And I have a lot of
mechanical advantage.

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:08.060
Because it takes an awful
lot of force

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:11.561
to plunge one of these holes through
the mortises into the wood.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:15.401
Unfortunately with this cheap drill
it's a hammer drill.

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:17.770
And even with the hammer
function turned off

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:21.271
this drill chuck will actually
move into the drill, a little bit

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:25.008
when I'm mortising. So I have to actually
leave an extra little bit of slack

00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:29.549
on this arm with the chisel

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.785
because these hollow chisel
mortising chisels

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:36.286
the drill that goes into here
is not meant to rub against

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:39.923
the actual chisel, itself. It needs to
protrude. And I need to protrude it

00:02:39.927 --> 00:02:43.427
an extra little bit so that
when the wood pushes it up

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:48.000
it still doesn't ride into the chisel.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.570
The drill, that I'm using, is
a real cheap hammer drill.

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:52.905
It only cost me
about twenty dollars.

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:55.174
And, it's too high an RPM so

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.410
it would be better to have one
with more gear reduction

00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:59.612
and this whole chuck issue, as well.

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:02.114
But, other than that
it's about right.

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:05.615
To get the right kind of drill there's
a DeWault drill that would be perfect.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.754
But that costs a hundred
and fifty dollars.

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:11.190
And a brand new

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:14.691
cheap hollow chisel mortiser
only cost two hundred dollars.

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:17.363
So, it really doesn't make much
sense to spend a lot of money

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:20.233
trying to build a cheap
hollow chisel mortiser

00:03:20.234 --> 00:03:23.734
if you can buy one for
that little money.

00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:37.981
Let's have a closer look
inside those mortises.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.921
The problem with hollow
chisel mortisers is that

00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:45.258
the bottom of the mortise just
isn't very clean.

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.693
Because when the chisel comes in
the drill has to

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:50.229
cut a little bit ahead of the chisel.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.232
And the chisel has got these
sort of

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:56.602
curves in here.
So, it doesn't actually

00:03:56.603 --> 00:04:00.103
remove all of the chips. So the bottom
of the mortise just isn't clean.

00:04:00.374 --> 00:04:02.508
So, you'd really have to clean
it up with a hand chisel

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.344
if you want your tenon to
come all the way down.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:08.281
Now, my mortiser
is a little bit worse.

00:04:08.282 --> 00:04:11.782
But this mortise here was actually cut
with a real professional mortiser.

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:16.086
And you see similar results.
It's just not very clean.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.858
And the sides
are not very clean either.

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.727
Because the chisel is just
essentially pushed straight down

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:23.462
and that makes the cut.

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:26.933
So, it's really not a very
elegant way of making mortises.

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:30.069
A slot mortiser, by comparison
will cut a lot faster

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.570
and it will cut a lot cleaner.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:37.610
So, overall, I don't think it
really makes that much sense

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:40.279
to build your own
hollow chisel mortiser.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.416
Especially when you consider
how cheap you can buy those.

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:46.652
If you are gonna build a mortiser. It'd
be much better to build a slot mortiser.

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:48.788
Or maybe, even, my pantorouter.

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.490
Because those machines do a
much better job of mortising

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.991
and they're much quicker. And they're
much more expensive to buy new.
