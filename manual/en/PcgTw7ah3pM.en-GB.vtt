Alright YouTube, It is Chrisy here from Chantotor
Games and some of you boys out there have

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.110
been asking me how I record other people talking
over my game play, especially on GTA 5 online

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.800
for the PS4. So this very quick and simple
set-up guide will basically show you how I

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.570
set it up and a lot of boys out there have
posted videos but to me it was hard trying

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.090
to patch other boys videos together so this
video will be as simple and as straight forward

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.000
as I can make it. So hopefully you can start
making the same type of videos as what I have.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.700
Alright guys. The things you will need for
this to work are, any USB Mic. I personally

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.780
use the Blue Yeti. Another mic for the PC,
I prefer this lapel microphone I got for 10

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.390
Pounds and Headphones to stop the microphones
picking up the sound from the TV. First connect

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.410
the USB Mic to the PS4. On the PS4 go to Settings,
Devices, Audio Devices. You then want to plug

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.670
and unplug normal headphones into your controller,
doing so changes the Audio Output to TV or

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.690
AV Amplifier. This means the sounds will then
come through the TV of the other players talking

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.010
allowing the capture card to pick up other
people talking. Connect up your headphones

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.610
to your TV, any 3.5mm headphones does the
job, like I said this stops your microphones

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.010
picking up the sound and causing any echo's.
Using your other mic (or lapel mic) stick

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.760
it onto your USB Mic like I have, meaning
it captures your voice to the PC and allows

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.210
other players to hear you. Hit capture on
your capture card software, be careful that

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.159
commentary is not turned on. Use Audacity
to record your own voice from the lapel microphone

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.460
separate. After you export both video and
audio, match them to together in an editing

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.450
program and export for YouTube. One other
top that I have found when using this, make

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.060
sure you start the party chat BEFORE you play
any games. Many times I have gone onto GTA,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.979
started a party to find it won't work. So
start the party, invite your friends, if you

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.979
hear them through your headphones and they
hear you, start the game. Problem solved.
