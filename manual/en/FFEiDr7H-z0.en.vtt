00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.809
I don't understand it. How they just waiting
there.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.100
Okay, okay.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.409
Sorry. No speaking English.

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.570
Oh hello, you're home. It's James here from
Inter-Tele-World.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.539
No speaking English. Sorry.

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.170
What language do you speak, sir? Italian?

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.920
Espanola.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.640
Buenos dias. Mi amo James.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.130
No speaking Espanola. Ah...Greek. Greek only.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.759
Kalimera. To onoma moo eene James.

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.509
No speaking Greek. Chinese. Speak only Chinese.

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.159
Ni Hao. Wo Jiao James.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.080
Okay, okay. Italian only.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.780
Buon giorno. Mi chiamo James.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.780
These days they hire the people to come to
your house and speak in 20 different languages.

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.869
But why do they want my money so much? I only
have a little.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.479
Ah good morning sir. Buon giorno.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.640
Listen Mr...

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.880
Mr James Turner. Pleased to meet you.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.139
Mr Turner, I'm an old man. I do not want
to switch gas. I'm happy with Sunshine Energy and Gas...

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:16.139
Well, not so happy, really. Every
year they raise their prices.

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:20.370
Please, leave me be. Go and speak to next house.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.620
Mr?...

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.870
Díamico.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.400
Mr Díamico, you're in luck. I'm happy that
you're happy with your energy supplier.

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.120
I don't know the first thing about gas. You
know much more than me.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.579
Maybe I should get a job knocking on doors
for Sunshine Energy and Gas.

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.140
If you've got some time to spare though,
I'd like to talk to you about your phone bill.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.580
But I'm happy with my phone bill. It comes in
the mail. I open it. I pay it. Well, I just

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.920
don't pay it. I think to myself 'Marcello,
why do you call your family back home in Italy so much?

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.099
It's costing you money you don't
have.'

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:09.000
Uh-oh. Shouldn't have told him that. Forgive
me, I'm an old man. Sometimes I like to talk.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.200
I understand, Marcello. I'm originally from
New Zealand.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.750
And although I've been here a long time, it's still important for me
to ring home. To speak to my family.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.300
Yes, yes. Family very important. Wives. Children.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.200
Of course you're right. And with Inter-Tele-Worldwide,
we've got some good deals on international calls,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.709
so that you can make sure family stays
important. For you Marcello, you can call

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.129
back home to Italy. And I can home to Wellington.
And all for much cheaper than you'd expect.

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.090
Even I was surprised at how low my phone bill
was. When I saw it I said to myself

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.610
'Now James, you've got no excuse not to call home
every day.' Do you mind if I come in and

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.800
tell you about how Inter-Tele-Worldwide is
going to help save you money?

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:02.400
Am I going to regret this? But I do need to
call home. Speak to my family.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:10.500
Maybe if I sign up, I can call Italy more often. I'll just listen to him for five minutes and then I'll tell him to go.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.100
Okay, come in. Come in.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:27.800
Marcello, who's your current telecommunications
provider? Optimum Telco? Australian Telco?

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.030
Optimum Telco.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.760
Well of course you know that Optimum Telco
has to pay a licensing fee to Australian Telco

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.800
to basically rent their fibre optic land communication
cables and they pass that cost right onto the consumer.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.479
That means that the consumer pays
the retailer to borrow from the supplier.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.719
Now I'm not saying you should switch your
retailer to the supplier because Australian

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:53.449
Telco basically owns the telecommunications
market. Which means they have the market power

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.090
to set the costs for the other market players.
And they determine the market price in a market

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:05.000
they dominate and essentially price-regulate
the market. You understand me?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I have no idea what heís talking about.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.100
You like saving money don't you, Marcello?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.810
Yes. Everyone does.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.810
Good. Because our focus is the customer. You.
We want you to save you money.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.880
But what's all this?

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.479
It makes sense if you read this first. And
then you just give me your signature here.

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:37.669
Ah where?

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:38.259
Here.

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:42.500
But what am I signing up for?

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.979
Saving money, Marcello. Ringing Italy.

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.380
Wait, wait.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.180
If you don't sign now, you won't be saving
anything.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.090
I really need to think about this.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.200
Of course, of course. You just sign here,
have a think. And if you want to, give us a call.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.380
But what's in it for me?

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:11.139
Read the information pack, Marcello. It's
all in there.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.139
But it's all in fine print.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:40.100
What did I tell you? He is good. And me? Am
I saving money? Am I sucker?
