00:00:03.697 --> 00:00:08.377
Actually you know what Spiderman
Oh! We are on camera

00:00:08.397 --> 00:00:11.987
Hi, I am Jamila
Hi, I am advait

00:00:11.987 --> 00:00:14.467
And what you witnessed
Was an argument

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:18.837
About what we should make for you today
What we are gonna make is

00:00:18.837 --> 00:00:20.816
Superman
Batman and

00:00:20.817 --> 00:00:25.337
Spiderman
From PlayDoh

00:00:25.857 --> 00:00:31.257
So we are gonna start off with Spiderman
For that what you are going to need is

00:00:32.317 --> 00:00:36.617
A thick piece of paper or cardboard
And simply cut out the face of Spiderman's

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:39.217
face
And then, take red PlayDoh

00:00:40.897 --> 00:00:43.906
And then flatten it
Take your piece of cardboard

00:00:45.437 --> 00:00:50.837
And lay it on top like this
Press it on to it and

00:00:50.897 --> 00:00:59.457
Remove all the excess
Then what we are going to do is

00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:05.077
Take a PlayDoh knife and make a circle
In the middle like this

00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:19.437
And then we going to make lines of the web
So I am just making lines all over the face

00:01:19.937 --> 00:01:23.597
And advait here is going to show you
How to make the web

00:01:26.077 --> 00:01:37.517
Just make circular lines all over the surface
So once this is ready

00:01:38.126 --> 00:01:40.236
What we are going to do is
Make Spidermanï¿½s eyes

00:01:40.237 --> 00:01:45.717
For that take black PlayDoh
And cut out a triangular shape for the eyes

00:01:46.737 --> 00:01:50.217
Then we are going to do the same thing with
white PlayDoh

00:01:50.657 --> 00:02:05.197
So just cut it out
And take that and stick it into the black

00:02:05.897 --> 00:02:08.717
one
Then place it here

00:02:10.917 --> 00:02:15.537
Looks cool, doesn't it?
Do the same for the other eye

00:02:16.097 --> 00:02:23.097
Yayy! Our Spiderman is ready
Now it time for Superman. Wohoo!

00:02:25.737 --> 00:02:27.977
Let's make Superman
For that take blue PlayDoh

00:02:28.267 --> 00:02:33.347
And then take a circular cut out like this
And place it on top

00:02:33.347 --> 00:02:41.447
And remove off all the excess from the sides
Once thats ready we are going to cut out a

00:02:41.597 --> 00:02:48.057
diamond
Take your PlayDoh and simply cut out a diamond

00:02:48.057 --> 00:02:55.897
shape
Wow, it looks so cool

00:02:56.157 --> 00:02:57.117
Same way take out another diamond of the yellow
one

00:02:57.897 --> 00:03:02.177
And place it on top
Put it into place

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:12.517
And finish it off by making the 'S'
Roll out red PlayDoh and place it on top

00:03:12.517 --> 00:03:20.017
To make an 'S' remove all the excess
This is also done

00:03:20.317 --> 00:03:27.317
Time for my favorite Batman
Alright, alright! Let's make Batman

00:03:27.997 --> 00:03:30.317
For Batman
You will need a shape like this

00:03:30.497 --> 00:03:34.757
That is oval
Then take yellow PlayDoh

00:03:35.237 --> 00:03:39.377
And repeat the same process
Now to make this really simple

00:03:40.157 --> 00:03:47.157
Cut out a Batman shape like this
And then just take black PlayDoh

00:03:47.637 --> 00:03:52.938
And cove the entire thing
Be sure to make it even

00:03:53.217 --> 00:04:02.417
And then turn it around and
Remove all the excess

00:04:11.747 --> 00:04:16.687
Look your Batman is ready
Wow, it looks so cool

00:04:16.687 --> 00:04:17.586
 

00:04:17.586 --> 00:04:20.766
And tell you what
You can even stick some magnet behind

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:24.697
And then place it wherever you want
