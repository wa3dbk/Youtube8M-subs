00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.133
&gt;&gt; Y'ALL WERE CALLED TO

00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.033
ASSIST IN EMERGENCY

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:04.467
DISASTER OPERATIONS.

00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:06.066
&gt;&gt; WHEN DISASTER STRIKES...

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.600
(wind, fire crackling)

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.834
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE PARTICULAR AREA

00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:10.200
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.066
&gt;&gt; ...GAME WARDENS FROM ALL

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.533
ACROSS TEXAS RESPOND

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.066
TO THE EMERGENCY.

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.400
&gt;&gt; A CRASH NEAR FORT HOOD AREA

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.800
(plane crash)

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.100
&gt;&gt; 150 CESSNA

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.400
&gt;&gt; A TERRORISM ACT

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.500
&gt;&gt; AN ORGANIZED MASS ATTACK

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.333
ON U.S. ASSETS

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.767
&gt;&gt; FORTUNATELY THIS EVENT

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:25.900
IS ONLY A TEST

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.667
&gt;&gt; IT HAS THIS

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:28.400
STRONTIUM 90 IN IT...

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.834
&gt;&gt; THIS DRILL, SIMULATING A

00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:31.000
PLANE CRASH AND TERRORIST

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.633
ATTACK WILL HELP WARDENS

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:35.066
RESPOND TO ALL DISASTERS

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.433
BY TRAINING THEM IN THE VERY

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:38.033
LATEST MAPPING AND GLOBAL

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:39.533
POSITIONING TECHNOLOGY.

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.433
&gt;&gt; BE CAREFUL OUT THERE.

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:42.533
WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY HURT.

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.633
&gt;&gt; NOW WE SHOULD HAVE A GRID

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:44.533
ONCE WE GET OUT THERE AND GET

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.867
POSITIONED, SO IF YOU JUST

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:46.834
KIND OF WANT TO MOVE IT

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:47.967
OVER A LITTLE BIT...

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:49.333
&gt;&gt; GPS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.266
USED FOR JUST ABOUT EVERY

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.000
FACET OF OUR BUSINESS.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.667
SO WE FELT LIKE IT WAS TIME

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:54.734
THAT WE WENT AHEAD AND GOT

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:56.200
MORE GAME WARDENS TO EXPERIENCE

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.967
IT IN A DRILL BEFORE THEY

00:00:57.967 --> 00:00:59.600
REALLY HAVE TO USE IT.

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:02.300
IT'S A TECHNOLOGY USEFUL TO

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.300
MANY, BUT IT CAN BE VITAL

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.033
TO THOSE DOING RESCUE

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:06.700
AND RECOVERY WORK.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.500
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.300
THIS GRID RIGHT HERE.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.100
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.800
&gt;&gt; USING ADVANCED GPS UNITS,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.100
RESPONSE TEAMS CAN BE SURE

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.600
THAT SEARCH AREAS OR GRIDS

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.000
ARE COVERED COMPLETELY.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.300
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.333
&gt;&gt; IT'S A WAY OF KEEPING TRACK

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.400
OF WHERE YOU'RE ASSIGNED

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.700
TO GO AND WHERE YOU'VE

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.200
BEEN SO YOU CAN DO A

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.934
MORE SYSTEMATIC SEARCH.

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:24.900
&gt;&gt; IT MAY SOUND SIMPLE...

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.867
&gt;&gt; ...BUT IT REQUIRES

00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:26.567
SOME PRACTICE.

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:28.000
&gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO BE A BRAND

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.800
NEW EXPERIENCE FOR THEM.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.367
&gt;&gt; ...NOW WE NEED TO

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:30.166
GO THIS WAY.

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:30.967
&gt;&gt; IT'S A LITTLE SCARY.

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:32.166
&gt;&gt; WELL DO WE JUST GET OUT

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:33.200
AND START WALKING?

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.800
&gt;&gt; WE'LL GET YOU IN THE

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.767
RIGHT VICINITY.

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:35.400
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE TRYING SOME

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.100
NEW UNITS THAT THEY'VE

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.867
NEVER USED BEFORE

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:39.066
(unit dings)

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.467
&gt;&gt; QUIT IT!

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:41.600
&gt;&gt; IT JUST WON'T LET ME DO IT.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.900
&gt;&gt; AHHH.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.033
(unit dings)

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:45.166
&gt;&gt; IT'S A LITTLE TROUBLESOME

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:45.900
AT FIRST...

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.266
&gt;&gt; THIS ONE'S GOT US CONFUSED.

00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:48.900
&gt;&gt; ...BUT ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.800
THE EQUIPMENT, UH, IT'S EASIER.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.066
&gt;&gt; I'VE GOT A WAYS TO GO.

00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:56.000
BUT IT IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.033
&gt;&gt; THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:59.233
INCLUDES NOT JUST GPS,

00:01:59.233 --> 00:02:01.767
BUT ALSO GIS, OR GEOGRAPHIC

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:03.800
INFORMATION SYSTEM.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.066
&gt;&gt; GIS IS A WAY OF PUTTING

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:06.600
DATA THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.333
INTO A VISUAL FORM THAT WE

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:10.734
CAN MAKE SENSE OF.

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:11.567
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK OF IT

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:13.066
AS COMPUTER MAPPING.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.233
IT ALLOWS US TO OVERLAY MAPS

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:15.834
WHERE YOU CAN LOOK AT HOW

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:16.900
THINGS RELATE TO EACH OTHER,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.734
SEE IF THERE'RE CORRELATIONS.

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:20.200
GPS AND GIS WORK REAL

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.867
CLOSELY TOGETHER.

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:23.834
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE COMPUTERS ARE

00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:25.467
INVOLVED, THERE ARE A FEW

00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:27.000
BUGS TO WORK OUT.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.834
&gt;&gt; THAT DOESN'T LOOK

00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:28.533
LIKE WHAT WE WANT.

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:29.633
&gt;&gt; IT'S TAKEN SOME

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:30.567
GETTING USED TO.

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:31.166
&gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT OURSELVES A

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:32.533
PROBLEM WITH THAT IMAGE THERE.

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:33.867
&gt;&gt; BUT WE'VE HAD PLENTY OF

00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:35.200
HELP TO FIGURE IT OUT.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.700
(rustling grass)

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.433
&gt;&gt; GIS AND GPS TECHNOLOGY

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:41.200
CAN'T REPLACE THE LEGWORK...

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.867
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE GETTING PRETTY

00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:42.834
FAR DOWN THERE.

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:44.066
&gt;&gt; ...BUT THEY CAN HELP SEARCH

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:45.800
TEAMS WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.333
&gt;&gt; THERE'S SOME DEBRIS

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:48.433
&gt;&gt; WE FOUND UH, A COUPLE OF

00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:49.834
PIECES OF PLASTIC FROM THE

00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:51.100
AIRPLANE AND WE'RE GONNA BE

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.166
MARKING THEM WITH THE

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:53.200
TRIMBLE UNIT HERE.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.633
&gt;&gt; PIECE BY PIECE, THE MOCK

00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:56.033
DEBRIS IS PINPOINTED

00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:57.633
ELECTRONICALLY AND FLAGGED

00:02:57.633 --> 00:02:59.734
FOR RETRIEVAL.

00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:02.633
&gt;&gt; WE'RE GETTING THERE.

00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:03.934
&gt;&gt; BACK AT THE COMMAND CENTER,

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:06.266
THIS DATA BEGINS TO YIELD MAPS,

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:07.600
RICH WITH INFORMATION THAT

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.667
WOULD BE VITAL TO HAZMAT CREWS

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:11.667
OR FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS.

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:12.600
&gt;&gt; I SEE A LOT OF POTENTIAL

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.834
FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY.

00:03:13.834 --> 00:03:16.667
&gt;&gt; SO MUCH DATA TO COLLECT,

00:03:16.667 --> 00:03:18.133
AS YOU FIND ALL OF THAT

00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:19.500
AND YOU CAN MAP IT OUT,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.433
YOU CAN KIND OF LAY OUT A

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.467
PATTERN OF WHAT TOOK PLACE.

00:03:22.467 --> 00:03:24.300
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.066
&gt;&gt; I WISH WE'D HAD THIS

00:03:25.066 --> 00:03:26.433
TRAINING AND THIS

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:27.433
TECHNOLOGY WHEN THE

00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:31.166
SHUTTLE CAME APART.

00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:32.734
&gt;&gt; WHEN THEY HAD THE SHUTTLE

00:03:32.734 --> 00:03:34.800
EVENT HAPPEN IN EAST TEXAS...

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.600
&gt;&gt; ...ARE CONFIRMED PIECES.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.500
&gt;&gt; ...THERE WAS A LOT OF

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.133
GAME WARDENS THAT

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:38.200
PARTICIPATED IN THAT.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.233
&gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE ONE PIECE OF TILE

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:40.367
&gt;&gt; COLLECTING THAT DEBRIS

00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:41.233
AND USING SOME OF

00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:43.200
THIS TYPE OF EQUIPMENT.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.200
THEY KNOW LANDOWNERS,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.333
KNEW THOSE WOODS,

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:46.700
HOW TO GET INTO THEM.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.266
&gt;&gt; JUST STAND UNDER IT

00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:48.066
AND MARK IT

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:49.467
&gt;&gt; ALSO GAME WARDENS, IN THE

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:50.633
EVENT THAT SOMETHING DOES

00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:52.200
HAPPEN, WE'RE USUALLY THE

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.333
PEOPLE IN A RURAL AREA

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:54.200
THAT HAVE THE EQUIPMENT

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.633
THAT CAN GET THERE.

00:03:55.633 --> 00:03:59.633
FOUR-WHEEL DRIVES, ATVS, BOATS.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.700
SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT WE WOULD

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.166
PROBABLY BE THE FIRST ONES ON

00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:06.133
THE SCENE, AND THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:07.567
WOULD HELP US A LONG WAY AS FAR

00:04:07.567 --> 00:04:09.333
AS BEING ABLE TO USE OUR

00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:10.734
MANPOWER AND OUR EQUIPMENT IN

00:04:10.734 --> 00:04:13.233
THESE TYPE OF EMERGENCIES.

00:04:13.233 --> 00:04:17.233
(helicopter starts)

00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:23.066
&gt;&gt; 93-13 PARRIE HAYNES

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:24.533
&gt;&gt; SOME TEAMS GO IN BY AIR,

00:04:24.533 --> 00:04:26.967
BY HELICOPTER, SOME BY ATV,

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:30.233
BEGIN WORKING FOOT SEARCH GRIDS.

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:31.700
THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB OF

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.967
COVERING THE AREA AND DOING THE

00:04:32.967 --> 00:04:34.533
SEARCHES, THEY'RE PICKING UP

00:04:34.533 --> 00:04:36.600
ALL THE DEBRIS POINTS,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.133
SO WE'RE FINDING WHAT WE NEED

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:40.133
TO FIND OUT IN THE FIELD.

00:04:40.133 --> 00:04:41.133
&gt;&gt; AHA!

00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:42.333
WE HAVE SOMETHING.

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:43.567
&gt;&gt; COORDINATING SEARCHES

00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:44.667
WITH THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY

00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:45.700
IS GOING WELL

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.467
&gt;&gt; A BLUE BRIEFCASE

00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:49.000
&gt;&gt; ACCIDENT DEBRIS IS LOCATED,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.667
WHICH, IN A REAL SCENARIO

00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:51.400
MIGHT DETERMINE THE

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.900
CAUSE OF AN ACCIDENT

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.066
OR UNRAVEL A TERRORIST PLOT.

00:04:56.066 --> 00:04:56.867
&gt;&gt; WE'VE LOCATED A POSSIBLE

00:04:56.867 --> 00:04:58.133
EXPLOSIVE ORDINANCE DEVICE...

00:04:58.133 --> 00:04:59.266
&gt;&gt; BUT THE BIGGEST SUCCESS OF

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:01.000
TODAY'S DRILL MAY BE IN HOW

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.467
DIFFERENT GROUPS ARE COMING

00:05:02.467 --> 00:05:03.967
TOGETHER AND COORDINATING

00:05:03.967 --> 00:05:05.500
THEIR RESPONSE.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.200
&gt;&gt; TEAM Y HAS UNCOVERED

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.100
SOME HAZMAT MATERIAL.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.033
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING TO SEND

00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:09.567
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO SEE

00:05:09.567 --> 00:05:10.900
HOW HAZARDOUS IT IS.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.967
&gt;&gt; 10-4, WE'RE CLEAR.

00:05:11.967 --> 00:05:13.066
WE'LL HAVE A UNIT IN ROUTE.

00:05:13.066 --> 00:05:14.300
&gt;&gt; THE DRILL IS AMAZING HOW

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.500
MANY AGENCIES, TO GET US

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.233
ALL TOGETHER IT WOULD

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.433
HAVE TO HAPPEN THIS WAY.

00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:20.600
THE KNOWLEDGE FROM ONE GROUP

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.967
CAN SAVE ALL THE OTHER GROUPS.

00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:23.934
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF TIMES ONE AGENCY MAY

00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:25.400
NOT HAVE EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.166
BUT ANOTHER ONE MIGHT,

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:27.467
SO YOU CAN MINGLE TOGETHER

00:05:27.467 --> 00:05:28.367
AND YOU CAN GET IT ALL DONE.

00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:31.033
&gt;&gt; PC028, ENDED AT 10:48

00:05:31.033 --> 00:05:31.834
&gt;&gt; I THINK THIS TRAINING WILL

00:05:31.834 --> 00:05:33.834
REALLY BE USEFUL IN,

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:34.967
IN OUR CRIME SCENES

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:38.867
AND INVESTIGATIONS, LOST CHILD,

00:05:38.867 --> 00:05:39.934
ANYONE THAT'S MISSING.

00:05:39.934 --> 00:05:40.667
BASICALLY ANYTHING

00:05:40.667 --> 00:05:41.600
THAT WE'RE SEARCHING FOR,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.800
WE CAN USE THIS TRAINING.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.500
&gt;&gt; ABOUT 60 FEET THIS WAY

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.934
AND GOES BACK

00:05:46.934 --> 00:05:48.800
&gt;&gt; AS TEAMS WRAP UP A

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.533
LONG DAY OF SEARCHING,

00:05:49.533 --> 00:05:50.667
&gt;&gt; ALMOST THERE.

00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:51.433
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE STILL FINDING WAYS

00:05:51.433 --> 00:05:53.200
THAT GIS AND GPS WILL

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.600
HELP THEM IN THE FUTURE.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.433
&gt;&gt; IT'S TAKEN SOME TIME,

00:05:55.433 --> 00:05:56.467
BUT SOME OF THIS

00:05:56.467 --> 00:05:57.867
TECHNOLOGY IS AMAZING.

00:05:57.867 --> 00:05:59.533
&gt;&gt; THIS TECHNOLOGY MAKES OUR

00:05:59.533 --> 00:06:01.400
WORK MORE EFFICIENT,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.767
WHETHER IT'S WORKING A

00:06:02.767 --> 00:06:04.467
WILDLIFE CRIME OR WHETHER IT'S

00:06:04.467 --> 00:06:06.767
CONDUCTING SEARCH AND RESCUE,

00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:09.233
THE DRILL WAS A BIG SUCCESS.

00:06:09.233 --> 00:06:10.867
&gt;&gt; AND I'M LIKE, 'UH, IT'S

00:06:10.867 --> 00:06:12.233
WORKING NOW, NEVER MIND.'

00:06:12.233 --> 00:06:14.033
(laughs)

00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:14.900
&gt;&gt; AND AS TEXAS

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.767
GAME WARDENS KNOW...

00:06:15.767 --> 00:06:16.967
&gt;&gt; COME LOOK AT THE SCREEN

00:06:16.967 --> 00:06:17.600
&gt;&gt; ...YOU CAN ALWAYS HOPE

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.600
FOR THE BEST...

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.567
&gt;&gt; IT SHOWS THE EXACT TRAIL

00:06:19.567 --> 00:06:20.633
THAT THEY WALKED BACK AND FORTH

00:06:20.633 --> 00:06:21.767
THROUGH THE WHOLE GRID.

00:06:21.767 --> 00:06:22.700
&gt;&gt; ...BUT YOU ARE NOT TRULY

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.300
PREPARED UNTIL YOU CAN MAP

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.266
OUT A PLAN FOR THE WORST.

00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:28.200
&gt;&gt; THEY COVERED SOME GROUND!

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.667
WE DO A LOT OF TRAINING

00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:31.500
AND CERTAINLY YOU HOPE YOU

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.166
NEVER HAVE TO USE MOST OF IT,

00:06:33.166 --> 00:06:34.000
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.333
TIMES WHEN WE USE IT.

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:36.400
AND SO WE WANT TO BE PREPARED

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.667
IN THIS SAME SITUATION, BECAUSE

00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:40.500
IT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.667
TEXAS HOMELAND SECURITY.

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:45.233
I THINK THAT PEOPLE CAN REALIZE

00:06:45.233 --> 00:06:46.500
THAT THEY DO HAVE PEOPLE THAT

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.934
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS,

00:06:47.934 --> 00:06:49.767
ESPECIALLY IN THE RURAL AREAS,

00:06:49.767 --> 00:06:51.633
NOT JUST THE URBAN AREAS,

00:06:51.633 --> 00:06:52.567
AND THAT THERE WILL BE PEOPLE

00:06:52.567 --> 00:06:53.700
THAT CAN COME INTO THOSE RURAL

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.867
AREAS AND HELP THEM, WHETHER

00:06:55.867 --> 00:06:57.166
IT'S A TEXAS GAME WARDEN

00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:58.500
OR MANY OF THE OTHER AGENCIES,

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.667
WE'LL ALL BE THERE

00:06:59.667 --> 00:07:00.767
WORKING TOGETHER FOR THE

00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:03.233
PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS.
