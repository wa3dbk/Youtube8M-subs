00:00:05.525 --> 00:00:08.547
Researchers have known for decades
that meditation can improve someone's

00:00:08.547 --> 00:00:10.375
physical and mental health.

00:00:10.375 --> 00:00:14.476
It can relieve stress, lower blood pressure
and lift someone's mood.

00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:18.180
But only in the last few years have
neuroscientists taken a serious loook

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.347
at the changes in brain structure
underlying some of meditation's benefits.

00:00:22.347 --> 00:00:26.285
Like everything else we do, meditation
rewires our neural circuits.

00:00:26.285 --> 00:00:31.112
Pruning away the least used connections
and strengthening the ones we exercise most.

00:00:31.112 --> 00:00:35.829
Studies looking for signs of these changes
usually focus on "mindfulness meditation"

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.388
which challenges people to keep their 
attention fixed on the thoughts and

00:00:39.388 --> 00:00:41.769
sensations in the present moment.

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.354
Scientists aknowledge that these studies are small
and not ideally designed, but at this

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:51.111
point researchers have gathered enough
evidence to be confident that

00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:52.347
their findings are not just flukes.

00:00:52.347 --> 00:00:56.034
Experiments suggest that Buddhist monks
have really robust connections

00:00:56.034 --> 00:00:59.283
between scattered regions of their brains,
which allows for more

00:00:59.283 --> 00:01:01.113
synchronized communication.

00:01:01.113 --> 00:01:04.080
Expert meditators also seem to
develop an especially

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.976
wrinkly cortex: the brain's 
outer layer.

00:01:06.976 --> 00:01:10.943
We depend on the cortex for many
of our most sophisticated mental abilities

00:01:10.943 --> 00:01:13.840
like abstract thought
and introspection.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.771
Several studies have confirmed
that meditation can increase the

00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:20.511
volume and density of the
hippocampus: a seahorse- shaped area

00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:24.961
of the brain in the middle of the skull
that is absolutely crucial for memory.

00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:29.046
And although areas of the brain
responsible for sustaining attention

00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:33.176
usually shrink as we age, meditation
counteracts this decay.

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:36.187
An increasing number of studies show
that meditating for as little as

00:01:36.187 --> 00:01:40.744
12 to 20 minutes a day for several weeks
can sharpen the mind.

00:01:40.744 --> 00:01:44.813
In these studies, meditators have scored
higher on tests of attention

00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:47.978
and working memory, which is the
ability to temporarily

00:01:47.978 --> 00:01:50.919
store and manipulate information
in one's mind.

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:54.473
Some lifelong meditators in their
50s and 60s can even

00:01:54.473 --> 00:01:58.110
outperform twenty-somethings
in tests of visual attention.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.347
So if you're interested in trying
meditation, you should probably start

00:02:01.347 --> 00:02:02.700
as soon as possible.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.811
