00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.500
This historical drama from director Morten
Tyldum became the high-grossing independent

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.360
film of the year when it scored more than
eleven-times its $14-million dollar budget.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.240
Released in the UK on November 14, 2014, the
PG-13 rated film follows the true story of

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.410
mathematician and cryptanalyst Alan Turing
who tries to crack the German "enigma code"

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.550
during World War II.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.189
The 114-minute narrative bounces between parallel
timelines, one with Turing as a school boy,

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.029
and the other which sees him attempting to
solve the most daunting of math problems.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.800
The impeccable art direction and style, which
meticulously recreates these dual periods

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.010
scored "The Imitation Game" one of its eight
Oscar nominations.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.360
Impressively, even Turing's room-sized "computer"
is on full display.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.050
Hard to believe they make wrist-watches now
with more computing power.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.330
Benedict Cumberbatch portrays the awkward
smart-ass who is widely considered to be the

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.750
father of artificial intelligence and computer
science.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.510
The story of this man's short and complicated
life is extremely fascinating, especially

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.830
to Americans like myself who mayn't be all
that familiar with his accomplishments - many

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.690
of which remained classified secrets for decades.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.500
Turning may only be interested in the challenge
of decrypting codes, but it's the unlikely

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.070
obstacles and friends he meets along the way
that give this picture so much depth and interest.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.200
Cumberbatch's Oscar-nomination is equaled
by his female counterpart, Keira Knightley.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.160
When Benedict is feeling defeated, she echoes
his earlier advice back to him by reminding,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.920
"Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines
anything of who do the things that no one

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.920
can imagine."

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.250
This theme is repeated throughout the picture
with great results, driving home the importance

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:54.060
of individuality and self-worth.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.310
With many Oscar-recognized roles, there comes
a point in the performance that you can single-out

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.409
as the zenith of the actor's ability - and
a defensive monologue delivered late by Knightley

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.409
is such a scene.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.689
The beautiful Brit transcends the dialogue
in a powerful way.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.590
The adapted screenplay also offers us brief
glimpses of the actual war itself, to ensure

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.640
we don't forget what's really at stake here.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.230
Developing just below the surface throughout,
the issue of Turing's homosexuality takes

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.450
center stage late in the picture, as the movie
pivots from a dramatic bio-pic to a painful

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.730
reminder of England's homophobic past.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.760
While undeniably important, especially given
today's changing landscape regarding LGBT

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.430
culture - this shift in story feels a bit
jarring.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.730
Up until the 90-minute mark, the primary focus
was on code-breaking and defeating the Nazis.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.420
Slow pushes and steady close-ups fill the
wide-angle frame, while Alexandre Desplat's

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.170
piano-laden score provides an airy backdrop
to the more tense moments.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.470
Although this slower paced story may not be
the type of picture you ever rewatch, "The

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.090
Imitation Game" is a thoughtful and personal
account of an inspirational hero.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:03:01.459
And here's what you had to say about it in
the YouTube comments.

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.670
Despite complaints about the slower, formulaic
narrative, you loved the performances and

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.629
tragic story, rating this an EIGHT.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.400
I was definitely moved by the scope and importance
of this picture, which made me completely

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.250
respect and admire a man I knew little of
before watching.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.120
I thought it was AWESOME.
