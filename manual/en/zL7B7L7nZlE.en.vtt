fight

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.940
online hip

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.250
now it's everyone the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.019
uh... she is on a new program only channel
other

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.109
hitting terrible

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.299
uh... apparently not well

00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:23.230
and so there's a couple converses related
to this richard clip uh... one is

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.330
is this what's called can't hunting

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.900
where the adult cannot escape

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.539
uh... because

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:32.940
dear decade shot at

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.180
or moose are terrible

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.980
usually well

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.730
argue that doesn't seem to be the case here
we don't want to be just a yourself

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.300
and then uh... number two

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.870
he says they are not eating it or or using
it at all

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.030
absorbing the crater westerners argued it
is just as vicious as michael vick

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.000
program reasonable he called it a staff

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.800
which i i i thought was pretty

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.300
so now that i think i mean we should probably
watch it before we can

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.300
right this does receive cancellous take a
look and see piano

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.960
if you fixed

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.340

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.919
black congress will be happy when he didn't
get any animal because

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.999
use of land that is by my side and hunting

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:17.999
like cd deny this reducing and i learned something
unique artistic together week if that showed

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.300
that the pencils animal that could leave

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.850
why isn't there probably is a restricted

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.249
one how come they're whispering

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:28.470
an entity

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.089
future rifle shot pretend that if that's ok
that desperate gamble at all

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:36.709
bloomberg

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:40.169
west what do you bother to whisper and i just
like

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.479
there's at least lightweight with that's seven
shots they're like

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.220
why

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.919
that this is this is

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.129
i mean it's it's okay so what is that without
that we have a debate or not a that we're

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.979
now we're we're incomplete pay for stock

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.669
what you need a posse of dudes around do to
help you with your guy

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.149
because you don't collect all the time i don't
know if not that right

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:07.319
it she's you know if she's not salt

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:09.080
do you would it be a bit

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.209
uh... b should be know how to you know she
would know how to use the gone

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:18.349
properly you know i mean they'll all be data
already dot yes writing about that and i think

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.700
there is an automatically it you know if you're
at a hunting trip

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.789
you're making just look like that

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.840
actually perfectly ordinary and that is another
interesting ideas like camera shots right

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.300
because it was the t_v_ camera shot of ur
hands close-up which they might have taken

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.780
afterwards rate like alistair shot of you
with the rightful in medicare but then if

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.419
you notice there was also shot of the terrible

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.119
in the sites

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:44.709
so how do they get that shot

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:47.279
it's a terrible como

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.739
issue i'm sayin

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:52.539
basis at this point they got to get slaughtered

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.580
were still mean it's only one

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.860
now that we can now that i think about it
because there is there was that shot though

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.319
that actually getting

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:03.789
which looks to me like a pickup later and
so that would

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:06.460
mean more than one animal and now that i am

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.879
you know and working he talked about and now
with the idea that it's a staff wanted the

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:13.600
people don't think they should think scarier

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.959
i

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:20.400
i think it should be right that vicinity addison
crevices honey not for you know our

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.399
here's the thing

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:25.559
yet on an issue it's a teddy roosevelt fan

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:29.969
and here as well as a big game hunter and
he went to the you know after u_s_ president

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:31.340
to dance i mean he

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.030
he killed

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.830
the animals

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.539
uh... that could fight back

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:37.110
that could that could kill him

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.430
but he also

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:44.139
uh... portion dot yosemite you know he didn't
want it to rio in half

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:47.579
you know and that's what's so she's out there
all the time you know i'm in the wilderness

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:48.949
nine killing all these animals

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:54.300
but not in them and i want to jump into drill
all over it with her home in

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.059
the other server this possibility spotlight
being played

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:03.259
flatly said we could celebrate phillips anybody
anyone from anywhere and it's a lovely nine

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:06.370
dollars a month to the following actually
go to court

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.349
dot com slash tech

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:10.060
and anything from

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.600
never hurt anybody
