00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.100
Hi, this is Joelle Meijer.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.100
I am going to show you how to make a snake
from cardboard tubes.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.950
To make a snake with cardboard tubes, you
can use tubes from rolls of paper towels,

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.940
toilet paper or wrapping paper.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.849
The tubes must be flexible enough that you
can flatten

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:19.869
them.

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.900
Start by flattening one tube and place the
pattern on the flattened tube.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.109
Trace the pattern onto the tube with a pencil.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.389
Each end is rounded to be able to

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:31.389
articulate the snake.

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:36.039
The length of your snake will depend on how
many tube sections

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:37.609
you use.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.130
If you can find a tube a little wider in diameter
for the head, use it to

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.430
show that the head is a little wider than
the rest of the body.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.430
But that is not

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.280
absolutely necessary to create your snake.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.519
To create a tail, you can use a longer

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.020
tube with on one side a rounded edge like
the other sections of the snake but on the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.050
other side a pointy end.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.140
Glue the two layers of the tip of the tail
together with

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.070
white glue and hold in place with clothespins.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.820
Then paint the different sections

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.100
from the head to the tail in colours of your
choice.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.440
In nature, you will find all

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.810
kinds of colours for snakes so you can take
your inspiration from a real snake

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.200
or you can paint it more whimsical colours!

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.240
I chose to paint my snake in a rather

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.460
reddish brown and I added texture using two
colours: dark brown and ocher dabbed with

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.110
a marine sponge.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.030
When the paint is dry, add a coat of acrylic
varnish on each section

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.280
to better bring out the colours of the snake.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.000
Paint the inside of the tube that forms

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.950
the head in red to create the mouth.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.210
To build your snake, start with the sections

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.060
that represents the head on one hand and the
body in the other hand.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.060
Partially tuck

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.170
the body section inside the rear of the head.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.189
With small sharp scissors, make a hole

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.270
through the 4 layers of cardboard.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.170
Use a brass fastener and go through the 4
layers of

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.310
cardboard.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.280
Spread the legs of the fastener on the side
that will become the bottom of

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.390
the snake.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.890
Continue this by adding one section at a time
to the body.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.140
And to finish,

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.300
attach the tail in the same way as the other
sections.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.750
Always put the new piece into

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.050
the last, so that the same side of each section
is always on top.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.050
On the red

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.190
construction paper, trace and cut the snake's
tongue.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.190
Then glue it in the mouth with

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.390
the glue gun or white glue.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.040
You can paint the eyes on top of the head
or use

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.120
googly eyes.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.250
And voila, you have your finished snake that
you can articulate as you

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.870
wish!
