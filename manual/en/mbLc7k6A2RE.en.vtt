This is the view atop Mill Mountain which
is just east of Roanoke. Even on this cloudy

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:23.760
day, you can see that the view is stunning.
Coming into the here scene is downtown Roanoke.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:33.149
And justÊBeyond those hills is Blacksburg,
home of Virginia Tech. Now if I turn around,

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.609
you can see the giant star that sits atop
Mill Mountain. It's the largest man-made star

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:49.089
in the world. But enough ofÊthis introduction.
On to the featured presentation.

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:56.019
While I was here I thought I'd show you how
my new bicycle unfolds. It's something which

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:17.110
I hope to take with me all over the place
and this is my first time to use it on a trip.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:40.740
So, here we go.ÊThe main part of the frame
is unfolded. Handlebars. The seat and now

00:01:40.740 --> 00:02:01.570
the peddles. And I'm rearing to go. See ya!
