Hello everybody
In this video I'd like to show you my latest

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.000
geeky project,
which is a module to control my Linux desktop

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.340
using my hands
and this is actually the source code

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.340
It's written in Python and it makes use of
this... this device here

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.890
this little thing called the Leap Motion
which is actually a very, very nice gadget

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.950
and what it does is it recognizes the movement
of your hand in three dimensions

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.950
and it translates them into events that you
can then read with the API that it ships with

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.360
I'm going to turn on this flashy mouse so
that you can see the movement of the mouse

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.570
pointer
on the screen

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.570
I'm sorry if it's a little distracting but
I think we need that

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:12.659
So, what I found when I got the Leap Motion
is that it doesn't come with any software

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.659
for Linux
which I thought was very disappointing

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.939
and even for Windows it doesn't have a proper
desktop navigation system

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.749
which is, I think, the first thing that you
would do with a device like this

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:26.249
you would like to control your desktop with
it

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:33.249
And so I've been working on using the API
to come up with something like that

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:40.670
So, as you can see some of the basic things
that I can do here is

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.459
I can move the mouse pointer
I can grab windows and move those windows

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:52.799
around
I can have this window here, I can move my

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.990
pointer
I could even make clicks by moving my finger

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.990
towards the screen
but that's not really very convenient

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:10.789
So I can grab a window
oops, I have to have my hand horizontal like

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.379
this
I can grab a window and throw it away

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.730
And that would mean it gets minimized
but it's in debug mode right now

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.739
so it is minimized and then it's thrown back
in the screen

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.870
it's something that I implemented that way
in debug mode

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.870
So we can go to another window
And so it is very sensitive

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.079
it's pretty accurate
And we can do, there's a lot of things you

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:55.519
can do with it
it recognizes lots of gestures and things

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.920
like that
The Python API is very good, you get all the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.040
information there
So it's relatively easy to write applications

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.239
for it
Oops, sometimes it takes a bit of practice

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:16.079
to get used to this new way of doing things
Another thing that you can do with your module

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:16.620
is
you can bring up the desktop by putting your

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.620
hand like this
go to any window that you'd like to open

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:33.030
and then as you have already seen
I can do rotations of my hand

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:42.349
to switch desktops and things like that
You have to be a little careful because I've

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.680
seen that
it uses infrared light from your hand and it

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.909
can get confused
if there's a lot of infrared background in

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.530
the environment
Right now this is not a very good location

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.280
because I have it set right next to my laptop
fan

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.280
so it's getting a lot of hot air blown right
into the device

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:17.049
But still, as you can see, it's pretty accurate
It recognizes well the movement of my hand

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.820
and things like that
So well, that's basically it

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.950
This is a very experimental module still
There's a lot of very nice things that you

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.030
can do
You can conceive with this device

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.900
You can conceive an interface kind of like
the ones we see

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.670
in science fiction movies like Minority Report
and things like that

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:44.670
where you can grab a window and then toss
it away

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.050
That sort of things
So I think that's it

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.800
I've been working on this for a couple of
days

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.470
And I think it has a lot of potential
This is basically, what I've done here is

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.140
a quick and dirty hack
It's not the smartest way of doing things

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:16.050
I've been using the xdotool to translate these
hand events

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.630
into simulated keypresses that are sent to
the X server

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.130
But I'm sure there's much more efficient ways
to do it

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.900
So I'm really looking forward to other applications
that people will do

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.550
I think it would be very nice to have a _real_
three dimensional desktop

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:43.550
where you can have windows with depth
and you can basically grab a window that is

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.120
further down
and pull it up and bring it up

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.640
That sort of things
I think that's the future of this kind of

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.720
interfaces
Well, that's basically it

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.520
I hope you liked it and thanks for watching
