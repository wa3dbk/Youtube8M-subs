00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:04.466
They are sexy and lovely on stage

00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:07.700
but they completely change off the stage!

00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.466
Isn't it better for you to give in?

00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.766
Of course.

00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:14.866
But you shouldn't be so childish!

00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.866
I am who I am and you are who you are!

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.066
So just give in!

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.466
I am still older than you.

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.500
Not only are they very talkative.

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.266
They are also very naughty.

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:33.200
Are you sure you are all girls?

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:38.100
We are powerful on stage and very manly off the stage...

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.033
We were a boy group!

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.300
Then!

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:43.766
Why do you say that?

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.166
Ah, because of you?

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.300
Woah, calm down!

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.733
4minute hesitates to answer Q-mera's questions.

00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.133
That's why we prepared this!

00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.700
We will observe 4minute's day!

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.133
Hello.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.133
Who are you?

00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:08.033
I am the youngest member of 4minute, So-hyun.

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:11.200
I want strawberries.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.333
I am going to film 4minute in the waiting room today.

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.466
Dancing to the ringtone.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.400
This is so funny.

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:26.900
This is so funny.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.833
Yo, sexy! Sexy...

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.266
The mole on her leg is so sexy!

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.433
No, she's very manly!

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:40.333
Manly and cute!

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.133
What's the difference between being sexy and manly?

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.833
Sexy is being sexy...

00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:45.433
Being manly is... Being manly!

00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:49.833
Stop.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.233
Are they done fooling around now?

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:53.133
Do the "Cheon Song-yi" thing!

00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:55.600
She's better at it than I am.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.100
She's good.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.500
I am going to die.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.766
Oh, do it again! Again!

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:01.833
From the beginning!

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:03.300
I am sorry.

00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:06.066
She's Hyun Song-yi.

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:07.000
She's so good.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.733
Hyun Song-yi is rapping now, "song"!

00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:10.533
Hong! Hong! Hong!

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:11.733
No, it should be "song".
