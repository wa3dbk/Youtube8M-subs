00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.380
Sure, we've had shooters before on the App
Store and they've been received with mixed

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.820
amounts of love and hate. Some of the best
have gone on to become shrines of multiplayer

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.340
fun, but the single-player experience has
often been lacking as you're left with the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.810
usual draw-by-numbers war-torn battlefield
formula. SHADOWGUN by MADFINGER Games, better

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.960
known for their Samurai series have busted
out with a gorgeous cover-based shooter in

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.059
an attempt to break this routine.

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.560
Sadly it stumbles from the get-go as players
are thrown in to a story and environment that

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.010
bears more than a striking resemblance to
that of the seminal classic Quake 2. From

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.000
this point the game strays in to a thin plot
surrounding the god-delusions of a mad scientist

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.850
and his army of genetic mutants, but they're
no match for beefcake John Slade, "Shadowgun"

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.079
for hire.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.239
Thankfully the compensation for a mindless
plot is suitably vicious gameplay that pits

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.860
you against AI that wanders between cover
(albeit with predictability) while you dispense

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.091
bullet and explosive-filled justice to any
man, mutant or machine that stands in your

00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:09.759
way. Slade will stick to various surfaces
automatically, providing adequate cover from

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.979
incoming volleys of death, with a simple tap
forward or backward allowing you to jump over

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:14.979
or continue on your way.

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.030
Although there's only one set of controls
available, several customization options including

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.259
the ability to rearrange the screen makes
the most of the virtual-stick and swipe system

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.740
on offer. What's far less appealing is the
weapon-swap system that's difficult enough

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.411
to use in the heat of battle without it also
making you pause for a second or two. It may

00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:37.840
not sound like much, but when faced with multiple
opponents, the instinct to swap to a better

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.119
weapon (or otherwise running out of ammunition)
can be deadly mistake.

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.860
With 10 levels under its belt, multiple boss
fights and a few unlockables for the OCD gamers

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.210
out there, SHADOWGUN makes for a fun evening
of solid shooter gameplay. It's not perfect,

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.670
but that only means we can look forward to
bigger and better things in the future.
