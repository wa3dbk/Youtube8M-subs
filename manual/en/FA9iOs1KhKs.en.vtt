00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:02.889
DONNIE: Please. I see you have some stuff
from Pikeur out. Why don't you walk us through

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:03.549
what you brought.

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:09.000
RENEE: Ok. We added Pikeur to our fall catalog
and have had a really great response and a

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.940
lot of great feedback. One of our most popular
items is the Pikeur Tooled Belt. It is great

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.100
with jeans or breeches and is actually one
of the favorites of Becky, the founder of

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.400
SmartPak. She wears this all the time.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.910
DONNIE: So you've undoubtedly just doubled
Pikeur sales in that belt by mentioning that.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.070
RENEE: Totally intentional.
DONNIE: Absolutely.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.079
RENEE: Next we have the Pikeur Ciara breeches,
which are knee patch.

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:39.160
They are very popular with hunter/jumper riders.
They have a Euro seam, which is a self seam

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.360
around the back, which makes for a very flattering
shape.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.079
This is the color 'Safari' which is

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.670
very popular in the hunter ring. Some people
are confused which is the right color for

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.510
the ring, and Safari is the best one and we
have this color here for you at SmartPak.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.280
DONNIE: Excellent. And it's in stock for the
holidays, too, which I think is a nice thing.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.399
We have pretty deep stock in all this stuff
so that there's no chance we're going to run

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.499
out before the holiday season.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.180
RENEE: Nope, ready to ship.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.680
Next item is the Pikeur Lugana breeches. These
are full seat. Very traditional, popular,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.490
tried-and-true favorite. They are full seat
with a synthetic seat which makes them machine

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.190
washable, which is really easy to care for.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.910
DONNIE: Oh that's excellent.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.930
RENEE: Yes. We also brought a couple of coats
that we'd like to show you.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.880
DONNIE: Hello, ladies.
So what do we have here, Renee?

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.780
RENEE: This is the Pikeur Ghia jacket. This
is for the hunter/jumper ring. The jumper

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.240
ring or eventers have been using it. It's
a soft shell jacket, which is really stretchy

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.920
and comfortable. It is great in the saddle,
because you have tons of movement and no restriction.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.270
It also has a mesh lining, which makes it
really comfortable and breathable when you're

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.740
in the saddle, so you don't get too hot.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.369
DONNIE: Oh, that's excellent.
RENEE: Yes.

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.270
The next is the Pikeur Diana jacket. This
is a very traditional Dressage coat for use

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.170
in Dressage or actually Eventers can use it.
It's very nice shape, formed silhouette, and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.150
a longer drop so it's very flattering. So
these are two of our best-selling coats from

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.609
Pikeur.

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.180
DONNIE: You've really picked some great stuff
from Pikeur this year. We're really excited,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.349
huh?

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.159
RENEE: Thank you, so are we. It's been a lot
of fun.
