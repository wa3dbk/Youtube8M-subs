00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:33.280
Yeah, so I didn’t feel like bringing in
my massive collection of Final Fantasy titles

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.059
for the opening shot like I did the LAST time
I played a Theatrhythm game.

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:38.059
Deal with it.

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.190
I had better things to do, and by better things
I mean playing this freakin’ game.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.070
You think you enjoyed a nostalgiafest last
time, buddy, just hold onto your chocobo because

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.940
things are about to get crazy.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.170
Almost like a… wait for it…

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.769
CRAZY CHOCOBO.

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.520
I’d be going off the rails, too.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.460
Sure, the original Curtain Call wasn’t for
everyone; there were only three basic game

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.229
modes, three basic song modes, and some collectible
stuff.

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.189
And even then, unlocking things was a right
chore.

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.329
In Curtain Call, though, Square Enix have
just taken every knob, dial, and turny-button-thing

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:21.270
up to 11… or 14, rather, since this is apparently
the point at which that game can be spoken

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.079
of without fear of reprisal.

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.920
Y’shtola gets some love, and tracks like
Under the Weight bring the rock.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.920
Get it?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.200
‘Cuz it’s what plays when you fight Titan.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.820
Oh, I kill me.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.970
The tracklist has expanded, from three songs
per game to as many as they feel like jamming

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.799
in; from the two meager offerings from Mystic
Quest to IX and X’s 14 apiece.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:45.799
What’s that?

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.150
Yeah, that’s right, I said Mystic Quest.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.560
I’ll also say Tactics and Crystal Chronicles,
if you give me the time to do so.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.920
And all the offshoots of VII, and all three
XIIIs, and exclusive tracks from both Dissidias,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.280
and we’re not even getting into the DLC
which threw all caution to the wind.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.460
You want a Mi’qote White Mage trottin’
through Shibuya?

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.720
Here’s a Mi’qote White Mage trottin’
through Shibuya.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.680
Sure, the game says “Final Fantasy” on
it, and all the on-cart music is in fact from

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.860
Final Fantasy, but Square’s not above pinging
you a buck a track if you want to diversify

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.709
into some other staples of the RPG genre.

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.060
You want The World Ends With You?

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.060
Have a couple tracks.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.230
How about Xenogears, that’s on there.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.230
Bravely Default?

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.230
Yep.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.230
Chrono Trigger, too.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.400
Various Romancing SaGa tracks, a few pieces
from the Mana series - even including one

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.209
from Seiken Densetsu 3, and they’ve been
trying to disavow knowledge of that for decades

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.209
now.

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.209
That’s not stopping ‘em.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.550
Hell, you’ve got three playable characters
and several tracks from Final Fantasy Misspelling…

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.239
I mean, Final Fantasy Type-0, and that’s
only recently been announced for Western shores.

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.260
Theatrhythm don’t give the slightest damn.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.879
There’s awesome music to be had.

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:59.190
The gameplay is largely unchanged from the
original, save for the addition of Critical

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.070
Triggers that either do more damage in battle
or can drop bonus items in field and event

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.349
scenes should you hit them square on the nose.

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.239
The Chaos Shrine battles, though, have been
replaced by a new Quest Medley mode, where

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.709
you get to pilot your team of classic Final
Fantasy heroes across an overworld and a dungeon,

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.030
knocking down bosses, unlocking doors, racking
up EXP and tinkering with your team’s skills

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.860
loadout as you go.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.610
Each map offers chances at those shards what
unlock more playable characters - though this

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.530
time, you’re offered your choice from a
lineup of a half-dozen or so each time you

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.959
collect the requisite number of gems.

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.970
If you’ve got a particularly bountiful map
- or you just love that it ends with Battle

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.120
on the Big Bridge and want to share the FFV
love - you can pin it to your ProfiCard to

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.960
be shared with your StreetPass connections…
or the combatants you face in the PvP mode.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:48.050
Oh yes, there’s a PvP mode.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.380
Perhaps one of the most glaring flaws of the
original Theatrhythm is that there wasn’t

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.659
much interaction besides sharing your Dark
Notes.

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.319
Here… heh, that all goes out the window.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.720
You’ve got head-to-head options against
increasingly difficult AI opponents, local

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.189
opponents, or online foes, which you can restrict
to domestic or international challengers.

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.780
Because the meaning of Final Fantasy Fandom
is beating up some unfortunate named Hana

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.230
with Team Heroine’s Holdfast right here.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.010
Ladies of Vana’diel, represent.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.710
You’ve got your choice of a straight score
attack, or you can allow for game-changing

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.240
EX bursts which increase your opponent’s
difficulty by tightening their window for

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.130
hitting notes or screwing with their display.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.370
It certainly adds a level of difficulty, but
I feel they can get a little overwhelming,

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.640
especially since you can’t really control
which attacks you use against your opponent.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.310
And it seems like they always use Monster
Boost or Mystery Triggers, preventing you

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.460
from figuring out which way to slide your
stylus.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.340
And then the monsters jump down your throat.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.291
Hell, even the card-collection system returns,
with its three grades of rarity for each of

00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:45.590
the characters, foes, and classic monsters.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.980
But unlike last time, when they were just
pretty pieces of cardboard, Curtain Call allows

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.990
you to burn these cards for permanent stat
boosts to your combatants, with bonuses to

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.930
success rate and critical rate for matching
like cards, like titles, or like categories.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.250
Really, the only thing you’re missing from
the previous version are a couple of the Event

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.620
videos, since every track from the original
Theatrhythm - and every DLC track, for that

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.750
matter - is available pretty much right away.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.070
Well, except the one outlying song from Final
Fantasy Versus XIII, because that doesn’t

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.040
exist anymore.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.560
Awkward…

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.080
Anyway.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.640
Yeah, it’s largely a bunch of cutesy graphics
laid overtop of a recycled set of game mechanics

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.660
and the music from a number of other games.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.950
And I wouldn’t have it any other way.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.080
Sure, you don’t get the inter-character
interactions, that’s Dissidia’s thing.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.440
But what you do get is over two hundred of
the best tracks in the history of video gaming,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.750
a healthy challenge, several dozen iconic
characters to level up, and, oh yeah, once

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.530
you unlock songs in the music player you can
wire your 3DS into your car’s stereo and

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.840
jam out to the FFVII motorcycle chase theme
as you speed down the interstate.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.770
I may speak from experience.
