Hello, welcome to G's España group's spring onion 
pack house in Agost. Come in. 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.520
Hello, I'm Emilio Payá, I'm Spring Onion production manager for G's España Group. 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.120
Follow me and I will show you our crops.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
My job is to get an excellent quality product,
from the selection of seed, later transplanting to harvesting

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and arrival of the spring onion to 
the pack houses for sale.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.200
I'm Manola Ojea and I'm Agost's pack house supervisor.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.380
I've been more than 20 years in this company 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
My job consists of making sure that 
each client is satisfied.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Our spring onion is all homogeneous, but it has different cuts: 
short, long, with or without root. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.560
We adapt it to suit everybody. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Each team I have knows perfectly what to do,
 but I supervise their job so everything is perfect. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.440
What makes us different? We have been working for 
50 years on Spring Onion 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.040
and I think experience is unique.
