00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.899
today I'm going to address a growing
misconception in the world of computers

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.749
and that is how much memory of you
actually need in a modern computer?

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:11.590
in order to address that i'm going to
start by explaining

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.039
how it is different from storage

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.090
and then i'm gonna explained for memory
actually does

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.260
and finally some real life tests showing what
differences you can expect with

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.859
different amounts of memory

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.039
in order to clear things up I need to
roll the clock back in 1982

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.939
here's a commodore 64 computer.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.400
which has 64KB of ram

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.230
if you open the computer you can see
the memory chips right here

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.900
but there's no internal storage device

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.710
if you want to use any sort of software
you needed an external storage device.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.260
some examples of the this cassette drive
that you could load and save programs and

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.340
data to

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.130
Or, you could use this disk drive.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.640
Now, over time memory and storage devices have improved a lot

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.570
in the 1980's we measured
memory capacity in kilobytes

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.010
then the 1990's we measured
in megabytes

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.590
and today we measuring gigabytes

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.970
as for storage

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.470
we moved to other types of floppy disks

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.090
and then hard drives

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.690
compact disc, dvd

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.610
and now flash memory

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.530
Take this USB flash drive or this memory
card for camera

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.540
both of them use flash memory and even
though we call this flash memory is

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.870
still not really computer memory in the
traditional sense

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.830
it still only used for storage, data, and
software

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.920
The problem we've run into with
these modern devices such as the ipad

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.610
or the iphone, the amount of memory
is no longer advertise the consumer

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.650
nobody cares anymore

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.910
some all they advertise is the amount
of storage.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.640
it's just so happens that the storage is
flash memory, but make no mistake 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.180
an iPad still has traditional memory inside, as well as flash memory.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.360
the truth is,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.160
this original iPad has 256MB of memory.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.150
but it has 16GB of storage.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.349
and that's all well good for an iPad or iPhone,

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.779
But the problem is when people try to look at a laptop.

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:14.699
they see a laptop advertised with 2GB of memory and i think wow

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:19.249
that's not much because my iPad has
16 GB

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:20.430
the problem is

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.489
that with the iPad you are looking at storage capacity, and with the laptop

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.139
computer you're looking at actual memory

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.650
so this is created many uncomfortable
conversation swith my customers when they

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.550
come to me

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.059
wanting a computer with the most memory possible

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:39.259
because they have "lots of photos" or "lots of music" they want to store on their computers.

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:40.859
So lets be absolutely clear here.

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.079
let's look inside of a mac book

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.979
Here are the memory chips

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:46.879
this is not used for storage

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.609
none of your photos from music will be
stored there

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.120
This is your hard drive.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.149
this is the storage device.

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:59.859
in this particular case the hard drive is 60 GB

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.049
this is where all of your music, photos, and documents will be stored.

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.010
and when the proper members are compared
you'll see the laptop has not only a heck

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.099
of a lot more memory than the iPad,

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.519
but it has a lot more storage too!

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.059
So what IS the benefit of having extra memory in your computer?

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:19.710
The memory is there to help the processor do work.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.109
let me explain.

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.659
Let's say your job as a human

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.349
is to take this piece of paper and copy
all of these numbers from one page to

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.439
another using a pen

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.589
you'll need to look at the numbers and
remember as many as you can

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:33.379
then write them down

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.169
the speed at which you can perform this
job be dependent upon two factors.

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.599
One is how fast can you write?

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.309
Another is how much can you remember?

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:46.609
imagine how much faster and to perform
this task if you could simply look down

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.479
at the page one time,

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.919
and remember the entire document.

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.939
adding more memory could actually double
the speed at which you could perform

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:58.720
this task. But, here's the catch a lot of
people don't understand. And that is

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.210
at a certain point adding more memory becomes futile and no longer helps the

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.120
computer at all.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.559
even if i could remember hundreds of
pages of numbers at a time

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:11.529
i'm still not going to be able to work
noticeably faster than i could remember

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:13.659
one full sheet at a time.

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.150
at this point the main thing slowing me
down is my writing speed

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.449
and so it works pretty similar with computers.  If you don't have enough memory

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.669
then adding more memory can drastically
speed up the computer, but once you have the

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.210
right amout, adding more memory will do absolutely nothing for your computer in which

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.460
case, it is just a waste of money

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.769
so that of course begs the question, how much
is the right amount of memory to have in your computer?

00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:41.239
well there's really not one specific
answer to that is really not the

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:45.319
computer that uses the memory, its actually
the software that you're using the

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.690
that determines how much memory that you need.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.050
so even if two people had absolutely identical computers, but one person is running a 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.009
different set of software on the
computer they may need a different amount of memory

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:56.999
from another person.

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:02.119
so i'm going to attempt to do some
real-life test scenarios here to show

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:05.429
you what types of software do and don't need
extra memory.
