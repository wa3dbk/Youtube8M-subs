00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.629
Hey guys we're here at Anime Expo 2015.

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.300
We're seeing everything from celebrities to
fantastic cosplays from Anime, video games,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.000
and even the Marvel and DC Universe.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.280
Lets check it out.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.920
I don't think that I'm really much of a Naruto
fan.

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:27.939
Oh really?

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.550
No I don't mean not like you're dressed as
Naruto or anything.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.550
No of course not.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.160
Why would I be dressed as Naruto?

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.740
Yeah I mean it's not like it's an Anime convention.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.920
Normally I have a sniper with me but I'm from
Atlanta and I couldn't fit it into my bag,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.219
but um I just usually do this awkward number.

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.490
They might have asked you some questions if
you tried to take a sniper on the plane.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.250
Do you guys think it's OK to pick up girls
in a dungeon?

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.000
That depends if she's a higher level than
me then yes because she can carry me through

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.880
the dungeon and I can score that loot.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.600
Don't pick up guys in the dungeon either.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.600
Definitely don't pick up guys in the dungeon.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.459
How is it ruling the world?

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:13.180
It's a really tough job because you got the
Black Knights to try to take my throne and

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.719
all those Freya bombs destroying cities but
hey it's all in a day's work.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.159
Hey guys I'm here with the girls from.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.709
. Love Live!

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:23.719
What are the names of your guys's characters?

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.439
I'm Ren.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.579
Macki.

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:27.719
Hanayo.

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:28.859
Kotori.

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:29.999
Niko.

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:31.139
Hanako.

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:32.279
Nosomi.

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:35.700
Did say Hanukkah?

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.509
Honkers, I get nervous I'm sorry.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.200
Charmie Sweets what are you dressed as today?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.920
I'm cosplaying Perona from One Piece.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.489
One Piece oh that's so cool!

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:47.090
Yeah I love One Piece.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.090
Perona's super cute.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.709
She's like a creepy little ghost princess.

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:51.709
Ghost Princess?

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:54.240
Yeah she has little zombie animals that she
makes have tea parties with her and make her

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.240
hot chocolate.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.240
She's the best, she's so funny.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.240
That's so creepy.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.989
I mean that's cool but that's really creepy.

00:01:58.989 --> 00:01:59.989
Yeah.

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:03.099
Oh my gosh he can't move at all.

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:04.099
I'm useless from the waist up.

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:05.319
I know you are.

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.539
Did you guys make your cosplays?

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:07.679
Did you buy pieces?

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.680
This one I made all of these and hers.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.700
Pretty much everything.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.700
Wow.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.700
I'm the man behind everything.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.700
That's so cool.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.760
I just flash my tits.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.680
People were just like why don't you do this
thing and this thing?

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.209
It's like I'm not pretty enough and then I'm
just flashing my body because (cooge?) is

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.219
just leg, hip, everything.

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.060
For the record that's not true.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.549
You're very beautiful.

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.240
See they think I'm beautiful.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.480
I said you were gorgeous.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.520
Hi you guys.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.510
I'm sorry you guys, I swear I'm gonna get
this.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.510
One more time.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.510
I know, you guys are distracting me.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.670
I'm so nervous.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.500
What made you guys want to come as sexy Diglett?

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.090
There was a picture on the internet depicting
what Dugtrio would look like from the neck

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.590
down and it's like muscular dudes and like
since this is what we basically do we thought

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.670
this would be the best thing to do.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.670
That's awesome.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.390
Well I definitely like your guys' cosplay.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.579
Do you think it's OK to pick up girls in a
dungeon?

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.630
What kind of dungeon?

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.060
I don't know, this is like a test.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.129
If I say yes it'll make me look like a bad
person.

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.660
If I say no it'll make me look like I'm lying.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.730
I mean if she's cute enough, yeah.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.739
Oh my gosh, it's smoking.

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.049
Can we see that again?

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.709
That's so cool.

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.040
That's awesome oh and it spins.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.040
This is amazing.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.700
They all spin.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.660
I'm geeking out right now.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.860
[inaudible]

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.379
That's a little scary.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.349
It's a little frightening.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.120
I was like I'm going to get creative with
the sexy no jutsu.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.060
Honestly, smart idea.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.320
And good for the weather too.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.680
This is a high tech costume.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.829
What are you from?

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:58.829
I'm from Phoenix.

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.340
Phoenix is that anime or games?

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.830
Oh I thought you meant where am I from like
where did I drive here from?

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.540
Phoenix, Arizona!

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.930
I'm from Gantz.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.029
It's a manga and an anime but the manga's
way better.

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:15.480
I have a gun like kinda like this at home
but it's you know it actually shoots real lasers.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.480
Oh wow.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.489
I'm jealous.

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.190
Yeah I almost destroyed a city once but I'm
working on that.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.471
Yeah, I mean they probably won't let you in
if you're gonna pose and accidentally destroy

00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:26.710
a wall or something.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.370
Yeah well I joined this guild called Fairy
Tails and you know they're really working

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.940
on my skills there on how to not destroy things.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.979
Uh you might want to learn where not to destroy
things from somewhere else.

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:37.979
Really?

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.599
I've heard they're the best wizards around.

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.889
Oh they are but they're also really good at
destroying stuff I hear.

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.090
Especially this one guy with like pink hair.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.310
Natsu!

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.100
I met him, the Salamander.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.050
Yeah he's a wild guy that one.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.440
Yeah he's I really look up to him he's like
my motivation.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.660
What cosplay is this from?

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.379
It's a Korean game.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.940
A mobile game called Critiqua.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.960
This is one of the characters.

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:15.590
I'm a cat acrobat and I usually have a huge
sword but it's at the booth over there.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.410
That's cool so you're like a game version
of catwoman?

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.490
Kind of yes.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.580
But more cutesy.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.460
Cute animals you come on my way I'll let you
make hot cocoa for me any day.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.300
So is she like a little girl or is she like
actually.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.800
She's like a grown woman.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.819
One Piece is known for their very vivacious
like curvy women so yeah she's definitely

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:39.280
like well endowed we'll say that.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.139
She's well endowed and she acts like a child
with her little.

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.250
Yeah yeah like a very spoiled bratty child.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.200
She pouts, she throws tantrums, she's the
best.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.320
But like I gotta be her, that's it.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.979
Her power is she has little ghosts, she's
a ghost woman, a spirit woman.

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.770
So she has little ghosts that, they're called
negative ghosts, and when they go through

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.699
people they make you just feel bad about yourself.

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.270
So somebody will be ready to fight her and
she'll just send a ghost through and they'll

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.620
be like I'm am literally less than the dirt
on the Earth.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.659
So like if she was to fight like Pac-Man who
do you think would win?

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:14.340
Oh shoot, Pac-Man would be a good one!

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.880
Well if he gets the big white dot she's probably
out of luck but if she can get to him before then.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.640
That's a good.

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:25.471
I think I don't know I'd really love to see
Pac-Man fight her.

00:06:25.471 --> 00:06:28.580
I'd love to see her in a little chibi form
like.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.250
With little ghost that's a really good idea.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.460
Did you make the whole thing yourself?

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.360
I did, I did.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.680
Lots of tears and sweat and blood into this
one.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.840
Some blood?

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.699
That's why the costume is so red.

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:46.259
It's because all of her blood stained the
fabric.

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.020
I gotta give a creepy look with that.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.050
I stained it myself.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.050
Creepy.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.610
Very creepy.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.300
What made you guys want to dress up from this
anime?

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.650
To show off.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.389
Did you guys have some sort of work out plan
before you came here?

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:05.490
Don't eat McDonalds.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.750
Yeah, a little bit of Wii fit and Zoomba.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.650
Wii Fit and Zoomba, avoid McDonalds.
