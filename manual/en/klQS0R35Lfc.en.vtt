♪♪

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.560
[typing]

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.240
Shareware games. They exist.
This is one of them.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.020
This is Aqua Man.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.280
And, great Neptune, no!
It is not THAT Aquaman. My apologies.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.480
This is Soleau Software's Aqua Man from 1993.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.340
It's yet another game by William Soleau.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.840
The other one that I've covered
at this point is Balloon Challenge.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.620
And you know, I really liked
their games back in the day.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.420
Well, at least some of them.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.340
Soleau released an absolute crapton of games

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.220
and a lot of strategy kind of logic games,
and this is one of them.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.860
So, with Aqua Man, you put in your name,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.300
you can choose a few options that
really don't make much of a difference,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.740
and you can select from twenty puzzles,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.120
at least, in this first shareware episode.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.240
And, yes, you can choose any of them at any time,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.300
which is nice if you want to skip around.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.860
The object of the game is to move
around and push these pipe links.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.460
And what you want to do, of course,
is get the two storage pumps connected

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.360
by these linked pipes,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.280
in order to get whatever the frick
this is to flow through the pipes.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.340
I always imagined that these were
sewer pipes and that was the ooze,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.060
and I was actually helping out
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.160
But I don't blame that on childlike imagination.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.840
I blame that on this game being kind of bland.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.180
You play Aqua Man, the little guy with
an aqua color, I guess– [chuckles]

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.380
I dunno why else he's called Aqua Man.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.800
I mean, this isn't water 
coming through these pipes.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.160
You just have an aqua color.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
I-I'm seriously just gonna go with
that for the reason behind his name.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.900
But anyway, you play the guy

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.860
and you just sort of float around
in this nebulous play space.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.780
You got things to navigate around like rocks,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.100
whirlpools,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.780
and these little blank pieces.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.440
And you gotta move the pipes
around so that they fit each other.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.740
Makes complete sense.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.520
Seems simple enough,
and it completely is.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.620
It's all logic. There's no timer,

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.700
there's no monsters,
there's nothing like that.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.460
The catch is once you push anything,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.160
it's gonna keep going until
it hits something and stops.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.440
There is at least one solution to each puzzle,

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.460
but some of them have multiple solutions.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.200
ALL of them can be screwed up
in an infinite number of ways.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.380
And that's what makes this
game kind of annoying to me.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.320
And if you've watched
many of my other videos,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.220
you know that I like
straight up logic games.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.680
And, you know,
this is one of them,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.540
and it's not bad or
anything like that, it's just

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.620
this kind of game for some reason

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.340
irritates me more than
it does intrigue me.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.720
It is completely up to
personal preference, though.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.580
So if you like this kind of logic, then,
you know, this isn't that bad, I suppose.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.920
And the game is free.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.600
Well, it's free if you
got the free version.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.540
There was also a registered
version of the first episode

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.600
which is the same frickin' thing,
just without nag screens, for $12.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.220
It was $18 for Episodes 1 and 2,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.780
and $24 for Episodes 1, 2 and 3.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.160
And each of these
episodes had 20 more levels,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.600
so there's a total
of 60 freaking levels

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.220
of completely overwhelming
logical irritation.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.200
I just never really liked
this one that much as kid.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.700
I don't like it much now.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.540
I don't know why I'm covering it.
I guess because it was on my mind,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.100
and I figured I would revisit it and see
if it really was as lame as I remember,

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.360
and, well, it kind of is.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.080
These four or five obstacles that
you run across in every single level

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.980
just gets insanely repetitious.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.940
Combine that with the fact that I just
don't have a lot of fun with this to begin with,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.480
and it's not the greatest thing ever.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.280
That said, it's a game from my childhood
and it's a game from Soleau Software,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.180
and for that reason, I think it's cool.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.920
Yes, it's kind of a stupid reason
and it's completely subjective

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.000
and that's not gonna
make you like it at all, but

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.980
if you'd like to check it out in DOSBox or something,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.200
you can click the link and
download it for free below this video.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.880
And that's it for this quickie LGR episode.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.620
As always, thanks for watching.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.900
Oh, yeah, and if you'd like more,
there's a bunch of links here. You can click them.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.040
There's other stuff that I do
that's much more in-depth

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.700
and they're on games that aren't so meh.
