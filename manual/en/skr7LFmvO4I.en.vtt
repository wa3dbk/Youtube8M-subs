this david beckham and she asked have
denied hackney josh josh welcome back to

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.960
the show just one day left on the didn't
act until membership including special

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.239
david packing dot com slash made one

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:16.230
arc airplane safer overweight passengers
i was reading about this because of an

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.439
interesting new york times article about
this

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.019
more than six decades ago the federal
standards for the strength of airplane

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.090
seats and seat belts were written

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.150
and government regulations were based on
everest passenger weight of a hundred

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.679
and seventy pounds

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.159
now the average man ways american and
weighs a hundred ninety four pounds of

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:39.179
the average woman one sixty five so some
scientists and engineers are really

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:41.160
raising questions both about

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.790
whether we are we need to reconsider

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.300
whether the kind of status quo airplane
seats and airplanes more generally are

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.029
safe

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:51.870
or overweight passengers what do you
think

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.420
do i think we should be read reassessing
this yeah

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.030
could hurt i guess

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.260
now there's a lot more to say about this
uh... when we actually look at

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.990
uh... changes to the regulations and
back in two thousand five the f_a_a_

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.130
changed the average passenger weights
that are used to calculate

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.080
uh... the way the the weight in the
airplane the men's weight was raised by

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.760
twenty five pounds two hundred pounds on
average and the women's weight was

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.980
raised by thirty four pounds to one
seven nine that the summer calculation

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.460
it even more in the winter when
travelers typically have have you close

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.710
possibly jackets with them as well so
that has been changed the problem is

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.730
that uh...

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.880
a number of engineers including

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.270
robert cells there

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.119
at the center for applied biomechanics
at the university of virginia is saying

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:41.599
that

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:45.200
if i have your person completely fills
the c_d_ itself forget about the way

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.700
calculation for the play more broadly

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.050
this it is not likely to be his intended
during a crash

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.000
this can apply to different things
number one this can apply to

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.610
uh... people sitting next thing i would
jason

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.220
through the overweight person

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.049
but also this kind of like to see it dot
usage because as we know

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.259
legally uh... you only need to have a
seatbelt extender if you can't buckle

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.249
your seatbelt for takeoff

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:14.349
but after take off all those times when
most people here the pilots say

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.099
finkelstein is off but you should keep
it uh... on wall your sitting that type

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.889
of thing

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.679
obese passengers are far less likely
both in in automobiles as well as in

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:27.269
airplanes to spend a lot less time with
their seatbelts fastened

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.990
which can then further the risk of of
injury to themselves and to others

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.439
in a crash

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:37.340
now the for the feedback from this
particularly from interest groups like

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.300
for example

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.120
the national association to advance fat
acceptance are saying that listen this

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.780
is just yet another way to criticize and
condemn people that are overweight and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.290
the reality is that if airlines just
address this everybody would benefit

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.820
possibly by creating

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.489
a couple of isles that have uh...
slightly more expensive seats

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.579
better wider and my thought is it's it's
called business class or first class and

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.540
that's exactly what the the group is
advocating sing these would be price

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.519
similar to business class seats

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.779
without already exists in my point of
view yeah i mean i can't think of

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:12.779
anything else that uh... airlines
themselves would be able to do

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:17.840
to uh... e to compensate for overweight
people i mean and they're certainly not

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.959
going to start ordering new planes that
have uh... would mean you plan to be a

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.469
seats new seats or new planes and the
reality is if you want to get sick city

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.649
finest if i might be narrow body
airplane

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:32.989
you want to get stick seats across with
an eye on the middle

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.819
simple math dictates how wide the seat
can be

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.309
and therefore if you reduce the number
of seats are going to start talking

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:42.980
business class prices which then i'm
discriminating price wise against

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.169
overweight people

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.839
same thing applies if you force them to
by to see a follow some would say

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:52.469
if u baaki by two seats then you pay for
two seats

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:53.250
um...

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.469
it's it's it's off

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:58.390
tough situation for rape people i mean
arm of the mindset that

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.850
people allow themselves to be that
overweight well that's a controversy

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.110
direct not everybody does your are now
you have here you have to ask that

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.639
question uh... when years when you're

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.909
debating whether or not they should be
paying more for airline seats and when

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.319
people to say about this time out of all
condition then you say what you need to

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.849
have some kind of dr

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.049
stating that right

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.349
uh... you know there's this really isn't
about waiting fat people i mean we we do

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.550
have what's the eyes the society

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.110
that is built around encouraging people
to increase consumption of everything

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.279
but that being said

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:31.449
there has to be some level of personal
responsibility at least in cases that

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.729
are not so-called medical cases but the
time how do you really distinguish in

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.229
the end

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.740
i don't know the deal i mean none

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.720
i would look at it like this when you go
to an amusement park you have to be a

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.220
certain height even if you're an adult

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.120
to get uncertain rides

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.990
and you can't be over a certain way

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.780
you can't be over certainly

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.419
and sometimes you have to be of a
certain way

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.300
to be a police officer in good standing
you have to have the minimally

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.599
physically fit

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:00.830
there's all sorts of things where you
need to just have certain physical

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.319
characteristics and there is
discrimination based on that if you call

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:07.650
an amusement park telling you can't go
in even though you're a forty-year-old

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.289
in good health but you're just one inch
shorter than the limit

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.309
i would say that you know if people
wanna fly an airplane they should do

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:16.080
things that

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.909
they should be in a physical state that
is safe for the rest of the passengers

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.800
certain now what about the argument
hinted to be made that was in the same

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.960
way the airplane has to accommodate
someone who is disabled in the form of

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.240
having uh...

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.740
i don't know

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.349
uh...

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:34.479
some kind of uh... diabetes that might
qualify you but there's a disabled

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:35.310
person

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.119
if you are you that the obesity is a
type of disability

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:43.460
you you all of a sudden can just say
listen you can either do it or you can

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.130
well i mean when you get into

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.980
disabilities that could

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.939
truly be something that someone has no
control over

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:52.170
anne when you have a debilitating
disease uh...

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.229
certainly something you have no control
over

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.229
so you could get have to ask the
question is your weight controllable

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.689
uh... i guess i would have to come down
for some time a doctor's note or or

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:05.419
statement confirming that you have no
control over it

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:06.689
all right sonya thoughts on that one
