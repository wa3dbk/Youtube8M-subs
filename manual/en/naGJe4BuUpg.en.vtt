00:00:05.136 --> 00:00:13.866
How much do we know about the Goths?

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:26.496
Those fortunate enough to keep at a sound distance from the historical discourse shall probably think of those numerous Bela Lugosi impersonators who live by their hairspray and their macabre aesthetics.

00:00:26.496 --> 00:00:57.046
Those who did devote some of their time to tearing through all the insurmountable dogma and inexplicable lacunae in place of vibrant ages and civilizations that one finds in history textbooks will doubtlessly think of Jordanes and Cassiodorus in this respect, and recollect the Goths to have been a group of Germanic tribes who swarmed Europe in the alleged 3rd century AD - and "alleged" is a key word here - to rape, pillage and terrorize.

00:00:57.046 --> 00:01:05.226
But how Germanic were they really, and when exactly have they been introduced to us as such?

00:01:05.226 --> 00:01:15.376
According to Anatoly Fomenko, one of the world's leading mathematicians, the Goths were Slavic through and through.

00:01:15.376 --> 00:01:28.716
This alone would fail to make a piece of sensational news - however, Fomenko redefines sensational telling us that the Gothic tribes were none other but the Biblical nations of Gog and Magog!

00:01:28.716 --> 00:01:38.506
That might sound like nonsense - after all, don't the Old Testament events date back to times immemorial?

00:01:38.506 --> 00:01:45.286
However, once you've delved into the long awaited English translation of Fomenko's History: "fiction or Science?"

00:01:45.286 --> 00:01:53.676
You shall very soon discover that official history is absolutely and completely without competition in terms of making nonsense sound like science.

00:01:53.676 --> 00:01:56.426
"History: Fiction or Science?"

00:01:56.426 --> 00:02:07.346
is a phenomenal and unprecedented scientific experiment since neither state-of-the-art methods of mathematical statistics nor astronomical data have ever been applied to history before.

00:02:07.346 --> 00:02:15.046
One would expect such a procedure to yield interesting results - but "interesting" doesn't remotely approach the results of Fomenko's research.

00:02:15.046 --> 00:02:29.576
Ancient and mediaeval history transform into a phantom, leaving us with a historical period of a single millennium to encompass everything from Jesus Christ (who is proved to have lived in the 11th century AD) to today.

00:02:29.576 --> 00:02:35.196
Definitely nonsense and positively impossible, you say?

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:53.056
Just wait till you get infected with the New Chronology meme, and mark our words - looking back at your vehement support of consensual history will be most embarrassing indeed!

00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:56.456
This book will change your entire perception of History forever!

00:02:56.456 --> 00:03:01.916
What if Ancient Rome, Greece and Egypt were invented during the Renaissance?

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:06.526
What if The Old Testament was a rendition of events of the Middle Ages?

00:03:06.526 --> 00:03:16.136
What if Jesus Christ was born in 1053 and crucified in 1086 AD?

00:03:16.136 --> 00:03:19.656
Sounds Unbelievable?

00:03:19.656 --> 00:03:25.196
Not after you've read "History: Fiction or Science?"

00:03:25.196 --> 00:03:34.736
by Anatoly Fomenko, the leading mathematician of our time.

00:03:34.736 --> 00:03:42.926
According to the official version of history, Russia remained under the political and military yoke of the Mongols for many centuries on end.

00:03:42.926 --> 00:03:57.226
The term "Mongol" is usually assumed to have always meant the same thing - however, this turns out to be incorrect; the modern interpretation is of a relatively recent origin.

00:03:57.226 --> 00:04:02.536
Bear in mind that Mongolia didn't exist as an independent state until the early 20th century!

00:04:02.536 --> 00:04:11.956
The word "Mongol" simply meant "Great One" - its association with the nomadic tribes hailing from the steppes north of China is a later invention.

00:04:11.956 --> 00:04:15.306
But why did it have to be invented?

00:04:15.306 --> 00:04:21.926
The reason is simple - the actual "Mongol conquerors of Russia" never existed.

00:04:21.926 --> 00:04:28.306
The yoke theory was created by the court historians of the new Russian dynasty - the Romanovs.

00:04:28.306 --> 00:04:50.016
It has served the end of justifying the Romanovs' claims for the throne and demonising their longtime adversaries - the Horde, or the professional Russian army, which remained fiercely loyal to the old Russian dynasty, deposed and finally destroyed by the Romanovs as a result of a conspiracy.

00:04:50.016 --> 00:05:00.836
The savage invaders and torturers of the Russian land that we read about in history textbooks were the protectors of the state in reality - and ethnic Slavs for the most part.

00:05:00.836 --> 00:05:11.156
Small wonder historians still cannot find a single trace of the mythical Mongol capital - no such capital ever existed anywhere near the Gobi Desert.

00:05:11.156 --> 00:05:13.176
History:" Fiction or Science?"

00:05:13.176 --> 00:05:16.786
is finally available in English.

00:05:16.786 --> 00:05:24.356
This book will change your entire perception of History forever!

00:05:24.356 --> 00:05:29.816
What if Ancient Rome, Greece and Egypt were invented during the Renaissance?

00:05:29.816 --> 00:05:34.416
What if The Old Testament was a rendition of events of the Middle Ages?

00:05:34.416 --> 00:05:40.266
What if Jesus Christ was born in 1053 and crucified in 1086 AD?

00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:41.236
Sounds Unbelievable?

00:05:41.236 --> 00:05:44.676
Not after you've read "History: Fiction or Science?"

00:05:44.676 --> 00:05:48.542
