00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.810
Today I'm gonna tell
you guys about an app

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.500
that you can use on your
iPad, or your tablet, or even

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.410
your iPhone, to turn it
into a whiteboard screen,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.530
that you can then record and
use as a part of your videos.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.678
That's coming up.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:16.181
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.181 --> 00:00:16.680
Hey, guys.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.660
My name is Tim Schmoyer.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.326
And it's Thursday,
which means it's time

00:00:19.326 --> 00:00:21.120
to do some YouTube
Q&amp;A with you guys.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.592
Felipe Cruz wrote and
asked this. "Hey, Tim.

00:00:23.592 --> 00:00:25.050
At the beginning
of your video, you

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.670
reference using a whiteboard.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.750
Seemed like an iPad or tablet.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.170
If so, what app did you use?"

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.050
Yeah, good question.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.500
I found it pretty helpful
in several of my videos here

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.260
to use kind of like a whiteboard
to draw something, illustrate

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.330
something, or kind of
using it as a teaching

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.170
tool to teach something
that's a little bit easier

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.270
with some visuals than it
would be for me to just

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.520
kind of animate the whole
thing on screen or something

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.020
like that.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.620
It's actually
really simple to do.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.050
All I do is pull up the app
called Paper on my iPad.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.320
And then I just simply
record my iPad screen

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.310
using a program on my
computer called AirServer.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.070
And the AirServer
program lets me simply

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.660
use the AirPlay
feature on my iPad

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.110
to mirror my iPad screen
on to my computer.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.530
Then I simply, in
AirServer, can just

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.360
click a little Record button,
and record it right there

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.480
on my computer.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.850
It saves it as a movie file.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.230
And then I take that movie
file, and then just import it

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.870
into my overall video
project, and then just kind

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.110
of edit it as necessary.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.690
I've already did a video that
goes into more detail about how

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.070
to record your iPad screen.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.025
So click right here.

00:01:24.025 --> 00:01:25.400
There's a link in
the description

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.940
below that will
take you to that.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.160
Kind of just start
walking through the step

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.005
by step process.

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.440
And I also put a link down
there to the Paper app

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.890
that I use on iPad.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.870
I'm sure there's many other
apps that you could use.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.570
And if you guys who
are watching this

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.600
have one that you would
suggest as really good,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.670
that's got like a
whiteboard type of a feel,

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.740
please talk about those
in the comments below.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.230
And I'll link those
up and mention them.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.290
So the rest of you
guys, if you're

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.910
looking for something
other than Paper--

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.284
maybe looking for something
that's free and maybe just as

00:01:50.284 --> 00:01:52.080
good, like-- I love Paper.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.809
I use it.

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:54.350
I totally think it's
worth the money.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.510
But maybe some of you guys are
on a little bit tighter budget.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.880
So check out the
comments down there,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.255
what other people
are suggesting.

00:01:59.255 --> 00:02:01.089
If using a whiteboard
in some of your videos

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:02.630
is something that
you would consider,

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.967
I'd love to hear how you
would use them in your videos,

00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:06.550
and how they might
be helpful for you.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.050
And the rest of you guys,
again, go down there

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.508
and look, if you're looking
for some ideas of how you might

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:11.970
incorporate this
into your content.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.152
So comments below.

00:02:13.152 --> 00:02:14.610
If this is your
first time, I would

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.140
love to have you subscribe.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.227
Every Thursday I do YouTube Q&amp;A
with you guys just like this.

00:02:19.227 --> 00:02:21.560
On Tuesday, we'll take a look
at some online video news,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.140
talk about the updates that
are happening to this platform

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.681
here on YouTube,
and the implications

00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:27.650
it has for us as creators.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.480
And then on Wednesday,
I just give you

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.960
guys some easy tips,
ideas, suggestions, advice,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.880
things like that-- all to
help you guys really spread

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.465
a message through your channels
to reach the people who

00:02:37.465 --> 00:02:39.460
need to hear what
you have to say.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.979
So thank you for letting
me be a part of that.

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:44.020
Subscribe, and I'll see
you guys again next week.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.570
