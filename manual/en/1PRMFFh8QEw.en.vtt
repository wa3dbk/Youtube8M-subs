Real Usage. Real Reviews. Mobile Reviews - eh.ca

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.429
hey its Aaron from Mobile Reviews - eh.ca

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.820
and today we're going to do the snow
test for the LifeProof Nuud iPad case for the

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.369
iPad Mini and the iPad Mini retina

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.480
so this is the case there's an iPad Mini

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.109
it's under the video camera as you can
tell I am filming the parallel parking

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.469
only sign so this is a live iPad

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.430
we're going to start filming and we've
got

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.590
a gala dressed up like an Eskimo she is
much colder than I am

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.440
she's waving so we've got snow

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.440
so we're gonna put this into snow so
that is an iPad Mini LifeProof Nuud iPad case

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.840
in snow the lake proof new case for the
iPad Mini is waterproof up to 6.6 feet

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.280
and it's also super now snow is a frozen
for mobile rain

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.720
release so if it's waterproof there's a
good chance to snow proof and

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.060
I am sure thats there is no problem

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.229
other than the fact that the camera gets

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.930
covered with snow all the time gonna
find a better way of dealing with

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.400
thats so you can kinda see again as put
at the bottom of the

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.630
the video I am so snow test

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.040
past number one um the next thing I'm
gonna do

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.049
I'm gonna go and shovel this little

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.970
Bank of snow with the nude case for the
iPad Mini

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.970
looks like it's protecting the

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.460
you know it's Megan it's no so it's not
gonna see

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.640
right into your case right away maybe if
we a

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.159
boiling some water Pro its notices the
cameras always get covered with snow

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.750
there you go what happens if I do this

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.569
up

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.610
so if you found this review in any way
shape or form useful

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.760
because you know it's really just no you
know it when it's so cold it's

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.349
kinda dry I don't know if that makes any
sense but

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.550
