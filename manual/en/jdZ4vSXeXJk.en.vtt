00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.080
Back in the 1940s, historian Rosamund Harding
noted the creative process of famous musicians

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.050
and writers involves habits of motion.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.860
Twain paced and dictated, Dickens walked and
thought, Goethe composed on horseback and

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.340
Mozart in the back of a carriage.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.550
Harding wrote “that state of mind is most
favourable to the birth of ideas.”

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.070
Recent research suggests that diverting our
attention could unlock our creativity.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.840
First, forget the whole idea that your right
hemisphere is creative and the left is logical.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.390
When you “use your imagination” you use
lots of different structures across your entire

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.330
brain.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.030
Research suggests the interaction of three
brain networks influences your creative thinking.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.280
The Executive Attention Network depends on
your working memory and is active when you’re

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.910
really focused on a task, like hard calculus
homework.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.640
The Imagination Network creates mental simulations
about future events and is active when you

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.110
consider other people’s thoughts or perspectives.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.440
And the Salience Network monitors your internal
consciousness and events that occur outside

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.550
your body, so it can direct your attention
to what’s most important.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.280
When all these networks are active, it can
actually diminish creative thinking.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.280
Reducing the activity of Executive Attention
Network-just a little-can boost our creativity.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.850
In one study a group of children with ADHD-Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder- and a group

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.300
without were given a series of tasks to test
their working memory.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.891
Researchers found the children without ADHD
had more activity in their Attention Network

00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:48.430
and less in their Imagination Network.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.120
Those with ADHD couldn’t deactivate their
Imagination Network to focus on the task and

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.250
overall, they had slower response times.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.780
Children and adults with ADHD have trouble
focusing their attention, but again and again

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.200
research shows they’re more creative because
their Imagination Network is really active.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.629
And focused attention has been shown to limit
spontaneity.

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:22.799
In another study jazz musicians gave an improvised
performance while they were inside a fMRI

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:23.799
machine.

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.349
When they spontaneously improvised, brain
structures involved in the Imagination Network

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.349
were more active.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.879
And when they played an over-learned musical
sequence, like a scale, the brain structures

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.739
of their Attention Network were more active--you
know, their working memory.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.489
So to get your creative juices flowing, be
spontaneous!

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.079
And if you’re not into jazz, try singing
in the shower.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.930
And be distracted!

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.409
Like Dickens and Goethe before you, pacing
or riding a horse could see your mind come

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.549
along and wander too.

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.430
