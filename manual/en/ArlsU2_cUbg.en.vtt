00:00:03.535 --> 00:00:07.748
- What book ?
- The one down your trousers.

00:00:07.832 --> 00:00:10.406
l don't have a book
down my trousers.

00:00:10.502 --> 00:00:12.459
Right.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:14.835
l tell you what.
Um, l'll call the police, and, um,

00:00:14.924 --> 00:00:18.708
if l'm wrong about the whole
"book down the trousers" scenario,

00:00:18.803 --> 00:00:20.213
l really apologize.

00:00:20.304 --> 00:00:25.678
Okay. What if... l did
have a book down my trousers ?

00:00:25.768 --> 00:00:28.603
Well, ideally,
when l went back to the desk,

00:00:28.688 --> 00:00:33.767
you'd remove the Cadogan Guide
to Bali from your trousers...

00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:37.064
and either wipe it
and put it back or buy it.

00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:39.529
l'll see you in a sec.

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:42.073
l'm sorry about that.

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:44.653
No, it's fine.

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:48.616
l was gonna steal one,
but now l've changed my mind.

00:00:48.711 --> 00:00:51.628
Oh, signed by the author, l see.

00:00:51.714 --> 00:00:54.039
Um, yeah, couldn't stop him.

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:57.004
lf you can find an unsigned one,
it's worth an absolute fortune.

00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:00.086
Excuse me.

00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:02.174
- Yes ?
- Can l have your autograph ?

00:01:02.267 --> 00:01:04.724
Uh, sure.

00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:10.522
- What's your name ?
- Rufus.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.232
What does it say ?

00:01:17.325 --> 00:01:22.368
That's my signature. And above it, it
says, "Dear Rufus, you belong in jail."

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.532
Good one.

00:01:26.293 --> 00:01:29.828
- Do you want my phone number ?
- Tempting.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.758
But... no.
Thank you.

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:39.510
l will take this one.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.056
Oh, right, right.
So, uh--

00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:46.189
Well, on second thoughts,
um, maybe it's not that bad after all.

00:01:46.274 --> 00:01:49.144
Actually, it's a sort
of a classic, really.

00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:52.819
None of those childish kebab stories
you find in so many books these days.

00:01:52.906 --> 00:01:54.816
And, um, l tell you what.

00:01:54.908 --> 00:01:56.866
l'll throw in
one of those for free.

00:01:56.952 --> 00:01:59.491
Useful for, uh, lighting fires,

00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:02.497
wrapping fish,
that sort of thing.

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:07.912
- Thanks.
- Pleasure.
