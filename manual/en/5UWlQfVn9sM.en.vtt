[Music]

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Local voices. Global change.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
For more than 30 years,  Internews has worked to

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
empower people around the world with information.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Here's why:

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
People need to know if their communities are safe.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
People need to know what their leaders are doing. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
(And leaders need to know people are watching.)

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
People need to know how to keep their families healthy.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
People need to know where their children can get a quality education.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The need for information is universal. But not everyone has access.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.500
And global news can’t cover the local issues that matter most. 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.500
But I can.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I’m a blogger. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I’m a DJ. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.500
I tweet. 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.500
I report. 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.500
I write. 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.500
I film.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I am a journalist.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.500
I fight for laws 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.000
that make it possible 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to demand the truth. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.500
I fight for laws 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.000
that make it possible 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
for all voices to be heard.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.500
In every country around the world, 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500
people like me make a choice – 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.000
to find the truth, 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to tell all sides of a story, 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to create space for debate. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Whether we have a bulletin board, 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.500
a megaphone, 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.500
a cell phone, 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.000
a radio tower, 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
or a video camera. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We talk to our neighbors.  

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We investigate the issues. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We find answers.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We are local voices. Making global change. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
What do you want to say?
