00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.840
 Hi, I am Tamir Linhart owner of Golden Boot Soccer and I am going to teach you

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.299
 today, how to score goals in soccer.

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.599
once we have  got into a scoring position

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.280
now it's time to learn

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.779
how to put the soccer ball in the back of the net.

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.369
i'm going to teach you first

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.569
how to shoot the ball with power

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:24.669
There are many ways of striking the ball, today I am going to focus really on the

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.650
most basic technique

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.710
of striking the ball

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.289
first

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.720
you want to push the ball in an angle

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.490
 You are going to run as fast as you can towards the ball

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.900
take a quick look at the goalkeeper and
see where they are

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.860
We want to place the non-kicking foot, right next to the ball and point

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.750
your toes towards 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.160
your target

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.140
 Your knee's got to

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.420
bend over

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.610
and now you want to take your

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.130
foot, your leg all the way up here

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.520
Once you get here

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.840
you want to swing your food

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.590
as fast as you can

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.460
to get

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.660
more power

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.590
Once you swing your foot forward

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.740
you want to punch your toes down 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.710
and lock your ankle

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.330
when you hit the ball

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.530
you want to hit it

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.130
in the middle of the ball, so you want to lift your toes, your foot up a little bit

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.620
make contact with the ball

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.480
and continue with your shot

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:26.480
all the way up follow-through

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.380
In order not to stop your follow through

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.710
you want to hop

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.360
with your opposite foot 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.360
and land

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.770
on your

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.210
kicking foot. 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.670
that's how you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.689
strike the ball

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.100
with power.   Again many other technique for finishing

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.990
