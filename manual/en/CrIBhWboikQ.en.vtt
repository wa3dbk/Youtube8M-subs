00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.430
a tumors is Charlie thank you haven't
seen any questions for this week's

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.569
legend accord cuny

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.090
and lot of the questions about what's
going on with coroner head

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.660
totally got a lot of problems to work
out just remember were barely halfway

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.510
through book for

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.890
so core has a little ways to go before
she find the right path

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.140
cover for spoilers if you not come upon
before but starting with questionable

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.670
one

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.670
Isabel ass do you think the news
American Bowl in step

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.080
will spread to Marco and Sammy no I
think that everyone's going to meet up

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.720
before that

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.000
I think the bowl in america gonna head
back to friendlier territory

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.470
whenever me lo iniki road in with the
sky by send us a court they took off

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.260
not sticking around out food so I think
that they're heading back to their

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.280
temple Island

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.600
I think it'll take Bowl in america
little bit longer to get back

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.829
but I don't think they're going to be
lost wondering around the Earth Kingdom

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:46.690
on their own

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.230
I think they will head back to Republic
City two questioner to

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.649
laura's ass what do you think the
computer was going to do to cora when

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:54.649
she had her trapped

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.360
I think he was totally gonna killer if
you member in the first episode from

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.280
book for when we first saw could be
right

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.100
going crazy with those metal bands Under
Armour shoes is capturing people even

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.409
though

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.119
metal can be made to be very sharp so
she could just killed all those bandits

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.170
it's hard to tell what could be his
plans are for the attorney general

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.450
the weapon she's replicating has the
power up in Avatar

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.149
art dark avatar depending on how you
look at it so coral be the only thing

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.270
able to fight that it's possible she has
some secret plan for core that we just

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.420
haven't learned yet

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.859
question number three Nick ask do you
think the coup beer is like in Avatar

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:28.659
universe version of Hitler

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.709
I didn't think she's a passes so I would
say yeah plus if you look at a lot over

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:33.349
troops

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:36.439
visually they're inspired by a lot of
the Nazi stormtroopers

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.389
you can also see Star Wars Stormtroopers
but it is a strong girl into traditional

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:41.259
fascism

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.159
the next step would be her kicking
everyone out of the earth empire that

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.380
doesn't bow down to her

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.590
like expelling them from our borders and
if you haven't studied world war two yet

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.429
concentration camps used to be called re
concentration camps

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.599
which sounds a whole lot like
reeducation camps

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.869
very sinister see at things are only
getting worse with chimera

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.859
she's only becoming more and more like
Hitler everyday question for four

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:07.239
sit as there's been a lot more focus on
the air bender children recently

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:10.290
do you think that the get their own
comic book eventually I don't know if

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.120
they get their own comic book title in
the near future but I think that Nick is

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.700
exploring all possible

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.450
licensing avenues seem I see a mobile
game or special merchandise

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.840
in terms the comment specifically you
pry just the small ventures

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.489
inside a larger stories so the decor
comic book a couple years

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.700
you feel like a couple pages with just
the Airbender children going off doing

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.800
something on their own

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.750
it would happen inside a book or a comic
it's possible they could branch out in

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.920
the future but for now the concert is
going to focus on the main protagonist

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.010
mostly teenage and then what's the core
come occurs around teen core characters

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.390
question number five Roger s why didn't
cora metal band again Scooby Road

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.900
why did you just really offer game it's
been three years remember

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.680
add to that pic or it didn't become an
expert at metal bending

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.930
before she went into hiding before she
went away for three years

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.220
says you're not super hot any type a
bending she's hasn't been in training

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.329
if you member before book one before she
moved Air Temple Island shoes in secret

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:04.890
training

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.260
in the Southern Water Tribe she
basically been doing nothing but rain

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.190
the whole time

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.590
she done that I think the battle buddy
gone very differently I think

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.329
in having her lose but Mike and Brian
wanted to say is that she's not going to

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.730
be able to win a battle against coupe
Europe without killing her

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.540
but you'll have to go to the Avatar
State she's not going to be able to do

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.040
that just because she thinks

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.579
that she is another version of her so
she doesn't wanna kill herself

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.850
when it comes to fighting to be records
at a stalemate she's not gonna be on a

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.310
fighter

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.150
critiquing killer and killing your is
the only way to Peter which number six

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.799
took a rogue OS it seems like or is
going to a big temple soon

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.019
why do you think she's going there so
there's two possibilities

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.760
one she just could be going to learn
some spiritual knowledge or she could be

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.700
busy things they hear

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.430
in prison I've seen a lot as a here
theories I don't know that he's being

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.280
kept in the Earth Kingdom specifically

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.430
but I think regressive who she's going
to see she's going to seek knowledge

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.940
it's like when they went to one sheet
owns library book to the same thing

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.880
happened during last year bender that is
always an episode with the team goes

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.230
to learn more information about the
problem the problem in before being

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.760
could be rubbed so the committee's
existential study time

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.930
which number seven CBS is this the last
season a core

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.139
effort that sucks yes it does that but
there are a lot of TV shows that have

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.510
continued on in the comics

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.620
like Smallville did next season in the
comics Buffy the Vampire Slayer did the

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.310
same thing

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.050
core could do the same thing to I think
the actual stories the brady will be

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.800
a little bit smaller like the books that
they've written for Last Airbender like

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.099
to collect it works

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.629
let the search the promised the rift I
think it'll be more like that

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:38.389
me as long as there's a Newark a new
story you can view that as a new season

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:38.789
so

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.720
technically it might be the last season
on TV but it's not the last season a

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.729
poor ever

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.250
question number eight dawn as do you
think the computer had good intentions

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.729
when he thinks he went wrong so I think
she definitely started out with good

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.900
intentions she did the court thing where
she just road in gung-ho and try to

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.789
solve the problem

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.789
there was chaos all over the earth
Kingdom so I think that her solution

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:59.770
involved is completely replacing

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.440
their order with hers that's what the
contracts are you know you do everything

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.960
the way I tell you to do it

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.039
or else I think that started bossing say
I think the road in their first

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.440
that would be where things went wrong
she equalized everyone

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.759
in a very a Monte Poole Quay just didn't
have to do with bending in not bending

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.849
so if you wanna pinpoint like a very
specific time and place

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.719
where things went horribly horribly long
I would say the minute she fixed

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:27.210
you know fixed passing say questioner 9
Kevin s

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.469
do you think that sammy's bother will
help them thank you for your a do you

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:33.560
think the party will come back because
what the Spirit by tech

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.150
and do you think the coup bureau wants
to cook or and try to control the earth

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.979
avatar

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.020
that would take her place so lotta
questions okay so

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.800
I definitely to Sammy's father will help
out in some way maybe just giving us

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.690
some advice

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.990
she's really smart so she could pretty
much do almost anything he can

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.550
Mike and Brian explain the comic-con
that the Airbender costumes are from

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.430
future industries designed by Samim

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.770
so she is a capable engineer just like a
father he may not make it into prison

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.960
but I do think he'll be able to give her
some advice on how to solve a few

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.719
problems

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:07.039
as for bot to know my can bring
confirmed it'll be another 10,000 years

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.469
before we see him again

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:13.180
and as for computer controlling an earth
avatar I don't think that she wants

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.279
another avatar

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:17.469
I think the technology is one of the big
Jones in this book like

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:21.870
you had a giant high-speed rail the
magnetic rail and now you have a spear

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:22.659
fine tech

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:26.210
I think she intends for that to replace
but the Avatar would normally do

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.880
be like a giant weapon

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.000
it's funny how lott accords enemies just
view her as jane weapon

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.590
or if not a weapon than a giant tool
question number ten

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.820
Jessica asked for anything to team coral
reunite so I know that at least half of

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.710
them will reunite in the next episode

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.670
but it might be episode eat before
they're all completely together

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.330
there thirteen episodes in the season
and I don't think that they're gonna

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.110
wait till

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.390
episode 13 to do like the big final
battle will not definitely

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.190
all be together I think there will be a
confrontation with computers are me

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.800
again

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.420
even though my can brian has said that
there's not going to be like some giant

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.990
big

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.950
Corp at all at the end you do what you
would see is a team core rally before

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.060
the climax

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.210
could be really needs to get more
speared binds to replicate the spirit by

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.840
weapon

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.780
right now the only place we know that
they grow in abundance is Republic City

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.670
so is possible she could move her army
on Republic City

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.130
to get more that I don't know that for
sure it's possible inspired by it could

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.610
be growing in boxing say

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.230
but I just feel like everything is
pointing towards could Europe moving on

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:25.520
Republic City next

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.310
thank you so much to everyone for so
many questions is are always attend a

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.000
fund you

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.610
again I think that there's a big big
climax coming for core so it will get

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.400
more exciting

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.080
even if you weren't big fans in this
episode in particular congratulations to

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.070
