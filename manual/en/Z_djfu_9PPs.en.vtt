00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:05.890
Well hello there.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.339
 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.119
now let's get started

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.969
first of all we need some special
ingredients

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.419
hand sanitizer. A lovely Sharper. A pin.

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:25.519
And a piece of paper. Use the hand sanitizer
and put it on the piece of paper.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.789
Be autistic at this point.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.600
Isn't that fun?  Remove the butt and put it on the end of the Sharpie. Always start first with the

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.970
eyes, because eyes give

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.740
personality

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.040
to the creature. And now the nose. 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.840
Biiiig fluffy, fuzzy cheeks.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.690
let's make this one eccentric-looking

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.730
Ooooh, isn't that clever?

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.730
What we're going to do is the ears.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.340
I quite like little kittens. 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.370
The WHISKERS that come out like this.  Ohhhh joy. 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.860
See? Isn't this easy? 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.860
Now the tail must be up.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.080
Like this.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.640
because it doesn't want to get the
tail

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.770
in the feces.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.350
A bit of exertion. And force. 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.820
From this little animal.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.670
It's ssssomewhat squinting like soÉ 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.820
This is outrageous.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.550
Now. 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.930
What we're going to do.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.280
Is a small coy smile. There we go.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.950
Look at that.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.740
Oh. See? You can do this at home. 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.480
Now you may be wondering

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.330
what are we going to use

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.870
the pin for? 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.580
Well firstly, 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.690
apply the, the cap from the butt
back onto the face so that you do not soil

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.390
yourself with the ink.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.860
And then what you do

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.690
Is, is you find a nice little cork board. 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.060
Put it up, like that. And then...

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.170
you STICK the pin in the picture. So then it holdsÉ

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.770
Isn't that beautiful? 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.529
I hope you join the upside-down artist
next time

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.150
as we discuss

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.289
pygmy hippos avocado clothing off

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:16.959
when you step on one.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:17.919
Have a lovely day.
