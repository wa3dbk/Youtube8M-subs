Welcome Friends. Chris here with Dillon Brothers
Harley-Davidson.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.260
Exciting news out of the Harley camp this
week with the introduction of the new Street

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:21.260
750 and the Street 500.
The Street features a 60 degree V-Twin liquid

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.970
cooled Revolution X engine. The 750 and 500
are identical in every way except for the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.300
displacement.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.600
Belt driven with a six speed transmission
and 2 into 1 exhaust. Mid mount controls,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.630
single caliper disc brakes and a specially
tuned suspension.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:48.630
2 up set with back pegs, metal tank and fender,
LED taillights and bullet signals. All that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.730
and a wet weight of only 480 pounds.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.720
The street 750 and 500 are the first new line
motorcycle added to Harleys line up in 13

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.720
years. Harley crowd sourced and listened to
the people and delivered huge with these motorcycles.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.090
As part of their announcement at the International
Motorcycle Exhibition, Harley had several

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.990
Custom Motorcycle shops pre-customize individual
bikes to show off their potential. As a Harley

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:39.079
owner I am incredibly excited about the street
750 and street 500. I can not wait for our

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:46.319
dealership to get these bike in so I can see
one up close and get a test ride. To see more

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:50.469

our new and pre-owned motorcycles please go
