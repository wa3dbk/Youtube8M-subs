Hey guys! This is Heather from HealthyVeganRecipes.net.
Today we’re gonna make some vegan veggie

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.070
burgers. Often veggie burger recipes do involves
eggs or cheese or something like that. So,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.840
it’s important to have some vegan options
available to you.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:35.140
What I’m gonna start with as a base is sweet
potato. I’ve got this peeled, diced, boiled

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:43.659
and in a bowl. You can also bake this if you
prefer. And when I boil them I used just a

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.540
little bit of water at the bottom of the pot
so that they keep as many of its nutrients

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.540
as possible.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:57.150
I’m gonna mash this up. You can use a potato
masher if you have one, might be more efficient

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.610
and if you’re looking to skip ahead to the
recipe just head over to HealthyVeganRecipes.net.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.040
I’ll post the ingredients and directions
there.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:16.530
Ok. So if you’re mashing this up you will
notice that sweet potato is quite mushy and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:27.880
soft and you need something in there to get
it to a burger like texture.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.650
And what I’m gonna use today to make it
really easy and quick is some rolled oats.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:44.200
So, I’m just gonna pour some in here probably
about a cup coz as you can see I don’t really

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.580
measure but if you stir it around with your
sweet potatoes, you wanna be looking for a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.650
texture that will hold together in a bowl
but not too stiff.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:06.500
So, gonna mix together there. I like, I like
cookie dough texture. Alright, so I dumped

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.120
in about another quarter might be a third
of a cup and there’s the texture that I’m

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.080
going for. It also depends on how big your
sweet potato is so try not to be so literal

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.080
with the measurements.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.609
Make sure you are look at on what you are
stirring and make sure it makes sense for

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.499
what you have in your bowl.

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:32.310
Now to this I’m gonna add some seasonings
and what I have is some fresh herbs from the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:44.989
garden. I have some fresh oregano and parsley.
Flavours will go nicely with the sweet potato

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.200
and I’m also going to add some nutritional
yeast, for those of you who haven’t seen

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.480
a nutritionally yeast and asked me about it
this is it.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:02.120
It’s yellow, it looks like flakes and I
use it for seasoning, quite enough. It has

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.780
the bit of a cheesy-salty kind of flavour
so if you don’t have any nutritional yeast,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.569
if you can’t find any in the store you can
just leave that out. It’s not a big deal.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.159
It is called nutritional yeast and some people
say it has nutritional benefits but there’s

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.519
some debate about that and I don’t use it
for any nutritional reasons, I use it for

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:31.379
flavour so again don’t feel that that is
necessary.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:43.040
Last thing I’m gonna put in here is some
salt and some black pepper. Get up a little

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:51.859
notch, stir that around and then you just
need to form this into patties and you can

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.409
do this in the frying pan, you can do them
in the oven but I’m gonna do is actually

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:02.090
put them on a cookie sheets that’s line
with parchment paper and put them on the barbeque.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.959
You could try them straight on the grill but
they are a little bit soft, they probably

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.529
stick, that’s my main concern so I’m putting
them on the parchment paper so that they don’t,

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:14.519
they don’t stick to the cookie sheet.

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:25.310
Ok! So I’ve lit the grill, let it heat up
and then brush it off. I’ve got my burgers

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.360
ready to go right here and like I said I put
them on a sheet with some paper and you can

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.020
see with the oats these guys really hold their
shapes well but the reason I’m putting these

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.000
on a sheet on paper is because they tend to
stick.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.340
If you want to do them right on the grill,
what you can do is spray the grill with some

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.810
oil and they should do ok depending on how
much you watch them. You’ll need to flip

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.780
them halfway through but these guys I’m
just gonna actually put them on the top shelves

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.800
because I’m gonna grill some veggies on
the bottom.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.590
And what you can do is then close the lid
and it’s basically like they’re in an

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.949
oven and if you have a temperature gauge that’s
awesome because you don’t want it to get

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:17.720
too hot in there. I’ll say around 400 degrees
F and if you are doing it in the oven you

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.870
can do 350F, frying pan just medium high.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.530
So, they’ll stay in there until they’re
a little bit crisp on the outside. We’ll

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.970
see how long that takes for me and then I’ll
let you know and like I said I’m gonna do

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.120
some vegetables at the same time to go along
with these burgers because I don’t like

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.970
to, to waste the barbeque time.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.440
So, there are my burgers after about 30 minutes
if I give them a little poke, they are little

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.569
bit crispy on the outside, they look lovely
so they are done.

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:55.710
And again you can find the recipe over at
HealthyVeganRecipes.net and I’m gonna enjoy

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.849
this with some grilled vegetables and put
them over probably a green salad. You can

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:09.820
also put them on a bun. You can have them
over a whole big mount of vegetables or salad

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.439
or whatever you like.

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:16.010
So, I hope you enjoy them and let me know
what you think. Leave a comment and I’m

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.210
looking forward to hearing from you guys.
