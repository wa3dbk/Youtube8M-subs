Hi! My name is Nikole and I write for healthybalanceddiet.org.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.160
Every person diagnosed with diabetes would only want to make sure that 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.660
his/her diet is what’s best to prevent and manage diabetes. 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.870
The good news here is you can still eat your favorite foods and 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.170
enjoy your meals even when on a diabetic diet guide. 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.160
Even if a person is on a diabetic diet, 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.040
he/she still has the same nutritional requirements as other people. 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.960
There are no wrong or right foods when on this kind of diet. 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.420
The key here is moderation and being conscious of the amount of food intake. 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.300
It is also important that a diabetic person follows a diabetic diet chart where 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.940
it is placed there the meal time and the kinds of foods to eat on each meal.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.470
For a better understanding of what a diabetic diet is about, 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.960
here is a list of foods that can be eaten and which ones to avoid.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.860
Foods That Can Be Eaten 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:04.200
You can eat all meat items, such as lamb, beef, pork, bacon 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.240
Meat can also include the organ meats such as liver, kidneys, heart, as 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.140
they contain high doses of vitamins and minerals required for your body.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.900
You can have poultry items, such as chicken, goose, duck, turkey, etc. 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.110
All animal and meat fats. 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.940
Fish and seafood of all types can also be eaten.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.400
Eggs, except ‘omega-3 eggs’. 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.700
You can have all cheeses, except cottage cheese, 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.130
as it is high in carbohydrate content and has very little fat.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.590
Butter and cream can also be used. Use butter in cooked vegetables instead of gravy

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.170
use cream in hot drinks in place of milk. 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.260
Plain, natural full-fat yogurt.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.300
Vegetables and fruits, keeping the carbohydrate content in mind. 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.430
Condiments like pepper, salt, mustard, herbs and spices can be readily added to your food. 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.940

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.460

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.700
mixed vegetables which might contain them.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.300
Beans, except the runner beans.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.900
Take milk only in small quantities.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.730

Follow restraint with respect to fruit juices, as these are quite high in carbohydrates.
