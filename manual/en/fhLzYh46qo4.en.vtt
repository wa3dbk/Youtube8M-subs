00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.140
Hello! I'm Vitaliy Borodovsky,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.600
the Technical Director of Mobile Development department at Wargaming.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.000
Today, I will tell you about update 1.8.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.300
In this update, we will add missions and the new tutorial process,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.040
and also improve our system of quick registration.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.620
What are missions?

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.120
Missions are a new system

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.100
that allows players to receive game bonuses for completing different objectives.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.880
For example,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.020
a mission might be to spot three enemies when playing a light tank and survive.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.500
If players succeed,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.480
they will receive a reward regardless of whether the battle is won or lost.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.660
Even if you play in a platoon,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.880
each member of the platoon will have his or her own set of missions.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.880
You can help each other complete missions, though.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.540
How do missions work?

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.420
A special tab will appear in the Garage. Three missions will be available.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.940
You can complete these missions either simultaneously or one by one,

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.220
depending on their conditions and your preferences.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.540
Missions will be unique.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.320
Some will require individual skill, and some will require teamwork.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.780
Some missions must be completed during one battle,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.860
while some others can be completed gradually over several battles.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.980
Missions vary according to what vehicles you have in your Garage

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.820
and what tiers those vehicles are.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.300
So, when you play the vehicles of different nations

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.280
and research new vehicles in their branches,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.540
you will receive new missions.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.420
And what if a player can't complete a mission?

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.460
You can skip one mission per day without completing it.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.380
In this case, it will be replaced with a new one.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.540
As for the rest, if missions are not limited in time,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.740
they will stay in the list until they are completed.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.760
New missions appear in place of the completed ones three times a day,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.560
and the experience modifier is reset.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.280
What rewards will players receive for completing missions?

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.660
Missions will make battles more diverse and unpredictable,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.620
but the main bonus is the reward for completing them.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.240
There will be additional credits, experience for vehicles and crew,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.620
Free Experience, Premium Account time,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.480
and other bonuses depending on the difficulty of the mission.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.120
With the introduction of missions,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.540
research of new vehicles will become more accessible,

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.980
and the vehicles in a player's Garage will be more useful and beneficial.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.280
How will the Tutorial change?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.920
We remade the Tutorial map and changed the overall Tutorial process.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.760
Now, players will receive more detailed information at every stage of the Tutorial.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.140
We will not only explain the basics of vehicle control and shooting,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.660
but also recreate real battle situations.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.980
Thanks to these changes,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.180
players will be more prepared when they start fighting real battles.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.860
How will quick registration change?

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.000
We will implement the demo account system.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.100
This will allow players to immediately proceed to the game

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.020
and not have to spend time on the registration process.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.000
Such accounts are created automatically,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.840
so you will be able to enter the battle in just a few taps.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.180
How is a demo account different from a standard account?

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.340
Of course, standard accounts have more services and functions.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.840
You will be able to transfer the progress from your demo account to a standard account at any time.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.420
All you have to do is register.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.700
In this case, you will also be able to change your nickname for free.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.180
You will find more detailed information in the upcoming update review.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.300
In this review, we will tell you about all new features and changes in Update 1.8.
