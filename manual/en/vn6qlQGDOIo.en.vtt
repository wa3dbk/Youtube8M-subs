00:00:02.824 --> 00:00:05.863
Look, you don't understand
what he's like,

00:00:05.927 --> 00:00:09.266
what he... What we did,
what he made me do.

00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:13.235
All right.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.737
Let's start at
the beginning then.

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:21.477
What'd he make you do?

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:23.646
(SOBS)

00:00:26.847 --> 00:00:28.250
We killed some kids.

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:29.583
What?

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.257
Look, l didn't
mean to, l swear.
He made me help him.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.924
He said if l didn't,
he'd kill me, too.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.694
Look, you gotta
help me, please.
l'm so scared.

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:41.764
l don't want to go
to hell for killing kids.

00:00:41.828 --> 00:00:43.198
Look.

00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:46.103
What kids?
What... What are
you talking about?

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.704
l don't know.
l never knew their names.

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.272
Names?

00:00:50.337 --> 00:00:51.372
How many?

00:00:51.438 --> 00:00:52.940
How many kids?

00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:54.376
All together?

00:00:58.779 --> 00:01:00.649
About 20, l guess.

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:03.418
No, you're lying.

00:01:03.484 --> 00:01:05.855
No! It's true, l swear!

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:07.589
You're gonna tell me
you killed 20 kids?

00:01:07.654 --> 00:01:11.128
Yeah! Thereabouts.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.864
l stopped counting
after a while.

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:23.474
Gordon said maybe
one or two may
have escaped.

00:01:27.174 --> 00:01:28.209
But...

00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:29.310
No.

00:01:29.376 --> 00:01:32.215
Nobody can iust up
and kill 20 kids, okay?

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:33.481
We did.

00:01:35.882 --> 00:01:37.084
We did.

00:01:39.986 --> 00:01:41.054
How?

00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:45.528
Most times we'd iust
have one or two.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.097
Sometimes as many as three.
