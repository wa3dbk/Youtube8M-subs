00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.440
Whack and Epified give you the truth behind
the sunglasses monopoly.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.360
What do sunglasses sold by Chanel, Bulgary,
Dolce and Gabbana, versace, Tiffany, Ray Ban,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.040
Oakley, Prada, Burberry and Ralph Lauren have
in common? Besides being frighteningly expensive,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.440
they are all made and owned by one company.
Luxottica.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.300
Ray Ban came out with their first pair of
sunglasses back in the 1930's in the form

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.179
of aviation sunglasses which were specially
designed for the United States Air force.

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.410
These Anti- glare sunglasses were crafted
to cut light at high altitudes without obstructing

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.350
vision. These sunglasses were remodeled in
1937 with a metal frame today popularly known

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.820
as the Aviators.
In 1984 Oakley released their first sports

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.150
oriented sunglasses called the Factory Pilot
eye shades followed by Oakley Frogskin. The

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.870
company raised 230 million dollars by 1985.
Another milestone worth mentioning is the

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.670
Oakley M frame sunglasses which are included
as part of the US army's authorized uniform.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.039
So let us now tell you why sunglasses are
so expensive. This probably has something

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:15.270
to do with the illusion of choice and the
fact that one company owns over 80% of the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.840
planet's major eyewear brands. In 1961 Luxottica
started off in a tool shop in Algodo, Italy.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.009
Today, Luxottica is known for manufacturing
more than 6 and a half crore pairs of sunglasses

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.249
every year.
In 1980s Luxottica started buying every sunglasses

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:37.709
company it could get its hands on along with
convincing every fashion designer into letting

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.969
them make their sunglasses line. So if you're
wearing high end Tifanny sunglasses or last

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:48.029
year's stock clearance from Sunglass Hut,
well you're wearing Luxottica.

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:51.749
This is the reason why they can charge you
a massive sum of money for a piece of plastic

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:57.560
with two hinges. Because most of their competition
isn't inexpensive unbranded products, its

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.229
other brands they own. Luxottica is using
it's near monopolistic control of sunglasses

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.349
to keep the prices artificially high
Luxottica's bestselling sunglasses are none

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:14.270
other than your Ray Bans. In the early 90's Ray
Ban was sold to Luxottica for 640 million

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.020
dollars.
In 1996, Oakley had a pricing conflict with

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.340
Luxottica as a result of which Luxottica stopped
stocking Oakley products in their stores leading

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.960
to a 33% drop in Oakley stock market value.
Oakley tried to compete by selling their products

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.460
outside Luxotca's retail outlets but failed,
following which Luxottica bought Oakley in

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:45.720
2007 for 2.1 billion dollars along with 16%
premium over the existing share price.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:53.050
Today, a pair of Chanel black costs 351 dollars,
a tiffany blue cost 370 dollars and a pair

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.790
of Ray Ban aviators cost 86 dollars. These
ray bans by the way, cost 30 dollars back

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.280
when Luxottica hadn't even bought Ray ban.
Dark glasses are obviously not the only monopolistic

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.500
market around.
Did you also know that 80% of all the computers

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.540
that exist in the world are all manufactured
in Taiwan. One company- Quanta computers manufactures

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:21.700
33% of all the laptops in the world including
Dell, Sony, HP, Toshiba and yup Apple Mac.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.120
So the next time you feel smug about owning
a Macbook, know that its been put together

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.000
in Taiwan right next to other brands.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.800
While most of us support Capitalism and free
markets, these monopolies corner a big chunk

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.550
of the market share having a huge influence
on the price the masses have to pay.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.120
Diamonds are another example of one company
ruling the entire show and hiking up prices

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.490
by creating an illusion but that we'll get
into in another episode. For now we leave you

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:55.330
with this thought - As the CEO of Luxottica
said 'Everything is worth what people are

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.730
ready 
to pay.
