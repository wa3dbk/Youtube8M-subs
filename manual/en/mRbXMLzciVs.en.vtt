00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.800
I mean the first fight was really tough it
was grueling it was brutal we got fight of

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:14.010
the year round of the decade you know things
like that we just tried to kill each other

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.150
for ten rounds I ended up winning the decision
in that fight the second fight stop right

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.499
there for a moment are you really trying tokill
each other well I'm not really trying to kill

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:29.830
him but if it happens it happens wow I'm not
in there trying to kill him by no means but

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:37.300
if so be I mean it could happen it's part
of the sport it might sound brutal but that's

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.390
the way it is I rather hit him then him hit
me yeah you'd rather be the one that's not

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.150
dead right right wouldn't you want to be the
one hitting instead of getting hit right right

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.360
right sorry to interrupt you so fight number
two so the second fight you know it was my

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.810
biggest purse up to that date funny story
is three years before I fought Gatti I was

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.630
fighting at Wonderland Ballroom for like six
hundred dollars and four years after I fought

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.170
Gatti my second fight for a millionso if I
gave up back then when people said give up

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.670
you can't do it you know your hands this that
yoy know you're not gonna be nothin' if I

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.870
listened to them I wouldn't have made it but
I knew I could do it that's why go with your

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.060
mind go with what you want to do that's why
I want you here today I want you to tell those

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:35.060
kids never never never give up right exactly
but the second one was we fought and I made

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.389
that money not because I made the money but
I mean we fought the second one and um he

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:43.399
caught me in the third round with a right
hand over my jab hit me right in the side

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.420
of the ear here and knocked me down I was
out pretty much I went down and they gave

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.229
me an eight count and the referee and this
is a funny story and this is a true story

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.040
too and it's crazy but the referee give me
an eight count so now I'm wobbly I'm all over

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.170
the place and the referee says you okay yeah
of course okay okay okay I'm going like this

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.929
because I said he hit me behind the ear but
he didn't listen to me so anyways referee

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.340
says okay fight so he comes at me like a mad
man and I'm going against the ropes I'm trying

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.500
to like block I'm like ready to fall over
again right luckily the ropes are there so

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.390
I'm against the ropes and he lines me up with
a right hand he goes boom boom and he goes

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.890
boom caught me with a right hand whack I was
out I was ready to fall when he hit me with

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.670
that right hand it woke me up I wasn't even
hurt no more I came at him after that he ended

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.440
up beating me that fight he ended up beating
me in that fight and our third fight he ended

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.353
up beating me again third fight but my uh
I got hurt in that last fight the people didn't

00:02:44.353 --> 00:02:49.810
want me to fight I said no I'm gonna fight
him the third time and my brain ended up shifting

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.790
in my skull in the seenth round and stuff
like that so plus I suffer from post concussion

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.810
syndrome now which I'm in the study with Dr
Robert Cantu and Chris Nowinski donate my

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.740
brain when I pass so they can study the affect
of concussions and how to monitor them or

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.160
to not get 'em you know just wonderful of
you to do that yeah now ring magazine which

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.200
is the big magazine or was the big magazine
in your day they tout your fights as the fights

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.590
of the year am I right about that right yeah
uh I'm one of only like six people in the

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.340
history of boxing or seven people maybe that
was involved in fight of the year three consecutive

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.790
years I mean some guys have got it four years
some guys have got it five years but only

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:45.460
six or seven of us got three in a row like
I think Ali uh maybe Carmen Basilio or someone

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.150
like that back in the fifties but only three
like seven guys got three fights like I got

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.160
two thousand one two and three a kid from
Lowell and if I gave up and I was fighting

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.540
in Wonderland if I gave up and listened to
the people that said I could't do it then

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.440
I would've probably been paving right now
there's nothin' wrong with paving but i probably

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:13.210
would've been you know construction again
