Hi my name is Carey Kepler I'm a functional
training coach and a triathlon coach I work

00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:10.679
with intermediate and beginner triathlete
for more information you can go to my website

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:20.330
at www.boundless-energy.com. I want to talk
about what your swim workout should look like

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.869
so when you go the pool when you get there
you want to get in the water and get a warm

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.550
up segment in. Basically your looking at a
100 and depending on your swim level up to

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.710
500 meters, basically you can go through as
many strokes meaning the back stroke the freestyle

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.180
stroke, the breast stroke whatever you like
your trying to get the muscles warm, the body

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.510
warm and ready for your preset and main set
working out. So make sure you get a warm up

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.500
to 100 to 500 meters. The next set is your
preset what you want to do during the set

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.940
is do swim drills, get familiar with some
of your techniques you want to get some different

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.660
drills down. Your doing this from anywhere
to 50 to 300 to 400 meters, and if your a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.869
beginner swimmer spend extra time on your
swim drills. These drills are going to be

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:24.009
very beneficial and you do not want to swim
and take down a technique that's not proper

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.830
and have try to relearn. You want your muscle
memory to begin start from the beginning and

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.799
start out correctly so your preset is going
to be any of your drills. Your main set is

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.439
going to be the focus of your workout, you
might have endurance workout where going to

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:44.399
swim long and steady you might have a sprint
segment on your main set where your actually

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.049
going to do a 25 to 50 meter sprint. Do repetitive
repeats ever giving yourself 10 second breaks

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.740
so that's your main set that's the main purpose
of the workout. And lastly you want to cook

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.229
down you can cool down anywhere to 50 to 150
meters. Basically you just want to bring your

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.080
body temperature and let your muscles and
your heart rate come down a little bit, cool

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.500
down so you can get ready to get out of the
water.
