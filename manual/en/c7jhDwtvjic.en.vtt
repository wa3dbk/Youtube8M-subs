Hey guys.

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:09.590
Dr. Axe here, founder of draxe.com.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.170
In this video, I'm going to answer the question,
"Is peanut butter bad for you?"

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.519
This is actually a common question that I
get from a lot of people.

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.990
There are some misconceptions when it comes
to peanut butter.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.960
I'll go answer your question here early.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.199
Is peanut butter bad for you?

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.159
Yes and no.

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:31.989
It depends on how much you consume and it
depends on the variety of peanuts you're getting.

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.840
I'll share with you a secret on the best type
of peanut butter you should be getting as

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.070
well as what the rest of your diet looks like.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.190
Let's start off talking about peanut butter
in terms of what the issues are within why

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.940
it can be bad for you.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.250
For starters, most of us in America get way
too many omega-6 fats in our diet and not

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.589
enough omega-3 fats.

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:52.910
Remember this.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.579
Omega-3 fats help reduce inflammation where
too many omega-6 fats cause inflammation.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.620
Well, peanuts are high in omega-6 fats.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.420
They're low on omega-3 fats, so they can cause
an imbalance ratio there.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.670
That really is one of the first issues you're
going to find with peanuts is that they have

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.090
too many omega-6, there's not enough omega-3.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.930
That's the first problem with most peanuts.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.050
The second issue is that most peanuts are
grown on the ground.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.640
They get very moist, and a lot of them contain
mycotoxins or mold.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.270
So that mold is one of the big reasons why
so many kids today have allergies or these

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.140
inflammatory immune reactions when they get
around peanuts.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.190
In fact, a lot of schools today have laws
or restrictions against peanuts.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.230
Because you're bringing them to school and
its like bombs are going off.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.680
Kids are having all of these immune reactions
because of all of the food allergies and food

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.310
sensitivities today to things like peanuts.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.970
So that's the other issue is there are food
sensitivities involved because of the mold

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.850
that's associated with a lot of the peanuts
today.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.570
I would say those are really two of the bigger
issues today you're going to find with peanuts.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.300
By the way, peanuts aren't really a nut.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.580
They're more of a legume.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.900
They're like a cross-breed in between a nut
and a legume or a bean there as well.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.440
But let me say this, you can actually eat
peanut butter and it can be healthy.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.810
Let me share with you how.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.810
First thing is this.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.530
It's that when you're buying peanuts, make
sure you're buying a certified organic brand.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.580
Ideally, a type of a peanut called a Valencia
peanut or Jungle peanuts.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.320
These peanuts are typically not grown in the
moisture of the ground.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.140
They're typically in bushes off the ground
or higher up.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.840
That's going to eliminate that issue with
the mold.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.540
So that's one way you can eat peanuts.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.280
So again, my favorite brand is called Jungle
Peanuts, you can check out, or Valencia Peanuts.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.080
Those are the two brands you want to look
for.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.000
Ideally, organic peanuts are going to be the
best things you consume.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.160
The second thing that can actually make peanuts
healthy for you is if you're getting omega-3

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.020
fats with them and even adding in a little
bit of flaxseed oil or when you're consuming

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.460
it as well or just doing a little bit of something
like a fish oil supplement.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.290
If you're getting plenty of omega-3 fats in
your diet, then you really don't need to worry

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.340
about if you're eating a serving of peanuts.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.250
It's completely fine.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.480
Peanuts actually can be a food that supports
metabolism and fat loss if you're consuming

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.970
them with the other rights foods and as part
of a proper diet, because peanuts are very

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.680
high in protein and they are high as well
in easily burned carbohydrates.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.209
But again, they're one of the highest plant-based
form of protein available today.

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.630
So can peanuts be healthy?

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.980
Yes, they can if you buy something like Jungle
Peanuts and you're getting plenty of omega-3

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.090
fats in your diet and they're organic.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.110
For all those reasons, yes, peanuts can be
healthy.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.959
But here's the problem today.

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.970
Ninety-nine percent of the peanut butter and
peanuts people are buying in America today

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.599
have hydrogenated oils added, they're non-organic,
and those people are getting too many omega-6

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:01.760
fats in their diet.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.370
So you start adding in peanut butter in its
vegetables oils.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.050
It's highly processed.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.830
Allergic reactions happening within the body.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.650
So that's why you've maybe even seen articles
I've written.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.950
Or I was recently on the Dr. Oz Show talking
about why peanut butter is not good for people.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.160
Because again, 99.9% of peanut butter out
there today is absolute junk.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.520
It is not good for you and it can even cause
weight gain and inflammation and inflammatory

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.370
reactions in the body.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.490
But again, if you're a person who's going
to have enough omega-3 fats in your diet and

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.199
you're going to buy a good quality brand of
peanuts or peanut butter, then hey, having

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:45.911
a little bit of peanut butter in your diet
can be A-okay and good for you, again, if

00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:48.229
it's that balances omega-3 to omega-6 ratio.

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.060
Hey, if you want to learn more about how to
reduce inflammation and some of my top healing

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.530
foods that are full of omega-3, check that
out on my website.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.979
Simply go to draxe.com.

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.550
That's D-R-A-X-E.com.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.180
I've got some other great articles on things
like chia seeds, flax seeds and hemp seeds.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.819
You may want to read about there on there
as well.

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:11.159
I think you'd really enjoy that article on
chia seeds, by the way.

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:12.580
Actually, just a little home recipe.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.349
A lot of times, I'll take my peanuts, I'll
make my own peanut butter, but I use flax

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.360
oil as the oil if I'm making homemade peanut
butter.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.650
So again, Jungle Peanuts is the brand that
I buy.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.340
Along with, I'll put in some cold-pressed
flax oil.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.900
I make my own peanut butter at home that way.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.900
It tastes great and it has a balanced omega-3
to omega-6 ratio.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.150
