EduAction is an intercultural and non-traditional educational project 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.000
that brings young international volunteers 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.700
to public schools of Latin America. 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.000
The volunteers facilitate workshops about global topics, looking forward to break boundaries and prejudgments, 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
expanding the world view of students. 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.000
The project is present in 5 countries: 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.500
Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Looking forward to build a strong and united Latin America, more conscious and tolerant. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.500
With EduAction, the students have the opportunity to experience 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.159
a different social and cultural reality, without leaving the classroom, within its walls.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.300
Contributing with the education of citizens, who will be the future agents of change.  

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.700
In 4 years of the project we have worked with 300 international volunteers environ

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.300
We participated in more than 250 schools of Latin America

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.300
We impact over 30.000 kids and teenagers of the whole continent

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We achieved incredible results

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.200
after receiving the project,  

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
70% of the students wanted to study at the university

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
54% would like to learn a new language

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and 94% wanted to participate again in EduAction

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.000
EduAction? Love, Fun, Creativity

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.700
With the results, experience and responsibility achieved, we decide to institutionalize the project

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.800
We want to open the NGO EduAction, but to make the dream true 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.500
we need your support

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.800
Thatâ€™s why we ask you to share the idea

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.500
support the project

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.800
The future of the education is in our hands.
