00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:13.167
ED:
Hi, my name is Ed Brickler,
I'm an artist,

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:15.033
art material consultant,

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:16.833
and also the Fine Art
Education Director

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:18.700
for Canson Incorporated.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.267
We also represent
Royal Talens

00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:23.533
which is a Dutch
colour company.

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.533
Today we're going to
talk about

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.633
Rembrandt Oil Colours.

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:29.000
Rembrandt Oil Colours have
been around for a long time.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.500
They are an artist grade
oil colour.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.700
All the colours on
the colour chart behind me

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.667
are totally light fast.

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:40.500
Some of the unique features
about Rembrandt Oil Colours

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.033
are their rich,
creamy texture,

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:46.967
and you can see
as I put this down on a palette,

00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:49.400
it is very very movable.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.167
It also mixes well
with other colours.

00:00:54.167 --> 00:00:56.833
So you can get a good
consistency across

00:00:56.833 --> 00:01:00.200
the colour range,
where each colour is the same.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.033
If you want some
thicker colours,

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:06.067
especially in the white,
this is made with a linseed oil,

00:01:06.067 --> 00:01:08.800
and has a little more
tactile quality.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.833
One of the other unique things
about Rembrandt Oil Colours

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:15.067
is the high amount of
transparent colours.

00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:20.400
These are very popular
in traditional painting

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.167
because most artists
would start out with

00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:26.033
a monochromatic painting
as I have here,

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:28.667
and then add a glaze.

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:32.267
Now a glaze is basically
adding a transparent colour

00:01:32.267 --> 00:01:33.600
to a medium.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.167
You mix it up, and then glaze
over the top of your painting,

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:43.300
just providing a nice
thin layer of colour.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.667
An artist will sometimes put
six or more layers of glaze

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:52.867
onto a painting
and build up the layers.

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:56.033
If we go across another colour
we then get what we call

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:58.400
optical mixing.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.067
So these are some of
the unique features

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:03.200
of Rembrandt Oil Colours.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.033
If you're looking for a colour
that has maximum pigmentation,

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:08.100
it is truly light fast,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.467
and a nice range
of transparent colours,

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:14.667
start experimenting with
Rembrandt Oil Colours.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:17.200
