On behalf of Expert Village my name is Vince
Fazio and I'm here to talk to you from the

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.950
Sedona art center about one session oil paintings.
I mentioned that I'm working on a glass palate

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:20.539
here. The glass is placed into the box of
my portable easel. This kind of easel is great

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.090
for planer painting, as we mentioned. It's
also great for working on a small scale. Working

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.340
larger, I like a larger palate. I personally
like a lot of room. But working on a small

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.730
scale this works. Also, with the glass I can
clean it really easily in the middle of a

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.879
painting process. Disposable palates are great
too. They come in sizes that will insert right

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:51.989
into there. This is and ECL easel, one of
a number of brands that combine the easel

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.079
with the palate and so that becomes a very
portable situation that you can move around.

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.430
They also make cigar box size easels that
you can carry around with you and have a little

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:13.790
smaller sized palate surface. And that's pretty
nice. This easel will expand down to here...

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:24.970
it will go up so that we can put a much larger
canvas on here. This easel I got exactly because

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:32.500
it will take up to a sixteen by twenty canvas
really easily. So you can see how big a canvas

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.200
that can go out to here easily. But it's also
very handy for the small size. And this easel

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:46.189
comes with a tripod. So this tripod is very
malleable. You can do all kinds of neat things.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:56.740
I can tip it back and forth. I can also, if
I'm on uneven ground, pivot it this way and

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:08.649
that way. The legs extend, So I can put this
out to a standing height. So for standing

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:09.860
or sitting, it's very adjustable.
