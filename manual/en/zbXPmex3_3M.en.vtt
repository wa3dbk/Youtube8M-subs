Hey, everyone, today we're making Asian Inspired

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.069
Pork Tenderloin Sliders on the Island Grillstone
on...

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.690
Announcer:
The Cooking Everything Outdoors show is sponsored

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.309
by Camp Chef and www.OutdoorCooking.com and

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.110
Presenter:
So before we get started I'm going to tell

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.020
you that 90 percent... okay, maybe 85 percent
of this recipe is prep.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.540
But the important thing to remember, overall
of this, is that the pork tenderloin needs

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.800
to marinade.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:39.230
What you'll need for this is 2 tablespoons
of mirin, 3 tablespoons of rice vinegar, 1

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:47.059
teaspoon of sesame oil, 2 tablespoons of honey,
2 tablespoons of soy sauce and about a tablespoon

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.359
of roasted sesame seeds.

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.359
So it's very simple, just mix all these ingredients
together.

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.749
You want to set aside a couple tablespoons
of the marinade for our slaw.

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:05.030
So now, we need to prepare our pork tenderloin
and I just have a single tenderloin here.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.250
It's real important to have a very sharp knife
because we're going to make extremely thin

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.660
slices.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:25.250
So once this is sliced up we're going to put
this in our bowl and add our marinade.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.670
Mix that up really nice.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.640
Cover up, refrigerate it for at least 3 hours
or overnight if you like.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:43.110
So, to make up our slaw we're going to use
some red cabbage, napa cabbage, carrot and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.680
a nice red pear.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.850
Additional toppings are going to be Korean
barbecue sauce and pickled ginger.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.810
Now, to make our slaw we want to think thin
slices, Julienne, if you will.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.840
With my carrots, I've already skin them and
just using the peeler I can get some real

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.610
nice strips out of this.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.739
Now, once you have that what I'll do is I'll
take two or three of these and then I will

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.049
just slice them into smaller slices.

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.480
These don't have to be perfect.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:27.010
You can take your red cabbage and then just
very thinly give that a slice, about like

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.040
that and then I give that a nice cut, it all
comes apart.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.799
And what I found that works with the napa
cabbage is just to peel off the leaves and

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:48.760
two or three of these will work just fine
and then, again, real fine cut, about 3 1/3

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.840
of a cup.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.650
Now, for the pear I like to skin it.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.120
You could leave it on if you want.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:04.489
But again, I just take the vegetable peeler
and knock that off and I will cut it in half,

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.959
cut it in quarter, take out the core.

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.519
And then I want to slice these up thin, as
well.

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:23.470
Now, don't put the marinade on it until it's
time to serve.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.109
Pork goes right on the hot Island Grillstone.

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:33.499
So let's get this cooking and you can see
some of these pieces were already getting

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.170
a little bit of crust, it's real nice.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.909
Should be done.

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.629
It's nice.

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.819
Don't overcook this.

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:50.620
Now, what I want to do is I want to toast
up a couple of these buns.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.620
Put this together.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.249
Now, the first thing we need to do is get
bit of a marinade on our slaw and mix that

00:03:55.249 --> 00:04:00.659
up and you don't want a lot on this.

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.620
It just kind of accented, if you will.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.620
Okay.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:13.129
So here is our bun and I want to get some
of my pork tenderloin on there.

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:14.129
Okay?

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.750
We want to drizzle a little bit of our Korean
barbecue sauce over that.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:28.850
I want to put some of my pickled ginger on
there and some of our slaw on the top of that.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.590
That is my Asian Inspired Pork Tenderloin
Sliders.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.229
For you guys, lot of prep but it cooks really
fast and it's super delicious.

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.229
It's fantastic.

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:54.280
You're going to love this.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.479
