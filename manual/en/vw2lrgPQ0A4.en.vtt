00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.700
Hey, what's up GG (guys and girls)? CouilleBleu's
back today to play...

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.600
Here are the runes, masteries, skill distribution
and items that you'll need to throw your items

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.900
at the fuckabishes like a crazy girl.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.100
In the laning phase, harass your opponent
with your S Beam skill to fuck him up from

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.500
the front like a coward, but if you want to
deal lots of damage yolo style,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.600
take out your S Beam-Yellow Flash-Mega Buster combo on a crippled old man to show your superiority to him.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.500
Since you'll be slapping your foe in the face
without effort, he'll bring a stranger to the party,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.090
but don't worry about it because your Yellow
Flash is here to teleport you out of this

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.600
troublesome threesome.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.149
Are you ready to wipe out the criminals from
the surface of Summoner's Rift?

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.800
Then all you need to do is use everything
at your disposal to stay away from the enemy's range of attack

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.710
and use every pew pew pew gun you have in
your left hand to send that reckless ninja

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.500
to hell.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.309
If an ugly woman tries to bind you on her
bed, show her that you're not an easy prey

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.719
by jumping right back at her to mess her monstrous
face even more.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.579
Then, buttfuck that wannabe dragon slayer
until she understands that no one tarnish

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.789
the beautiful name of Fairy Tail.

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.730
Oh, and by the way, you don't need to keep
your spaceship in your pocket to assassinate

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.170
a running enemy : just use it after your partner
dies to ''secure the kill''.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.000
Hello Kitty tries to surprise you with his
sharp claws? Poor little feline can't catch

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.090
Ezreal's balls because of his Dragon Ball
moves.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.450
Speaking of moves, Ezreal is capable of using
his abilities to skillfully finish off a pussycat

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.680
hiding behind minions

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.560
and using a S Beam-Flash combo will prevent
any fuckabish from reacting fast enough to

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.280
dodge your skillshot.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.280
When you play that tomboy, you have to tape
your fingers to your QWE keys because you'll

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.979
be spamming those buttons like never before.

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.299
When you unlock your ultimate skill, you can
use it to run over the minions from the other

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.700
lanes to piss off your own teammates.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.840
What's more? You can get even more pocket
money by aiming your spaceship at the human

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.650
barbecue trying to go back home safely to
cook for his wife,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.500
at an assassin trying to assassinate you,
at a wannabe ninja, and blablablablablablabla

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.350
Guess what? That skill is also excellent to
repel a push from the opposing team

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.979
and to massacre an army of kiddos to get more
mini money while you stay at the base like

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.000
a lazy ass to buy your last item.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.469
And now, you should play Tower Defense with
your S Beam skill to make your ultimate come

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.400
back from cooldown faster so you can perform
all those miracle deeds more often.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.219
When you get Phreak's trademark item, you'll
be able to harass your opponent even harder

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.800
and killing enemies will become a walk in
the park.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.400
When you get your BladeFire Gunblade combo,
you'll finally fulfill Ezreal's dream,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.600
that is bursting a fuckabish like a mage.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.400
All these items will give your spaceship a
smooth mix of extreme physical and magic damage

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.000
capable of crashing arsonists all over the
world.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.949
In teamfights, the only advice I can give
you to win them is to stay behind your team

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:46.189
like a chicken, shoot your juice at your enemies
and when I say juice,

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.489
I mean that juice, you know...the manly juice.

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.600
And trust me, these guys will kneel down before
the king of the gay porn world, right sexy Taric?

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.839
If you see a human barbecue running away from
war, don't bother chasing him because that

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:01.500
motherbitch will get run over by your spaceship.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.909
After that, block the dragon pit entrance
with your team to have a wonderful fivesome

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.469
with a trapped dancing ninja.

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:10.400
Then, kill his girlfriend that tried to save
him from that humiliating situation and,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.900
of course, do not spare the life of the lovely
Lucian boy.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.800
If you want, you can start a fight with your
ultimate and then jump in there like a super

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.900
hero if you know you can take them on.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.300
When I say take them on...it's not YOU that
takes it, alright?

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.120
Since you're a hybrid little bitch, you should
use all your skills whenever they're available

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.600
to massacre everyone around you like a boss...y
girl.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.930
You were not invited to the party? Don't fret
about it son, err I mean daughter...this is

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.500
one easy way to make them pay 
for this outrage.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.800
That's it for today, people!

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.200
Don't forget to check out my channel for more boring League of Legends videos.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:54.000
Feel free to leave a comment in any language you want, but I'll only answer those in English and in French because I'm a racist fuckabish.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.700
Ciaossu!
