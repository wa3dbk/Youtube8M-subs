00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.129
Hello and welcome to Videojug.

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.350
Renowned chef and Indian
cookery book expert Manju Malhi is going to

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.360
show us how to
make mango chutney.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.250
Step one, to serve four people you will need
two ripe, medium

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.050
sized mangoes, two tablespoons of vegetable
oil, two dried

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.509
red chilies, two black peppercorns, a pinch
of cumin seeds,

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.680
quarter of a teaspoon of coriander seeds,
quarter of a

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.670
teaspoon of onion seeds also known as nigella
seeds, quarter

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.280
of a teaspoon of mustard seeds, half a teaspoon
of salt, one

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.219
teaspoon of sugar, quarter of a teaspoon of
paprika, one

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.660
tablespoon of lemon juice.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.680
Here's that list again.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.030
You'll also need these utensils.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.850
A vegetable peeler, a
chopping board, a non-stick frying pan, a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.070
mixing bowl, a
wooden spoon, a teaspoon, a tablespoon, some

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.800
plates for
ingredients , and an air-tight storage jar.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.360
Step two, mango.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.790
Begin by carefully peeling two fresh
mangoes.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.830
If the mangoes are really ripe, you'll be
able to

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.170
remove some of the skin with your hands.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.950
Cut away as much of the flesh as possible,
leaving the stone.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.790
Put the flesh into
a bowl, and use a spoon to roughly mash it

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.710
into pulp.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.570
Step three, fry spices.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.110
Heat two tablespoons of vegetable oil
in a non-stick pan over a medium heat.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.680
Then add two dried red chilies, two black
peppercorns, a pinch of cumin seeds,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.810
quarter of a teaspoon of coriander seeds,
quarter of a

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.890
teaspoon of onion seeds, and quarter of a
teaspoon of mustard seeds.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.540
The seeds will pop and sizzle.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.430
Step four, add more spices.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.750
Now stir half a teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon
of sugar, and quarter of a teaspoon of paprika

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.380
into the pan.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.990
Step five, add lemon.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.360
Add one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.950
Turn the hob down to a low heat.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.810
Step six, add mango.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.370
Now, add the mashed mango pulp and stir.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.090
Continue to cook over a low heat for five
minutes, stirring occasionally.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.640
Step seven, serve.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.320
You can keep chutney for up to a week, in
an airtight container in the fridge.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.760
Done
