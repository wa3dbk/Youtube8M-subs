00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:05.927
Q: Can you give us some comments on a fight with Kubo?

00:00:05.927 --> 00:00:09.540
Saiga: He was not that tough than I thought.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.672
Just give me one year and I'm so confident that I'll be better than him.

00:00:13.672 --> 00:00:17.562
I'm sure I can be the best in Japan.

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:22.942
Q: You felt like you guys match equally?

00:00:22.942 --> 00:00:54.068
Saiga: Yes. I just waited too much. That was my mistake. Not big difference exist between us.

00:00:54.068 --> 00:01:26.218
I need more physical strength and speed. Then I'll win next tourney for sure.

00:01:33.275 --> 00:01:37.188
Q: You used to train with Saiga, right?

00:01:37.188 --> 00:01:46.677
Saiga: I used to be beaten completely. 

00:01:46.677 --> 00:02:03.032
But this time things were totally different as you saw.

00:02:03.032 --> 00:02:21.730
I can grow up more and more. I will be the best fighter from this tourney.

00:02:26.282 --> 00:02:32.790
Q: What was your game plan?

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:41.903
Saiga: I had no plans. I just fought as usual.

00:02:41.903 --> 00:03:22.623
I always train with tough fighters so I was so confident. But maybe I was a bit too nervous.

00:03:27.155 --> 00:03:38.598
Q: Your Karate style is what fans overseas should like.

00:03:38.598 --> 00:03:57.328
Saiga: Yes, I guess so. My style is tricky and acrobatic.

00:03:57.328 --> 00:04:17.888
I want to fight like no one else can do. 

00:04:17.888 --> 00:05:05.320
I want to entertain fans with my unique fighting style.

00:05:56.088 --> 00:06:02.830
Q: Have you seen fights of other participants?

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.362
Saiga: No, I have not. Actually I'm not interested in somebody else's fight.

00:06:08.362 --> 00:06:13.830
Because if I can do what I should do, I win.

00:06:19.903 --> 00:06:25.925
Q: Are you interested in K-1 MAX -63kg world tourney which will be held in coming Autumn? 

00:06:25.925 --> 00:06:35.508
Saiga: Of course I am. I'll beg you to give me a chance. 

00:06:35.508 --> 00:06:51.815
I'm sure I can entertain fans from the world.
