00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.970
We are long past the CRT era of games like
Mario, Sonic, Legend of Zelda and others.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.520
However, the nostalgia has driven the gaming
industry since a few years now towards retro

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.599
pixel graphics with 2-dimensional gameplay
either as a top-down perspective or sidescrolling.

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.599
Let us show you what we think are the best
pixel games:

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.780
Shovel Knight is the tip of the spire in this
list. No matter what screen resolution you

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.089
choose, the game will fill your entire screen
with pixel goodness. The game includes all

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:02.140
you could wish for in an RPG sidescroller
- various enemies and diverse locations, epic

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.140
boss fights, special powers, weapons, gold
and cliche storyline. Superb support for gamepads

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.740
lets you experience this game as oldschool
as it gets.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.570
Castle in the Darkness is a relentless stream
of unbalanced difficulty, where you beat a

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.580
boss in no time and get stuck for ours on
some mobs. The achievement "Die 500 times"

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.280
should give you a hint on that. Get prepared
for infernal humor, for instance: "You need help?

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.260
Take this!" and dropping 1 gold piece. The
trolling of this game knows no end, but it's

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.960
funny. The collisions are badly inaccurate
and the screen has a black frame, but despite

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.630
these issues the game transponds the old,
classic atmosphere and it looks properly.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.630
I gotta admit it grew on me and it resides
among the most memorable.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.740
VVVVVV takes you on a journey through a wrecked
spaceship that tossed the 6 crucial crew members

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.680
across the deck (whose names start with V,
hence the game title). Your task is to locate

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.360
them.
The graphics are monotone, and the backtracking

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.360
may be tiresome, but the game is certainly
worth the try as a fun pixel puzzler.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.480
Volgarr the Viking may leave an impression
of a lacking indie project at first look,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.150
but don't let that deceive you. The game is
soaking with oldschool epicness. Be advised

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.420
that it doesn't include ANY checkpoints at
all, so you either finish a world entirely

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.299
or next time you run the game, you start fresh.
Volgarr may not have a well established plot

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:56.299
or consistent graphics, but it surely compensates
in the gameplay. Much recommended!

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:08.219
Deep Dungeons of Doom is a mobile game that
got to Steam later on and it shows its roots

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:13.889
as enjoyable in small portions of time. The
game is simple - you press left to attack,

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:20.889
right to block. You can also use one item
at a time and a weapon or armor of choice.

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:26.340
Despite its simplicity, this game manages
to squeeze in a classic RPG storyline and

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.719
proves to have a high replayability rate.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.579
Out There Somewhere is a quite simple and
short sidescroller (walkthrough will take

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:51.769
you about 2h). The interesting part is the
teleport gun, that lets you reach places that

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.540
would normally be inaccessable - the entire
gameplay is based on this notion. If you have

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.540
a spare evening and feel like challanging
your brain a little, this would be the choice.

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:17.310
Environmental Station Alpha is another sci-fi
pixel adventure with tons of atmosphere and

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.310
eerie soundtrack. It's design is charmingly
colorful and smooth controls let you soak

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.400
in the dynamic gameplay. The game is not very
well advertised so it may be known to few

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.400
people, but it definitely deserves some praise.

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:49.530
Sword &amp; Sworcery has won numerous design awards
thanks to its original depiction of the story.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.389
It is clear that most of the creative fuel
for this project has been spent on the story

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:01.120
and how the game looks. This is an adenture
piece with puzzles, action is rather scarce.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:08.120
You can check it out both on Steam or iOS
AppStore.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:17.280
Crawl got me interested with it's awesome
trailer, just have a look:

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:39.300
Even though the game is still in Early Access, it is pretty solid for a beta and the developer tends to it.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:46.310
Definitely worth trying out for the unconventional
gameplay structure.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:57.970
Ever thought of imagining Dark Souls in 2D?
Titan Souls is an equivalent of death simulators

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:03.919
in the world of pixel genre. The game has
a very steep difficulty curve and quite frankly

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:09.419
- we weren't involved enough to play the game
for a longer period of time, but it does have

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:15.970
some nice graphics and interesting game model.
It is based on throwing a singular spear and

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:22.970
having to pick it up before you may attack
again. It might suit some hardcore gamers.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:32.550

interesting:
