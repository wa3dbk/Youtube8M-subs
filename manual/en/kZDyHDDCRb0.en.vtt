00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.720
Connor was referred to me because he
was born without thumbs

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.779
he had four fingers but did not have a
thumb on either hand

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.420
I met the family at that time and

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.060
the question immediately was

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.000
what can we do to
make sure that Connor leads a normal, healthy

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.960
high-functioning life

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.580
It was in the birthing room that we found out Connor didn't have thumbs

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.940
and I think everybody was pretty stunned

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.160
We got almost an immediate referral to Doctor Chhabra

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.880
 I was always fascinated in orthopedic surgery

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.360
and then I spend additional time in my fellowship training learning about 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.840
congenital hand differences

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.780
For a while there, he was trying to pick things up using his four fingers

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.820
but eventually he started picking things up kind of like a crab would

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.400
I discussed with them options for
treatment

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.230
we could do nothing but there's one
particular operation and that's a Pollicization procedure

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.160
It's a complex micro surgical
procedure where you

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.650
separate the index finger and rotate it
into a position of a thumb

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.340
and then recreating the tendons and
muscles you create

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.870
a new thumb for a child

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.380
It's one of the
reasons I went into hand surgery

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.300
It was the most fascinating operation
I had ever seen

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.600
Connor underwent the Pollicization procedure for one hand

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.380
and then about 7 months later he went to Pollicization procedure for the other hand

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.130
We went in to get his first cast removed

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.930
It was the first time I actually got to see his new thumb

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.590
I was there by myself

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.800
and I started crying

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.190
I just

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.940
It was a lot

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.100
He can go to the playground and he can slide down the slide and grasp onto those sides

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.740
He can pull himself up on things, gasp things

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.880
He has the strength now, he didn't have that before

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.509
To have someone at two weeks of age, come in and tell you

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.509
This is not going to be a problem, we can
fix this, we can make this better

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.169
I think that was such a relief

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.930
We have, I feel, some of the highest skilled

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.280
providers anywhere in the country with
these kids I'm

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.530
part of the team that gives them the
self-esteem and helps them

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.410
realize that just because their hands
are different doesn't mean they can't do

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.850
anything that any other kid can do

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.150
I can't really tell you in words how
great that can make you feel
