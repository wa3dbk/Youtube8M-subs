00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.220
Today on this 2010 Toyota Tundra pickup, we
are going to install part number 37185.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:13.240
Also, we are going to use an install bracket,
part number 118136 from Tow Ready.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.080
In this case what we are going to do is we
have our factory 4-pole lose from the vehicle.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.610
Our 7 and 4-pole down to our 4-pole adapter
is going to go on the end of this.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.950
Now we will take a few minutes to do some
test fitting here because it is kind of close

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.230
between the hitch and the bumper.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.460
So, we use our bracket.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.010
We can mount it this way or we can mount it
this way.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.340
And we can mount it just like this.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.500
It does stick out kinda far.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.180
So what we can do is we can just take this
bracket and flip it around.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.989
And if we are installing it backwards, it
actually recesses a little bit.

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.010
It sits a little tighter against the hitch
and it is not the only thing that is sticking

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.010
out further than the hitch itself.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.159
1:00
Alright, first we will install our bracket.

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.470
Put the clamp over it and then we will run
it through.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.040
The clamp is screwed down against it and then
twist it.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:23.770
Now next we will go ahead and bolt on the
bracket that came with the 4-pole and 7-pole

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.750
adapter.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:38.659
Install the adapter itself.

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:46.850
To take a few minutes out, we will go ahead
and take up these wires to make them nice

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.050
and neat, a little added protection.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:58.830
[Adapter 1:55] This 4-pole is going to plug
into the factory 4-pole and then we will have

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.830
a few extra wires.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.630
This will be used for a 12 volt hot lead,
the black wire, if we needed to install that.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.900
We do not have to in this case.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.289
The blue wire is going to be for the brake
output for the brake controller.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.709
Again, that is not going to be installed either.

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.080
And what we have left over is the purple wire.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.519
That is usually ran to the reverse lights
for reverse light lead, either on your trailer

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.079
you may have a reverse lock out for the hydraulic
brakes or just simply reverse lights on the

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.109
back of a trailer.

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.069
We are not going to use that one in this case
either.

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.189
That leaves us with the white wire, which
is ground, right here.

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.840
And we will run that to the frame member of
the vehicle.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.529
So the remaining wires, we are just going
to tidy them up for easy access at a later

00:02:43.529 --> 00:03:30.260
point 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:50.980
in time, if needed.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:04:00.010
