00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.910
On behalf of expertvillage.com, I am Tom Flowers,
owner of Well Tempered Piano Tuning and I

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.020
am here today to talk to you about piano tuning
and maintenance. We are going to take a look

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:18.150
inside now of the piano and moving from the
players position forward. We have a harp,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.429
this large metal cast iron typically which
is what this is. It is coated in super bronze

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:34.520
oxide. We have tuning pins for all roughly
225 strings. As you see the strings begin

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.700
with single strings into double strings into
triple strings on up to the top of the piano.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.990
Strings are not individual. This string begins
at this pin, comes around a hitch pin down

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.340
here and returns to the second pin. So it
is actually one piece of piano wire strung

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:01.280
at two points. The small objects here are
called agraphs. These keys keep the strings

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.110
at a particular level and distance from each
other. These are called the head bar or pressure

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.430
bar and this puts pressure on the strings
and gives them the proper down barring coming

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.380
up to the pins. These are the dampers. These
are what comes down once they are activated

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:29.380
and stops it. These are simple things happening
and sometimes not so simple operation as there

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.820
are many parts governing those processes.
It has a bridge with strings guiding over

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.560
to the hitch pin and everything is over a
soundboard which is typically made of ___

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.350
or engleman's spruce. In this case, it is
probably engleman. It does have some cracking.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:55.150
Kind of difficult not to have cracking in
nearly a hundred years of southwest dry air.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.810
It may not be a problem. Often it is said
that if a piano has a cracked soundboard,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.150
that it is over but that is really not the
case. If you cannot hear the crack and it

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.450
is not particular wonderful to look at but
it isn't a problem.
