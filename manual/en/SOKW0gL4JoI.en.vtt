00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.120
Now that we've got our ingredients prepped
and ready to assemble our enchiladas, we're

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.330
going to go ahead and get started. Remember
those tortillas we fried earlier? We're now

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.780
ready to use those. I'm going to lay on my
work area and I'm going to place a little

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.570
bit of chicken across the length of the enchilada.
I'm going to add a little bit more. The thing

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.650
is you don't want them to too full because
they're going to bake and with the cheese

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.640
they're going to absorb a lot of salsa as
well so try not to make them too full. That's

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.150
good about there. A little bit of cheese.
I'm just going to start rolling it. You just

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.199
want to make sure that you get the seam underneath
at the very bottom like that. I'm going to

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:46.450
start by just lining them down the length
of my baking dish. We're going to do another

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:54.190
one. Again, we're going to add our chicken
down the center of the enchiladas and add

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.100
about a tablespoon of that Monterey jack cheese.
Again, we're going to roll it. Whenever you

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.510
roll it, like at this point here, I'm actually
pulling all the ingredients so they're nice

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.860
and tight. If you do them loose it makes it
really hard to get them out of the baking

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:25.450
dish once they've been cooked versus keeping
them nice and tight.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.820
When we made these my mom would make tons
of these things and then freeze them. Whenever

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.590
we needed a quick dinner sometimes, she could
just put the whole thing into the oven. She

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.960
would thaw them out, put the whole thing in
the over, and we would have a really great

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.250
dinner. Keep that in mind if you're going
to make a big amount. Go ahead and make them,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.550
and you can freeze them, and they'll be ready
to go for you whenever you have an unexpected

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.140
guest. This one has got a tear in it, so I'll
show you how we're going to do that. It's

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.080
really, really easy. You don't have to throw
it away. We're going to go ahead and fill

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.500
it like normal. With the tear, I'm just going
to kind of do it together here so I can still

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:25.580
use this one, roll it, and make sure my tear
is underneath here. You want to make sure

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.200
that they're pretty snug in there, so I'm
going to go ahead and get one more in there.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.170
See how they're nice and firm and held together.
That way they bake like that as well. Again,

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.819
that helps them from rolling out whenever
we pull them out of the pan.
