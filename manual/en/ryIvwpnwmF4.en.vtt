Hi this is Debra Windsong with Expert Village.
In this clip I'll talk about making necklaces

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.780
with cord. There are several different kinds
of cord you can get--real leather, or you

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.760
can get something that simulates leather.
This here is plastic, and while I like to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.331
usually use all natural materials, I'm finding
that this is working a lot better to use the

00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:27.390
plastic, especially if you want to do some
kind of an opening, like on this necklace

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.710
where you slide to adjust and get it over
your head and slide back again. The leather

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.550
wears out after a while. Plastic is holding
up real well, so this cord is my favorite

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.860
right now. When it comes to cord work, the
cord is usually thick as far as beads go,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.530
so you'll have to have very large beads, or
else just hang a piece down from the cord.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.460
What I did do on this piece is braided the
cord, just to make it look a little different,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.979
and then wrapped it around this piece of rose
quartz. This one is a very thin cord. What

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.490
I chose to do with that is treat it like the
wire that I use for the other necklaces, and

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.180
use a crimp, and I use some knotting techniques
too to help hold beads in place. Here we have

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:30.390
a clasp, I actually made, it's just a copper
wire, and shaped the hook clasp. I used a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:41.140
piece like this that's made for leather and
cord. What you do is use your flat nosed pliers

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.759
and squeeze it right on there. I'll show you
how that works. You want to line your leather

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:54.539
cord up so that it's not interfering with
the opening. What you need to do is squeeze

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:03.010
one half at a time around the cord, just a
little bit, not all the way, and try to bring

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.980
the other side around the outside of that
half. At that point, you'll put a ring on

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:18.690
there on one side and then your trigger clasp
on the other side. So here's one already done,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:28.140
and you just thread your open ring, your open
jump ring, onto there and onto your hook clasp.
