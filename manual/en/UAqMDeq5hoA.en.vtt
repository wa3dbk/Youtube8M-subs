00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.680
Isaac Newton, God bless him for all the amazing things that he did,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.400
thought that our world was simpler than it actually was.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.140
When that apple fell off the tree, he thought that it was gravity that was pulling it...

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.300
Anyways, that was a good example of if not gravity, at least equal and opposite reaction stuff.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.680
The apple hit me and I moved away because the apple hit me in the head

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.800
That's what my head did. Equal and opposite reaction!

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.360
The energy had to go somewhere, and so it went into the apple.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.260
And if we drop this considerably damaged apple down into a bowl of water, the water would all fly up!

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.200
That's a Newtonian reaction. That's a fluid behaving in a way that Isaac Newton would expect it to.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.520
But what if, instead of splashing in the water, the water suddenly solidified and the apple bounced away?

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.680
That would be a fluid behaving in a non-Newtonian way. And if you went to the classic geek's birthday party

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.280
in Elementary school, you may have some experience with non-Newtonian fluid, and if you got really into it and got some of it on your clothes,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.280
you may have been experimenting with your first non-Newtonian bullet proof vest. This non-Newtonian fluid that you may have some experience with, was

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.600
probably mixed up by that geek's mom. It certainly was mixed up by my mom. Thanks, mom!

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.580
And she probably called it ooblek, which is a Geiselian term, meaning it was coined by Theodor Geisel, also known as Dr. Seuss.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:24.020
Simply mix together equal parts cornstarch and water and you have yourself a physical audity. It behaves like liquid when you stir it around or dip your finger in it,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.180
but give it a good smash with an apple and it suddenly solidifies. Fill up a big enough vat and you could run across the surface, but just stand on it and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:38.600
you'd sink like a... like a log? No... Logs don't sink! In physics, we call this a non-Newtonian fluid. And the concepts we're playing with are those of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.380
viscosity and shear. Particles in a Newtonian fluid generally stay the same distance from another so viscosity always stays the same.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.940
In a non-Newtonian fluid, when you apply pressure, the particles actually clump together into pattern-regular forms. It's almost as if they're temporarily

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.520
turning into a little crystal. In your oobleck, it's the cornstarch bits that bind together to solidify the goo. The harder you hit, the harder it gets, but

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.100
just for a millisecond and then it returns to a liquid again. But here's the question, what if we could make clothes the same way? Clothes that are

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:13.020
flexible and easy to wear, comfortable, but become extremely rigid upon being hit by something moving very fast, like a bullet.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.400
Non-Newtonian body armor uses some more complicated chemistry, but it's basically the same thing.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.740
Kevlar, the fibers that make up a kevlar vest, are actually strands of a non-newtonian fluid, so viscous that it's practically a solid.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.980
Unfortunately, as you've seen, kevlar vests are a little bit too stiff for comfort and they certainly can't go down over your arms and your legs.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:41.440
And I mean that's great because most of the really important stuff is in here and also up here a little bit, but protect this part, pretty.. Doing a lot

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:49.820
better, but, you know, frankly, if my choice is get shot in the chest or the arm, I'm gonna take the arm. But if my choice is get shot in the arm or not shot, I

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:57.600
would go for the circumstance in which I don't have a bullet inside of me. So what they're doing now, is dipping kevlar fibers into non-Newtonian fluids,

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.720
the most common one being silica dissolved in a polyethylene-glycol gel. And thanks to science, putting on a bullet proof vest could be as easy...

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:14.240
As that. Bullet proof hoodie! And then you got head protection too! Check it out! If there's like, really something in your way, give it a good like...

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.800
YEAAH! I'm safe now. No bullets allowed! I'm not actually safe from bullets.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.400
Luckily, I don't really need to be. Thank you for joining us, and I hope you learned something.
