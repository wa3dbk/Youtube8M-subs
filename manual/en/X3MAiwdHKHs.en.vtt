Hello I am Sarolta Eke. Hello I'm Tamas Kassai,
we are here on behalf of Expert Village. We

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:19.020
are going to teach you how to dance Waltz.
The lady's step is continuous with the whisk

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:33.149
and cross hesitation would look like this,
1-2-3. Once more 1-2-3. The rise and fall

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.410
for this step, commence to rise at the end
of 1, continue to rise on 2, continue to rise

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:49.070
on 3 and at the end of 3 go down. The foot
position, left foot forward and across, right

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:59.699
foot to side and close left foot to right
foot. The foot technique for this step is

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:12.230
heel toe, toe, toe heel. The rise and fall
commence to rise at end of 1, continue to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:31.710
rise on 2 and 3 and at the end of 3 lower.
1-2-3, once more 1-2-3, and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:52.850
once again 1-2-3. Just take care that your
head should go from the right to the left,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:16.199
1-2-3. 1-2-3, 1-2-3, once more 1-2-3.
