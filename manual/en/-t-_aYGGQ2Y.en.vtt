00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.330
This is the innovative Sierra Designs Backcountry
Bed.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.790
You can see we have got two different versions
of the bed here in front of us and, actually,

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.370
it comes in a number of different varieties,
different rates of fill, different temperature

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.490
ratings for different purposes.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.070
But there are shared features across the line
that make the Backcountry Bed different than

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.960
any sleeping bag you have ever seen.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.160
Before we touch on some of those unique features,
let's talk about the fabrication of the Backcountry

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.160
Bed.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.809
So we have got polyester rip stop fabric on
the exterior and a taffeta lining so nice

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.640
comfort inside, nice durability on the outside.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.950
The Backcountry Bed utilizes duck down and
it is DriDown duck down insulation.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:58.539
So what you are getting is that compressibility,
that excellent, excellent thermal efficiency

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:04.820
that you would expect from a down insulation,
but the DriDown treatment ensures that this

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.010
is highly water resistant, comparative to
what you would get from a non-treated down.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.010
So you are getting the warmth.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.810
You are getting the compressibility, but you
are also getting all weather performance that

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.750
you wouldn't have without that DriDown insulation.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.910
The bag we have got in front of us is a 600
fill bad.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.940
Sierra Designs does also offer these bags
in an 800 fill.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.430
A bit pricier with that more premium down.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.410
They are also more compressible and lighter
in weight.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.540
This 600 fill three season bag that we are
looking at here, three pounds, one once for

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.700
the regular length.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.210
So still a great option for three season back
packing.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.250
Some really obvious design features not the
Backcountry Bed that separates it from other

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.810
options that are out there starting with his
big, broad, unusual opening on the face of

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.110
the bag itself.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.670
This is a sown in down comforter.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.430
So it peels away from the interior, folds
down, but is stitched in place.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.430
So it is secure.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.789
It is a zipper less bag.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.319
There is no side zippered entry to this bag.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.500
It doesn't throw open in that regard.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.760
But the comforter folds down.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.730
It actually makes it really, really easy to
get in and out of this bag.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.519
It also gives it a lot of venting options.

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.090
The hood certainly is non traditional.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.550
You can see it is just a straight cut across
the top of the bag.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.209
My concern was initially on this bag was:
Can it possibly retain its thermal efficiency?

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.350
Used this for a few days last summer up in
Colorado and it does.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.350
It does.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.060
It made a believer out of me.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.430
The comforter itself has sewn in, integrated
hand warmer pockets.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.600
That also enables you to pull that comforter
in around you and seals it nicely within the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.600
bag itself.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.930
I didn't get cold air into the bag.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.209
I was pleasantly surprised by that.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.719
It was just as warm as the temperature rating
would suggest, even with that down comforter.

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:10.190
Upside of that was it gave me all kinds of
venting options, to get an arm out.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.349
I could get both arms out.

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:17.400
I could even sneak a leg out and put it completely
outside of the bag.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.510
In addition to that there is a foot vent here
at the ... near the bottom of the sleeping

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.510
bag.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.569
It is not like where I have seen it before,
a zipper, a fly to the bottom that you can

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.370
fiddle in and get in and out of.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.049
No zipper, just a pass through with overlapping
insulation that retains that warmth when you

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.950
need it, but lets you hang a foot out when
temperatures climb a little bit and you just

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.010
need to cool off just a tiny bit.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.430
Vent that bag just enough to keep you comfortable.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.480
A couple of other quick features to mention.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.069
As I peal this back, you can see a sleeping
pad beneath the bag.

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.849
There is an integrated sleeve to hold a pad
in place.

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.290
The pad certain-ly does not come with the
bag, but whatever you have got will fit inside

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.499
that sleeve and ensure that the pad stays
underneath you all night long for enhanced

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:11.499
comfort.

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:16.580
The bag does come in differing lengths so
that depending on your height go with a different

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.580
length.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.299
You will find a comfortable fit inside the
bag.

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.050
It does taper to save weight similar to a
mummy style bag, but a lot more room here

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.090
at the head.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.889
Each Backcountry Bed does come with its own
stuff sack and mesh storage sack.

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.639
Keep in mind you never want to store a sleeping
bag in its compressed state.

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:40.360
Just seeing the feature set, the DriDown insulation,
the sown in down comforter of the back country

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.669
bed, I am sure you can see why we are so excited
by this offering and why we are certain it

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.000
is going to appeal to all types of backcountry
users.
