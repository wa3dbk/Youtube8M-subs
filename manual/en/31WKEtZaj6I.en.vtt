00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.480
Hi!

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.270
Welcome to 'Lachlan Likes a Thing', a show
where I take a thing and see whether or not

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.270
I like it.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.519
Now, the thing that we're looking at in this
video is the Beats By Dr. Dre Mixr portable

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.009
on-ear headphones.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.519
Now, for those of you who have been watching
my videos for some time, you might be a bit

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.689
surprised to see me reviewing a Beats product,
considering that the company is not exactly

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.570
fantastically well-known for sound-quality.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.020
I think it's important to be aware that Beats,
as a company has a 64% market share of the

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.739
premium headphone category, and, you know,
the company was able to single-handedly demonstrate

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.280
that the average consumer was willing to put
down quite a lot of money for portable headphones.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.910
So I think if you're going to have an informed
and - and open opinion on, you know the state

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.131
of the headphone market as it is today, you
can't really just ignore, or, you know kind

00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:56.340
of mindlessly bash a brand that, you know,
over half of consumers are buying when they

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.750
go out to buy a pair of fancy headphones.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.850
And you can't really judge it from a one-minute
store demo either.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.970
So, with that in mind, I bought a pair of
these, the Beats Mixr's, these are my first

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.510
Beats headphones, and I got these because,
you know for one thing, they're relatively

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.230
subtle, in terms of design, and the other
thing is that, the reviews that have been

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.070
floating around that I've read on the internet
have been relatively positive in terms of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.030
sound quality for these headphones.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.350
So, I've had these for about a month now and
actually I've been a little bit surprised.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.070
First of all, build quality for the Beats
Mixr's has been pretty impressive.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.130
These are meant to be a DJ headphone, and
for the money you get a mixture of metals

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.560
and plastics that feels really solid, feels
really durable.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.680
It actually feels better than the virtually
all plastic Sony MDR-1R, though it's not quite

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.680
as nice in terms of fit and finish as something
like the Sennheiser Momentum.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.670
As I said, I think these are relatively subtle,
in terms of their design, they come in a number

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.379
of different colors now, and they have a number
of design features which I think are worth

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.379
a closer look.

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.170
So with the Mixr's the cables are detachable,
and you get two headphone cables.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.469
You get a coiled DJ-style cable and you get
a normal straight cable with an iPhone remote.

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:25.730
Now what's cool about this cable is that you
can actually attach it to either side, either

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.159
ear-cup, because there's jacks on both, and
what's cool about the jack is that it's not

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:34.569
recessed in any way, it's a standard 3.5mm
jack, so if you break the cable, you can pretty

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.760
much replace it with any off-the-shelf 3.5mm
cable.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.760
So that's really cool.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.470
The other nice thing about the MixRs is that
the ear-cups swivel up, so you can fold it

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.330
all up into this nice little compact shape.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.180
Because the ear-cups swivel up individually,
you can actually do neat little things like

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.040
wear the headphone on one side of your head,
which again I suppose is useful if you're

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.040
a DJ.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.200
Now this actually brings me to my biggest
complaint about the Beats Mixr's, which is

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.150
that they're just not very comfortable at
all.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.550
The clamping force on the Mixr's is very very
high, and the ear-pads, even thought they're

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.940
quite soft and supple, they're not very thick.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.300
So you can actually feel parts of the headphone
frame just pressing right on top of your ear,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.239
with quite a lot of force.

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.120
Again, I suppose if you're a DJ, this is a
good thing, because the headphones are secure

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.629
on your head and theres a lot of external
noise isolation, but personally for me, especially

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.489
because I wear glasses, I just find them really
uncomfortable.

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.239
I can wear them for about an hour before I
have to take them off because my ears start

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.519
getting sore.

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.639
Now, supposedly the Mixr's were designed in
collaboration with David Guetta, and I don't

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.840
know if Guetta's head is especially tiny or
something, but I just found these uncomfortable,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.290
and i you are interested in them, I do recommend
that you just try them on first and just make

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.499
sure that you're not going to find them too
uncomfortable.

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:07.060
This is actually really surprising to me that
these are so uncomfortable because I would

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.591
have thought that Beats would have nailed
it as far as comfort was concerned for the

00:04:12.591 --> 00:04:19.110
average consumer, and I really don't think
that this headphone, which given the design

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.690
and the retail availability, they really intend
it only to be sold to DJs.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.010
So if my biggest complaint is about the comfort
of the MixRs, then, does that mean I don't

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.940
have any complaints about the sound?

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.760
Well, actually, kind of.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.130
I actually think that the Mixr's sound decent
for the price.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:43.470
They definitely do have a bassy and warm tone,
but not in a way that just sounds so bassy

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.870
that they sound bloated or overblown.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.631
They actually have quite a lot of energy in
the mids and the vocals, and actually, my

00:04:53.631 --> 00:04:59.500
one issues with the Mixr's is that at times
this energy is just too aggressive.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.050
They can sound at higher volumes quite indistinct
and splashy, the vocals get too aggressive.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:13.060
Now, to me I think thats actually preferable
to a headphone that actually sounds too bassy

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.200
but theres not much treble so it ends up sounding
dull, something like the Skullcandy Navigator

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.410
or the Logitech UE4000 sound like that.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.420
In comparison I think the Mixr's with their
aggressive tone actually work quite well with

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.420
a lot of music.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.210
Funnily enough, I enjoyed them more with slower,
acoustic tracks than I did with the electronic

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.180
or dance tracks that supposedly these headphones
were designed for.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.940
Now, of course, the Mixr's are a relatively
expensive headphone, and while I think that

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.410
the build quality and the sound quality are
about right for the price, I really find comfort

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.460
to be a huge issue with these headphones.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:56.160
Now if I was looking for a bassy pair of headphones,
I would personally prefer the Sennheiser Momentums,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.420
or the Audio Technica ES10.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.570
Now, I think that both of these headphones
are awesome looking headphones, they have

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.630
a bit of a smoother sound than the MixRs,
they have a bit of a defined sound, while

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.610
they still have quite a lot of bass.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.360
So I would prefer these if you were looking
for a bassy headphone, and I actually have

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.550
reviews up of both of these headphones, so
check them out on my channel if these look

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.550
good to you.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.170
Now if you're after a nice looking pair of
headphones with bait more of a flatter or

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:30.060
a bit more of a neutral sound, then these
are the Audio Technica ES700s which Audio

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.050
Technica Australia has very kindly loaned
me for review.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.370
I'll have a review of these up soon, but I
can tell you they're very nice headphones

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.330
so if you haven't already, subscribe to my
channel and you'll be updated when that review

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.520
is uploaded.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.470
Back to the MixRs though, if you love the
look of these headphones, or, you have to

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.350
get headphones for someone who just has to
have Beats, I actually think these aren't

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.570
too bad in terms of sound quality.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:02.220
Just make sure you try them on first, so you
know how comfort is going to work for you.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.660
Anyway, I have a Facebook page now, where
