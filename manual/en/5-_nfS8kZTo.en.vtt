00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.260
Hey guys Iâ€™m here to present to you another Chiptronic equipment

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.320
first of all my name is Luciano, I work in the field of training

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.340
and today I'm here to talk about a release that Chiptronic made recently

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.820
and it was presented at the Automec

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.760
that is the equipment that we have available, ECU TEST DIESEL PRO

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.420
but what is that? What does it do in fact? 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.780
Well we have here with it the possibility to test on bench

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.620
several modules of the injection system for diesel line

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.280
We have here with this equipment the possibility to test individually 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.480
sensors, actuators for each system

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.100
and do a full scan of how the module is behaving to receive feeds

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.380
, receive the stimuli similar to the truck, we have the possibility to put here

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:19.640
In addition to this equipment here we have the possibility also to make a specific test in each module

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.060
we have here a serie of 4 modules which we're doing

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.800
including power we have available here a EDC7 to do the demonstration test

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.460
What is the advantage? Or what would be the difference of this equipment?

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.260
First thing, you can make a more effective repair and principally a more accurate test on the modules

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:49.520
 when you do a repair on a central it is possible you put in that equipment and scan,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.200
 checking to see if in fact the module has been fixed or not

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.760
You don't need the truck, maybe you don't need to run after

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.260
catching a truck from somewhere else to do the test

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.220
get the bench module you'll be able to do that

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.440
 So let's do some brief demonstrations of the use of the equipment

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.920
and how it will behave getting tested here in the EDC7 system 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.500
that is a Ford Cummins

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.260
OK, so now let's turn on our ECU TEST DIESEL PRO

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.400
Let's make the automaker's selection, we have here available: Mercedes, Scania, Volvo 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.113
and Ford, of course,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.240
our system here is a EDC7, let's make the connection

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.440
first line 30, line 15 now

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.640
let's make the connection of the relevant main relay and start

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.020
ready, now we can observe the injectors that are already in operation

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.940
so now that this is connected our system we will do a brief demo

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.400
using a multi-brand scanner, in our case we use the dieseldiag

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.900
and we're going to do a variation of the sensors and show on screen how it will behave

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.320
as the central will react when receiving these stimuli

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.660
first we will vary the throttle pedal

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.220
here we have its variation, it goes from 0 to 100%

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.120
Shortly thereafter we will be able to vary the water temperature here

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.180
note the parameter as I'm doing here, the modification

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.800
in our Dieseldiag we have a different parameter

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.180
Air temperature, the same thing

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.260
I can vary and observe how central this is reacting to these stimuli, to these signals

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.600
We also have here fuel temperature

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.280
Oil temperature is then varying, up to the maximum value

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.660
Air pressure, it would be in the case of turbo pressure here on our scanner

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.460
And finally, in the rail pressure observed also that in our reading parameter there is a modification

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.520
The objective which I do this variation is to find a defect in

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.520
the sensor signals or even mass of each individual sensor

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.400
Very well, then the variation of sensors we have the option of also 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.580
do specific tests in some actuators

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.480
we have the brake motor where you can view the status of enabled or disabled

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.280
and cruise control which is another type of system that we have in EDC7

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.540
I can turn on and off

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.660
and I can also see the return and acceleration

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.480
in case there are keys that we have for the cruise control drive

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.100
As I push the return we can observe the status in Dieseldiag 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.900
that cruise control active will make the return to the initial pattern

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.280
and then I have the option to make the acceleration

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.540
So, these are simple tests that I can be making 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:35.280
and verifying how the central behaves when asked these two types of operation

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.180
Another detail worth noting is that the ECU TEST DIESEL PRO 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.680
is the only equipment that is capable of generating real electric consumption

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.300
in other words, it is like the motor module was really working on the vehicle
