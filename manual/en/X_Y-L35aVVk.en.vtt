00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.885
JARMAINE: Joining this DanceOn
competition kind

00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:03.720
of struck me first.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.600
I was scared.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.300
Because the last time I danced
I ended up whacking her face

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.340
with a tribal stick.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.140
I didn't mean to.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.448
She was the one who
punched me first.

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:12.698
Don't mess with my
moves, girl.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.400
IAN EASTWOOD: Hello.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.096
JARMAINE: Hi.

00:00:28.096 --> 00:00:29.040
IAN EASTWOOD: Hi.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.800
JARMAINE: I was asking somebody
what you looked like,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.290
and somebody said, some
tall, skinny kid.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.740
IAN EASTWOOD: That's me.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.738
Yes, I'm the tall,
skinny kid, Ian.

00:00:33.738 --> 00:00:34.182
Very nice to meet you.

00:00:34.182 --> 00:00:35.070
JARMAINE: Wow.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.790
I've never been in
a dance studio.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:37.780
It looks weird.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.610
IAN EASTWOOD: When I first see
Jarmaine's YouTube videos, I

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.070
get so confused as to how all
that happens on your face.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.110
I just I thought it was
just kind of like

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.060
bah, color, ah, color.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.760
But she makes it more
fun and interesting.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.868
JARMAINE: I've always considered
myself poised.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.110
I think that's why they're so
popular because she gives

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.200
really great advice.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.570
But she also delivers it in a
funny, cute, charming way.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.050
The concept of our
piece, you're

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.730
coming into a shoe store.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.390
JARMAINE: A shoe store.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.510
IAN EASTWOOD: Yeah,
a shoe store.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.520
I'm the shoe salesman,
I guess.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.730
And I sell you on it.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.970
And by the end, we dance
together and have little break

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:19.612
down together.

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:20.938
JARMAINE: Wait, it's just
you and me together?

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:21.159
IAN EASTWOOD: No, no, I'm
dancing with you.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:21.380
Yes.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.822
JARMAINE: Oh yay.

00:01:21.822 --> 00:01:23.150
IAN EASTWOOD: Yeah,
partner ah.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.010
JARMAINE: First I thought I was
going to be intimidated by

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.962
Ian because he's got
some dance skills--

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:29.710
with next to no skills.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.500
And then I started to break out
of my discomfort with the

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.380
whole meeting him.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.700
It was like music chemistry
but people chemistry.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.150
And I was just like, oh, can we
dance outside the studio?

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.620
IAN EASTWOOD: Have this song
called "Get Out My Shoes."

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.690
JARMAINE: "Get Out My
Shoes." Is it fast?

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.245
IAN EASTWOOD: It's
a little fast.

00:01:46.245 --> 00:01:46.880
JARMAINE: Oh no.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.340
So the last time I danced,
we were doing

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.130
Little Mermaid, tutus--

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.960
failed.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.992
I was not meant to be a dancer
because I have a stiff body.

00:01:56.992 --> 00:01:58.280
I move awkwardly.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.840
IAN EASTWOOD: An eight count,
a dance by yourself

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.590
before this, OK?

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.940
JARMAINE: Eight count.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.600
IAN EASTWOOD: Yeah,
one eight count.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.550
JARMAINE: I learned that.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.725
IAN EASTWOOD: One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:04.500
JARMAINE: OK.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.530
IAN EASTWOOD: One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.580
JARMAINE: Why do you do it
with more rhythm than me?

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.860
IAN EASTWOOD: I'm a dancer.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.590
Five, six--

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.740
JARMAINE: Wait.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.160
What am I doing?

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.550
IAN EASTWOOD: Just the legs.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.590
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.820
Sometimes you have to teach
things in certain parts.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.510
And I taught her the legs first
and then the arms, so

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.680
it's easier to add
things slowly.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.800
Two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.200
Pull your body, now
use your body.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.520
Yeah.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.750
Don't fight your body.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.420
Right now--

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.110
JARMAINE: Like, drop
your body?

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.280
IAN EASTWOOD: You and your
body are going like this,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.130
you're boxing.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.810
You and your body are just
boxing each other.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.030
JARMAINE: Like we're two
different limbs.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.580
IAN EASTWOOD: Yeah.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.470
Don't think so much.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.490
You're thinking so much
in your head.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.790
JARMAINE: I'm thinking
awkward.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.630
Ian says I fight my body.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.130
Like I have a demon inside me.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.610
Oh.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.050
IAN EASTWOOD: You
gotta catch it.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.010
One.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.500
JARMAINE: One.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.895
IAN EASTWOOD: Yeah.

00:02:52.895 --> 00:02:55.090
One, two, three, four, can.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.995
Hold, hold, can.

00:02:56.995 --> 00:02:57.490
Hold.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.740
JARMAINE: Like, OK, how
many Mississippis?

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.880
How many Mississippis?

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.340
Like two?

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.975
IAN EASTWOOD: Oh, no.

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:05.520
It doesn't work like that.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.222
One, two, then out and an up--

00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:08.670
JARMAINE: Oh, I have to
keep moving my feet?

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.500
IAN EASTWOOD: --and a down.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.820
Yes, you have to keep
moving your feet.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.760
That's the rule.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.700
JARMAINE: It's like
this thing right?

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.110
IAN EASTWOOD: Yeah, kind of.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.140
But it actually works.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.030
Jarmaine has problems
moving her arms and

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.240
feet at the same time.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.680
And that is a problem as a
dancer because you have to use

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.900
your whole body all the time,
at the same time.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.240
Ta, ta-ta, and ta, ta-ta.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.920
JARMAINE: Oh, I'm confused.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.780
IAN EASTWOOD: So when you do
this, you don't want to look

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.860
and see someone look like
their thinking.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.200
You want to watch someone
just in their element.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.120
JARMAINE: Like just fuse.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.000
IAN EASTWOOD: I don't know
what that was, but yes.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.435
JARMAINE: I don't like somebody
to act professional

00:03:45.435 --> 00:03:46.630
around me all the time.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.810
I don't do well with
professional people.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.665
I like to treat everybody
like they're my friend.

00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:52.710
And so I felt that with Ian.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.440
And so once that comfortability
happened, it

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.530
was like all right, what
do we have to do?

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.776
IAN EASTWOOD: And arms, and
arms, and yes, and yes!

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:03.764
JARMAINE: Ooh.

00:04:03.764 --> 00:04:04.258
IAN EASTWOOD: Yes.

00:04:04.258 --> 00:04:05.246
JARMAINE: Got it.

00:04:05.246 --> 00:04:06.240
IAN EASTWOOD: That was it.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.920
JARMAINE: Watch me
lose it just now.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.130
Like what you saw?

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.380
Like right now.
