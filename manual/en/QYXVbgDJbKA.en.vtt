00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:08.174
- WELCOME TO THIS WEEK'S
ELIMINATION TATTOO.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:12.812
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO SHOW US
THAT YOU DESERVE $100,000,

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.614
A FEATURE IN<i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.383
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:19.285
THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING GRADATION.

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.988 line:0%
- GRADATION IS GOING
FROM SUPER DARK TO SUPER LIGHT

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.557 line:0%
AND HAVING A NICE,
SMOOTH TRANSITION IN BETWEEN.

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:27.227 line:0%
- THERE IS NO BETTER TEST
OF GRADATION

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.997 line:0%
THAN A BLACK AND GRAY TATTOO.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.066 line:0%
- I'M KNOWN
FOR BOLD COLOR TATTOOS,

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:34.901 line:0%
NOT MY BLACK AND GRAY WORK.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.403 line:0%
THIS IS GONNA BE TOUGH.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:39.005
- IF YOUR BLACKS AREN'T DARK
ENOUGH TO SMOOTHLY TRANSITION

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.242
TO LIGHT TONES,
YOU WILL NOT ACHIEVE GRADATION,

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:45.645
AND YOUR TATTOO WILL END UP
A GRAY, UNREADABLE MESS.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.580 line:0%
- IF YOU DON'T HAVE
THAT GRADATION,

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.082 line:0%
EVERYTHING JUST LOOKS THE SAME.

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:52.352
- IN EVERY ELIMINATION TATTOO,
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE TATTOOING

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.588
HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH AT LEAST ONE
OTHER ARTIST.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:56.990
TODAY, NOT ONLY

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:59.759
ARE YOU ALL GOING
HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH EACH OTHER,

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:03.096
YOU MUST ALSO TATTOO
HEAD-TO-HEAD

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.964
WITH OUR GUEST JUDGE.

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:07.367
- WHAT THE [bleep]?

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.269
- MR. TOMMY MONTOYA.

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:12.505
- OH, JESUS.

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.607
- I'M KNOWN FOR PORTRAITS
IN BLACK AND GRAY.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.143
COMING HERE AS A GUEST JUDGE
AND TATTOOING--

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:18.578
THESE ARTISTS ARE WATCHING ME.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.246
THE WORLD'S GONNA
BE WATCHING ME.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.215 line:0%
I'M GONNA REALLY
HAVE TO TURN IT UP.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.783 line:0%
- WHAT'S UP, GUYS?
- HEY, TOMMY.

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:25.418 line:0%
- TO COMPETE
AGAINST TOMMY MONTOYA,

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:27.320 line:0%
ONE OF MY HEROES, IN BLACK
AND GRAY,

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:28.321 line:0%
IS NOT ONLY AN HONOR,

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:30.290 line:0%
BUT I AM SCARED [bleep].

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:33.093
- TODAY, WHILE YOU DESIGN
AND TATTOO YOUR CANVAS,

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:37.597
TOMMY WILL ALSO DESIGN
AND TATTOO AT THE SAME TIME.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.598
- THAT'S CRAZY.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.100
- IN CRITIQUE, YOUR TATTOOS

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:43.036
WILL BE DIRECTLY COMPARED
TO TOMMY'S TATTOO.

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.804
- OH, MY GOD.

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:47.674 line:0%
TOMMY MONTOYA
IS RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED.

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:49.576
I AM PANICKING.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.413
- AND YOU MUST TATTOO
ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:56.282
BLACK AND GRAY IMAGES:

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.384
CHRIST ON THE CROSS.

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:00.720
- OH.

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:01.788
- WHAT THE [bleep]?

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:04.190 line:0%
JESUS IS SUCH
A RECOGNIZABLE IMAGE,

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:06.593 line:0%
ANY MISTAKES ARE GONNA BE SEEN
FROM A MILE AWAY.

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.394
THE ROOM FOR ERROR
JUST GOT SMALLER.

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:11.064
- YOU'LL BE JUDGED
BY OLIVER PECK, CHRIS NUÃ‘EZ,

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:13.333
TOMMY MONTOYA, AND MYSELF.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.168
BUT WE'RE NOT YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:18.371
EACH WEEK, YOU'LL ALSO
BE JUDGED BY AMERICA.

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:20.840
VIEWERS AT HOME
WILL SCOUR EVERY DETAIL

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:24.978

AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:31.050
AMERICA'S VOTE
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.585
AT THE LIVE FINALE.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.020
LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:40.660
THERE IS ONE CANVAS HERE
WHO'S OFF-LIMITS.

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:43.163
WIDE RECEIVER
FOR THE NEW ORLEANS SAINTS,

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:46.099
HE'S TOMMY'S CANVAS TODAY,

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:48.835
MR. KENNY STILLS.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:55.375 line:0%
- I'M EXCITED
TO GET TATTOOED BY TOMMY.

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:58.611
HE'S THE MAN, AND I THINK THAT
IT'S A PERFECT PIECE FOR HIM.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:02:59.946
- THAT'S WHAT'S UP.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.081
- MARK,
YOU WON THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:05.718
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES,

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.820
SO BE SURE TO LOOK OUT
FOR YOURSELF.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.022
- ALL RIGHT.

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:10.290 line:0%
ALL CLEEN'S BEEN DOING
IS WALKING AROUND,

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.858 line:0%
BEING CUTTHROAT, AND TELLING
EVERYBODY THEY SUCK.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:13.459
IT'S TIME FOR PAYBACK.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.028
I GOT THE SKULL PICKS,
AND NOW IT'S MY TIME TO SHINE.

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:16.696
WHERE DO YOU WANT YOUR JESUS?
- ON MY SHIN.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.498
- ARE YOU OPEN TO
SOMEBODY CHANGING YOUR MIND?

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.400
- NO.
- WHAT ABOUT IF THEY SAY,

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.035
"I'D LIKE TO MOVE IT
TO AN EASIER SPOT"?

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:23.736
- NO, I'M PRETTY SURE.
- HE'S BEING VERY DELIBERATE.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.871
- WHAT IF THEY TELL YOU
IT'S GONNA HURT?

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:26.139
- I KNOW IT'S GONNA HURT.

00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:28.274 line:0%
- CLEARLY, I MADE A BIG
IMPRESSION ON THE OTHER ARTISTS

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:29.742 line:0%
BY CONTINUOUSLY MOVING
THE PLACEMENT.

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:31.744
- WHERE DO YOU WANT IT?
- ON THE SIDE--RIB, RIGHT HERE.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:32.979
- YOU GONNA LET
ANYONE TALK YOU OUT OF IT?

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:34.080
- NO.

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:35.748
- EVERYONE HERE SHOULD GET
WHAT THEY WANT.

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:37.016
- MM-HMM.
- YOU'RE THE CANVASES.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.318
YOU SHOULD TELL THESE ARTISTS,

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:40.353
"NO ONE'S GONNA STOP ME
FROM GETTING WHAT I WANT."

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:42.689
- THE DUDE JUST DID A TOTAL 180.

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.591 line:0%
INSTEAD OF BEING,
"OH, NAMASTE.

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:45.925 line:0%
MY NAME'S MARK.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:46.926 line:0%
EVERYTHING'S COOL,"

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.127 line:0%
A LITTLE BIG OF PIGS' BLOOD,

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.862 line:0%
AND IT ALL WENT TO HIS BRAIN.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:53.029
- I WANT THE CROSS
GOING STRAIGHT DOWN THE BACK,
