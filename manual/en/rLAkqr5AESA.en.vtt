00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.880
A domain name, such as www.freewebstore.org,
is the address that people use to find your

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.430
store online.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.270
It's what you type into a browser's address
bar when you want to visit a specific website.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.020
When a store is created, we automatically
provide a unique address for it, based on

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.680
the freewebstore.org domain name.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.680
For example, something like www.freewebstore.org/mystorename.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.530
You don't have to use this address, though,
and you're free to obtain your own domain

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.640
name at any time, and link that to your store
instead.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.420
In fact, we recommend that you obtain your
own unique domain name, as, not only does

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.980
it give your store a more professional image,
it can also help your store perform a little

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.719
better on search engines, like Google.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.980
There are a large number of websites that
you can use to cheaply register a domain name.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.789
Some of the more popular choices include www.GoDaddy.com
and www.123-Reg.co.uk.

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.170
Both of these domain name registrars also
offer full DNS Management as standard, which

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.030
is something that will come in useful a little
later.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.110
Once you've decided where you want to register
your domain name, you'll need to have a think

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.830
about what domain name you want to use.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.369
All domain name registrars should allow you
to search for the domain you had in mind,

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.509
to check if it is available and find out if
it has already been registered by someone

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:23.560
else.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.979
To help your store perform well on search
engines, it can be a good idea to include

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.720
words that you think your customers may search
for, if possible.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.090
Domain names can't be bought; instead, they
are leased or hired for a set period of time,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.369
typically 1 or 2 years.

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.709
When that time is up, the current owner has
the option to renew their registration.

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.030
Once you have found a domain name you want
to register, select the length of time you

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.810
want to register it for, and add it to your
basket.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.599
Some domain name registrars also suggest other
similar domain names when you search, so make

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:57.619
sure that you are only registering the one
you want.

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.030
Once you have decided on your domain name
and have added it to your basket, continue

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.380
through the registration and payment process.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.030
After you have registered your domain name,
you'll need to carry out a few "DNS" changes

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.569
to the domain name, in order to point it to
your store.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.940
In this example, we'll take a look at how
to do this using the 123-Reg control panel,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.849
but we also provide a video showing how to
manage the DNS of a domain name registered

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.489
through GoDaddy.

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.860
Once in the 123-Reg control panel, you'll
see a "Your domains" dropdown menu containing

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.349
your domain name.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.370
With your domain name selected in the dropdown
menu, click the "Manage" button.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.370
On the next page, select the "Manage DNS"
option under the "Advanced Domain Settings"

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.609
heading.

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.180
Then, click the "Advanced DNS" tab.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.290
You'll then be shown a list of all current
DNS records. If your domain name still uses

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.269
the default settings, there should be two records
shown.

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.900
The first record shows an "@" in the
"DNS Entry" column.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.640
We need to update this to change the numbers
shown in the "Destination/Target" column.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.409
These number are known as an IP Address.

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.409
To do this, simply click on Pencil Icon on
the right, and the fields will become editable.

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:20.409
We can then update the "Destination/Target"
to use the following values:

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.700
91.201.200.10

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.700
Once that has been updated, click the "Save"
button.

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:37.340
The second record in the list shows "www"
in the "DNS Entry" column. We need to completely

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.519
remove this record and then create another
in its place.

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.739
To do this, click on the Trash Can icon to
the right.

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.989
Once that record has been deleted, we can
use the fields below to add a new entry.

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.469
In the "Hostname" box, enter "www".

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:54.780
Next, select "CNAME" from the "Type" dropdown
menu.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.780
Finally, enter "shop.freewebstore.org." in
the "Destination" field. Please ensure that

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.629
you include the final "." at the end of
that address.

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.319
Some domain name registrars require it, others
don't, but it's best to try to include it.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.090
If it isn't required, most registrars will
remove it for you or display a warning message

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.060
about it.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.060
Once the DNS record has been entered, click
the "Add new entry" button.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.289
It can take up to 48 hours for the DNS changes
to filter through and become active, although

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.599
it generally only takes a few hours.

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.479
Because of this, we recommend you take a break
at this point and return to attach your domain

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.150
name to your store a little later.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.870
Once enough time has passed, login to your
control panel and visit the Marketing &gt; Domain

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.599
Name section.

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:48.870
Just work through the steps shown on the page:
"Do you already have a domain name?" - yes.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.370
In Step 2, you're asked where you registered
the domain name. We'll then show specific

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.699
help information, explaining how to carry
out the required DNS changes for that registrar.

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.380
As we have already done this, we can move
straight on to Step 3.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.870
We just need to enter the domain name and
click "Continue".

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.240
The system then performs a check to make sure
the DNS changes have propagated.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.960
In this example, we can see that the changes
have filtered through, so we just need to

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.250
confirm and the domain name will be attached
to the store.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.770
If you encounter a problem at this stage,
you may simply need to wait a while longer

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.720
for the DNS changes to propagate. Remember,
this can take up to 48 hours.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.590
If you continue to experience problems with
this, feel free to contact our Support Team,

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.780
and we'll do our best to help.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.180
And that's it. Once attached correctly, you
should see your store when you visit your

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.819
domain name.
