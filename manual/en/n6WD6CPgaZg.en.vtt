00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
Linkara: Reign blasts the supervillain away with a psionic blast, and Kodiak thinks he's done for.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.460
When he gets too close to where Elemental crashed, he of course gets knocked aside like the idiot he is.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.320
Geez, Kodiak gets smacked around more than Worf from "Star Trek".

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.440
Elemental says

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.200
Elemental: It is time I put an END to this foolishness...

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.280
Linkara: Oh, good, the comic's over already! Well, let me just go and–

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.920
Oh, no, of course not, it's just your standard villain dialog.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.920
Dash yells that she's got an idea.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.960
Yeah, here's an idea: you're a speedster, so why don't you punch him a hundred times in a second?

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.580
Exit: Dash?!! It sure would be nice if you'd let us in on your plan before taking off!!

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.580
Reign: No kidding! Especially when Element-Lad here is bent on making us a permanent part of the floor!

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.840
Linkara: Wh?.. "Element-Lad"?! Is an Image comic actually referencing a DC Comics' character?

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.600
Reign: What's the matter, Elemental?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.440
Afraid to get up close and personal?

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.740
Why not come down here and fight like a man?

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.700
Linkara: Don't you mean "fight like a NEW man"?

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.480
Elemental: One of my power is far beyond reliance on mere physical combat!

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.100
Linkara (as Elemental): I can simply stare at you to death instead!

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.000
(normal): Dash suddenly zips past Elemental, having grabbed the breathing tubes from his face.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.900
Although, why the breathing tubes have green Kool-Aid in them is anyone's guess.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.020
Elemental immediately gets knocked unconscious from this maneuver.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.480
Exit: Great work, Dash! Who'd have thought he'd leave such an integral part of his existence open to attack?

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.280
Guess your judgment gets a little hazy when you're sucking on artificial air!

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.020
Linkara: So, artificial air is a liquid and green...

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.260
Hitler Clone: Of course. Don't you know anything about SCIENCE?

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.100
Linkara: They go out to recover Kodiak, who has his tongue hanging out for, like, the fourth time in the issue.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.800
Here's a hint, writers and artists:

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.140
KODIAK BEARS AREN'T LIKE DOGS!

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.160
Kodiak is unconscious next to an orange pyramid sticking out of the ground and giving off an ominous hum.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.600
And so, our comic ends with two little kids finding the pyramid.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.100
Kid: Radical! And it's glowing, too! Whaddaya think it is?!!

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.700
Linkara: Look out, kids, it's Happy Fun Pyramid!

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.600
Okay, we also have a solicitation for next issue...

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.900
Text: Think the Newmen–

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.320
Linkara: Wait, it IS "Newmen"?!

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.340
Offscreen voice: Because poor literacy is kewl.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.880
Text: Think the Newmen had a rough time with Elemental?

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.280
Well, hang onto your seats, 'cos this was just a warm up for...

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.060
THE MAN CALLED GIRTH!

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.140
Linkara: And we get a preview of Girth, and he–

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.520
W-wait a second!

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.540
That Girth?!

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.800
The Girth from that Rob Liefeld book "Badrock"?!

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.700
The one I did a text review on?!?

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.140
Oh, there is no way in Hell I'm going to issue 2 now!

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.020
Oh, and we also get a happy message from Rob Liefeld, even though he technically had nothing to do with this book, other than the concept.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.360
Message: Eric, Jeff, Jonathan, Chris, Kurt and the Extreme color team

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.800
are knocking themselves out in order to make every issue of the Newmen an instant classic!

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.660
O-o-oh, they were knocking themselves unconscious! No wonder they didn't realize how awful this book is.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.440
This comic sucks!

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.100
The artwork is horrible, the dialogue is stilted, and the characters are as bland as the backgrounds!

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.620
Well, I hope you enjoyed this little anniversary as much as I did,

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.100
and that you had an EXTREEEEEEME time!

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.720
Hello, everyone. I'm Linkara from the popular web series "Atop the Fourth Wall",

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.140
but I'm here today to talk to you about a serious problem still affecting comic book characters,

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.160
and that is Youngblood's Disease.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.560
Youngblood's Disease affects characters from all walks of life:

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.260
men, women, transgendered or other term.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.020
Youngblood's Disease doesn't care who you are,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.000
it will destroy your eyes and make you look really, really stupid.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.140
If you suspect that you or a friend or loved one suffers from this horrible illness,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.380
consult a physician or trained penciler or inker right away.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.100
And we can help stop this horrible disease before it strikes again.
