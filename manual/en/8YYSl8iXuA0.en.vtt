We all have photographic memories, it's just
that some of us don't have any film.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.680
Hey Guys Julia here for DNews.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.070
One of my favorite book series as a kid was
about kid detective Cam Jansen, who by saying

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.439
“click” could snap a picture in her head
and be able to remember the scene like she

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.550
was looking at a photograph.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.170
Just like Cam Jansen, though, photographic
memory seems to be a work of fiction.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.330
There’s a limit to the kind of information
we can take it at once.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.480
We remember certain details of a scene, but
not EVERY detail.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.230
Like if I try to think of the painting of
the Girl with the Pearl Earring, I can kind

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.970
of remember what her earring looks like, but
I couldn’t for the life of me tell you what

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.230
color her eyes are.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.320
Little kids often have something close, though,
called eidetic memory.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.510
This is when kids can recall an image in extreme
detail for a few minutes after they’ve seen

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.510
it.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.360
But because most people lose this ability
as they grow up some scientists think it’s

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.360
an immature version of memory.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.150
As kids grow up and learn to read and write
and think abstractly, memory becomes more

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.150
abstract too.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.280
Yeah there are some examples of people with
REALLY good memory.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.710
Stephen Wiltshire comes about as close as
possible to being a human camera.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.580
After just a short helicopter ride, he was
able to recreate the skyline of New York to

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.420
almost near accuracy.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.390
Of course, he is an artist, so he took some
creative liberties.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.310
But no serious scientific research confirms
his abilities.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.920
While that’s just one maybe example, there
are other cases of people will really good

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.920
memories.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.920
Like really good.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.360
One famous case, the story of Jill Price who
remembers nearly everyday of her life was

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.280
published in the journal Neurocase.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.920
She remembers everything about her life, down
to what shirt she wore to Target to buy groceries

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.090
on a certain day.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.850
Although her abilities might be the result
of a kind of OCD where she obsesses over memories.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.670
Which doesn’t sound all that fun.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.920
Another study published in the journal of
Neurobiology of Learning and Memory looked

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.729
at the brains of eleven participants who might
have similar memories.

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.600
Scientists referred to this ability as Highly
Superior Autobiographical Memory (HSAM).

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.920
While they performed pretty average on some
cognitive tests, the researchers found that

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.770
their brains were actually unique.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.420
They had stronger white matter connections,
which could allow information to be transferred

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.910
more efficiently in the brain.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.700
But the participants didn’t use memory palaces
or other tricks.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.620
The scientists found that “Instead, they
appear to have some inherent ability to retain

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.750
and retrieve vast amounts of public and autobiographical
events, well beyond what one may expect from

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.920
simple rehearsal.”

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.620
What kind of rehearsal you ask?

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.510
Well, mind palaces seem to be the best way
to boost your memory.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.000
If you’ve ever seen BBC’s Sherlock Holmes,
you know what this looks like.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.670
Pick a scene you’re familiar with like walking
down your street or walking around your house

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.130
and put things you want to remember in a certain
spot.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.650
Like if I wanted to remember pi i could put
the 3 on my front door, I could put the .14

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.030
on the wall in my foyer.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.460
I could put the 15 on my banister I could
put the 92 at the top of stairs.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.640
you get the idea, as I mentally walk through
my house, I would associate those numbers

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.640
with those locations.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.720
A lot of memory champions use this trick.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.850
While photographic memory doesn’t seem real
and most of us don’t have special memories,

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.901
thank God because I would really hate to re-live
every embarrassing day of middle school, there

00:03:02.901 --> 00:03:04.520
are ways to improve your memory.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.540
Like the mind-palace trick or Trace says to
sniff some rosemary or maybe make a fist!

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.481
No really, check it out in this video here
or check out why we forget things at all,

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.800
check out this video here.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.060
Alright guys, what tricks do you use to remember
things?
