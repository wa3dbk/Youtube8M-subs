00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:06.680
Hey Vsauce, I'm Jake and potato chips or crisps
were invented 160 years ago in Saratoga Springs,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.630
NY by a chef named George Crum.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.140
You can use the Food Timeline to uncover the
origins of pretty much every food like nachos,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.000
gingerbread or the old classic, cock-a-leekie.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.789
If you want something meatier, you just need
to find the invisible cow .com But let's use

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.810
the Minecraft logo generator and check out
some more DONGS...things you can do online

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.690
now guys.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.780
Sid is a robot you control in real time, using
your computer.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.090
You queue up and once it's your turn, use
Sid to grab a ball and drop it into one of

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.210
the surrounding holes.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.260
You are only in control for 45 seconds and
the holes that get you more points are further

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.579
away so you have to strategize your moves
if you want a top score.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.139
If all you really want though is to wait in
line, then try Waiting in Line...3D.

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:02.219
Where you wait in line...and punch yourself
in the face.

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.219
Wow.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.409
Such real.

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.659
Much fist.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:06.659
Many Lines.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.060
A fun drawing tool that has you directing
patterns of lines using your cursor.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.840
You can give them color, reduce their number
and can make them fade away.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.200
Once you finish your masterpiece compare it
using Toddler or Modern Art.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.270
A surprisingly difficult quiz where you decide
if the artwork was created by an adult artist

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.310
or an infant.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.030
For more art there is Street Photography from
GTA5.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.070
Photography student Fernando Gomes goes around
Los Santos snapping photos with the cell phone

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:43.060
cameras getting some pretty cool shots.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.189
After exploring the streets of Los Santos,
explore Middle Earth.

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.180
THis Hobbit chrome experiment has you outrunning
and dodging Trolls in Trollshaw, spending

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.880
some time in Rivendell, or escaping evil in
Dol Guldur.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.409
Then wander off into this Corn Maze you go
through using Google street view.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.179
If you get lost, use your emergency yodel
button.

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.010
Or drive out of there with Hotline Trail.

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.190
Try and control your vehicle on a road that
continuously grows in random directions and

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.190
blurs.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.410
Before getting behind the wheel though use
what side of the road to find out which countries

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.730
drive on what side of the street.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.670
Once you figure it out, hit the Accelerator,
a fast paced game where your speed increases

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.030
the more obstacles you dodge, and the more
obstacles you dodge the faster and more frequent

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.690
they become.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.250
For something a little slower paced, be a
leaf on the wind.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.530
A fun little game that has you gliding across
the screen collecting green orbs, avoiding

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.330
red ones and obtaining power ups.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.210
While you're floating around, check how much
your Steam library is worth with Steam Gauge.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.960
Then compare that number to how much the top
technology companies make every second and

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.950
imagine how all the Scrooge McDuck gold coin
pools it could fill.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.250
If all those numbers become intimidating use
Mathigon.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.870
Mathigon's World of Mathematics is an incredibly
cool interactive eBook that presents some

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.190
of the most interesting mathematical ideas
in a really engaging way.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.090
You can learn about fractals, graph theory,
probability and more.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.550
But the most important math to know is obviously
Pizzarithmetic which tells you how many pizzas

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.890
to order depending on the number of people
who will be feasting on said circular disc

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.150
of doughliciousness.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.770
If you need more people for your pizza party
use some of these dictionary definition pick

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.520
up lines, for example...

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.380
Girl, you must be a Darwinism because you
are a theory of biological evolution developed

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.040
by Charles Darwin and others, stating that
all species of organisms arise and develop

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.680
through the natural selection of small, inherited
variations that increase the individual's

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.760
ability to compete, survive and reproduce.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.870
Once you've got all your friends together
have a GIF Dance Party.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.290
Add a myriad of different dancing gifs, change
the background, the song and share your dance

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.370
party's URL to invite more friends.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.650
Leave the party and find your Pokemon.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.400
Hmm, not sure how I feel about that choice
so instead I'm going to guess your number.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.620
The number I'm thinking of is 10 and wouldn't
ya know it, it guessed 10.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.590
Combine the different numbers or subtract
them to get the total to hit 10.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.910
It starts to get pretty complicated as the
game progresses because if you do your addition

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.460
out of order, you might be out of luck.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.990
So lets keep using our brains with RobinWords.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.430
Cange one letter in the four letter word to
create a new one, then the computer does the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.460
same and you continue on until all possible
words have been used.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.840
While battling the computer, use Noisli to
create some peaceful background noises like

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.900
a distant thunderstorm or the woods.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.380
If you want more noise, I made another JAM,
a Just Awesome Music leanback for you over

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.370
on WEsauce, so listen to that while you check
out these DONGs, and as always, thanks for

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:54.250
watching.
