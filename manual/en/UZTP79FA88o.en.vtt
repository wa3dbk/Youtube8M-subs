Hi, I'm Chef A.J., and thank you for watching
Expert Village. I'm now going to show you

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:12.840
how to make a delicious sauce for what I call
"Kung Mao Pao Tofu." We're going to start

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.390
with two cups of vegetable stock in a saucepan.
I'm actually going to turn the heat on medium

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:26.199
right now. You can buy this in a carton in
any natural food store. Actually the regular

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.220
supermarket carries it now. You could make
it yourself. It's kind of labor intensive.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.929
And you could also buy it in a powdered form,
either vegetable broth or chicken flavored

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:38.690
vegetable broth. If you want to save money,
you just reconstitute it yourself. But this

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.609
is very, very convenient. Two cups is half
a box. So if you want to use a whole box,

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:54.499
double the recipe. Next we're going to add
a cup of mirin. What mirin is--it's a rice

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:59.329
cooking wine. We are using a little bit of
alcohol in this recipe. Now I personally don't

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.120
drink, but I do cook sometimes with alcohol
because it evaporates. So the alcohol gets

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.670
burned off, but it leaves the flavor. So,
again, you can actually find this in a regular

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.510
supermarket too, any Asian market or natural
food store. I like to get the one--sometimes

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.280
they have things like corn syrup or glucose
syrup in it--I like to get the one that is

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:29.280
just the wine. Next we add a cup of organic
tamari. Tamari is just like soy sauce, but

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.270
it's wheat-free. Tastes exactly the same.
If you don't mind using wheat, just use any

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:43.409
soy sauce you like. And a half a cup of dry
sherry. You don't have to get the expensive

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.310
ones for cooking. I just picked up whatever
they had at Trader Joe's. I think this bottle

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.700
was maybe $3. And we're using a half a cup,
and it is going to burn off. But it's going

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.049
to give it a really nice flavor. Next we have
chili garlic paste. If you ever order take-out

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.260
food, a lot of times they give you these little
packets. Some are soy sauce, and some have

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.689
this kind of red stuff in it. And that's usually
what they're giving you. And make sure you

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.200
get one without sulfides. You can get this
in the regular store, and also Asian markets.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.780
How much you use depends on how spicy you
like it. I like it kind of medium to medium-high

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.920
heat, so I'm using three tablespoons. And
I like using this because, traditionally,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.920
at least the Kung Pao Tofu always had the
whole red chile peppers in it. But I had an

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.000
experience where once you bite into one, you
never want to bite into one again. So at least

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.280
this gets incorporated into the sauce, and
it makes it a little bit more uniform, and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.230
it's actually a lot easier.
