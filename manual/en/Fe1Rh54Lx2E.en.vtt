00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.490
Alright, now I'd like to talk you about serving
and the techniques that go along with serving.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.830
We'll worry about where the ball has to go
in the court and I'll give you some court

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.390
guidelines later for singles and doubles tennis.
But for now, when you see TV and you see a

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.390
professional tennis player and the serving
the ball, it always looks so fluid and natural.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.769
This is the way it should look to start. You
take the ball to the edge of the racket and

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:42.390
just like this. Your knees are up. My right
knee is up just a little bit, and then next

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.030
thing I would do is toss the ball in the air.
I would suggest that you work on tossing the

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:57.300
ball first before even hitting the ball and
just catching to where you might be comfortable

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.500
of it being a certain level. Next, you want
to hit the ball. Now keep in mind in tennis

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.970
you can always catch the ball if it's a bad
toss or if you're not ready to hit it with

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:22.690
out fault, without an error. A fluid motion
looks somewhat like this. Now, I don't know

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.170
if that ball was going to go in, but we're
focusing on technique right now. A nice fluid

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:39.580
motion. You want to hit the ball more up here
as to so that you're coming down towards the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:46.539
net. Some mistakes I've seen people do in
serving is hitting the ball too quick like

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:59.039
this, maybe hitting the ball on a bad toss
like that. Now I'm out of balls. Or some people

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:09.270
try to hit just to get it over the net, which
isn't so bad to start, but it's that old adage

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.720
why learn something the wrong way and practice
it the wrong way if you can learn something

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:24.590
the right way and get in just a little more
time. And that's serving for me.
