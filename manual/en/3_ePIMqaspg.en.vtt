00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.959
Hello

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:06.779
Today im going to make something so tasty so delicious so decadent 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.440
that you can not have just one piece. Thats right today im going to make a 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.139
cheesecake with a chocolate swirl 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.409
For this recipe you will need the following ingredients. Butter, thickened cream, 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:32.820
cream cheese, 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.820
Caster sugar, some chocolate, some chocolate cookies

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.200
and some ricotta cheese

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.010
Start by making the base by putting the chocolate cookies into a food processor 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.240
Now if you don't have a food processor

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.430
just put the biscuits into a zip lock bag and bash them with a rolling pin

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:57.840
Once the cookies are crushed add in our butter

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.060
next lightly grease a

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.630
spring form pan.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.260
now place the cookie mix into the pan

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.100
and even it all out

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.210
next using the base of a cup, push down firmly to compact 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.540
Next melt the chocolate in a microwave for fifteen seconds at a time and stir each time until melted. 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.800
Now into a mixing bowl place two hundred and fifty grams of ricotta 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.690
then two hundred and fifty grams of cream cheese 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.080
then two thirds a cup of caster sugar 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.070
Then blend until well combined. Once combined add in two hundred and fifty grams of thickened cream

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.060
Then beat on high for five minutes

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.060
until the mixture is smooth and thick

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.939
This is the consistency you're after, it is nice thick and creamy

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:16.469
Now spoon the mixture onto the base then even it out

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:26.299
Next with the chocolate at room temperature 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.879
simply swirl it around the outside then moving in to the centre 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.150
Just so you get a nice pattern 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:45.079
Now with a knife swirl it around until you get a nice ripple affect through out the entire cheesecake

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:58.939
Now once done

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.949
place the cheesecake in the freezer for two hours and then it will be ready to serve 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:08.029
If you want it frozen them leave it over night.

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.469
I have just taken it out of the freezer after two hours and it looks fantastic

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.129
Now just cut it up and serve it on a plate.

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.409
