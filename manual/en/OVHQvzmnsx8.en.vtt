Hey everyone, Justin Jackrel from citEcar
Electric Vehicles.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.540
Today I have one our our campaign 4PR golf
carts for you.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.570
I am going to give you a quick product demonstration
and show you some of the features that come

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.560
standard with the unit and if you have any
questions I will give you our contact information

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.439
at the end of this video.

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.380
Alright so just like all of our street legal
golf carts the wood grain finish comes standard

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.009
on your dashboard, steering wheel, and seat
backs.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.850
Over here we have a 12 Volt outlet which comes
included on all of our golf carts.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.320
You have your set of keys, your forward and
reverse switch, your windshield wiper, and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.320
your speedometer.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:52.230
The speedometer cluster is actually going
to show you your battery range as well as

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.230
your speedometer.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.050
Your windshield is DOT certified AS1 safety
glass with a windshield wiper.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.840
All of our street legal vehicles come with
the full light package so headlights, taillights,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.860
turn signals, brake lights, all of that.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.460
You also have a hand parking brake which is
really important.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.380
You have your headlight switch, horn, and
turn signals just like on your car.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.020
Okay so once a month you will want to go under
your seat and check all of the fluid levels

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.020
in your batteries.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.020
It is as simple as taking off the white cap
and checking the fluid underneath it.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.030
If it needs more distilled water just go ahead
and fill it through the holes on top of the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.030
battery.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.899
Make sure you are using distilled water not
your standard tap water.

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:37.179
All seats come with the DOT seat belt and
the aluminum rims that are standard with no

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:38.179
extra charge.

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.409
I want to show you this rear facing seat kit.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.109
You can keep it like this for the rear passengers
or if you have cargo, as easy as that you

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.979
can fold it down and it is great for storing
anything with you.

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.399
It just folds right back up again and you
have the seat belts just like you would have

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.439
for the front passengers.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.799
Underneath the seat is where you will have
your on board charger and your on board cooler

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.060
which is tied into the battery system so it
actually can heat or cool your beverages and

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.149
is removable so you can bring it with you
on a day trip or anything like that.

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.180
On the roof line is where you have your safety
grab handles that are available for your rear

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.620
and front passengers.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.540
So that is going to do it for me today, we
have to get this shipped out to one of our

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.620
customers.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.209
