00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:10.078
Milk Pie

00:00:10.078 --> 00:00:16.684
To make the pie crust: Mix 260 gr flour &amp; 125 gr frozen unsalted butter

00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:22.364
Use mixer/hand until you get the sandy texture. Do it quickly, you don't want the butter to melt!

00:00:22.404 --> 00:00:26.428
Add 1 egg yolk

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.989
2 tsp lemon juice

00:00:33.177 --> 00:00:39.653
Add about 2-3 heap tbs of ice water. Mix well.

00:00:42.693 --> 00:00:50.800
Knead the dough w/ your hand. Not for too long, you don't want the crust to be too tough.

00:00:51.487 --> 00:00:56.363
Sprinkle flour so the dough doesn't stick

00:00:56.585 --> 00:01:00.946
Keep kneading until everything is stuck together.

00:01:01.134 --> 00:01:08.798
Form the dough into a round shape &amp; wrap w/ plastic. Rest it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:22.598
To make the filling, mix: 1 can condensed milk, 4 eggs, 4 tbs custard powder, 1/2 tsp vanila extract

00:01:22.806 --> 00:01:29.817
Add 300 ml water &amp; stir well

00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:33.741
Strain the mixture to get the perfect consistency

00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:36.758
Brush the mold w/ butter/oil, so the crust doesn't stick

00:01:36.758 --> 00:01:40.051
Sprinkle flour to your tabletop/chopping board

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:46.532
Flatten the pie dough w/ a rolling pin. We want it to be approximately 0.3cm thick

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:53.595
If it gets too sticky, sprinkle more flour to the dough, tabletop &amp; rolling pin

00:01:53.752 --> 00:02:00.568
Cut the dough slighty bigger than the mold

00:02:00.763 --> 00:02:05.870
Press gently into the mold

00:02:07.631 --> 00:02:11.874
Poke the dough w/ a fork to let the air out while it bakes

00:02:12.045 --> 00:02:15.437
Cool it in the fridge for 15 minutes

00:02:15.686 --> 00:02:19.829
Brush the sides of the pie crust w/ egg yolk to give that nice shiny finish

00:02:20.047 --> 00:02:23.172
Fill in the milk filling

00:02:23.172 --> 00:02:27.244
Bake for 45 minutes in a preheated oven at 160c

00:02:27.244 --> 00:02:31.973
