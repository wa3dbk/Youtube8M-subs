00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.160
SPEAKER: We're in the
demo lab with Lonnie,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.740
where he's going to mix cane
sugar and sulfuric acid.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.980
So sugar is a carbon compound.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.030
Sulfuric acid is a
strongly dehydrating agent,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.470
so it will remove
water from the sugar.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.710
When you remove water from
sugar, what's left behind

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.260
is essentially just
elemental carbon.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.460
So the mixture of
sugar and sulfuric acid

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.160
will produce black
elemental carbon

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.360
in a rather dramatic fashion.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.570
Let's watch as Lonnie
mixes these two compounds.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:51.110
Here's the sulfuric acid
being mixed with the sugar,

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.280
forming a slurry.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.560
You can see the
reaction beginning.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.200
Lonnie'll add a little
bit more sulfuric acid.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.070
And you can already see black
carbon beginning to form.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.760
This reaction is
fairly exothermic,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.360
so it will proceed with the
expansion of the forming carbon

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.020
to form a rapid expansion of
a long snake of black carbon.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.020
Let's watch that happen.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.350
There we have the formation
of elemental carbon

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.780
by the dehydration of
sugar with sulfuric acid.
