00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.760
Photography is all about light. The best light
to use is without doubt natural light.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.980
The problem with natural light is that it can
not be manipulated. If the direction is right

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:27.560
then everything is good. If the direction is not
desirable, then the images look bad.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.631
You can use flash to counteract this but since
SLR cameras can record video, then there's

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:42.070
the need for a new accessory. These are LED lights
that can be attached on camera.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.570
The problem here is that the background is much
brighter than my face. I want to look important

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.481
but here I am, in shadows. Metz offers three
different video lights.

00:00:58.907 --> 00:01:05.698
The smallest of them makes me look like this.
The effect is not much because the light is

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:16.097
small and designed for video close-ups. But a
more powerful light makes me look like this.

00:01:18.297 --> 00:01:26.518
This is the effect of a medium-sized video light
from Metz.

00:01:26.957 --> 00:01:30.577
Then there is even bigger light which makes
me look like this.

00:01:31.078 --> 00:01:35.917
This is the effect of the biggest LED light
from Metz in these conditions.

00:01:36.318 --> 00:01:40.418
It obviously illuminates my face sufficiently
but if we were to turn on all three lights at

00:01:40.797 --> 00:01:47.617
the same time, then the effect is even better.
Now I have all three lights shining on me.

00:01:50.297 --> 00:01:52.368
I will say nothing more.

00:01:56.508 --> 00:02:03.148
Let's have a closer look at these lights. I have
the smallest LED light in my hand.

00:02:03.617 --> 00:02:18.408
It has 24 LEDs, bracket for special mounting foot
to be used on-camera and threaded sockets on sides.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:27.678
It uses two AAA size batteries and this button
turns it on. That's it.

00:02:28.298 --> 00:02:37.578
The medium-sized light has 48 LEDs, threaded
sockets on three sides and it uses four

00:02:37.998 --> 00:02:50.508
AAA size batteries and it also enables you
to adjust the intensity of light using this wheel.

00:02:51.028 --> 00:02:53.678
Light adjustment is stepless.

00:02:54.378 --> 00:02:59.388
When describing the small light I forgot to
mention that all lights come with two

00:03:00.058 --> 00:03:07.108
accessory panels. One of them is a diffusing
panel and the other one is orange

00:03:07.528 --> 00:03:14.588
which changes the color temperature to match
warmer ambient light sources like

00:03:14.988 --> 00:03:20.698
daylights because the light of LEDs is
naturally colder (blue).

00:03:21.528 --> 00:03:23.818
These panels attach conveniently using
magnets.

00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:31.998
The biggest Metz light has 72 LEDs, sockets on
all three sides and wheel for

00:03:32.848 --> 00:03:45.078
stepless adjustments. This light uses four AA
size batteries and has a socket for

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:54.478
powering the light from wall socket when
available. Also the medium light had this socket and

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:06.299
enables to use the diffusing panel and/or the
orange panel.

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:13.828
We showed earlier how all three lights work
together. This was not a show but rather

00:04:14.438 --> 00:04:22.268
a very handy feature of these lights. If you
have the smallest light, you can attach

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:32.568
the bigger lights to it. They also have
electrical connectors for controlling them.

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:46.269
Each light is turned on individually but
I can control the intensity of light using

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:54.859
the control dial on only one of them.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:01.339
You don't have to adjust the two
bigger lights individually.

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.669
These were LED video lights from Metz.
Every videographer needs one

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:13.019
because the natural light is
not always favorable.

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.279
This way you can use additional lighting
where needed.
