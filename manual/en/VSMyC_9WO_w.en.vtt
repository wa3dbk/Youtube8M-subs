"Focus Pocus" by ROCKIT RANGER

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Damn! I can't focus on my homework anymore...

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.740
That ain't you! It's this paper that's out of focus!

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.700
Oh really?!

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.040
Oh, hell no! You ain't been cooking up my spices?

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.200
I've just been using this salty stuff that

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.160
That ain't no salt! That shit's Focus Pocus!

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.820
Aw man! I thought this was Lawry's...

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.280
Quit giving me them salty looks!

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.340

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.200
And introducing Gizmo. Yeah.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.460
Man, this frame's some wizard shit!

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.600
Uh huh! Keyboards! And shit's getting orchestral!

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.500
Fight like me? Shit, I eat orcas whole!

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.960
Chicks say, "Dang! Looks like that dork is full..."

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.840
Shit's so easy, say it until more gets told.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.620
Man, shit is real.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.400
Baby cow, shit is veal

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.080
Mickey Dees, happy meal.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.660
End of show, clap and squeal.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.100
Another show, sit back and chill.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.640
Gizmo says it's good, because he likes the triplet fill.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.400
Pickles straight from the jar, another day another dill.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.640
Unagi (うなぎ) sushi, freshwater eel.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.320
Jack and Jill, went up the hill.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.800
Jack fell down, he took a spill!

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.520
That shit's outdated, he's constipated.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.500
Uh uh, unemployment across the nation.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.800
Constant occupation, like constipation.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.840
Stop the shit talk, Glow.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.680
Have patience. I keep my figure by drinking malt liquor.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.540
I start to glow, my liver's getting weaker.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.940
Popsicles, they icy cold.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.800
What's cooler than cool? Icicles!

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.860
I can't smoke or toke these artichokeses!

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.640
Riding on my bike 20 inch spokeses!

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.460
Next to a Lexus, a car that goes fast!

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.260
Pulling white rabbits out of my hats!

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Hocus Pocus! Alakazam! Too bad I'm not a magician.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.240
I'm a cameraman if you didn't notice.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.400
All I can do is focus pocus.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.620

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.700
Gay marriage? I oppose this.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.520
You mad? That was jokeses.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.000
Sipping colas. Eating bobas.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.840
Don't turn the light off, I'm scared of ghostses.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.720
I give my girls lots of roses.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.580

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.840
