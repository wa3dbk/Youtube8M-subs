00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.040
I'm going to walk you guys through a beginner
gymnastics floor routine.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.199
The floor exercise is a little bit different
when you're talking about men's and women's

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:14.820
gymnastics.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.430
Men do not use any music.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.249
It's only tumbling and one or two non-tumbling
skills.

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.189
They call them non-acrobatic skills.

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:32.780
For women, women combine dance, non-acrobatic
skills, acrobatic skills, and choreography

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.180
into their tumbling, so they have to be good
dancers, good tumblers.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.600
They have to combine a lot of different things
that the men don't necessarily have to have.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.210
But this today, I'm just going to run you
guys through a basic beginner's floor routine.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.030
No matter what level, no matter what age group
normally the floor routine will consist of

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.030
a few things.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.190
You'll have a front tumbling pass, so like
a front handspring, a front roll, a front

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.429
flip, anything forwards.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.540
Then you'll also have a back tumbling pass,
so something like a roundup back handspring,

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.150
or a roundup back handspring back tuck, back
layout, back full.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:19.000
Aside from your front and back tumbling pass,
girls will have dance elements and flexibility.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.550
So they'll have leaps.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.940
They'll have turns.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.940
Things like that.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.250
So let's watch Alyssa do her beginner's floor
gymnastics routine.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.110
Usually they'll use music to choreograph the
routine, too.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.520
At any level the girls use floor, they use
music on the floor, and this will be her back

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.450
tumbling pass, roundup back handspring, rebound,
nice stick.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.990
Then she's going to do one of her dance elements,
called a turn.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.160
That was a full turn.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.000
Now she's doing her another non-acrobatic
skill called a leap and a jump.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:12.959
Nice, and now she's going to finish with a
front skill.

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:27.930
Nice, so we saw the front tumbling pass, back
tumbling pass, non-acrobatic turns, leaps

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.530
and jumps and dance, in between all of this.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.250
That's how you put together a beginner's floor
gymnastics routine.
