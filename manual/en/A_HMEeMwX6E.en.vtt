CASEY CORMIER: Let us look at the C Dorian
scale a little closer. Let us look at it in

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:16.150
terms of its scale degrees. So we start with
C now. If C is 1 and we are doing a Dorian,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:27.199
C is 1 D is 2 just like normal, now E flat
instead of E, that is a flat 3. So we got

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:41.500
1-2-flat 3, F is 4, G is 5, A is 6 that is
normal but then B flat is a flat 7, go back

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.860
to 1. So we have a flat 3 and a flat 7 which
really defines that we have a Dorian scale

00:00:48.860 --> 00:01:07.200
1-2-3-4-5-6-flat 7, 1-2-flat 3-4-5-6-flat
7-1. This would also indicate for us that

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:17.180
we are in the key of B flat major okay because
this would be our Ionian and then C would

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:28.170
be the Dorian; it has the same notes in a
different order. Now let us move this movable

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:46.650
Dorian shape up to E flat, E flat-G flat-A-E
flat-G flat--E flat

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:59.250
sorry F-G flat--I do not think that was right--A
flat-B flat-C-D flat-E flat. So same scale

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.020
degrees that are altered and then we will
be in the key of D flat if this was the case,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.390
so that is your Dorian.
