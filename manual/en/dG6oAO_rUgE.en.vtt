Alright, well we're going to talk about another
major food group, and that is the dairy group.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:13.860
The dairy group being milk, cheese, yogurt
and so on cottage cheese. We need two to three

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:22.420
servings a day. Serving size would be one
cup of milk or one cup of yogurt. A cheese

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.509
serving would be one and a half ounces. Why
do we need dairy. Well aside from being a

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:36.120
good source of protein, we get calcium from
dairy products. Calcium is a mineral that

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.250
we need in relatively large amounts. That's
why we need the dairy products. Calcium of

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.160
course is needed for muscle contraction. It's
very soothing and relaxing to the nervous

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.760
system. Studies even suggest it helps to lower
blood pressure. It has an alkalizing effect

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:02.180
on the body. So dairy products are very dependable
source of calcium. And I know that some people

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.470
don't do well with dairy products. They might
be lactose intolerance or have a food allergy

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.790
to dairy. That being the case, then a calcium
supplement would a good idea. But even those

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.960
people a lot of them can tolerate yogurt because
they have the friendly probiotic bacteria

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.310
in there that help to digest the milk sugar
and break it down, make it more digestible.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:36.021
Everyone should have cultured foods in their
diet whether it's yogurt or kimchi for example

00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:43.190
which you might find at a Korean restaurant.
The cultured foods provide this friendly bacteria.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.710
I like to think of them as keeping a sanitary
condition in the bowel. Crowd out the bad

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.860
bacteria, the disease causing bacteria. So
include cultured foods in your diet. Yogurt

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.890
for example. Yogurt makes a good snack. Or
plain yogurt can be a condiment on your plate.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.090
A lot of times the sweetened yogurt's a little
high in sugar. So what I would suggest you

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:18.560
get the plain yogurt and you control the sweetness.
You can add some chopped fruit, some strawberries,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.930
bananas, and grapes or what not. And maybe
sprinkle some chopped nuts on top. So that

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.280
makes a good snack or a small meal. So make
sure you're including those dairy products

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.810
or taking your calcium supplement.
