00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.519
So I'm here to give you some tips on safely
changing lanes and merging.

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.520
And from the subject of merging, the basic
rule of thumb is to use that merging lane

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.540
to build up our speed, which will make it
a lot easier to merge onto the highway.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.840
We don't want to come to the end of that merging
lane and have our car at a full stop, because

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.630
then it's going to be much harder getting
on the highway because the cars that are on

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.120
there are traveling at a greater rate of speed.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.840
So what you want to do is you want to build
up your speed in that merging lane.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.960
You want to check your mirror so that you're
sure that you have a good safe gap in which

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.480
to merge onto.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.490
And then right before you make that merge
onto the highway, turn your head over your

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.579
shoulder.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.220
Make sure you take the blind spot out of it.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.130
And then when it's safe and you have enough
room, then you're going to get your car onto

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.160
the highway.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.989
As far as changing lanes once you're on the
highway, the first thing you want to do is

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.640
indicate the direction of the change.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.600
So if you're going to change lanes to the
left, you have to put your signal on to the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.689
left, giving the other cars around you the
idea of what you intend to do.

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.469
Once you've done that, the next thing to do
is to make sure it's safe to actually make

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:20.899
the lane change.

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.649
So you put your signal on.

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.329
You start checking your mirrors to make sure
that you have enough room.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:31.299
And then when you think it's safe, again a
turn of the head is definitely good advice.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.439
You want to turn over your left shoulder.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.729
Look back.

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.789
Make sure there's sufficient room in order
to make that safe change, and then move your

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.869
car into the lane that you intend to go into.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.780
When do you come back to the right lane after
you've made the lane change?

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.490
The rule of thumb for that is that you need
to see the entire vehicle that you've passed

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.450
in your rear view mirror before it's safe
to move back into the right lane.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.799
So again, you put your signal on right.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.329
Make your indication of where you want to
go.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.359
Check your rear view mirror, and when you
can see that entire car in the rear view mirror,

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.850
then it's safe to move back to the right lane.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.560
And those are some good tips on merging and
changing lanes.
