00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.340
You played well last night. Are you already 100% fit again?

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.880
I don’t know. I’m not sure if I am at 100% yet or not.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:20.660
To be fit and healthy is most important for me and right now I need to regain my match rhythm. 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.000
Every game helps and when I’m on the pitch I’m always happy. 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.240
To be able to play is great for my team and for me personally.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.060
Right now I’m feeling better each day and that feels great. 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.760
Against Dortmund the fans shouted for Pep Guardiola to field you

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.720
and yesterday the fans chanted your name again.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.180
What goes through your head when you hear that?

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.160
How do you feel about the fan support at Bayern?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.360
That’s been going on for a long time now.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.680
I’ve been here for eight years and I’ve always had a great relationship with the fans of Bayern Munich.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.460
Everybody knows me and everybody knows I give everything for this jersey, these fans and this club. 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.500
We went through thick and thin together, we won many titles 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.360
and the fans know when I’m on the pitch I want to do my very best. 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.440
Of course that’s never easy:

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.380
you cannot be fit and in 100% top shape in every single game

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.740
but for me it’s always sad if I’m injured and unable to play.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.200
For me it’s always a difficult situation when I’m not on the pitch and not together with my team.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.560
But the fan support is fantastic

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.420
and I enjoy the rotation right now because it gives me enough strength 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.400
and motivation to play well when I’m on the pitch. 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.200
You were injured for a long time. Did you ever feel doubts about your comeback?

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.780
Injuries are always tough to cope with. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.800
Sometimes you feel good and sometimes you feel pain.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:10.480
I need to prepare for each training session for about half an hour with the physical therapists 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.260
and I have to stay around a bit after the training sessions too. 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.600
I'm always worried what the physical therapists might say

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.600
because my injury is a little complicated and difficult to handle.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.680
But so far things are going well and that’s obviously great.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.920
On Saturday you play against Frankfurt before the national team break takes place.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.480
Is the team still fit enough following the busy recent schedule?  

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.720
Of course we have to win in Frankfurt

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.200
Obviously we know this is a good team

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.920
and it will be difficult to win there particularly because of the great atmosphere in their stadium.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.120
Nearly all of our players will leave to join their national teams after this match.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:05.940
We need to win the three points because that would be important for the Bundesliga.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.700
We need to stay at the top and collect as many points as possible before the winter break.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.360
Thank you Franck.
