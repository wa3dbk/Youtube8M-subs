00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.820
My name is Alison Schuback.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.720
I was coming home from

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.700
work in 1997 and a lady ran

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.880
a red light and

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.490
T-boned me on the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.380
passenger's side.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.750
She didn't break any bones, she

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.870
didn't have any cuts,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.680
but her brain moved in her

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.350
head and basically she was

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.890
pretty close to being dead.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.950
She was unconscious for 29 days.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.690
That's the way our story started.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.150
It was pretty traumatic

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.540
and they didn't give much hope for.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.220
Well, I read alone

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.570
how to breathe, how to eat.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.390
She started speech therapy, big,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.890
big challenge there, she's

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.260
a public speaker now, she wasn't

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.520
supposed to be able to process and

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.840
have a cognitive brain and she

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.960
invented the Visi-Bib for

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.710
a TV show that was called

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.660
Everyday Edisons and out of 14,000 people, she won.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.570
We've worked on Alison's core for

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.740
18 years now, she can do 100 sit ups at night.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.630
She can't walk.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.620
The reason isn't muscle tone anymore,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.610
it's now a balance issue.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.840
Balance, I don't really have.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.750
She had a real eye movement

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.430
and it was a movement of her eyes.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.750
The first session that we

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.500
did on this, it started to

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.950
slow and then we did three sessions the first day.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.890
By the end of

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.040
the third session, the movement,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.350
it pretty much stopped in her eye.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.950
My eyes have gotten

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.000
better and that's huge,

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.080
it blew my mind.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.590
I can see better which

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.460
goes back to I'm

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.730
not tripping over myself.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.130
And now she can read very clearly

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.170
after working here, so that was a big thing for us.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.990
So, not only is her perspective

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.070
of where she is in the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.010
world, as far

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.060
as balance goes, different, but

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.960
so is her ability to read

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.490
and focus in on things.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.400
So it's big, big stuff.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.360
I can't say enough good

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.440
things about this place and

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.160
I will refer everyone I

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.980
known to come to Carrick.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.350
It does work.
