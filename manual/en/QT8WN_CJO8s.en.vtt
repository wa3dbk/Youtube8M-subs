O.k. folks, in this clip I'm going to teach
you how to draw flames. Now flames are relatively

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.780
simple if you're drawing them in cartoon form.
If you really wanted to go in to graphic detail

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.550
that would take a great deal of time and practice.
But just about anybody can draw flames. And

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.170
one of the main ways we do it is to go like
this. You're going to start with the outer

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.790
edge of the flame. Start at the base and kind
of just work your way up in zig zaggy lines

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:37.739
and always kind of come to a point. One thing
to do is to always keep the zig zaggy pattern

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.920
consistent. And you're obviously going to
build on this as you draw this fire. But just

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:54.949
kind of work your way up and almost like little
horns, come in and draw these fingers kind

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:13.780
of licking toward the sky like flames would
do. Something like that. And then what you

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.410
will do, at this point, is to create sort
of a three dimensional look to the flames,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:26.030
you would kind of come in and sort of lightly
now follow your lines up. Now the outer line

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.110
again should be the thickest. The inner line's
just kind of lightly traced where you were

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.810
on the outer edge. You follow them up a little
bit, you see how I'm doing this? And just

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.960
follow the line right around like that. And
you're going to do two or three layers like

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.400
this. And then you're going to come in, and
this would be if you were to draw them in

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:56.950
color, you'd draw a few different shades.
You would make this inner portion yellow or

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.170
almost white, to show like the white heat
of the flame. And you'd make the outer portion

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.740
the most orange. Orange, slightly less orange,
yellow or white just to show the intensity.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.011
And then if you really want to make the flames
kind of licking, like a lot of folks do, You

00:02:12.011 --> 00:02:16.730
would draw up some extra little bursts of
flame kind of coming up. And make sure they

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.750
kind of marry the motion of the outer line
that you've drawn already. Like if you were

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.120
to take this bit right here, you kind of come
up and swoop along side it and follow it up

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.290
just like that. Almost as if it's kind of
an extension of the one you've drawn already.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:47.140
Kind of fire, little licks of fire kind of
coming off. You can even draw a few. And that

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.739
is a very good way to draw a fire, or flames
for that matter.
