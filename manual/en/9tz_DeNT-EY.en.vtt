00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:07.779
Okay, now on the previous clip, I was showing
you how to add tensions, on how to play the

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.219
chord in both ends, how to open them up into
two hands. Now, what's going to help that,

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.880
help you playing is learning how to invert
them, how to invert your chords. Inverting

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.320
means to take the note that was on the lower
part of it of the chord, on the bottom of

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.930
the chord and switching, playing, putting
it on the top, or just finding different ways

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.540
of voicings of the chord just repositioning
it. So, let me give you an example. Here we

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.760
are back in A Flat, we're going to take, just
basically, take the basic minor chord and

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.890
if you're playing in an organ, it's okay and
you're learning, just go ahead and mess, play

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.010
around with your settings. Remember I said
that's like, bass, mid, high; it's back to

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.880
invert in the chord, you're going to take
the note that's on the bottom of the root,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.430
place it on top. So I'm only just placing
it like that there. Now the third, I'm placing

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.440
it on top; fifth, placing it on top. Now if
you're going to be playing a seven chord,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:26.119
you go put the seven in there and just bring
the root over. And you go work it like that.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.310
So after you get use to adding in tensions
and things like that, and you know, okay,

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.560
what note is okay to put in the chord; because
I had a friend asked me before, "what, how

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.240
do I know what to put in there? Does this
sound right? Is this okay? I've given you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.590
some rules so you know what sounds okay. You're
going to take the first, third, fifth, seven,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.840
nine, thirteen, of you want to. You know I
always have to have the thirteen. But definitely,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.729
the seven and nine, which are added in there,
you just invert it, you take notes from the

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:07.990
chord and you position how are we get use
to playing

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:17.550
it. There you go.
