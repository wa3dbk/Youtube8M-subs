AIMEE MULLINS: I remember the first time I
saw a pair of my legs in a museum. It was

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:11.770
weird.\
\

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:12.770
[Music]\
\

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.379
I probably shouldn't be telling you all that.\

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:31.529
As a teenager, I'm sitting there with basically
the same version of what I'd always had\'97of

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.719
what most amputees have had since the 30s,
basic kind of wooden legs that are y'know,

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.649
really for orthopedic shoes. Now, not as a
teenager, not ever will I be wearing an orthopedic

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:53.179
shoe. So I was shoving this flat foot into,
it was kind of like a little motorcycle boot.

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.789
Not a big heel, but probably an inch. It was
pitching me a little bit forward so my knees

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:05.650
and my hips and my lower back were gonna take
that impact, but as a teenager we do ridiculous

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.540
things for vanity and I was doing that. So
I was traveling with a man who was responsible

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.350
for developing the cheetah leg. We were sitting
in this airport ready to board a plane. He

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.550
looked down and said y'know, I can't believe
you're doing that to your back and to your

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.990
knees. That's just\'97it's really bad and
you need to just accept it. You are a double

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.090
amputee. You should accept that. And I\'97I
remember being like not even knowing where

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.550
to start with my rebuttal. Uh, I have accepted
it. I live it every day, but also why should

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:51.890
I be immune to experiencing the same thing
that every other teenager is experiencing

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.970
and furthermore why is that I can go to Madame
Tussaud's wax museum and see a leg that absolutely

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.281
in every way replicates a human leg but I
can't have one to wear with a high heel? With

00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:10.200
any kind of an elevated heel? And I thought,
wait a second, why is there never\'97why have

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.019
I never met somebody who went to art school
working in a prosthetic lab? It's this area

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.430
where it's usually\'97the role of aesthetic
is abandoned. \

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.040
\
And when I say aesthetic, I'm not talking

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.269
about the need to have something that looks
human, it just has to be beautiful to the

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:35.069
wearer and has to be something that evokes
a sense of ownership and confidence. So there

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:43.819
is something about that very intimate relationship
between us and our assistive medical devices

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.129
that needs to be honored. Whether it's your
eyeglasses or your contacts, why shouldn't

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:56.180
they be custom? Why shouldn't they allow you
to feel proud of it? Developments in the world

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:03.450
of prosthetics are happening in leaps and
bounds. Just the other day, I got two new

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.980
sets of legs. One was the Biomes from a company
called iWalk out of Massachusetts, but it

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.769
was really the sockets. It's a new kind of
socket for me that completely changed my alignment.

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.069
I mean, I actually got taller and the legs
weren't any taller than my old legs, but I

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:29.999
was almost a half inch taller simply from
standing straight. For the first time in my

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:37.079
life, my alignment is allowing me to stand
perfectly straight and perfectly still so

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:47.849
I'm not constantly fighting y'know and moving
my muscles around to hold a stable position

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.609
which is something I just had gotten used
to my entire life in the sense of I've adapted

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:58.270
to what didn't work and made it work and now
you don't have to make it work anymore. You

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:06.540
can get something that fits your body properly,
so I'm really curious to see as we add, continue

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.299
to add assistive medical devices to our bodies,
what does that look like with our locomotion?

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:21.320
And y'know what are the new kinds of beautiful
movements we'll come up with?\

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.580
