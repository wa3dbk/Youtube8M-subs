Jobar. Clearing the School Compound (Part 6)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The Syrian infantry troops keep entrenching in the newly cleared ruins on the school blocks, now.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The army snipers and spotters are looking out for any militant movement.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000
While entrenching inside the school blocks, the infantry troops have reported on having been engaged by the militants and on increased militant activity inside the buildings situated beyond the school compound.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The battle tanks have moved in to engage the militants.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The tanks are moving along the narrow alleyway now between the school compound and the fence.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The tank drivers’ expert performance is crucial in this situation.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It takes a lot of nerve and mastery to drive a tank through such a narrow space.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The Syrian army troops and snipers are covering the armored vehicle while it is on the move.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The militants are less than 300 meters (about one thousand feet) away and they might try to hit the tank using their anti-tank weapons.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The first fire strike is directed at the houses situated beyond the private housing area that is adjacent to the school grounds.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It is clear that the quality of house building materials is very high in Syria.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.000
All the buildings that look like ruins at first glance, on the other hand, remain relatively intact and enable the militants to put up active resistance.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Having turned right, the battle tank has delivered a fire strike on a structure adjacent to one of the school blocks.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The tank’s fire strike is followed by a shot by the militants from inside the buildings in the left situated beyond the Jobar private housing district.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The militants have missed their target. The projectile has detonated before reaching the battle tank showering the armored vehicle with fragments.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Meanwhile, the tanks keep doing their job.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
They have delivered two more strikes and started moving forward.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
As the dust has settled down, it can be seen that the shots fired by the tanks have blown away the inner partitions of the buildings.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
This has exposed the positions of the militants forcing them to retreat toward the center of Jobar.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Having closed with the building, the tank fired another shot.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Having finished firing, the tanks are turning back and moving out, laying their smokescreen along the way.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
As always, their main guns are pointed towards the enemy.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000
When moving out, the tanks are using the smokescreen in order to prevent the militants from firing their anti-tank missile systems from the areas deep in the city of Jobar.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
The operation is over for today.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
All the school blocks have been captured back. A number of underground tunnels running to the center of Jobar have been discovered.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Examining the tunnels does not seem possible right now as they are most likely rigged with explosives.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
The troops are setting up checkpoints in front of the tunnels’ exits.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Further activities are being planned to clear the business center building adjacent to the school compound.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
It is a huge building measuring more than 2 000 square meters (about 21 500 square feet); it is linked to the Jobar inner city.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:01.000
This underground facility – linking the Business Center to the school blocks – has become the main reason the fighting inside the school compound has taken so long.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Nonetheless, the school grounds have been taken fully under control by the Syrian army today.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:14.000
However, the anxiety has not subsided yet as the private housing area adjacent to the school compound remains controlled by the militants.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
The distance between the warring parties is mere 20 – 30 meters (about 60 – 100 feet).

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:28.000
