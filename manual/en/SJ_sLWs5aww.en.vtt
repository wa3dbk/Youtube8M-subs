00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.419
Much of what we experience in life comes

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.990
out really ancient parts of the nervous system -- what's called the brain stem --

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.469
and that information is taken from the whole body.

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.000
That information comes up. It's what's called the bottom-up approach to behavior.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.140
We experience it through our cortical pathways and through

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.380
life's experiences, which are sort of stored in the cortex,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.219
but the information itself is very non-specific.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.260
It's vague. In fact, it comes through a nerve called the vagus.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.840
The vagus nerve predates

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.770
mammals, and some components of it go all the way back to fish

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.809
or the ancestors of fish, so we have this really

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.239
ancient information coming up into our brain,

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.000
into our consciousness.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.650
We interpret it as feeling safe or feeling afraid.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.189
Those are sort of the two most fundamental states

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.000
that almost all vertebrates, all mammals experience.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.460
That information has a tremendous impact on whether we can think or not,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.000
whether we can think straight, whether we can make rational decisions,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
whether we can interpret the environment in an accurate way.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.179
Psychologists have spent 40, 50, maybe longer years

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.999
arguing about different emotions. In some ways, it doesn't matter.

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:44.990
There are really sort of two fundamental patterns. There's a pattern

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.409
of safety, security, and in that state,

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.679
we have much more we have much more

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.319
touch with constructs or feelings like compassion,

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.770
empathy, awareness of the feelings of others.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.000
Older states, which actually have very specific physiology that's now known,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.160
these older states are much more primitive.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.569
They may allow us -- or they may,

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.129
under the conditions of sort of these ancient systems associated with fear,

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.430
we may see everything around us as fearful.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.099
We may not be able to engage in positive behaviors because we're so busy

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.000
defending ourselves.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.160
Anything we can do to provide that child with a sense of safety is positive.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.760
That safety might come from an outsider to the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.420
family who's available for the child to call,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.690
to go to that person.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.950
In earlier times, it might have been a grandparent. It might be an aunt

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.700
or an uncle, but it doesn't have to be a family member. It only has to be someone

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.500
who themselves are sufficiently safe,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.519
that they can provide what used to be called a secure base.

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.329
The quality of that care has an immediate

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.720
effect on how a child reacts to the environment.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.010
If you go to someone who makes you feel safe,

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.090
your state can change instantly. You can be taken

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.190
out at these fear states into a sense of safety

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.000
because humans are so social.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.500
UNICEF is already in the business of creating safety,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.700
and what this conference brings to it

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.960
is a sense of how important the biological states are to these decisions.
