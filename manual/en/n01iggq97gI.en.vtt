Welcome Heroes! I’m Noémie Verpeaux, also Xhane on the forums, your Community Developer on Heroes VI.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Welcome to this second community Q&amp;A.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Today, Julien Pirou, Lead Level Designer on the game will answer your various questions about Creatures.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Welcome back adventurers! Are you ready to roll?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I promise I’ll talk slower this time. So, let’s get to it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There will be 8 neutral creatures and 8 bosses in Heroes VI.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Bosses can be considered as “über neutral creatures”.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You’ll see them on the adventure map and fight them on combat map.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Each boss has its own gameplay. Some will summon creatures to assist them, others are more like lone wolves.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000
All bosses are linked to factions such as Mother Namtaru, who is linked to Necropolis for instance. However there is no boss associated with the Stronghold faction.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
As you know in Heroes VI the line-up of each faction is divided into three categories: the Core units, the Elite units, and the Champion unit.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
All units of a same category are close in terms of stats, but have different roles during the battle.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
To use a simple example, let’s see how it works for Haven.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The three Core units of Haven are the Sentinel, Crossbowman and Sister.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The Sentinel is the melee unit; Crossbowman is the shooter, and the Sister is the support unit.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
In fact, it’s a bit more complicated than that but you get the idea.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Then you have three Elite units that are significantly stronger, and finally, you have the Champion unit who is even stronger.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
There is the same gap between Core and Elite units as between Elite and Champion units.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The Champion is not here only to crush his enemies. He has also a tactical role, linked with the other creatures of his faction.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Of course, it is possible to upgrade your creatures, and you will still have the possibility to recruit the unupgraded version if you wish.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
A lot of players are wondering why the Pit Lord is the Inferno Champion unit and not the Devil as in previous games.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The reason is that we tested several different line-ups for Inferno and finally decided to use the idea of creatures linked to the Six Demon Overlords,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
who are still ruling Sheogh at the time of Heroes VI.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So as the servant of the Overlord of Hate, the Pit Lord became the Champion.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Some fans are wondering if the new look of the Vampire is inspired by the Lich King of another famous fantasy game…

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Other fans seem to believe we were inspired by Sauron from the Lord of the Rings.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Honestly, the goal was to make them look closer to the Death Knights seen in Heroes V, but on foot.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And also we wanted to integrate the spider motif of the Necromancers of Ashan in the design.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
One of you pointed out that the Rakshasa was voted the best Heroes creature of all time by one of the communities. So will they be back in Heroes VI?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I cannot tell, but I can tell you we love the big cats too!

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
A lot of players are also requesting classic creatures like the Behemoth or the Thunderbird.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
For now, these creatures are not in the game. But, it does not mean that they don't exist somewhere in Ashan.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Some players asked why we chose to put Stronghold in the game instead of other factions. There are two reasons for this.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
First, we felt the gameplay of Stronghold was complementing the other factions in an interesting way,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and secondly, we didn’t want to have Stronghold in an add-on once again.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Some of you have asked for a faction dedicated to Ylath, the Dragon of Air.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Ylath is traditionally the patron of free-thinkers, nomads and free cities,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
so he is less involved on the political scene of Ashan

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and does not have a big empire with large armies serving him.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
On the other hand, as you know, the Orcs follow Father Sky, so in a way they are the Ylath faction.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
We did not “avoid” to have Dragons as Champion units in Heroes VI but it was a bit too systematic in Heroes V

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and a lot of people complained about that.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It doesn’t mean that in the future we won’t have factions with Dragons as Champions.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I think you’ll agree that some factions just cannot exist without a Dragon in their line-up…

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Finally, one of you remarked that leaving the black dragons out was a bad idea.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
But who said anything about leaving them out?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It’s all for now. Keep submitting your questions on forums and fansites,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and I'll see you soon for another video Q&amp;A at the next turn.
