00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.150
Before Curiosity can explore Mars, it has
to get there first.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.770
The last stage of the launch vehicle gives
the spacecraft a final push and spins it up

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:28.080
for our eight-and-a-half month cruise to the
red planet.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.000
10 minutes before hitting the atmosphere the
cruise stage separates and final preparations

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
for entry begin.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:50.820
Hitting the atmosphere at about 13,000 miles
per hour, the spacecraft begins to slow down.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.600
While slowing down, the spacecraft uses thrusters
to help steer toward the landing target.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.519
We throw off weights to rebalance the spacecraft,
so that it’s lined for parachute deploy.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.710
After slowing to about Mach 2, or about 1000
miles per hour, we deploy the parachute to

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.710
slow down even further.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.470
Once we are below the speed of sound, the
heat shield separates and the spacecraft looks

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.960
for the ground with the landing radar.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:23.310
Once we reach an altitude of about 1 mile,
the spacecraft drops out of the back-shell

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.880
at about 200 miles an hour. It then fires
up the landing engine to slow it down even

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.880
further.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.630
Once we’ve descended to about 60 feet above
the ground, and going only about 2 miles per

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.250
hour, the rover separates from the descent
stage.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.860
As the rover is lowered, the wheels deploy
in preparation for landing.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:02:02.911
Once the rover is safely on the ground, and
touchdown has been detected, the descent stage

00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:22.860
cuts the rover loose. It flies away leaving
Curiosity safe on the surface of Mars.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.320
One of the first things Curiosity does after
landing is to deploy the mast, which supports

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:49.770
many cameras and instruments. Curiosity shoots
a laser at an interesting target. This helps

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.250
us quickly understand the kind and composition
of that target from a distance of up to 30

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.800
feet.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:06.130
If the target is worth a closer look, Curiosity
can drive up and inspect it with instruments

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:32.080
and tools at the end of its arm.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.340
The drill on the arm allows us to grab some
of that rock and deliver it to the laboratory

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:55.620
instruments inside the body of the rover.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.070
Those instruments can tell us even more about
the mineral composition, getting us closer

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:06.010
to understanding whether life could have existed
on Mars.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.690
Curiosity will be exploring the red planet
for at least 2 years and there’s no telling

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:11.519
what we will discover.
