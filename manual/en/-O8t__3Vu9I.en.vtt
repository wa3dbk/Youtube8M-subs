00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.356
&gt;&gt;Scott: Hi guys.

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:43.856
&gt;&gt;Scott: I was a student that
probably could have fallen

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:47.796
through the cracks pretty easily and
I always vowed that if I was ever

00:00:47.796 --> 00:00:51.446
into education I was going to create
a school in which all kids counted

00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:54.246
and that we did everything
in our power for kids.

00:00:55.256 --> 00:00:56.696
&gt;&gt;How are you?

00:00:56.896 --> 00:00:57.586
&gt;&gt;Mom: Good how are you?

00:00:57.586 --> 00:00:58.086
Come on, kids!

00:00:58.516 --> 00:00:59.186
&gt;&gt;Scott: Look at you go, Girl!

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.166
&gt;&gt;Mom: I know, we're workin' it!

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:00.976
&gt;&gt;Scott: There is no stopping you!

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:03.556
&gt;&gt;I just really believe that
more than ever before we need

00:01:03.556 --> 00:01:07.976
to teach kids the skills of
self-regulating their emotions.

00:01:08.796 --> 00:01:10.526
We know that they're going
to benefit from dealing

00:01:10.526 --> 00:01:12.126
with social-emotional components.

00:01:12.126 --> 00:01:13.316
They're going to perform
academically and they're going

00:01:13.316 --> 00:01:13.976
to perform very strongly.

00:01:32.046 --> 00:01:34.906
&gt;&gt;Rebecca: The social-emotional
learning allows me to be a teacher.

00:01:35.256 --> 00:01:41.366
The students are motivated to learn
and to have that leadership role

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:43.016
within the classroom
to have that sense

00:01:43.016 --> 00:01:43.976
of community and a sense of family.

00:01:54.106 --> 00:01:56.416
&gt;&gt;I would like someone to choose
how we're going to transition

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.536
from our desks to the rug.

00:01:58.536 --> 00:01:58.786
Emeris?

00:01:59.106 --> 00:02:00.016
&gt;&gt;Emeris: Thumb walk.

00:02:00.216 --> 00:02:00.956
&gt;&gt;Rebecca: Thumb walk?

00:02:00.956 --> 00:02:04.396
And can you tell the
class your expectations?

00:02:05.236 --> 00:02:08.446
&gt;&gt;Emeris: Quiet and don't talk.

00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:10.626
&gt;&gt;Rebecca: One of the
things that's crucial

00:02:10.626 --> 00:02:12.876
with a Responsive Classroom
is allowing the kids

00:02:12.936 --> 00:02:14.886
to take the leadership role.

00:02:15.446 --> 00:02:17.996
They made a list of how they
would like to transition

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.146
from one activity to the next.

00:02:20.236 --> 00:02:23.236
Doing a thumb walk
where they walk slowly

00:02:23.236 --> 00:02:25.826
and basically twiddle their thumbs.

00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:28.396
&gt;&gt;Julian: The transitions
make me feel relaxed

00:02:28.396 --> 00:02:32.956
and they help me calm down.

00:02:33.046 --> 00:02:35.016
&gt;&gt;Rebecca: We are going
to start morning meeting

00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:36.646
with what we did this weekend.

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:40.116
I know a lot of you had
some great stories to share

00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:42.096
so we will start with Jacob.

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:48.216
&gt;&gt;Jacob: I saw the ice boats just
fly and that was really, really cool.

00:02:48.676 --> 00:02:50.996
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth: When people share
things I always get a little picture

00:02:50.996 --> 00:02:52.946
in my mind of what they're doing.

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:54.566
&gt;&gt;Rebecca: This is our family time.

00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:58.836
We come together as a family and from
here we talk about any successes,

00:02:58.836 --> 00:03:02.576
accomplishments students have had,
and it just sets us up for the day.

00:03:02.576 --> 00:03:06.376
&gt;&gt;We are going to do yoga
this morning and we are going

00:03:06.376 --> 00:03:09.736
to transition from the
rug down to the forum.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.566
When you're ready you may
start your stretch walk.

00:03:18.216 --> 00:03:20.546
&gt;&gt;Usually every day try
to do some type of yoga,

00:03:20.776 --> 00:03:22.406
whether it's just a
couple of minutes a day

00:03:22.406 --> 00:03:25.956
or twice a week I do a full
blown 40-minute yoga class.

00:03:27.646 --> 00:03:31.496
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth: The yoga and the
transitions, it's helping me also

00:03:31.496 --> 00:03:33.816
when I'm at home I'm also
calming down more too.

00:03:35.126 --> 00:03:38.076
&gt;&gt;Rebecca: This is something that
I can't start my day without.

00:03:38.076 --> 00:03:40.526
Oftentimes with kids
they don't realize

00:03:40.526 --> 00:03:43.016
that their body will tell them
how they are feeling before their

00:03:43.016 --> 00:03:43.506
brain does.

00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:47.286
With yoga we get that out of
them and it's a way for them

00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:51.016
to release all their energy,
get them ripe for learning.

00:03:51.306 --> 00:03:53.216
&gt;&gt;How do you think that doing yoga

00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:56.836
in the morning especially
before writing is helping us?

00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:01.006
&gt;&gt;Jacob: I feel much more
relaxed and more focused.

00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:04.736
&gt;&gt;Student: All the yoga that we
do helps us do more writing time

00:04:04.736 --> 00:04:05.966
in the small amount of time we have.

00:04:19.046 --> 00:04:21.076
&gt;&gt;Rebecca: The advice that I would
give to a teacher about wanting

00:04:21.076 --> 00:04:22.896
to implement social-emotional
learning

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:24.776
into their classroom
is that it's easy.

00:04:24.946 --> 00:04:28.486
It's easy and it's something that
comes natural to all teachers.

00:04:28.766 --> 00:04:32.826
It's incorporating the
movement, incorporating a voice

00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:35.876
for our students, incorporating that
community, that sense of family.

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:40.506
&gt;&gt;Scott: Once you have a culture
where staff are committed to kids,

00:04:40.706 --> 00:04:42.346
it spreads like wildfire.

00:04:43.506 --> 00:04:45.966
All of the things that we do
have been teacher-initiated.

00:04:46.306 --> 00:04:47.796
I'm smart enough to
know as the leader

00:04:47.796 --> 00:04:49.626
of my school is I'm not the expert.

00:04:49.776 --> 00:04:51.206
My teachers are the experts.

00:04:51.606 --> 00:04:58.046
A key mindset I think is for
leaders of schools to feel empowered

00:04:58.336 --> 00:05:00.976
to give their teachers a license
to do these types of things.
