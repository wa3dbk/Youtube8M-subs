Hi, my name is Tim.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.290
I'm 25 years old and I'm from
Hannover in Germany.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.240
Hello, my name is Iris.
I'm 29 years old and I'm from Mexico.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.830
I think Vancouver is so very special
because I have never seen another place

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.920
where city life and nature
is so close to each other.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.140
I think Kaplan has the best location
in Vancouver because it's right in downtown

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.560
and it's so close to all the transportation
and I think it's a great place.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.310
What I like about Kaplan that it's a
really friendly environment to learn English.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.000
There are great people around
and good teachers who help you study English.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.620
The quality of teachers
at Kaplan is outstanding.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.430
They're very friendly, caring.
A lot of them have worked here for

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.000
many years and they take on the students
as kind of a family.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.370
The level of teaching is amazing.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.600
There's the computer lab and each of
the Kaplan buildings in Vancouver

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.460
you can grab a computer almost at anytime.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.110
There's a nice lounge
where you can get lunch.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.260
In the lounge there is a
Wii station to play Wii games there.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.350
So whenever there's a break in between of
the classes you can go there

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.180
and you can be sure that you'll find
somebody playing there.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.250
It's really fun!

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.570
As far as accommodation goes
for students the home stay

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.010
is fabulous way to go.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.270
We make sure our home stays
are all native speakers.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.760
I would certainly suggest that a student
take the home stay route.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.250
They are put in the position where they
have to use their English more.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.000
It's great because they treat me
like if they were my own family.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.140
They are always speaking in
English with you

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.560
and that's the perfect way
to improve your English.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.890
Something that is really amazing
about Vancouver is Grouse Mountain.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.140
We got to chance to see the bears.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.880
For me that was amazing!

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.280
Also there's many extreme
sport that you can do.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.610
You got the chance to see some shows like
the Lumber Jack Show

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.940
or the bird exhibition.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.320
At the beginning they showed us
a falcon, really beautiful

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.480
and it's quite fun
because they are flying all over us

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.080
so you feel like the bird is going to grab you,
so it's exciting.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.610
It was a good show.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.990
If I had to take the decision again,
I would absolutely decide the same way

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.480
and come back to Vancouver.
Studying at Kaplan is really fun.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.130
You really learn a lot of things and
get to know many people

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.610
and Vancouver is absolutely
the best place to be!

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.860
I'm still learning English
but I think it has improved a lot.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.090
Oh yeah, I'm so happy,

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.520
I think I will never regret to come here
to Vancouver to study English.
