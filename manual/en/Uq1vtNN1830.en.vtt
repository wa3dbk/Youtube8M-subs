00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.800
Here we are, we're ready to make the supreme
part of our Vegetable Soup Supreme. It is

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.610
just garlic, tomato, olive oil, paste. Too
easy to make in our food processor fitted

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:20.720
with the S blade we are going to put our six
cloves o garlic and one can of tomato paste,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:33.320
tomato paste as we call it on the other side
of the pond. Let's get that going here and

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:49.510
chop it up. This is going to need to shake
a little bit, this is kind of pasty but we'll

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.000
get it, excellent. Now we are going to add
some olive oil, just going to help loosen

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.700
everything up. You can see the garlic is now
chopping around. You just need a couple tablespoons

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:16.039
of olive oil. It requires very little salt,
just a thin bit like half a teaspoon. We can

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.899
just let that grind for a little bit longer.
I can see now that the garlic pieces are just

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.049
breaking up to almost invisible and that is
what we want. You don't want to have a big

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:32.179
piece of garlic in your mouth when you take
in the soup. Let me just do one check here

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.759
and just clear off the sides and make sure
we are getting all the big pieces, it looks

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:48.615
beautiful and it is coming out perfect. That
looks about done and all we need to do now

00:01:48.615 --> 00:01:54.070
is I'm just going to put it in a round pan
for now and it will be easier to pour into

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.469
the soup. I'm just going to check on the stove
and see if the soup is ready and we'll put

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.250
it all together for you and have a quick taste.
