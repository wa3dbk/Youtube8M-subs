00:00:00.618 --> 00:00:16.397
[Soccer commentary]

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.434
Well, you're on time.

00:00:21.468 --> 00:00:23.321
Oh, you've begun already?

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:26.097
I was watching soccer.
The match is actually quite boring.

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:35.356
This car isn't boring though.

00:00:35.387 --> 00:00:39.838
This isn't a regular Focus RS,
but a Focus RS500.

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:44.643
And in a couple of minutes
I had a great big smile on my face again.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.484
It is such a fun car!

00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:51.428
500 of these RS500s will be made...

00:00:51.568 --> 00:00:53.587
...and those will be the last Focus RSs made.

00:00:53.624 --> 00:00:58.697
It has gotten a couple of upgrades
over the regular RS.

00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:02.755
And that already was a beast
you could have a lot of fun with.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.935
Maximum torque has risen to 460 Nm.

00:01:09.253 --> 00:01:11.484
This machine is just lightning fast.

00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:15.577
0-62 in 5.6 seconds, 163 mph.

00:01:15.603 --> 00:01:17.608
It hasn't been limited to a 155.

00:01:17.972 --> 00:01:21.355
It's very strong in all situations...

00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:23.592
You can cruise at 60 mph in 6th gear...

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.276
...hit the throttle and it'll go like stink.

00:01:30.474 --> 00:01:35.239
It also sounds great.
This is such a brilliant car!

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.518
I'll show you something.

00:02:02.735 --> 00:02:06.416
I'm driving off in third gear.
Let the clutch come up, 1000 rpm.

00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:09.189
Of course it takes a little while to get going...

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:13.477
...but it really does that very well.

00:02:13.495 --> 00:02:17.242
Of course I discovered that by accident
because I forgot to change back to first...

00:02:17.432 --> 00:02:21.886
...but it just shows how strong
and smooth this engine is.

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:25.500
It really is unbelievable that
it picks up so easily.

00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:31.726
It has the trusty 5-cylinder turbo
we know from a couple of Volvo's...

00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:34.896
...and in the Focus RS and Focus ST.

00:02:35.998 --> 00:02:38.916
For this occasion
they've given it extra horsepower.

00:02:38.982 --> 00:02:42.278
In total it's got 350 of them.

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:46.468
And that from a 2.5 liter turbo,
that's not bad.

00:02:46.877 --> 00:02:50.979
I hear you wondering if the RS has
front- or 4-wheel drive.

00:02:51.154 --> 00:02:54.819
With this many horsepower
it only has front wheel drive.

00:02:54.828 --> 00:02:58.662
But that's fine.
It's dry now, that also helps.

00:02:58.892 --> 00:03:01.775
It has a limited-slip differential...

00:03:01.968 --> 00:03:09.037
...and a RevoKnuckle front suspension
to stop the power pulling on the steering wheel.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.152
it's just a brilliant chassis.

00:03:12.393 --> 00:03:17.882
You can go into corners so quickly that
you think that the rear has to slide away...

00:03:17.944 --> 00:03:19.597
...because it just can't go right.

00:03:19.786 --> 00:03:24.451
It's way better than its competitors.

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:28.275
Talking about competitors.

00:03:28.443 --> 00:03:32.207
This RS500, limited edition,
500 will be built...

00:03:32.275 --> 00:03:35.449
...and Ford thought
let's give it a nice prize tag.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.478
62 grand.

00:03:37.935 --> 00:03:41.212
That's quite a lot for a hot hatch.

00:03:41.385 --> 00:03:45.879
That's much more expensive than all the rest.

00:03:46.556 --> 00:03:51.877
But that doesn't seem to matter, because all 10
coming to the Netherlands, are sold.

00:03:54.021 --> 00:03:58.062
Ford thought the green was a bit boring...

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.887
...so they did something else with this one.

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:03.969
They made it matte black.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.200
It's wrapped. The car is really just black...

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.993
...but they wrapped it in 3M film.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.148
It again looks quite cool.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.190
It already stood out with all its air intakes,
spoilers and big rims.

00:04:19.553 --> 00:04:25.320
But in matte black it's really a people-magnet.
Lots of people react to it.

00:04:25.337 --> 00:04:28.685
All the pieces come together in this one...

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.400
...this is like a hatchback-sized supercar.

00:04:34.248 --> 00:04:36.200
Is there nothing to complain about?

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.160
Of course there is.
The prize is very high...

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.052
...its turning circle is also not very nice.

00:04:41.478 --> 00:04:45.925
There are very nice Recaros, but they're
mounted quite high and you can't lower them.

00:04:46.837 --> 00:04:50.150
But a car like this makes you greedy.

00:04:50.211 --> 00:04:55.155
This is a car that should be in the garage
next to your supercars...

00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:56.848
...so that you can drive it once in a while.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.767
I'm done right? Is it a wrap?

00:05:00.951 --> 00:05:02.153
Right?

00:05:02.914 --> 00:05:08.455
Ok, then I can watch the world cup again.

00:05:12.385 --> 00:05:13.970
Can you wash it?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.220
I also want to watch.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.002
It has to be washed.

00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:17.976
But...

00:05:19.523 --> 00:05:30.413
[Soccer commentary]

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.965
You have to wash it by hand by the way,
because of the wrap.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.286
Just get a bucket and some water
somewhere and wash it.
