Hi I'm Mohammad from Baby Car Seat Installers.
In this video, I'm going to show you how to

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.330
install the Maxi Cosi Mico Car Seat without
the base when needed. I don't recommend using

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.910
this seat like this all the time, however
in emergency situations, or when you don't

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.910
have the base available and you need to get
the child around, you may need to do this.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.790
Step one. This line here should be level to
the ground that the vehicle is one. Step two.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.780
Fill in the gap between the car seat and the
child seat with pool noodles, rolled towel

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.020
or something similar like a jacket. Step three.
Secure the seat belt through the belt path

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:33.330
and buckle the seat belt. Step four. Make
sure the lap portion of the seat belt is as

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.530
tight as possible. Holding the seat belt tight
with one hand, continue to remove the rest

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:45.369
of the seatbelt until it stops. Now let the
seatbelt retract. You should hear a clicking

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.709
noise. This is the seatbelt's locking mechanism.
Feed as much of the seatbelt back into the

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:57.250
retractor as possible. If you car's seatbelt
does not have a locking system, you may need

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.749
to use a locking clip. After bringing the
seatbelt through the belt path, make sure

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:09.580
the lap portion is tight. With your fingers,
secure the two straps together and unbuckle

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:17.350
the seat belt. Attach the locking clip onto
the seat belt about half an inch above the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:55.489
buckle. This will keep the seat belt tight.
