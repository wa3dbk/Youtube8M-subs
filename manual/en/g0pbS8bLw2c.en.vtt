00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:23.090
Today I want to show you what the soil food
web is and I like you so much that I drew

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:33.570
it for you, right there.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.960
If you’re new to gardening you may come
across this term, soil food web and wondered

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.220
what that meant.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.321
It really refers to everything, all the organisms,
all the life forms that live in and on the

00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:46.170
soil.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.700
And the reason we call it a web, this is what
I really want to talk about today, is to show

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.700
how they're all interconnected.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.579
If you have a spider’s web, if you cut one
or two strands of that web it might impact

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.480
the whole web and it's same with this.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.430
All of these organisms are important and they're
really important for our gardens.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.970
So what I did is I drew the plants in the
middle.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.310
It doesn’t really matter, I just did that
because that’s the first thing I drew and

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.280
down here I have some bacteria which are tiny
one-celled organisms.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.940
There could be 30,000 different species of
them in a gram of a healthy soil.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.210
So they are very very tiny.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.210
We have fungi which are also very tiny and
protists which are also small, like paramecium.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.530
There are all kind of odds and ends protists.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.230
And then I drew animals up here.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.960
I guarantee this is the first soil food web
drawing that has a unicorn up here and probably

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.140
the last so this is a real special day here
I think.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.200
So what’s going on here is all of these
things impact each other.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.920
Many of them eat plants - bacteria, fungi,
protists, animals - eat plants.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.759
Obviously the unicorn is a herbivore so it
only eats plants, I’m pretty sure, although

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.079
in Harry Potter there was kind of, was it
a unicorn that was eating - I don’t remember,

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.439
but I think unicorns are herbivores.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.989
Then we have fungi and bacteria.

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.540
The fungi will eat the bacteria, the protists
will eat these other organisms, animals, especially

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.560
small animals like earthworms, the tiny animals
like nematodes, they’ll eat protists and

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.820
fungi and bacteria.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.390
They all eat each other but they also work
together.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.540
There are cooperative, beneficial relationships
that happens between many of these things

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.200
- bacteria and plants, fungi and plants, protists
and plants, animals and microbes.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.930
Microbes are friendly with everyone and they
also eat everyone.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.870
So, it’s a very interconnected web.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.290
I'm not going to get into too much more detail
about why this is so much important but the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.090
reason ultimately is because all of these
things, having a diverse soil food web is

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.459
gonna make for a better, healthier garden
for us and so that’s why I talk about it

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.260
a lot on my website.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:19.690
And 
that is all for this soil food web drawing.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.810
I hope you like my drawing.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.720
I worked really hard on it.
