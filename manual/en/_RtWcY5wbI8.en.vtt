00:00:18.093 --> 00:00:20.020
&gt;&gt;Paley: So many people think of

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.060
creativity in reference to

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.090
artistic pursuits, but

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.063
creativity is just a fundamental

00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:27.033
human condition.

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:28.090
You build on a vocabulary;

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.083
you build on a foundation to

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:32.073
develop a concept or an

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:34.040
understanding.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.077
if you're already dealing with

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:39.010
your understanding of an order

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.040
of things, that's something you

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.087
already know, so where real

00:00:43.087 --> 00:00:46.000
innovation comes in is getting

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.007
those things that are unknown

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:50.077
and so you have to restructure

00:00:50.077 --> 00:00:54.057
and re-alter your perception.

00:00:54.057 --> 00:00:56.023
Art is communicated via the

00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:57.083
senses,

00:00:57.083 --> 00:01:01.093
and these senses are invisible.

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:04.063
And so how do you communicate

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:05.093
those sensibilities to another

00:01:05.093 --> 00:01:08.047
human being?

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:10.023
And backgrounds are totally

00:01:10.023 --> 00:01:12.090
different, cultures are totally

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.013
different, but there is the

00:01:17.013 --> 00:01:18.050
fundamental fabric of our

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.077
humanity.

00:01:20.077 --> 00:01:22.017
Because my work changes quite a

00:01:22.017 --> 00:01:23.063
bit, there's a whole spectrum

00:01:23.063 --> 00:01:25.033
of what I do:

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:26.083
I design furniture, I design

00:01:26.083 --> 00:01:28.013
large-scale sculptures,

00:01:28.013 --> 00:01:29.013
some of it's figurative,

00:01:29.013 --> 00:01:30.077
some of it deals with

00:01:30.077 --> 00:01:32.097
abstraction, some deal with the

00:01:32.097 --> 00:01:36.023
emotional context of color.

00:01:36.023 --> 00:01:37.047
They're all different.

00:01:37.047 --> 00:01:38.050
But when somebody looks at the

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.043
work, they'll say, "Oh, well we

00:01:39.043 --> 00:01:40.027
can recognize that;

00:01:40.027 --> 00:01:42.040
that's your work".

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.050
So what it is is those

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.090
invisible sensibilities come to

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.070
play.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.070
I went through a formal art

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.013
school training.

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:55.030
We did drawing, print making,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.067
ceramics, painting, and after I

00:01:58.067 --> 00:02:00.080
had experienced all of these

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.023
processes, I ended up going with

00:02:05.023 --> 00:02:08.000
metal.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.070
And I always wonder why I

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.063
gravitated one to the other.

00:02:12.063 --> 00:02:15.023
I mean, I don't know if you

00:02:15.023 --> 00:02:17.043
picked this up or not...

00:02:17.043 --> 00:02:18.067
maybe not now, but I was a very

00:02:18.067 --> 00:02:21.007
aggressive kind of personality,

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.057
and for me the paint and

00:02:23.057 --> 00:02:25.030
ceramics was much too

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.063
submissive, it was too easy.

00:02:27.043 --> 00:02:31.073
♪ Music ♪

00:02:31.073 --> 00:02:34.053
Metallurgy and metal processes

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:37.013
are very specific and very

00:02:37.013 --> 00:02:39.017
linear and very demanding, so

00:02:39.017 --> 00:02:40.073
one there was the intellectual

00:02:40.073 --> 00:02:42.023
discipline of this structure of

00:02:42.023 --> 00:02:44.043
how you approached the material,

00:02:44.043 --> 00:02:46.037
therefore approach form, and

00:02:46.037 --> 00:02:48.090
then also the physical demands.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.063
When scale started to increase,

00:02:50.063 --> 00:02:54.060
we had to understand tools and

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.013
machines that could do it larger

00:02:57.013 --> 00:02:58.090
and logistically shipping and

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.017
installing and then when it gets

00:03:01.017 --> 00:03:03.053
into the large-scale public

00:03:03.053 --> 00:03:06.040
works there's the politics,

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.017
there's the engineering,

00:03:08.017 --> 00:03:09.050
there's the feasibility studies

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.097
and all that.

00:03:10.097 --> 00:03:12.020
And all of those things

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.043
which are so kind of prominent,

00:03:14.043 --> 00:03:16.000
all they do is they're kind of

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.070
like buttresses that go down to

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.040
the main core of creating that

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.087
unique object, and so it's

00:03:21.087 --> 00:03:23.047
created that scenario that

00:03:23.047 --> 00:03:25.057
allows me to perform as best I

00:03:25.057 --> 00:03:28.023
can.

00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:32.043
The Sentinel, because of its

00:03:32.043 --> 00:03:35.007
scale and its prominence there,

00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:37.037
it helps define a little bit

00:03:37.037 --> 00:03:39.003
the cultural profile of the

00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:41.033
Institution.

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:43.020
When the student first comes to

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.053
RIT and it's the first time

00:03:45.053 --> 00:03:47.007
they're on campus and they go

00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:48.030
to the central core of the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.077
campus and the Sentinel is

00:03:49.077 --> 00:03:51.020
there and they walk through and

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.060
they look at it and what is this

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.010
place?

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.080
That defines a place in time

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.047
and defines part of their

00:04:00.047 --> 00:04:02.077
experience and when they come

00:04:02.077 --> 00:04:04.020
back to that, that's the

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.093
resonance that they have.

00:04:05.093 --> 00:04:07.003
I was thinking about the

00:04:07.003 --> 00:04:08.027
educational process and how

00:04:08.027 --> 00:04:10.050
dynamic it is, that a student

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.030
comes in, has a certain set of

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.000
values, a certain understanding

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.073
of who they are and what their

00:04:15.073 --> 00:04:17.087
capacity is and as they go

00:04:17.087 --> 00:04:19.077
through this process,

00:04:19.077 --> 00:04:21.030
the skills that they learn, the

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.043
challenges that they are, it's

00:04:23.043 --> 00:04:24.083
totally changing, and when they

00:04:24.083 --> 00:04:26.040
come out the other end, there's

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.057
a transformation that happens.

00:04:28.057 --> 00:04:29.087
And what I tried to do with the

00:04:29.087 --> 00:04:31.087
Sentinel is somehow that that

00:04:31.087 --> 00:04:33.073
reflected that sensibility, that

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:35.017
things are in flux, that things

00:04:35.017 --> 00:04:37.050
are changing; I'm not sure about

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.030
this, I'm not sure about that.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.093
So therefore, even though it was

00:04:40.093 --> 00:04:43.000
nonverbal, that it aligned to

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.067
that energy that the individual

00:04:44.067 --> 00:04:46.010
was going through...

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.073
and in a broader context,

00:04:47.073 --> 00:04:48.070
this is what art has always

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.057
done in a society, it

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:54.013
helps humanize an experience.

00:04:54.013 --> 00:04:55.057
I'm trying to bring my

00:04:55.057 --> 00:04:57.067
understanding and my perception

00:04:57.067 --> 00:04:59.053
and my personalization,

00:04:59.053 --> 00:05:01.070
that's where the innovation

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.083
comes from, because I'm solving

00:05:03.083 --> 00:05:05.060
a problem in a different way,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.037
so therefore my work looks

00:05:07.037 --> 00:05:08.063
quite different from everyone

00:05:08.063 --> 00:05:11.037
else's.

00:05:11.037 --> 00:05:13.047
I'm creating a new context,

00:05:13.047 --> 00:05:16.010
a new vocabulary, a new

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.070
understanding and hopefully

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.060
a new sensibility for the viewer

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.063
or the user of that object.

00:05:23.063 --> 00:05:25.057
There's thousands and thousands

00:05:25.057 --> 00:05:27.003
of chairs and thousands of

00:05:27.003 --> 00:05:28.077
tables that are made and these

00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:30.007
have been explored and explored

00:05:30.007 --> 00:05:31.053
and explored...

00:05:31.053 --> 00:05:33.047
so as an artist, what can I

00:05:33.047 --> 00:05:34.087
bring to that equation?

00:05:34.087 --> 00:05:37.067
What can I do that makes it

00:05:37.067 --> 00:05:38.070
different?

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.080
I can't make it more

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.093
functional, I can't make it all

00:05:40.093 --> 00:05:43.090
of that.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.043
So basically my approach to

00:05:47.043 --> 00:05:54.013
that is looking at the object

00:05:54.013 --> 00:05:55.053
as kind of a sense of ceremony

00:05:55.053 --> 00:05:58.003
that we live our lives through.

00:05:58.003 --> 00:06:05.027
That these objects are,

00:06:05.027 --> 00:06:06.097
they reflect our life, they

00:06:06.097 --> 00:06:08.097
reflect our morality, they

00:06:08.097 --> 00:06:10.057
reflect how we engage with

00:06:10.057 --> 00:06:12.060
people, they create a sense of

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.097
time and place, so for me,

00:06:15.097 --> 00:06:18.050
the table becomes a ceremonial

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.003
theater as it were, that

00:06:22.003 --> 00:06:26.003
the human drama is played out.
