00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Real and authentic Argan oil knowledge directly
from natives on www.arganfarm.com

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This video isn´t here to sell you anything nor is it one of these lame entertainment videos!
It´s for educational purposes only.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If you belong to the stampede of people running towards the latest exaggeration and hype about Argan oil, this isn´t for you!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
One primary goal of these FAQ video series is to weed out as much as possible the misleading information about Argan oil spreading around the internet!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We´ve spent a considerable amount of time and money on these simple videos, and we´ve done our best to keep them as simple and concise as possible to eliminate all the fluff, leaving only real useable information that will help you take full advantage of this magic natural "Elixir".

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And where else can you get more accurate information other than directly from the natives? Who:

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.000
- Know best about Argan oil and Argan culture 
- Have been producing, using and selling Argan oil for ages 
- Are still extracting it the ancestral and traditional way.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.000
Ok, what´s your name?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Fadna.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Fadna,  are you willing to answer my questions?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Yes.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Thank you very much for accepting.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I thank you too.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Question number 9: Is the Argan oil sold on the markets of a standardized quality?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What about the Argan oil which is sold in the city: in Agadir, Essaouira or Marrakech for example, is it of a standardized quality? Is it the same quality everywhere?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
No, the one of the souks / markets isn´t the same.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Why?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Because it´s often diluted.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Diluted?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Yes, it´s often diluted.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
With what?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
That Argan oil is often mixed with vegetable oil for example.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
To buy real and pure Argan oil, one should buy it in the cooperatives or directly from the farmers whose wives produce it at home, like in the Ihahan region for example.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We produce it at home, and the husbands sell it in the local village markets.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But the Argan oil in the cities or on the roadside, I wouldn´t recommend it, as it is more often than not, diluted.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Mixed!

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Yes. Many people have been had buying Argan oil and Amlou either in the city markets or on the roadside.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We´re in Chiadma region, right?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Yes.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
There´s Argan oil here, right?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Yes, but pure and real Argan oil only here in the cooperative.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Outside, it is unfortunately often cut-off.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Even if some of those sellers pretend their Argan oil is pure and real, one should pay attention.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
If one wants to make sure buying pure and genuine Argan oil, the real deal is to buy it in the cooperative.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.000
1. Most of the Argan oil sold on the markets, streets, online etc.. today is diluted unfortunately, &amp; is often of a very low quality.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
This kind of sellers cut-off the oil to make sure they yield a higher profit on their investment.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
2. Though goats' Argan oil might be genuine, yet it has a lower quality than the one extracted from hand-collected Argan fruits.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The cut of the goats' Argan oil on the market is not significant.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
3. Genuine, pure &amp; organic Argan oil. This quality is rare.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Sort out the fluff &amp; you´ll find only few sellers online who are offering 100% pure organic undiluted Argan oil.
