00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.130
If you’re like me, you can’t dance.

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.620
Actually if you’re like me you’ve been
politely but firmly asked not to dance.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:12.059
Whatever, I’m just gonna shake, shake, shake,
shake shake, baby, shake it off.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.349
Hello there, dancing machines, Julian here
for DNews.

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.210
I’m a firm believer that everyone should
march to the beat of their own drum.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.890
As it turns out though, it may be physically
impossible for some people to keep a beat.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.439
Researchers at McGill university and the University
of montreal recently published a study comparing

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.789
2 people with 2 metaphorical left feet to
32 controls.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.871
They had all of them clap out a beat of their
own, then keep pace with a metronome, and

00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:38.610
finally clap along with a metronome that changed
tempos randomly.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.970
At first nobody had a problem.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.150
When everyone kept their own beat or followed
a steady metronome, they all had the clap.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.940
This rules out the possibility that there
was something wrong with their motor functions.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.060
But when the 2 tuneless souls had to keep
time with a changing rhythm, they were hopeless.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.050
And I don’t mean they were just clapping
on the one and the three beats like a little

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.320
old lady in church, I mean they couldn’t
swap to the new tempo like everyone else could

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.890
after just a few beats.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.990
They would try, but be off the new beat by
big gaps.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.630
They were certified beat-deaf.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.799
There’s no explanation yet for why some
people have rhythm and some people don’t,

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.600
but the hypothesis is something’s off with
their biological rhythms.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.969
We all have biological rhythms like your heartbeat
and your day/night cycle.

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:20.990
Even the way you talk has a rhythm to it.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.319
but apparently for some people they just aren’t
able to adjust their rhythms based on external

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:26.369
cues.

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.170
Before you use it as an excuse to avoid the
dance floor, it’s an extremely rare condition.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.170
One previous study at the International Laboratory
for Brain, Music and Sound Research in Montreal

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.840
interviewed dozens of volunteers who claimed
they couldn’t keep a beat and only found

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.329
one qualified test subject.

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:42.329
As a sidebar, I think it’s interesting both
these studies were in Montreal.

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.329
I don’t like to play to stereotypes, but
we all know French Canadians can’t dance.

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.999
Mathieu Dion was the unlucky soul, and at
one point in his life he actually was a Mascot

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:51.259
at an amusement park who had to dance in shows
as part of his job.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.350
Eventually they stuck him in the back so he
could copy his fellow dancers, but it probably

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.109
helped that no one could see him.

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.889
The study had him dance to a variety of music,
because scientists are cruel.

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:05.060
They found the only genre he could keep up
with was Techno because of it’s loud steady

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.060
pulse.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.860
Dion had a good attitude about it, saying,
“I am the first diagnosed in the world of

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.940
having no rhythm, which is something great.”

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.260
Way to stay upbeat, Mathieu.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.070
Even if you are beat deaf, I still say you
just go for it.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.220
You do you.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.970
Dance like nobody's watching.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.140
Even though everybody is watching.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.230
Shame on them, you have a condition!

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.360
Aside from making you feel awesome and chasing
your cares away, Dancing might have some other

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.500
cool side effects.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.460
Cristal’s got the deets on the beats here.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.130
Are you afraid of busting a move?

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.850
Would finding out you’re beat deaf give
you more confidence or make you find a different

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.850
hobby?

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.060
Let us know in the comments, and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
