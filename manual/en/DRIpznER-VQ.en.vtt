00:00:00.215 --> 00:00:03.850
(intro music)

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.714
- The Artists Experiment Initiative

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:09.209
is not exactly an artist
residency project.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.332
It's an experimental approach to

00:00:12.332 --> 00:00:16.174
socially-engaged experiences that may help

00:00:16.174 --> 00:00:20.296
audiences to relate to art
in different and new ways.

00:00:20.296 --> 00:00:23.488
Artists that have
participated in this project

00:00:23.488 --> 00:00:27.818
commit to a long-term
relationship with us.

00:00:27.818 --> 00:00:29.212
It's a process of research,

00:00:29.212 --> 00:00:30.833
it's a process of reflection.

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:34.169
They get to know the institution
in a very intimate way.

00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:36.410
We are currently in our second year

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.416
of our Artists Experiment Initiative,

00:00:38.416 --> 00:00:40.496
and we have invited a number of artists

00:00:40.496 --> 00:00:43.782
that we admire, that we really
are inspired by their work,

00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:45.686
to come and look at our exhibitions,

00:00:45.686 --> 00:00:47.822
and look at our collection,
and work with us

00:00:47.822 --> 00:00:51.290
to develop a series of new
programs for next year.

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:57.376
- [Paul] I would say, it's
taken me maybe 15 years

00:00:57.376 --> 00:00:58.852
to become an artist that's really engaged

00:00:58.852 --> 00:00:59.801
with the public.

00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:02.342
I would say the first 15 years

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.501
were a very selfish practice,

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:06.221
and I don't mean that in a negative way,

00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:09.308
but artists are still
trained to work alone,

00:01:09.308 --> 00:01:10.920
to work by themselves.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.722
I think the first step of working

00:01:12.722 --> 00:01:14.344
in an engaged practice was just simply

00:01:14.344 --> 00:01:16.971
to learn how to work not alone.

00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:19.757
An exhibition space is
designed to receive objects,

00:01:19.757 --> 00:01:22.752
and in a way, it separates the transcation

00:01:22.752 --> 00:01:23.902
of the artists, and I think,

00:01:23.902 --> 00:01:26.205
"Oh, I'm making things
for the exhibition space."

00:01:26.205 --> 00:01:28.511
I think, because my work used
to deal a lot with history,

00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:31.309
I started to get a lot of requests

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:33.474
to make work that were specific to a site,

00:01:33.474 --> 00:01:35.328
specific to a history.

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:38.302
A lot of work that was
in the public sphere.

00:01:38.302 --> 00:01:40.183
Immediately, when you
leave the exhibition space,

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:42.469
the situation gets much
more complex and richer,

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.569
and you inevitably have
to think about the viewer.

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:46.567
With Artists Experiment,

00:01:46.567 --> 00:01:48.629
I'm trying to push it further and be like,

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:51.281
"Which public, of the
public that goes to MoMA,

00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:53.705
"would I like to speak to?"

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.858
I think that people forget that

00:01:55.858 --> 00:01:57.892
a museum is not just a
place of consumption,

00:01:57.892 --> 00:01:59.912
where you come and look
at art, or consume art,

00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:02.476
but it could also be
a place of production.

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:04.635
Once you make art, you look at it,

00:02:04.635 --> 00:02:06.297
at this object and you
realize that there's

00:02:06.297 --> 00:02:09.257
another person just like
you on the other side,

00:02:09.257 --> 00:02:11.108
making that thing.

00:02:11.293 --> 00:02:14.705
That is an incredible
feeling of connection.

00:02:19.334 --> 00:02:21.798
- (mumbles), what we do is to make

00:02:21.798 --> 00:02:24.411
complicated data accessible.

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:28.478
It may be hard for you to
encounter these data on your own,

00:02:28.478 --> 00:02:29.873
but maybe through some of the displays

00:02:29.873 --> 00:02:32.554
that we've created, we provide a kind of

00:02:32.554 --> 00:02:34.716
human-scaled encounter with it,

00:02:34.716 --> 00:02:37.976
so that you can come to
your own conclusions.

00:02:37.976 --> 00:02:41.589
- The data that tends to
appeal to all three of us

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:45.662
most is data that is
inherently human in some way.

00:02:45.662 --> 00:02:48.703
Whether it is all the words
Shakespeare ever wrote,

00:02:48.703 --> 00:02:51.129
or data that's about people and the way

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.600
that they behave, and the ways that

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.427
they move through the world.

00:02:54.427 --> 00:02:57.050
- I sort of envisioned
this data space of MoMA

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.245
as being this place that the public

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:01.511
has never been able to see.

00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:03.877
How do we bring people
into that experience

00:03:03.877 --> 00:03:05.246
is something that's
been really interesting

00:03:05.246 --> 00:03:08.532
for us to think and talk about.

00:03:08.532 --> 00:03:10.030
- There's a beautiful
story to be told about

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.677
how MoMA thinks about its objects,

00:03:12.677 --> 00:03:14.719
and that thinking is maybe captured

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:16.581
through the data that has
been collected, right,

00:03:16.581 --> 00:03:18.470
the concerns and the considerations.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.037
What I think we're interested in,

00:03:20.037 --> 00:03:23.634
is looking at how that helps us

00:03:23.634 --> 00:03:26.358
come to better understand
the original thing-ness

00:03:26.358 --> 00:03:29.745
of the objects that
are in the collections.

00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:34.137
- [Allison] I make
interactive installations

00:03:34.137 --> 00:03:37.644
that often invite the
public to participate.

00:03:37.644 --> 00:03:40.906
The public is very
important in the activation

00:03:40.906 --> 00:03:43.107
of the projects that I do.

00:03:43.107 --> 00:03:46.946
In many ways, I am
collaborating with the public.

00:03:49.683 --> 00:03:52.442
My work is very research-based.

00:03:52.442 --> 00:03:55.218
One of the great things about working with

00:03:55.218 --> 00:03:56.564
museum education departments

00:03:56.564 --> 00:03:59.815
is that they are also
interested in research,

00:03:59.815 --> 00:04:02.602
and in learning and in teaching.

00:04:02.602 --> 00:04:05.863
In Artists Experiment,
the artists involved

00:04:05.863 --> 00:04:08.905
have access to all kinds of archives,

00:04:08.905 --> 00:04:13.062
and we can do research and inquire into

00:04:13.062 --> 00:04:14.977
all the things that we're curious about

00:04:14.977 --> 00:04:16.707
in terms of the museum's history,

00:04:16.707 --> 00:04:18.483
the workings of the museum.

00:04:18.483 --> 00:04:21.140
It's really a behind-the-scenes view

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.336
of the museum itself.

00:04:23.336 --> 00:04:26.424
Ultimately, all of the
projects that we're doing

00:04:26.424 --> 00:04:29.640
will culminate in public programs.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.183
So, it's both a challenge and just a very

00:04:33.183 --> 00:04:36.245
exciting opportunity to try and figure out

00:04:36.245 --> 00:04:39.320
how each of our practices will translate

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.180
into this context.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.943
- We recognize that living
artists are the ones

00:04:43.943 --> 00:04:47.155
who infuse life into this institution.

00:04:47.155 --> 00:04:50.195
We, together, undertake this process

00:04:50.195 --> 00:04:53.799
of collective learning to
create new experiences.

00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:56.978
That try to re-imagine
what the relationship

00:04:56.978 --> 00:04:59.697
to the museum can be.

00:04:59.697 --> 00:05:04.697
