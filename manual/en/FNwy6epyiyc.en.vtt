00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.560
Step one . Choose shower drain placement.
Placement of the Trugard TruLine

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.090
linear shower drain is ideally at an end
wall, the threshold of a doorway or

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.490
somewhere in the middle of the shower or
steam room.  Step 2.  Locate the inside edge

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.050
of the drain trough.  Relocate rough-in
pipe work, if necessary, to align with

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.430
desired placement of linear drain.  Fhe
center of the waste drain line is often

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.689
located two and a quarter inches from
the wall sill plate, more precisely,

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.399
locate placement by adding the thickness
of the wall substrate, plus 1/8 inch for

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.170
the waterproof polyethylene membrane and
thin set assembly, plus the thickness of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.960
the tile or stone.  Step 3.  Cut waste drain
pipe  the height.  Place the linear drain

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.550
on the slab next to the waste pipe.  Now,
mark and cut the waste pipe a quarter

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.530
inch below bottom edge of the drain
waste water outlet pipe.  Step 4.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.289
Pre fit the linear drain,  Next, prefit the
linear drain to the plumbing waste line

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.049
to ensure correct placement and
connection of the drain.  Step 5.  Protect

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.330
the cutoff waste pipe.  Place a sleeve
coupling or temporary pipe extension to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.939
protect the debris from going into the
shortened cut off waste drain pipe.  Step

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.509
6. 
Fill in the block out area.  Use sand mix

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.240
mortar or concrete mix to fill in the
block out area under the linear drain.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.100
Step 7.  Protect the drain body and flange. 
Apply quality painters masking tape and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.640
cardboard to the top of the drain
flanges and body to protect and keep the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.009
inside drain putty trough and flange 
clean from mortar and debris.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.450
Step 8.  Build the drain body support.  Now
prepare a slightly wetter than normal

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.189
mortar bed sand mix and build a support
base under the linear drain trough and

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.740
the bonding flanges of the two ends and
back flange closest to the wall.  Note:  For

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.610
concrete slab installation, wet the slab
prior to applying the mortar mix

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.130
directly onto the slab.  This will bond
the slab and mud bed together.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.170
Step 9.  Install and connect the drain
body.  Install the TruLine drain body by

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.560
connecting the drain outlet to the
plumbing waste line.  Using a flexible or

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.700
non hub coupling and by squishing the
drain body down into the wetter than

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:21.319
normal mortar bed mix.  Step 10.  Level the
drain.  Next level the drain and pack

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:27.650
mortar under the remaining drain flange. 
Step 11.  Establish mortar bed grade

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.780
height.  Now, establish the grade height,
including a 2% or quarter inch per foot

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.670
slope toward the drain.  Use a chalk line
or pencil in straightedge to create the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.370
lines on the walls.  Step 12.  Build a
mortar bed perimeter guide.  Build a

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.750
mortar perimeter around the floor edges
to the height of the grade lines.  Step 13.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.430
Complete mortar bed.  Use the perimeter
mortar as guides filling in and

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.870
compacting in the entire mortar bed floor
area, maintaining the quarter inch per

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.049
one foot slope toward the drain.  Step 14. 
Install the wall substrate.  Install the

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.860
wall substrate in accordance with local
code requirements, which generally

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.840
require cement chess backer board or
gypsum drywall board.  Note:  Trugard vapor

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.090
shield works on standard green or purple
types of drywall.  Step 15.  Install a

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.620
polyethylene waterproof membrane.  Now,
install the truguard bonded polyethylene

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.459
waterproof membrane in accordance with
Trugard systems approved installation

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.019
instructions notes.  Now, remove tape from
the drain before applying thin set to

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.930
the floor area.  Step 15.1.  Apply thin set to
the floor area.  Apply modified or

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.410
unmodified thinset mortar to the floor
area from the outer edge of the drain

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.670
bonding flange outward.   For wall
placement, six inches up the wall

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.260
adjacent to the drain.  Note:  Do not apply
thin set to the stainless steel drain

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.260
flange.  Step 15. 2.  Apply TruSeal
sealant to drain flange.  Apply one

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.220
quarter inch bead of TruSeal sealant
around the drain flange and install the

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.359
vapor shield membrane.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.750
Step 15.3.  Place and embed membrane into
sealant.  Place membrane onto the floor

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.860
area, now press down on the vapor shield
membrane, squeezing the sealant sideways,

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.430
along the drain flange, to completely
cover the stainless steel flange and

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.900
then embed the membrane into the thin
set mortar in an outward direction,

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.210
towards the perimeter of the shower floor. 
Step 16.  Install the tile.  Install the

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.840
tile using best industry practices,
starting on the wall adjacent to the

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.520
drain.  After completing the first row of
wall tile,  temporarily install the drain

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.360
grate to ensure that the drain grate can
be inserted and removed freely with

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.560
approximately 1/16 to 1/8 inch of
clearance.  Step 17.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.020
Grout the tile after 24 hours of drying
or curing of the thinset mortar.  Grouting

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.720
of the tile may be completed using
industry best practices.  Step 17.1.  Use

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.840
flexible tile grout caulk to grout the
tile and grate tiles.  Step 17.2.  Use

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.470
flexible tile grout caulk to growl all
wall to wall and floor wall

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:13.660
intersections.  Step 18.  Caulk around the
tile perimeter  to give your tile

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.979
job a professional-looking installation. 
Use painters masking tape as a straight

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:23.070
edge around the perimeter of the tile
job and apply the flexible grout caulk,

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.289
then remove the tape.  Congratulations on
completing your single slope watertight

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.750
and leak proof shower with the elegant
TruLine drain.
