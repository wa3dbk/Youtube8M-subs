(heavy metal music)

00:00:07.577 --> 00:00:09.342
- Hey guys, it's Jeremy
from HowToHockey with

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:12.359
the Hockey Movement and
I just tested a machine

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:14.590
that can sharpen hockey skates at home.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.440
Yes, at home. It could be a huge product

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.654
for the hockey market, brand new.

00:00:19.654 --> 00:00:21.521
In this video, I'm gonna
test out and show you

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.410
all the bells and
whistles and how it works.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.679
Now I did do a video already, it's only

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.634
two minutes long, it's
on our Facebook page in

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:30.376
the video section. It's
just a quick look at

00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:31.860
the machine. Now in this one, I'm going

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.880
to show you guys all
the bells and whistles.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.825
It's actually really smart
how this machine is designed.

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:37.651
I was impressed, so I think
you'll like this video

00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:39.643
even though it's a bit
longer than the other one.

00:00:39.643 --> 00:00:41.794
So check it out, I'm gonna
show you the machine works

00:00:41.794 --> 00:00:43.792
and if you're lucky, you
can pick up one of these

00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:46.124
machines through the
Kickstarter before it's

00:00:46.124 --> 00:00:49.457
available in stores or on their website.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.027
Alright, well here's
Russ. He's the founder of

00:00:58.027 --> 00:01:00.708
Sparx Hockey. That is
the machine that will

00:01:00.708 --> 00:01:02.425
sharpen your skates at home for you.

00:01:02.425 --> 00:01:03.475
It's a new product coming up.

00:01:03.475 --> 00:01:06.139
Russ, explain to me how this works.

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:07.976
We already sort of went
over how it's sharpens,

00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:10.441
but show me sort of the inner
workings of the machine.

00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:13.247
- Okay, in between
sharpenings, you may want

00:01:13.247 --> 00:01:15.916
to change out the grinding
ring. This grinding ring,

00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:18.195
for example, is a 5/8 wheel.

00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:20.153
And the one that's in
the machine right now is

00:01:20.153 --> 00:01:22.411
a 1/2 inch radius.

00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:24.358
So this grinding ring

00:01:24.358 --> 00:01:26.882
would be a little bit flatter
and a little more glide,

00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:29.160
less bite than the ring
that's in there now.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.077
If you wanted to change
out the grinding ring,

00:01:31.077 --> 00:01:33.956
you would open this
front door on the machine

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:36.685
and again, similar to the
whole printer analogy,

00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:38.927
the grinding ring moves
over into a position now

00:01:38.927 --> 00:01:41.133
where you can just loosen
this nut and remove

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.860
the grinding ring and replace it.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.843
But you also might want to,
you know every 100 skate

00:01:46.843 --> 00:01:50.546
sharpenings or so, if
you care to, you can take

00:01:50.546 --> 00:01:54.392
this tray out and this
tray collects all of the

00:01:54.392 --> 00:01:58.168
steel dust from the skate inside the tray

00:01:58.168 --> 00:01:59.713
so you can just walk
over to the garbage pail

00:01:59.713 --> 00:02:01.498
and dump it out. And then there's also a

00:02:01.498 --> 00:02:03.706
HEPA filter in the back of the unit.

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:06.206
This HEPA filter is what

00:02:07.222 --> 00:02:08.534
all of the skate steel

00:02:08.534 --> 00:02:11.465
is being filtered through
so that none of it gets

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:13.161
into the environment
where you're operating

00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:15.393
the skate sharpener. This
can run, and we actually

00:02:15.393 --> 00:02:18.624
have run this in people's
kitchens and living rooms,

00:02:18.624 --> 00:02:21.377
with no dust accumulating anywhere because

00:02:21.377 --> 00:02:23.149
it's all trapped either
in the tray or filter.

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:24.495
- [Jeremy] Now can you
clean that filter or do you

00:02:24.495 --> 00:02:25.471
gotta replace it?

00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:28.447
- You totally can. We
recommend they're replaced

00:02:28.447 --> 00:02:30.697
about every 200 pairs of skates.

00:02:30.697 --> 00:02:33.155
But you can just as
easily, you know, you can

00:02:33.155 --> 00:02:35.170
dump it out and you can
see the skate steel's kinda

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.213
coming out of the filter.

00:02:36.213 --> 00:02:38.055
- [Jeremy] Yeah, so you do
that every few sharpenings

00:02:38.055 --> 00:02:40.067
just to keep it clean.
- Exactly, just to keep

00:02:40.067 --> 00:02:42.781
it clean. We'll offer
these, obviously on our

00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:46.948
website for replacement.
They won't be very expensive.

00:02:48.684 --> 00:02:50.243
- [Jeremy] So the replaceable
parts are the filter

00:02:50.243 --> 00:02:51.856
and those wheels.
- And these wheels.

00:02:51.856 --> 00:02:53.202
- [Jeremy] And the
wheels you said, every...

00:02:53.202 --> 00:02:54.562
- Every 50 pairs of skates.

00:02:54.562 --> 00:02:56.299
- [Jeremy] Alright, so
a dollar a sharpening?

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.211
- A dollar a sharpening.
- [Jeremy] 50 dollars a wheel.

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.062
So we got some safety features.

00:03:00.062 --> 00:03:02.385
So this thing won't work unless it's...

00:03:02.385 --> 00:03:05.660
- So if you try to start
it now, it'll tell you

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.230
that the, these we call these slot covers

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.584
or scoops. So it's not gonna let you start

00:03:10.584 --> 00:03:14.085
until these are closed.
The lights will extinguish

00:03:14.085 --> 00:03:16.195
as soon as it touches the skate.

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:18.672
And now it can start.
It also can't start with

00:03:18.672 --> 00:03:20.574
the door open. So if
you try to start it with

00:03:20.574 --> 00:03:22.989
the door open, it'll
give you an audible alert

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.393
telling you the door is open.

00:03:24.393 --> 00:03:27.185
- [Jeremy] Yup. And the one extra one is

00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:30.227
there's a filter in the back
and if the filter is out,

00:03:30.227 --> 00:03:32.805
or not in properly, then
it won't start as well

00:03:32.805 --> 00:03:34.583
because if that filter
isn't in there, it's gonna

00:03:34.583 --> 00:03:37.460
blow dust everywhere so
you're pretty much fool proof

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.034
skate sharpening. So Russ
is just explaining to me

00:03:40.034 --> 00:03:41.892
about the wheel and how it works.

00:03:41.892 --> 00:03:44.112
I'm asking, you can do
about 50 skate sharpenings

00:03:44.112 --> 00:03:46.514
with it, but how do you
know when to replace it.

00:03:46.514 --> 00:03:48.293
So I thought it was pretty interesting.

00:03:48.293 --> 00:03:52.318
- So, as this wheel is being
used to sharpen skates,

00:03:52.318 --> 00:03:56.090
the abrasive coating that is on the steel,

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.731
this ring. You can kinda
see this ring shape here,

00:03:59.731 --> 00:04:02.545
there's a steel-based
layer and then there's

00:04:02.545 --> 00:04:04.459
an abrasive coating on here.
And this abrasive coating

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.042
wears away as you sharpen the skates,

00:04:07.042 --> 00:04:10.297
and as you sharpen, we
call this the life bar.

00:04:10.297 --> 00:04:13.842
This life bar here counts
down the life of the grinding

00:04:13.842 --> 00:04:18.193
ring until you get all the
way down here, which will be,

00:04:18.193 --> 00:04:21.268
there's 10 lights, and so
you'll be in the 5-10% range

00:04:21.268 --> 00:04:24.489
of life of the wheel. This
will turn red, alerting you

00:04:24.489 --> 00:04:26.834
that you need to replace
your grinding ring.

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:28.726
- [Jeremy] And you said
there's a microchip in there,

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:29.559
that's how it reads it?

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:32.330
- Yeah, there's a chip
inside this wheel that

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.121
tells the machine how much
life is left in the wheel.

00:04:36.121 --> 00:04:37.558
The great thing about this,

00:04:37.558 --> 00:04:41.003
this allows, for example,
one guy on the block

00:04:41.003 --> 00:04:44.126
to buy a machine, and
all the kids on the block

00:04:44.126 --> 00:04:46.113
can buy their own grinding rings

00:04:46.113 --> 00:04:48.407
and share the machine.
- [Jeremy] Oh, I see.

00:04:48.407 --> 00:04:51.083
Yeah. So it's interchangeable. It knows

00:04:51.083 --> 00:04:53.250
which wheel is being used.

00:04:54.965 --> 00:04:57.332
- So everybody can have their own radius

00:04:57.332 --> 00:05:00.695
and the life of wheel is being tracked by

00:05:00.695 --> 00:05:01.801
the wheel itself.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:02.804
- [Jeremy] That's smart.

00:05:02.804 --> 00:05:05.012
- [Russ] It's finger
tight, there's no tools.

00:05:05.012 --> 00:05:08.023
We tried to get rid of any tools.

00:05:08.023 --> 00:05:12.190
Finger tight, you don't want
to go too tight. Just close it.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.546
So you can kind of see
how hacked up this is.

00:05:15.546 --> 00:05:18.651
- [Jeremy] Oh yeah, it's
a bad blade. (laughs)

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:22.651
I was, uh, skating on
synthetic ice for a while,

00:05:23.747 --> 00:05:25.851
which pretty much rounds the edges.

00:05:25.851 --> 00:05:28.227
So Russ gave me the intensive 30 second

00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:30.155
training session. I want to see if I can

00:05:30.155 --> 00:05:31.863
remember all the steps.

00:05:31.863 --> 00:05:34.540
Step one, push down here

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.296
and put the skate in, let it go.

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:39.593
She's in there, that's firm.

00:05:39.593 --> 00:05:42.758
Step two, push here
and clamp the skate in.

00:05:42.758 --> 00:05:45.218
That seems pretty good. And step three,

00:05:45.218 --> 00:05:47.797
push this button. There
we go, I'm an expert

00:05:47.797 --> 00:05:49.130
skate sharpener.

00:05:52.205 --> 00:05:54.872
(buzzing noise)

00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.616
And we're done! It's like a toaster oven.

00:06:10.616 --> 00:06:12.347
And I guess there's one step now.

00:06:12.347 --> 00:06:14.461
I have to run the stone up and down it.

00:06:14.461 --> 00:06:15.294
- [Russ] Correct.

00:06:15.294 --> 00:06:16.127
- Alright.

00:06:17.315 --> 00:06:19.149
- [Russ] And then you
can toss the edge checker

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:20.238
on there too if you want.

00:06:20.238 --> 00:06:23.717
- Sure. Last step is the edge checker.

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:25.920
I'm assuming most people
out there don't know

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.261
how this thing works. So
you toss it on your blade,

00:06:28.261 --> 00:06:30.448
and it's gonna measure how
leveled those edges are.

00:06:30.448 --> 00:06:33.321
Having leveled edges is
important in skating.

00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:35.230
So I'm just gonna exaggerate
this to show a point.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.878
If your edges are like
that, you can see a bunch

00:06:36.878 --> 00:06:39.267
of dots on this side and not on the other.

00:06:39.267 --> 00:06:41.132
You don't have even edges.
So I'm just gonna let this

00:06:41.132 --> 00:06:43.215
sit and push it up there.

00:06:44.918 --> 00:06:48.205
Alright so that is leveled.
You can see the dots

00:06:48.205 --> 00:06:51.239
right along there, showing
the levelness of the edge.

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:53.101
I'll wrap this up while
I'm skating, let you know

00:06:53.101 --> 00:06:54.815
how the sharpening felt.

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:57.178
So basically, it felt
just how you'd expect

00:06:57.178 --> 00:07:00.403
a good sharpening to feel
like from any skate shop.

00:07:00.403 --> 00:07:04.403
Good edges, no flat spots,
no nicks, nice glide.

00:07:05.978 --> 00:07:07.356
What I'm really excited about is that

00:07:07.356 --> 00:07:09.982
you can probably get the
same consistency from

00:07:09.982 --> 00:07:11.685
the machine over, over and over.

00:07:11.685 --> 00:07:13.959
Not like, sometimes you
bring your skates to the shop

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:16.893
and you wonder, "oh I
hope they did a good job."

00:07:16.893 --> 00:07:18.597
So you would never have that
feeling, you always have

00:07:18.597 --> 00:07:21.269
the consistency with the
quality that you'd expect.

00:07:21.269 --> 00:07:22.575
So really excited for
the product, if you guys

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:24.262
wanna pick one up or just check it out,

00:07:24.262 --> 00:07:26.568
check out the Kickstarter right now or

00:07:26.568 --> 00:07:27.791
their website. I'll put some links in

00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:29.560
the video description. So thanks a lot

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.841
for watching this video and don't forget

00:07:30.841 --> 00:07:35.008
