Joel Hickerson, grindog.com. Today we're going
to learn how to draw a scary face. First thing

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.780
you want to do is just draw the basic construction
elements that you would on any other face.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.270
And then you can come back and add the elements
that would make this one scary. And draw your

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.530
eye line, nose line, mouth line and draw your
eyes, nice simple shapes for now, just to

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.770
kind of get the position. Then the next thing
you want to think about is what's going to

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.640
make this face scary. Do you want to make
it super exaggerated or do you want to just

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.690
do it by eyebrows? When you bring the eyebrows
down, one it makes it meaner as you accessorize

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:53.240
a little bit and also add that scary element.
O.k., and then the eyes themselves, maybe

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:01.670
you want to make them rounded more bloodshot,
the nose maybe a little sharper and hooked

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.810
down. And you find yourself, as you draw,
actually making some of these expressions

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:17.180
really helps too. And the mouth, maybe you
use the teeth to add a scary element or the

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:28.360
tongue. And the ears, it never hurts to add
nice pointy ears. Basically you're adding

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.990
elements that all contribute to this face
just being that much more scary. Now, bald

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.040
is kind of scary. Maybe you bring it down
as a widow's peak, kind of a Dracula look.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.530
Maybe you even spike it up a little bit to
make it even more scary. Maybe you draw sweat

00:01:50.530 --> 00:02:00.570
marks, make the ears a little darker. Really
accent the eyebrows. The eyebrows can really

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.049
make you or break you on this one. O.k., and
maybe a wart on the nose. You want to darken

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:15.090
in the mouth, o.k. Now then you come back,
now that you've got your constructions lines,

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.069
you can pick and choose the scary elements
you want to keep, like on your eyebrows, for

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:35.859
instance. You can make them really dark. Then
your eyes, you come back and you make the

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:42.540
round circles. And if you're using color it's
always a good idea, kind of a little red around

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:51.389
those eyes. Flared nostrils are always a great
scary item. Again the mouth and the mouth

00:02:51.389 --> 00:03:08.150
lines, don't be afraid to leave your construction
lines behind. Maybe for the tongue and the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:24.019
sharp cheeks, and the jaw down to the chin,
and your ears and your spiked hair, kind of

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:37.249
even makes it that much more fun. Furrowed
brow, maybe a widow's peak too, and there.

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:38.809
And that's how you draw a scary face.
