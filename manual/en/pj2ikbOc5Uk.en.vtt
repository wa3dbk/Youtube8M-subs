00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.130
The original Kia Sorento debuted during the
midsize SUV craze over a decade ago.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:19.040
But, as tastes changed so did Kia and for
2011 the Sorento was reborn as a 3-row crossover.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.060
And now for 2016, Kia continues to refine
their family vehicle concept with an all-new

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.060
model.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.400
2016 Sorento SXLUntil you see them side-by-side,
it can be easy to mistake this new Sorento

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.020
for the previous one.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.770
With it being so successful, Kia saw no reason
for a radical design change and so they re-sculpted

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.100
what they already had into a CUV that’s
instantly recognizable as a Sorento but with

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.320
numerous changes to keep it modern as well
as to make it more spacious.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.800
Looking much like the new Sedona from the
front, the Sorento now presents itself as

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.520
more polished and also more planted with a
an over 3” increase in wheelbase and a nominal

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.309
increase in width.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.339
Kia also introduces a new turbocharged engine
to the mix – a 2.0-liter unit making 240

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.479
horsepower, returning 22mpg combined, bridging
the gap between the base 2.4-liter motor and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.020
this screaming, 290 horsepower 3.3-liter V6.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.130
Coupled with the optional all-wheel drive,
this Sorento SX V6 is fleet of foot and good

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.040
in the snow, even with the standard 19”
all-season tires – the Premier LTX, which

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.380
is all-new rubber from Michelin.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.049
Other benefits of the somewhat expensive all-wheel
drive system – priced as a $1,800 option-

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.979
include a 4-wheel drive lock mode for better
traction in off-road conditions and Torque

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.119
Vectoring Corner Control for improved dry-road
handling.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.439
No matter which engine you choose, it’ll
be mated to a 6-speed auto.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:54.820
Gas mileage here is rated at 17mpg city/23mpg
highway…a tick below the less powerful Toyota

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.590
Highlander while towing has been raised to
handle 5,000 pounds.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.750
The Driver Mode Select comes standard across
the board and manipulates the transmission,

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.890
steering and engine characteristics ranging
from Eco to Normal to Sport.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.910
V6 models also benefit from a rack mounted
electric steering system and indeed the Sorento’s

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.629
quicker wheel commands with better precision
but is still a bit Kia-vague.

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.890
The ride quality is far more sophisticated,
enhanced by a more rigid body and a revised

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.120
suspension that delivers increased softness
over harsh roads and sharper handling.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.622
And it’s no doubt quieter inside, too.

00:02:32.622 --> 00:02:33.860
The use of higher-quality and more aesthetically
pleasing soft-touch plastics and standard

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.860
leather trim greet the passengers.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.860
As you approach the Sorento, the mirrors unfold
and ambient LED lighting shows the way.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.860
It’s a brilliantly easy cockpit to use free
of clutter with intuitive control positioning,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.860
exceptional graphics displays and purposeful
solutions.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.170
The new UVO eServices is a subscription-free
telematics system that uses your smartphone

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.239
to do things like make a 9-1-1 call in the
event of an accident or to setup a geofence

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.970
that notifies you when the driver has left
a certain radius that you define.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:03:08.920
UVO also has really cool features like SoundHound,
Google Search and good voice recognition.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:25.290
Chrysler’s industry best UConnect system
has been put on standby because Kia’s UVO

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.420
is arguably just as good and features Siri
Eyes Free for iPhone users.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.010
The details present in the electronics are
impressive, like this graphic alerting you

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.840
to askew front wheels before driving off.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.300
Safety features here include a back-up warning
system, blind spot detection and rear cross

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.850
traffic alert.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.150
More advanced systems are optional on the
range-topping SX Limited V6.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.160
All three rows now benefit from increased
head and legroom and the 3rd row is easier

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.800
to access thanks to the increased wheelbase.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.560
It’s a useable space, too with far more
room than I would’ve imagined but getting

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.489
there can only be done from the passenger
side where the 40/20/40 splitfold seat slides

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.720
fore and aft.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.099
The driver’s side doesn’t have that tilt
and slide feature.

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.440
The easy to drop 3rd row and the dual levers
for dropping the 2nd row are very convenient.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.870
And getting the power hatch up is easier than
ever with a proximity sensor that doesn’t

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.060
require you to lift a leg.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.030
Looking up there’s a huge standard panoramic
sunroof that lends airiness but can be a bit

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.690
tricky to operate without also opening the
glass.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.370
This is a cabin that has all of the little
extras and clever designs to keep the family

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.620
happy.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.870
At the beginning there’s the Sorento L starting
at about $25,000 and then just before the

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:53.710
top of the line SX Limited V6 there’s this
SX V6, priced with AWD at $40,595 with no

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.040
other options.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:04.500
Kia’s 2nd effort in the crossover genre
produces a more appealing and mature entry.
