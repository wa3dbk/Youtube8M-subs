00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.640
So unfortunately for me, my transition
into my early twenties did not halt

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.389
acne forming on my skin. Shockingly this
is the best my skin has lived in over a month.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.110
I completely revamped my skincare
routine and if you guys look at these

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.740
before and during pictures

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.510
I think you'll agree when I say that it
has made some major improvements

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.350
in the condition of my skin. If you just
wanna see an updated skincare routine

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.849
give this video a big thumbs up so I
know, and I will get right on that.

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.679
In this video, I wanted to show you guys
an acne coverage foundation routine using

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.280
only drugstore products. I'm not gonna
lie, this is a really full coverage

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.260
routine so if you are not into the look of full
coverage foundation this is probably not for you.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.710
I don't even go this far a lot of the
time but if I have an event where I need to

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.870
make sure that my skin looks as clear as
it possibly can be, this is the routine

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:47.760
that I do.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.579
So the first thing you're gonna do is
ignore the red hair dye stains all over

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.100
my sink. This is just what happens when
you decide to dye your hair red.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.109
And the second thing we're gonna do
is clean off

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.600
our sponge that we're going to be using
to apply our foundation today.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.650
I using the Real Techniques knock off
Beauty Blender sponge thing to apply my

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.470
foundation.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.590
This sponge, especially when it's a little
bit damp, I find is the easiest and most

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.189
effective way to apply your foundation so
it looks like skin and not like

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:14.979
foundation.

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.750
You really can't beat the price tag either,
I'm pretty sure I picked this up

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.640
at Ulta for like seven dollars.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.110
I'm first going to be using a green
concealer to cover up the redness

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.600
in my face. Since green is opposite of red on the color wheel, that means these

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.759
two colors neutralize each other when
they're

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.110
overlapping so if ever you want to cover
up a little bit

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.200
redness I highly suggest either a green
concealer or green primer

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.619
it really helps neutralize the redness
in your face and I just find it makes

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.650
such a difference

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.360
once the green concealer is all applied
where I want it we are going to be doing

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.850
this incredibly advanced technique
called patting it out with your ring

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.310
finger

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.890
this method is incredibly easy and
convenient and it also makes the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.159
concealer look the most natural it
possibly could

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.130
I'm also making sure the edges of the
green concealer all diffused out

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.790
so the green kinda blends into your skin
a little bit easier but obviously

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.060
eh... it won't look natural

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.590
then I'm going to start with my first
layer of foundation

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.410
I'm focusing the foundation first
wherever I dotted that green concealer

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.720
because I want that concealer to be
about as invisible as possible

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.349
the annoying thing about green concealer is that it's pretty hard to cover up

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.390
this green concealer in particular is
very very

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.550
opaque. After my second layer of
foundation and I can still see the green

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.170
kind of peeking through I'm gonna go in with a more flesh-toned concealer

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.910
this one is also by NYX and I'm just to
put this concealer all over the green

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.550
spots that are peeking through again

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.959
and once more I'm going to be blending
out that concealer with my ring finger

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.080
I'm actually not going to diffuse the
edges of this concealer

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.209
out. Then I'm gonna go in with one last
final layer of my foundation

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.730
and I'm actually going to apply the
foundation all around the edges of the

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.450
concealer

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.890
applying foundation to the outer edges
of the concealer helps blend the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.690
concealer out along the edges

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.690
but it doesn't add unnecessary product
on top on where we are already placed

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.420
the concealer

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.340
once the foundation is all blended out
along the outer edges of the concealer

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.209
I'm going to delicately press the sponge
on top of where I already placed my

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:13.849
concealer

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.400
just to further ensure that its all
blended out and looks about as natural

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.209
as it can be

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.680
so now you can see that the redness is
really really really covered which is

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.640
fantastic

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.409
the sucky thing about acne for me is
more the texture than anything else but

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.860
unfortunately there's not really much I
can do about that

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.590
then I'm just gonna do the same thing on
the other side of my face

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.310
then it's time for powder my favorite
powder of all time is this translucent

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.180
HD powder by NYX it applies so flawlessly
and it doesn't give

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.350
any extra coverage which is actually
something I like in a powder

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.560
I'm actually going up I this powder
around my eyes first of all

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.400
only because they're really prone to
creasing so I'm gonna pat out any lines

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.090
that I might have and then I'm just
gonna go over everything with that

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.930
translucent powder

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.060
then with the bigger fluffy brush I'm gonna
tap off the excess the powder and I'm

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.759
gonna lightly pat it

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.949
on the areas where it gets a little
shiny sometimes

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.169
and very gently pat it over the areas
where I concealed heavily

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.280
then with the clean side of the blending
brush that still has a little bit

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.270
dampness to it

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.400
I'm gonna lightly pat this all over my face
this just helps ensure that my

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.250
foundation doesn't look cakey looks a
little bit more natural

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.349
and then I'm just going to apply the
rest of my make up for the day and

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:12.620
that's pretty much it

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.370
I hope this help you guys out if you are
also suffering from acne I know how
