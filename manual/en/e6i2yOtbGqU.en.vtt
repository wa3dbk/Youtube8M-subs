00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.400
what does a lighted wrench on your
dashboard or MID screen mean?

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.750
The lighted wrench is part of your vehicle's maintenance minder system which notifies

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.339
you when your vehicle needs service

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.590
maintenance minder measures and records
sensor readings at various points in

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.260
your vehicle to determine what is the
optimal time to have it serviced

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.310
when you're engine runs at higher
temperatures during short trips frequent

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.410
starts and stops or hilly terrain the
oil life will deplete faster than driving

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.240
under more normal conditions at lower
rpms

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.010
Oil is a major contributor to your
engine's performance and longevity

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.160
if you drive the vehicle with
insufficient or deteriorated oil the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.250
engine may fail or be damaged

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.920
when the oil life reaches fifteen
percent

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.720
you'll see the maintenance minder
indicator wrench turn on

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.120
along with the wrench indicator a
maintenance code will appear on your

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.800
dash informing you of which items need
servicing

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.370
when the oil life reaches five percent
the service is due now

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.060
if the only life reaches zero percent
the service is overdue any will show the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.670
number of miles overdue with a negative sign in front of it

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.500
this number will flash until you have
the vehicle serviced

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.390
your vehicle also uses codes to help you
decipher what is required for service

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.470
these codes consist of a main code by
itself

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.750
or a main and the sub code

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.890
the codes may seem confusing but in your
owners manual there is a page under the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.380
maintenance section with all the codes

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.720
the main code A indicates that you
just need to replace the engine oil

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.259
while B indicates you need to replace
the engine oil, oil filter,

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.920
inspect the front and rear brakes and
check the parking brake adjustment

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.720
etcetera

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.540
the sub codes are additional maintenance
items that need to be checked or serviced

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.290
with the main code.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.750
these codes may vary depending on your
model and trim,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.799
check your owners manual for your
vehicle specific codes

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.890
so for example if the code A2 is
displayed on your dash your dealer will

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.959
only need to change the oil and replace
your interior air filter

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.359
Other service facilities may have you
replace the oil filter unnecessarily

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:17.339
and may not even replace your cabin
filter

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:21.629
honda dealers try to ensure that not
only is your vehicle efficient but so is

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.419
your service

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:27.109
the maintenance minder system is also
intelligent enough to group your service

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.900
items together so you don't have to go
to the dealers often

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.530
for example if the drive belt
inspection is scheduled to be done at

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.269
thirty thousand miles but you oil life
percentage will reach the end of its

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.670
life at twenty nine thousand
miles

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.330
the maintenance minder system will move
the belt inspection out so you won't

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.089
have to come back for service in another
thousand miles

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:51.699
Visit your local Honda dealer when you
see the little wrench icon

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:57.079
or stop by any honda dealer that offers
express service for quick easy and

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.179
affordable service
