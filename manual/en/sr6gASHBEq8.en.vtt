Hey there. It's Nichole Kellerman, founder
and creator of SuccessfulWeightLossSchool.com;

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.820
where women go to stop dieting, reshape their
bodies and feel widly alive.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.020
Okay. So today is our third part of a 3-part
series on emotional eating. In the first video, Emotional Eating

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.180
I talked about how to stop a craving in the
moment of the craving. In video two, I taught

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.710
you the Food Freedome Technique to prevent
the food cravings. And today, I'm gonna be

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.180
talking about the physical addiction when
it comes to emotional eating.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.470
If you haven't seen those two other videos,
they're right here if you want to check them

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.160
out. I highly suggest you do.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.749
So today I'm gonna be talking to you about
the physical addiction when it comes to emotional

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.999
cravings.

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:11.289
So, when we're in our really highly stressful
or emotional time in our life, like say you're

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:17.259
going through a divorce, doing a big move,
or God forbidden one of your family members

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:24.069
passes away, we tend to turn to food for comfort.
I'm just as guilty as you. It's totally normal;

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:30.490
nothing to be shameful about. And so what
happens is after the emotional stage has done

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.840
passed, we then create a physical addiction
to the food.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.179
For example (this is totally me), is I'm going
through a highly emotional situation, ice

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.689
cream - I said it before, is tends to be my
 Emotional Eatingguilty food. And so say, I reach to the ice

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.469
cream usually at 7 o'clock almost every single
night.

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:56.469
I have found that you can create a physical
addiction in under 4 days. I then move passed

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:03.599
the stress on day 5. Then on the 7 o'clock
hit, and I'm like, "I want some ice cream."

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:10.000
So to know longer on emotional craving, is
a physical addiction. After you watch those

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.930
two other videos that I taught you, I want
you to really figure out if it's emotional

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.400
craving or it's a physical addiction from
an emotional craving in the past.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.920
This is what I want you to do if it's a physical
addiction -- I need you to distract your brain. Emotional Eating

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.719
They tell people who are trying to quit smoking
all the time. It's super easy. You can go

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:35.900
outside and take a walk. You can go for take
a bath. You can write in your journal. You

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.780
can do a little dance party. Get that energy
out of your system. You can call a friend.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.650
Anything.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.709
When my step mom was trying to quit smoking,
she told me she had a big dining table. And

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.069
she said that every time she had a craving
on cigarette, she would just lapse around

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.069
the dining room table until the craving went
away. Brilliant. That's all you need to do

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.340
if it's a physical addiction. Emotional Eating

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.209
You need to make sure that it's not emotional
and if it is, you go to the processes and

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:09.209
use the techniques and formula that I gave
you in the last two videos. But if it's physical,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.760
all you need to do is distract your brain. Emotional Eating
