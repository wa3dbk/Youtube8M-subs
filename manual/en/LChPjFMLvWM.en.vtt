Laura: Hi my name is Dr. Laurie Hess.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.620
I am a Board Certified bird veterinarian and
I work only with birds and exotic animals.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.170
I own the veterinary center for birds and
exotics in Bedford Hills, New York, which

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.980
is Westchester County, New York.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.860
I have practiced only on birds and exotic
animals for the past, almost 18 years.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.450
I have a very strong passion for birds and
exotics.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.680
I love them as does my colleague here, Sarah
Inglis.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.000
She is a licensed veterinary technician, right
Sara?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.250
Sarah: Yes I am.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.690
I have been working in the veterinary field
for nearly 13 years.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.500
I started with cats and dogs, and I began
my adventure with birds and exotics about

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.591
seven years ago, and I never turned back.

00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:50.829
I just think that they're so much more special
and they're so interesting and there's so

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.640
many more opportunities to educate people
on how to care for them properly and I

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.200
really think they need some allies.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.079
Laurie: Yeah, and that's why I chose to become
a bird and exotic animal veterinarian.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.260
I went to extra schooling.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.440
I did a residency in exotic animal medicine.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.070
I take a special board exam every 10 years
to certify for birds.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.729
There is actually fewer than 150 Board Certified
bird veterinarians in the world.

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.810
We're very proud of our hospital, the Veterinary
Center for Birds and Exotics, where we only

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.409
treat birds and other exotic species, like
ferrets and rabbits and rodents and reptiles

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.310
and sugar gliders and hedgehogs.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.799
Everything other than cats and dogs.

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.310

and what we do, you can visit us on the web

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.409

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.340
You can email us at info@avianexoticsvet.com
and we're really proud of our hospital.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.289
What we do all day is educate the bird and
the exotic pet owner about how to better care

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.060
for their pet, so that they can enjoy a long
and happy and healthy life.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.060
Right Sarah?

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.420
Sarah: That's right, and I really hope that
anyone watching these videos, any bird owners

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.069
or potential bird owners can come away with
some really good information that can help

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.729
them and their birds live happy and healthy
together for a very long time.
