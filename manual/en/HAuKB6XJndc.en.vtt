[WIND BLOWING]

00:00:01.988 --> 00:00:06.461
Just see how your voice is just
an extension of the breath.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.630
Meredith Monk's workshop
was really perfect for me,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.430
because all of
her work is really

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.740
about interdisciplinary
arts, which is my focus.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.770
I'm combining theater and
music and dance in my studies

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.120
at Mount Holyoke.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.370
A lot of her exercises
focused on bringing together

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.210
the voice and the body.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.210
[SINGING]

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.750
She had us do several exercises
in which we were doing

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.570
a particular vocal exercise.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.140
For example, like
one vowel sound

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.570
sustained for a while,
while being static,

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.690
and then while walking
slowly, while walking

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.220
a little bit faster, while
running through the room.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.280
And her point was to get us to
stop thinking about everything

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.170
so hard and just to let our
voices and bodies be fused.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.667
[BARKING]

00:01:40.655 --> 00:01:42.152
That's it.

00:01:42.152 --> 00:01:44.647
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.799
Of all of the
exercises that we did,

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.340
the one that stood
out to me the most

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.390
was the opening
exercise in which

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.940
she had us move freely
through the space

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.850
and lead the movement with a
particular part of our body,

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.950
like an arm or a
hand or an ankle.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.530
Normally improv is sort of
a challenge for me in dance

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.120
because I'm less
experienced and I'm

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.540
less adventurous
with my movement,

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.820
but it was simple enough--
lead with your hand,

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.872
lead with your foot--
that I found myself

00:02:08.872 --> 00:02:10.580
being much more
inventive than I normally

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.600
am and much more
comfortable in the space

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.140
and exploring the movement.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.160
For me, her visit is
really perfectly timed

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.960
because I'm taking
a dance composition

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.240
course with Terese
Freedman, who's fabulous,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.230
and we're talking about
site-specific dance pieces.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.330
So we're finding different
environments in which to work,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.120
and then creating dance
pieces based on what

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.939
we find in those environments.

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.480
And so it's really
interesting for me

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.260
to be able to talk
with Meredith Monk,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.250
because she does site-specific
work, and that's something

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.500
I'm just beginning to explore.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.560
And she has a lot of experience
with it, so I got some advice.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.199
That's the thing I love
about site-specific work--

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.440
And I've been having
such a wonderful time

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.710
meeting students and
hearing questions

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.956
that are even questions that
I'm still asking myself.

00:02:54.956 --> 00:02:56.730
It's been very, very lively.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.870
Being able to be at a
women's college at this age

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.960
is a really great thing.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.300
I went to Sarah Lawrence,
and there was just

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.350
something about
that time of my life

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.220
that I really felt I could
really concentrate and buckle

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.953
down and that my mind
was really respected

00:03:15.953 --> 00:03:21.400
and I could just really,
really dig down into my work

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.030
and into my exploration
of my artistic identity.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.100
So I was very grateful
for that period.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.820
And I think it's wonderful
that this school also

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.095
has that kind of intensity.

00:03:32.095 --> 00:03:33.677
And, hear, hear.

00:03:33.677 --> 00:03:34.631
Hear, hear.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.062
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.400
One of Meredith's
final bits of advice

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.510
that resonated with me
as a graduating senior

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.210
was to not be scared and
to be a troublemaker.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.760
When people have found out that
I'm working in human rights,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.410
they've jumped to,
oh, so you're going

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.669
to be working in politics,
and my immediate reaction

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.460
was, I don't really
want to be in politics.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.680
I would rather be the one
pissing the politicians off.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.721
So that's probably going
to be the trouble that I

00:03:57.721 --> 00:03:59.340
make in the next few years.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.440
