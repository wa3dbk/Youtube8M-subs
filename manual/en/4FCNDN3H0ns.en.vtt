00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:14.620
We have our tickets in hand and tonight we
are going to be doing the Melaka River Cruise.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:25.649
The city really lights up at night.

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:33.570
I'm really enjoying this right now because
I've actually only walked along this area.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:01:12.130
I've never taken the boat and I've never done
this at night so this is awesome.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:46.749
It is so much easier and convenient taking
the boat than walking.

00:01:46.749 --> 00:02:04.672
My favorite part of the tour has been getting
to see all of the art on the exterior of the

00:02:04.672 --> 00:02:05.810
buildings by the river.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.990
Since I first came here back in 2008 there
has been a lot of development in the area.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:21.170
There used to be a lot of traditional homes
alongside the Kampong the river but not anymore.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.170
Now there are boutique hotels and condos.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.710
It has lost a little bit of its charm in my
opinion.|
