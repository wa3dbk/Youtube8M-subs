Apart from being very beautiful, San Sebastián is very relaxing, you can live very well here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.021
This is Ondaretta beach and the beach where the matches of La Concha take place.

00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:35.015
Me and my sons Xabi and Mikel Alonso came here from Barcelona when my they were about eight years old.

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:40.007
At school they started to play football on the beach.

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:47.015
It’s very typical here. They played in beach championships at La Concha then moved on to Antiguoko.

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:58.014
Antiguoko was founded in 1982. It’s in a small area of Antiguo, which belongs to San Sebastián.

00:00:58.014 --> 00:01:06.010
Part of our function is to look at players from a young age and develop them

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.010
so that some end up in the Primera División.

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:20.004
Xabi Alonso was very small, very skilful, and he had a great shot that he still has now.

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:26.013
Going to the beach is very good for a young player’s development.

00:01:26.013 --> 00:01:35.020
It aids physical development and the development of ability and skills. Above all it helps with coordination,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.000
knowing how to step and move. The beach is very important.

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:49.000
The kids carry the goals, set up the pitch, mark the lines.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.017
They do this in all weathers. It’s what makes them men.

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:58.020
In future, we hope more Alonsos and Artetas will come from the beach.
