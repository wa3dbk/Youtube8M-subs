00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.703
[wind, birds]

00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:10.210
It’s just amazing 
the different things

00:00:10.278 --> 00:00:12.026
that show up here at the park.

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:14.848
This is the first time I’ve run 
across this particular flower.

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:18.518
Pat Bales likes to stop
and smell the flowers.

00:00:18.586 --> 00:00:19.651
"Beautiful little flower."

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.521
And after a spring rain at 
San Angelo State Park,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.625
there’s a lot to 
stop and smell.

00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:27.791
Yee-haw!

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.930
But get Pat on the 
mountain bike trails

00:00:29.998 --> 00:00:31.743
and nothing can stop him.

00:00:31.811 --> 00:00:33.600
One of our largest 
attractions of course

00:00:33.668 --> 00:00:35.365
is our trail system out here.

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:37.503
We have one of the most 
extensive trail systems

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:39.126
for hike, bike, and equestrian,

00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:42.275
of any of the state parks 
in the state.

00:00:42.343 --> 00:00:45.176
[bike on gravel]

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.513
I try to get out and ride 
as much as I can.

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:50.516
I enjoy it, not only because I 
enjoy being out in nature

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:55.621
but it just keeps me 
in pretty good shape.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.925
You can be riding along, just 
winding through the flats,

00:00:58.993 --> 00:01:01.528
all kinds of bushes and flowers 
and trees around you,

00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:03.826
next thing you know, you 
drop off into a ravine

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:05.228
or into a real rocky area

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:06.400
and so you never know

00:01:06.468 --> 00:01:08.598
what you’re going 
to see along the way.

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:12.238
[kids] "Look at this! 
I found a raptor track!"

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:15.585
Whether exploring by foot, 
bike or horseback,

00:01:15.653 --> 00:01:19.111
visitors are bound to notice 
the diversity of life here.

00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:21.881
"You all just hold him up 
so y'all can see him..."

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.185
We’re kind of at the confluence 
of 4 ecological zones out here.

00:01:25.253 --> 00:01:27.428
We have the rolling planes, 
the high planes,

00:01:27.498 --> 00:01:28.821
and then the Hill Country 
to the East

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.086
and Trans-Pecos to the West.

00:01:31.155 --> 00:01:33.356
We get a little overlap 
of flora and fauna

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:35.525
of those particular 
regions in this area,

00:01:35.593 --> 00:01:37.483
which makes it rather rich

00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:41.033
as far as that plant life and 
animal life’s concerned.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.220
[prairie dog chirps]

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.771
Prairie dogs were indigenous 
to this area at one time,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.003
and we actually started 
a colony on the north side

00:01:48.071 --> 00:01:49.791
and the south side of the park

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.180
and they seem to 
be doing quite well.

00:01:53.248 --> 00:01:55.948
Although it doesn’t appear 
to have hurt wildlife,

00:01:56.016 --> 00:02:00.935
a long-term drought hasn’t been 
so kind to O.C. Fisher Lake.

00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:03.290
It’s a beautiful lake 
whenever it is full.

00:02:03.358 --> 00:02:08.226
1982 was the last time that 
it was at a decent elevation.

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:11.096
Unfortunately, right now it’s 
down to about 2%.

00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:13.400
"Oh my goodness!"

00:02:13.468 --> 00:02:14.935
Fishing’s pretty good right now.

00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:17.200
They’re pretty concentrated 
as low as it is.

00:02:17.268 --> 00:02:18.841
"Is there a fish on there?"

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.973
But any day now, 
it’s gonna fill up.

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:23.776
"Oh, my second one 
of the day! Alright!"

00:02:23.845 --> 00:02:28.046
[running creek]
[cattle mooing]

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:29.581
We do have the largest part

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.800
of the official Texas 
state longhorn herd.

00:02:31.868 --> 00:02:33.786
They’re always a joy to see.

00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:35.886
They’re a magnificent 
herd of animals and,

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:38.158
of course, part of our 
American heritage.

00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:40.826
We've got ring-tailed 
raccoons, possums.

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:43.930
We've got bobcats, all kinds 
of neat animals out here.

00:02:43.998 --> 00:02:45.665
There’s a lot of 
geology out here

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:47.233
as well as our cultural 
and natural resources

00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:48.900
that we have out here
in the park.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:51.436
[kids] "...it has 3..."

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:53.273
We have the largest set of

00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:55.471
prehistoric Permian 
vertebrate animal tracks

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.576
in the world right 
here in the park

00:02:56.645 --> 00:02:58.875
that predate the dinosaurs 
about 90 million years.

00:02:58.943 --> 00:03:02.048
[kids] "All those footprints! 
Come on, guys!"

00:03:02.116 --> 00:03:04.685
Whether you marvel at 
prehistoric tracks

00:03:04.753 --> 00:03:06.686
or leave your own tracks,

00:03:06.755 --> 00:03:09.890
San Angelo State Park 
has a lot to discover.

00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958
Oh, golly, every day’s a 
new adventure out here.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.628
And it gets better all the time.

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:18.515
