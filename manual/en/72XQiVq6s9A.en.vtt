Hi guys - Drue James here from learnguitarinlondon.com

00:00:04.807 --> 00:00:08.807
Today, I'm going to be showing you a warm-up for your fingers

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:10.159
A finger gym exercise.

00:00:10.037 --> 00:00:14.037
This is something that you can be doing for about 5-7 minutes.

00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:18.272
There are different variations that I can show you 
 if you were to have lessons with me.

00:00:17.607 --> 00:00:23.607
But it's a good warm-up for your fingers, before you 
 get started on the rest of your practice regime.

00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:25.834
So as I said, about 5-7 minutes is perfect.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.720
I'm just going to number the fingers on this hand.

00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:30.182
So you've got your 1st finger.

00:00:29.052 --> 00:00:31.052
2nd finger.

00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:31.887
3rd.

00:00:30.517 --> 00:00:32.517
And 4th.

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:38.174
In the beginning of this exercise, we take our 1st finger and 
 put it on the 1st fret on the thickest string.

00:00:38.478 --> 00:00:41.478
And that play that note, that's the first one.

00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:46.712
And then, our 2nd finger, to make the F-sharp on the 2nd fret.

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:51.667
And then you've guessed it, 3rd finger to 
 make the G on the 3rd fret.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.270
And 4th finger, little finger, to make the G-sharp there.

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:57.439
So it should be like this...

00:00:57.383 --> 00:01:00.383
1, 2, 3, 4, okay?

00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:02.951
So hopefully you've got that.

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:04.628
 ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬  ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬

00:01:04.996 --> 00:01:09.996
Then you move down and repeat the same pattern on the A string.

00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:13.602
So 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:13.297 --> 00:01:15.297
Same on the D string.

00:01:14.678 --> 00:01:18.678
 ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬  ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬

00:01:17.347 --> 00:01:19.347
And same on the G string.

00:01:18.288 --> 00:01:22.288
 ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬  ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬

00:01:20.223 --> 00:01:22.223
And on the B.

 ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬  ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬

00:01:23.257 --> 00:01:25.257
And on the E.

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:26.734
 ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬ ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬

00:01:26.584 --> 00:01:28.584
Okay.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.900
As you're playing the exercise, always try to keep your 
 elbow as close into your body as possible

00:01:32.894 --> 00:01:39.894
'cause it can be tempting to do that - I was just doing it 
 a bit there actually - so keep your elbow into your body.

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:41.270
Make sure that you're pressing down on the fret

00:01:40.258 --> 00:01:43.260
But not so much that you're really, sort of, pressing into the wood

00:01:44.027 --> 00:01:48.030
Just press them down enough so that you can 
 get sound out of them. Okay? 

00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:51.060
And hold down as close to the fret markers as you can.

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.290
That's just to make ease of sounding the note.

00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:56.780
So that's 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:58.860
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:58.393 --> 00:02:04.390
♩ ♪ ♫ ♬ ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:09.860
And try to keep your fingers as close to 
 the fretboard as possible, as you're playing.

00:02:10.048 --> 00:02:15.050
Now if you're a beginner student, you might find 
 that your fingers are flicking off like this.

00:02:14.388 --> 00:02:19.390
Okay. Exaggerating slightly there, but the idea is 
 that this is building up the dexterity

00:02:19.818 --> 00:02:22.820
If you can keep all your fingers down at the same time.

00:02:23.283 --> 00:02:25.280
♩ ♪ ♫ ♬ ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.720
Okay, good.

00:02:26.355 --> 00:02:32.360
Then once you get to here, you then go down 
 the scale, so the notes are going down.

00:02:32.124 --> 00:02:35.120
So it's ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬ ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬

00:02:34.762 --> 00:02:36.760
Okay?

00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:39.260
And then, this is the part that beginners will find quite difficult.

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:41.030
So bringing your 4th finger over to the B string

00:02:40.906 --> 00:02:45.910
And then you just go 4, 3, 2, 
 1. And so on and so forth.

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.350
♩ ♪ ♫ ♬ ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬

00:02:50.943 --> 00:02:52.940
Okay?

00:02:52.408 --> 00:02:56.410
So that is a very simple and quick warm-up.

00:02:56.694 --> 00:03:00.690
If you're using a plectrum, you should be alternate picking

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:11.800
Which means, with your plectrum, you're going down, up, down, up, down, 
 up, down, up, down. And so on and so forth. 

00:03:11.563 --> 00:03:13.560
I'm exaggerating the movement there.

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:16.040
You should keep your plectrum as close to the strings as possible

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.420
But that's just to demonstrate to you that it's down, up, down, up.

00:03:19.514 --> 00:03:21.510
So that's a quick finger gym exercise.

00:03:21.924 --> 00:03:23.920
Just one other quick thing

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.050
(picks up phone) And you should always be playing to a metronome.

00:03:28.022 --> 00:03:30.020
(I've just got a metronome on my phone here, 
 so I'm just gonna sort that out)

00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:37.970
So I've got a metronome set here. If you're a 
 beginner (metronome set starts), I recommend 60 BPM.

00:03:36.626 --> 00:03:38.630
Hopefully you can hear that.

00:03:37.822 --> 00:03:44.820
And then this way, you're keeping a steady tempo and a 
 steady groove, which is very important as a musician.

00:03:44.748 --> 00:03:57.750
♩ ♪ ♫ ♬ ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬

00:03:57.305 --> 00:04:00.300
And so on and so forth. And the same back down.

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:04.620
So I'm just keeping a very steady tempo to the beat of the metronome.

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:09.260
Once you get a little bit more confident with 
 the warm-up, you can speed up your tempo.

00:04:08.285 --> 00:04:12.280
So at the moment, 60 is a good starting term.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.010
That's 60 BPM, beats per minute. And then 
 you can sort of speed it up.

00:04:15.446 --> 00:04:19.450
So whatever, whatever you're confident with, so...

00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:24.020
♩ ♪ ♫ ♬ ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬

00:04:23.886 --> 00:04:31.890
I was actually doing 2 beats (laughs) per click there, but that just gives you 
 an idea that you can speed it up as you get more confident.

00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:37.590
Great! Hope that's been useful for you. See you again soon.
