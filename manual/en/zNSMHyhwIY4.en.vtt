Hello again, Guys! ! Today we are going to make an apple pie or, as we call it, "Charlotte".

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.400
For the ingredients look below the video and here:
3 eggs, sugar - 1/10 oz., flour - 4/5 oz, cinnamon and apples

00:00:42.400 --> 00:01:00.400
Take the eggs and beat all three of them into the bowl.  Whisk them with the mixer.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:25.400
Now, sugar. If the apples are very sour, put more sugar than I mentioned in the recipe. Add slowly the sugar into the bowl with the eggs.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:45.400
The sugar won't dissolve till the end. The  paste will get several times bigger and brighter.  
Now, add little by littl our flour and stir everything together.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.400
Now we have everything stirred and mixed - eggs, sugar and flour. It's our batter.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:19.400
Now, choose any baking dish that you like and cover the bottom of it with the butter-paper, oil it.
DON'T oil the sides of the form, because the pie won't rise.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:03:03.400
Wash the apples.Their amount depends on your taste. In the classical recipe 3-4 are enough, if you like them a lot  - add more.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:45.400
Slice the apples into 3-4-5mm. You can also cut them into different forms.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:04:29.400
Cover the bottom of the dish with the apples. There can be several layers of them.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:05:05.400
Apples are done. Now, take the batter and spread it onto the apples, but don't mix.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:30.400
Flatten the surface of the pie. Let it be at a standstill about 10 minutes and the paste will fill the entire space.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:06:08.400
To have a tasty crust you need to cover the top of the pie with a small amount of flour.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:36.400
The most important ingredient - a cinnamon. It's just an incredible flavor - apple, pastry and cinnamon.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:57.400
Preheat the oven to 200 Â° C, reduce the temperature to 150-160 and bake until pie is ready.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.000
If you put a lot of apples, do not expect it to be spongy.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:13.400
You can make several experiments with the different amount of apples and choose the best variant for you.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:37.400
That's our cake. Look at this crust. Let it cool and it's ready to be served.It goes perfect  with ice-cream.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:48.400
