00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.800
Egypt played a crucial role

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.720
in popularising coffee in the Arab world.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.920
During the Ottoman domination

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.720
(1660 onward)

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.840
half of Yemen’s coffee yield

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.720
ended up in Turkey or Egypt.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.520
The brew became popular

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.560
regardless of race, religion,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.040
social class and culture.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.760
Cafés sprung up all over the country.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.720
By the end of the 17th century

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.280
there were 643 cafés in Cairo

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.040
as well as 360 caravanserais,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.400
located mostly near the workshops.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.120
The cafés were humble places

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.560
the owners would fit out with mats,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.120
benches and chests;

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.480
the only decorations were large mirrors

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.040
hanging from the walls.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.640
The cafés soon became meeting places

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.120
for all kinds of workers.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.720
Cafés for ragmen and fishermen appeared;

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.040
some cafés in Alexandria are still rife

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.920
with the atmosphere of days gone by.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.120
Egypt’s coffee-making tradition

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.560
ties in with popular culture.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.400
A poorly made pot of coffee

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.480
i.e. lacking foam on top

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.480
is said to have “lost its face.”

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.760
When plotting against someone,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.160
the saying is that “you’ll drink coffee

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.040
on that person’s grave.”

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.120
From simple restoration places,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.440
the cafés became full-blown meeting places.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.840
Board games, dances and hookahs appeared.
