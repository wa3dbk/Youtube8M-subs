00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.880
Most modern touchscreens are made using OGS
technology.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.270
Without going into deep detail, such touchscreens
have one glass layer removed, making them

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.270
much thinner.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.580
The glass is replaced by some insulation substance,
in most cases - air.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.279
And this air between the touch panel glass
and the display matrix itself may cause you

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.109
some trouble, especially if your are lucky
enough to get a huge, 5" or more device while

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.470
being unlucky enough to life in a shitty and
cold climate, like Russia, where we have snow

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.460
or rain like 8 months out of 12.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:39.360
Well, in this case your device is prone to
this kind of trouble - a wet spot inside the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.360
screen.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.370
If you press hard in the middle of such big,
over 5" screen, when carrying it inside your

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.820
tight jeans pocket for example full of warm
moisture generated by your body, and then

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:02.200
pull it out into cooler air to answer a call,
the moisturized air between the glass and

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:10.830
the display will condensate causing this water
spot right in the middle of the screen.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.479
The poodle moves when you touch it with your
finger.

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.369
The picture behind this moisture appears brighter
than in the corners of the screen.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.979
The poodle is formed under the same principle
thermo fabric is made.

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.600
Such fabric often found in sports apparel,
is made of very thin membrane.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.700
The pores of the membrane are big enough for
water steam molecules to come through, but

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.881
too narrow for bigger water molecules to pass
it.

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:30.881
So the sweat steam generated by your body
easily goes away through these pores onto

00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:32.889
the outside of the fabric, where it quickly
condensates to water sweat, and cannot get

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:36.289
back through the membrane, keeping your body
dry.

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.889
The sweat then quickly evaporates from the
surface.

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:39.889
You may be like - well professor what should
we do?

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:40.889
Take a small suction cup.

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:44.520
The one used in bathrooms are normally too
big, but those used in ladies razor holder

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.520
should do.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.249
I'll be using a suction cup phone stand which
I already reviewed.

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:48.249
Go see the review, by the way.

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:50.560
So press the suction cup right above the wet
spot and now start to firmly push it upwards.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.289
Do not be a chicken, but also do not apply
too much force as you may disassemble the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:55.289
screen.

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:56.289
You'll hear a small pop.

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:57.289
How use a toothpick to decompress the suction
cup.

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:04.159
As you may see, the display is as good as
new.
