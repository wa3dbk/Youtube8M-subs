How to Boost Charge a Dead Car Battery

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:06.540
Here we have a relatively brand new car battery,
less than 1 year old.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.910
It should still be capable of starting a car
but it was unfortunately left in a discharged

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.430
state for too long.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.880
When we test the dead car battery with a multimeter,
we get a reading of 6.8 Volts.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.289
Since this is a car battery it should have
a reading within the 12 volt range.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.589
Because the voltage has dropped so low, a
normal car battery charger will not recognize

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.329
it as a 12 volt battery.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.770
In some cases you may be able to slow charge
it over a period of a few days with a 12v

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.430
charger if the charger allows you to force
the charge mode to 12v.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.970
Typically when a 12v battery drops below 9v
the normal method of using a car charger doesn't

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:46.970
work.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.860
The method we use in this video is what we
call parallel charging.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.260
We use a fully charged 12v SLA (sealed lead
acid) battery that has at least double the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.470
capacity of the car battery.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.370
Note it is important the batteries have the
same voltage.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.750
In our case they are both 12v batteries.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.150
We then cable them together in parallel, connecting
one end of the red cable to the positive (+)

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.530
terminal of our fully charged SLA (sealed
lead acid) battery and the other end to the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.689
positive (+) terminal of our bad battery.

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.469
Then we connect one end of the black cable
to the negative (-) terminal of our fully

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:23.150
charged SLA battery and the other end to the
negative (-) terminal of the bad battery.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.369
You will need to let the batteries sit for
2-3 days to bring the dead battery back to

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.450
or closer to 12 volts.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.240
Be sure to do this in a covered and cool well
ventilated area.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.459
In our case we left the batteries cabled together
for 3 full days to insure the dead battery

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.070
becomes equalized.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.969
We then test the original dead car battery
with a multimeter and we get a reading of

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:49.209
12.23v.

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:54.299
We now use the Genius 26000 Wicked Smart car
battery charger and it is able to recognize

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.679
the battery which was once nothing more than
a dead car battery that needed to be replaced.

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.119
The charger immediately begins pulse charging
to desulfate the car battery.

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.750
Since the Noco Genius 26000 is a sophisticated
car battery charger, it has a built in microprocessor,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.930
enabling it to detect signals that indicate
the battery has become sulfated.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.790
It then automatically begins pulse charging
our car battery.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.780
In pulse charging mode, the charger is sending
out high currents of electricity for a short

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.670
duration in a pulsing fashion which helps
blast off any sulfur buildup on the lead plates

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.450
which make up the 6 battery cells in this
battery.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.680
After the charger is done with pulse mode
charging it will default back to a regular

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.000
charge mode.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.970
The great thing about this car battery charger
is it won't overcharge your battery.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.640
Once the battery is fully charged, the Noco
Genius 26000 will go into a storage mode where

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.930
it will float charge the car battery to maintain
optimimum charge without overcharging and

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.430
damaging the car battery.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.620
We leave the charger overnight to complete
the process of fully pulse charging and recharging

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.410
the car battery.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.731
Once the charger indicates the battery is
charged to 100%, we are ready to install the

00:03:05.731 --> 00:03:08.170
battery in our car for reuse.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.070
This process has given a dead car battery
a second life.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.310
We hope you have learned something from this
