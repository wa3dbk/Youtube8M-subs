Hey Binghamton. My name is Esther and
this  is the Binghamton Buzz.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.300
On this episode of the Binghamton Buzz,
we are going to be exploring a popular Binghamton tradition.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You all know it as co-rec football.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.380
This game creates friendly competition within the communities, yet still unites Binghamton as a whole.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.500
Let's go find out where your favorite
part of the game is.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's 6 people on the field and you have to have a female quarterback.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And, it's basically regular football; you play two hand touch.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Every game you get one ??? per half.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And, the biggest rule is to have fun.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Do you know which community founded co-rec football?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Either CIW or Dickinson? I think Hinman. Newing.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
CIW. Dickinson. I'd say Hinman! CIW. I knew that one. Right?

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.290
No. Actually that's a popular answer. It's
not CIW. It's actually Hinman.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.000
Why its co-rec football so popular at 
Binghamton? Why do people come back every year since the 70's to play this game?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.300
It's really about the bragging rights between the building. It really sets the buildings apart.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.740
It makes it a nice community on your floors and the building . . .

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.700
between the RA's and residents.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In fact, that girl has had equal opportunity   to come out and play and like have fun . . .

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.500
is like a big appeal.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Everyone is so involved with their studies and stuff, in academics.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So, I guess everyone has come together of course outside, to have some fun.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It actually brings together a lot of communities, because it's the one time where you get everyone in the building to kind of come together for one cause.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
If you show up, you are guaranteed to play.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This is actually more important than Division I football.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.700
Which building is going to win this
year?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.300
Obviously, Bingham.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.500
Cleveland!

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.000
Is that a question?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Johnson.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We're going Oneida.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Oh, absolutely O'Connor.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It's going to be Endicott.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Oh, Delaware.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Do you think I can bet all my tuition on O'Connor?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.700
You can bet your tuition, your room and board, all of your student loans, your grad school applications . . .

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
all the children you might have.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Okay. Now that you say it like that . . . No.  I'd go with Broome.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.800
I'll have to come back at the end of the year and make sure that I can still attend this school.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.800
[Laughing]

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Whether you are playing on the field or cheering on your building . . .

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
co-rec football is a great way to destress from your studies, by spending time outside, on a weekend afternoon.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
To find out the co-rec schedules, contact your community's resident director or area commissioner.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.670
My name is Esther and I'll catch you on the field, Binghamton.
