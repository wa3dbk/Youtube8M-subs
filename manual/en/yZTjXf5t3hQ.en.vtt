00:00:04.416 --> 00:00:06.676
&gt;&gt; Are you sure you feel good
enough to go into work today?

00:00:06.676 --> 00:00:07.176
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:07.176 --> 00:00:09.156
&gt;&gt; I thought I heard you
throwing up last night.

00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:09.656
&gt;&gt; I'm fine.

00:00:09.656 --> 00:00:11.406
It's just a little bug.

00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:14.816
&gt;&gt; I'll get us a video
on my way home today.

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:16.046
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:28.146
&gt;&gt; Man, you don't look so good.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:29.566
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:31.496
&gt;&gt; No seriously.

00:00:31.496 --> 00:00:32.986
Maybe you should
take a sick day.

00:00:34.446 --> 00:00:35.006
&gt;&gt; I'm fine.

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.706
I'm fine.

00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:49.526
&gt;&gt; How's it going?

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:50.516
&gt;&gt; Fine.

00:00:51.286 --> 00:00:52.576
&gt;&gt; What happened?

00:00:52.676 --> 00:00:54.316
&gt;&gt; John threw up and
Sammy's just cleaning it up.

00:00:54.796 --> 00:00:55.896
&gt;&gt; Are you using the vomit kit?

00:00:56.126 --> 00:00:58.296
&gt;&gt; No, but I used
plenty of disinfectant.

00:00:58.296 --> 00:00:59.556
&gt;&gt; Okay. Three things.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.026
One, we need to make
sure that John goes home.

00:01:02.026 --> 00:01:03.356
&gt;&gt; Oh, we sent him
home right away.

00:01:03.476 --> 00:01:05.936
&gt;&gt; Good. Second, you need
to get the vomit kit.

00:01:06.286 --> 00:01:08.216
We could be dealing with
a norovirus infection

00:01:08.216 --> 00:01:09.516
which is highly contagious.

00:01:09.896 --> 00:01:11.316
And third, you need to rinse

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:12.666
that disinfectant
off the counter.

00:01:12.926 --> 00:01:15.116
It's not safe for
food contact surfaces.

00:01:15.836 --> 00:01:18.586
Also, make sure that all
the food that John handled

00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:20.546
or was exposed to his
vomit is thrown out.

00:01:21.016 --> 00:01:22.976
We don't want this virus
spreading through the facility.

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:24.086
&gt;&gt; Okay. I can help with that.

00:01:24.506 --> 00:01:25.076
&gt;&gt; No, Sue.

00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:27.216
Food workers should never
help with the cleanup.

00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:28.326
It's just too risky.

00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:29.196
Thanks though.

00:01:29.196 --> 00:01:30.016
&gt;&gt; I understand.

00:01:30.106 --> 00:01:30.916
&gt;&gt; I'll get the vomit kit.

00:01:30.916 --> 00:01:31.816
&gt;&gt; Do you know where it's at?

00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:32.446
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:32.776 --> 00:01:33.846
&gt;&gt; Good. Then when you get back,

00:01:33.846 --> 00:01:35.036
I'll go over all
the steps with you.

00:01:35.036 --> 00:01:35.536
Okay?

00:01:35.586 --> 00:01:36.086
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:36.866
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:01:38.716 --> 00:01:41.096
&gt;&gt; Norovirus causes
vomiting and diarrhea

00:01:41.096 --> 00:01:42.756
and is the most common cause

00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:44.716
of food poisoning in
the United States.

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:48.916
A single episode of vomit
can contain millions

00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:50.486
of norovirus particles.

00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:52.296
And it only takes between ten

00:01:52.556 --> 00:01:55.606
and 100 virus particles
to infect a person.

00:01:56.176 --> 00:02:00.236
During vomiting, particles can
become aerosolized meaning they

00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:01.206
spread through the air.

00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:04.766
Any exposed food can
become contaminated

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:05.686
and should be thrown out.

00:02:05.686 --> 00:02:08.436
It is also important
to throw away the food

00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:10.676
that has been handled by
the person who vomited.

00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:13.896
It is important to
properly clean up vomit

00:02:14.256 --> 00:02:16.576
because vomit is a
concentrated source

00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:21.266
of harmful microorganisms
including bacteria and viruses.

00:02:22.076 --> 00:02:24.886
&gt;&gt; Okay. First step is
making sure that everybody is

00:02:24.886 --> 00:02:27.036
out of the kitchen and
only allow people back

00:02:27.036 --> 00:02:30.466
in after everything has been
properly cleaned, disinfected,

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:32.456
and all of the waste
has been removed.

00:02:33.396 --> 00:02:36.506
&gt;&gt; It is important to wear
protective gear to keep yourself

00:02:36.696 --> 00:02:38.676
and others from getting sick.

00:02:39.146 --> 00:02:44.906
Protective gear includes a
gown, shoe covers, gloves,

00:02:45.896 --> 00:02:47.276
hairnet, and facemask.

00:02:48.476 --> 00:02:51.036
Sometimes it's not
practical to wear all of these

00:02:51.526 --> 00:02:55.656
so at a minimum you should wear
a gown, gloves, and shoe covers.

00:02:56.236 --> 00:02:59.026
Once your protective gear
is on, there are four steps

00:02:59.026 --> 00:03:00.096
to cleaning up the vomit.

00:03:00.776 --> 00:03:03.306
First step is to
cover the vomit.

00:03:03.686 --> 00:03:07.626
You want to do this so you
can contain the vomit as well

00:03:07.626 --> 00:03:09.126
as let people know where it is

00:03:09.276 --> 00:03:11.526
so they don't accidentally
step in it.

00:03:11.526 --> 00:03:13.926
To cover up the vomit,
you can use paper towels

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:16.906
or an absorbent powder
that you can get

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:18.926
from a local chemical
supply company.

00:03:19.746 --> 00:03:22.116
To remove the covered
vomit, simply scoop them

00:03:22.116 --> 00:03:24.536
up with your gloved
hands and placed them

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:26.256
in the sealable plastic bag.

00:03:27.536 --> 00:03:30.196
The second step in vomit
cleanup is disinfection.

00:03:30.516 --> 00:03:32.296
To properly disinfect the area,

00:03:32.586 --> 00:03:35.716
you want to use an EPA
registered disinfectant

00:03:36.286 --> 00:03:37.796
effective against norovirus.

00:03:38.116 --> 00:03:39.706
And you can find
this on the label.

00:03:40.256 --> 00:03:42.576
You also want to use
proper contact time

00:03:42.846 --> 00:03:44.466
which is also located
on the label.

00:03:44.996 --> 00:03:47.466
Remember, stronger
doesn't always mean better.

00:03:48.126 --> 00:03:51.646
You can use bleach in
a one to ten dilution.

00:03:53.076 --> 00:03:55.566
Then you want to leave
the bleach on the surface

00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:58.006
for ten to 20 minutes.

00:03:59.556 --> 00:04:03.236
At present, research has not
established how wide of an area

00:04:03.236 --> 00:04:07.886
to clean around vomit so clean
as wide of an area as possible.

00:04:08.236 --> 00:04:09.856
This is called the
cleaning zone.

00:04:10.226 --> 00:04:13.706
It includes floors,
tables, chair legs,

00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:16.856
as well as food contact
surfaces such as counters.

00:04:17.826 --> 00:04:19.886
Do what is practical
for your facility.

00:04:20.496 --> 00:04:23.356
If there is any residual
disinfectant left

00:04:23.436 --> 00:04:26.086
after proper contact
time, you can wipe it

00:04:26.086 --> 00:04:27.376
up using paper towels.

00:04:27.906 --> 00:04:31.386
If you choose to use a mop,
make sure you use a pad mop

00:04:31.616 --> 00:04:32.606
that has a removable pad.

00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:36.526
You don't want to use a
string mop or a sponge mop

00:04:36.556 --> 00:04:40.736
as these cannot be
disinfected after the fact.

00:04:40.736 --> 00:04:43.166
Step three in vomit
cleanup is removal.

00:04:44.316 --> 00:04:46.566
When removing your protective
gear, you want to start

00:04:46.726 --> 00:04:47.926
by removing your shoe covers.

00:04:48.416 --> 00:04:50.806
Make sure not to touch
any of the surfaces

00:04:50.806 --> 00:04:53.836
that you have just cleaned as
you can re-contaminate these.

00:04:54.666 --> 00:04:57.236
Then you're going to
remove your gown starting

00:04:57.236 --> 00:04:59.276
at the shoulders
and rolling inwards.

00:04:59.986 --> 00:05:00.966
When you get to your cuffs,

00:05:01.226 --> 00:05:03.696
you can remove your gloves
turning them inside out.

00:05:04.516 --> 00:05:07.766
Place these materials into the
waste bag containing all your

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:09.346
other vomit cleanup materials.

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:10.496
Wash your hands.

00:05:11.036 --> 00:05:13.416
Then you can remove your
hairnet and facemask

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:15.196
and place these into
the bag as well.

00:05:16.346 --> 00:05:19.326
To remove waste, you want to
make sure that you have all

00:05:19.326 --> 00:05:21.056
of the cleaning materials
as well

00:05:21.056 --> 00:05:22.856
as your protective
gear in the bag.

00:05:23.436 --> 00:05:25.546
Then seal the bag
or use a twist tie.

00:05:26.286 --> 00:05:29.846
Remove the waste from the
facility immediately according

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:32.046
to local, state, or
federal regulations.

00:05:33.336 --> 00:05:35.876
Step four in vomit cleanup
is washing your hands.

00:05:36.406 --> 00:05:39.596
To properly wash your hands,
first turn on the water

00:05:39.746 --> 00:05:40.996
to a comfortable temperature.

00:05:41.916 --> 00:05:44.296
Then wet your hands
under the running water.

00:05:45.006 --> 00:05:49.716
Apply soap and rub together
vigorously to create a lather.

00:05:50.096 --> 00:05:52.476
Continue rubbing your
hands together for ten

00:05:52.476 --> 00:05:55.636
to 15 seconds paying close
attention to your nail beds,

00:05:55.906 --> 00:05:57.856
in-between your fingers,
and your wrist.

00:06:02.006 --> 00:06:05.176
Rinse your hands under the
running water making sure all

00:06:05.176 --> 00:06:06.376
the soap is gone.

00:06:09.666 --> 00:06:11.846
Immediately dry your
hands with paper towels.

00:06:12.386 --> 00:06:14.816
Then use the paper towel
to turn off the faucet

00:06:15.186 --> 00:06:17.336
and throw the paper towel away.

00:06:17.656 --> 00:06:18.786
Controlling norovirus

00:06:18.786 --> 00:06:21.166
in long-term care
facilities is important

00:06:21.366 --> 00:06:24.936
because older adults are a
highly susceptible population

00:06:25.156 --> 00:06:28.296
and can develop severe
complication resulting

00:06:28.296 --> 00:06:30.276
in hospitalization
and even death.

00:06:31.236 --> 00:06:34.406
According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention,

00:06:34.726 --> 00:06:39.396
59% of norovirus outbreaks occur
in long-term care facilities.

00:06:42.006 --> 00:06:45.086
&gt;&gt; So what did they
tell you at work today?

00:06:45.086 --> 00:06:47.046
When can you go back?

00:06:47.046 --> 00:06:51.316
&gt;&gt; Forty-eight hours without any
symptoms or a note from the doc

00:06:51.316 --> 00:06:54.896
that I'm free of a
norovirus infection.

00:06:55.186 --> 00:06:58.546
&gt;&gt; I'll get you some more
videos, "War and Peace" maybe?
