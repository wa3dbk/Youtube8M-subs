Rokosz your digital lifestyle expert here
with some information on how to choose a TV.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.249
Now a couple of things that you have to ask
yourself first is price, how much are you

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.730
going to spend. Second is where is it going.
Is it going in a giant rumpus room down in

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.030
the basement or is it going to the wall of
my one bedroom apartment. Or into a big media

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.610
room. Space is going to make a huge determination
on that and then we get down to the fun stuff.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.420
We know that we want it to be forty inches,
we know we want, yeah we want it to be in

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.680
our hanging on the wall, we want it to be
a flat screen. That's an important choice

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.409
too. Now you are into what are these flat
screen HDTVs. Alright here is some advice,

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:43.100
when you are looking at HDTVs you are going
to be looking at things, or numbers like ten

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.170
eighty I, ten eighty P, seven twenty P ok.
The easy thing to break down the P and the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.359
I is this, P is for progressive, I is for
interlaced. Great, Rokosz but what does that

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:02.609
mean. Well that means with interlaced that
each one of these scans if you look closely

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.630
on all monitors you can see these little lines
of resolution, well in a micro second a ten

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.119
eighty I or interlaced will do every other
line, every time it scans through it. So it's

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.990
two scannings. Sometimes it will scan the
top line then the bottom line. Progressive

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.170
it scans both lines or both odds and evens
at the same time. So your ten eight P will

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.359
give you your sharpest picture. And then we
decide what kind of monitor do we want to

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:39.920
see it on. Do we want to see it on a plasma
TV monitor, on a DLP or digital light projection

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.520
monitor, do we want to see it on a LCD monitor
or liquid crystal display. Or do we want to

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.829
see it on a rear projection. Ok each one of
those have their own distinct advantages and

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.390
disadvantages and a lot of them is price and
some of them have you know some advantages

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.340
that they are better for certain applications.
If you got a lot of direct sun light on your

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.219
TV. An LCD is a better way to go. If you are
a gamer and you play a lot of high definition

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.900
video games then you are going to want to
lean towards something like the DLP or the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.931
digital light projection screen. This is an
important decision you are going to get so

00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:20.459
much use out of it, you are going to have
so much fun doing it, but again where is it

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.849
going, how much do I have to spend on it,
how am I going to use it and then stick with

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.790
your major brands. Do a little research, look
at some of reviews and you are going to find

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.480
the best TV monitor, that's going to be your
best friend for a long time. Like me. Rokosz
