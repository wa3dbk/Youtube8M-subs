00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.560
The RF-TVMP40 from Rocketfish

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.160
combines full-motion functionality with a new dimension:

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.560
height-adjustment. Now, everyone in the family can adjust the TV

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.780
to fit what they're doing:

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:29.360
yoga, gaming, or movies, all with just a light touch

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.660
The RF-TVMP40 is built with constant-force technology

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.420
offering 20 inches of light-touch, continuous movement

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.080
of your TV in all directions with no knobs or levers required.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:01:00.320
It also offers tilt, pan, swivel, and leveling

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.220
for perfect TV placement.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.340
It also comes with gravity-tilt, allowing for 10 degrees of effortless tilt

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.400
and easy tension adjustment.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.280
And, the TV-safety latch secures the TV to the mount

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.200
protecting against accidental bumps.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.700
It fits most 30 to 55-inch TVs up to 40 pounds,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.660
extends up to 24 inches from the wall,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.400
and is VESA compliant up to 600 by 400.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.180
Plus, it includes a template, a complete labeled hardware kit,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.213
adapters and a manual to make installation easy.

00:01:45.213 --> 00:01:46.213
Here's how:

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.500
To start, choose the appropriate VESA configuration for your TV.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.400
Attach the VESA plate to the back of your TV, using the adapters if needed

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.000
and set the TV aside.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.800
Then, choose the location where you want to mount your TV 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.060
and use a stud finder to find the stud.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.720
Draw a T on a piece of masking tape

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.920
and place it on the wall to mark the stud's center.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.140
Cut out the top wall-plate hole on the template

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.580
and place the template on the wall with the center of the T visible through the hole.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.160
Based on the range of motion indicated on the template, 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.400
decide if the template needs to be moved up or down.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.960
Adjust the tape vertically to the desired height 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.920
and move the template so the T is visible again to verify mount range of motion.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.460
Remove the template and re-check for stud location.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.740
Now, center the wall-plate over the stud

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.320
with the top mounting-hole aligning with the top of the T.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.400
Make sure it's level and mark your pilot-holes

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.500
Remove the wall-plate,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.540
drill holes,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.220
and remove the tape.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.140
Place the wall-plate on the wall.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.620
Check to make sure it's level and tighten the lag-bolts.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.800
Then, attach the covers.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.920
To attach the arm to the wall-plate, insert the steel tube

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.680
and correct washers onto the wall-plate.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.560
Place the arm onto the steel tube, 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.300
insert the hardware and appropriate washers

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.320
and tighten.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.200
Then, attach the cover.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.720
With help, hang the TV on the mount arm

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.360
and secure it with the provided safety screw.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.320
Raise the TV to its highest point and adjust the tension

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.640
on the mount until your TV moves up and down easily.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.800
Note: this may take many turns to get the right amount of tension.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.260
Lift is properly adjusted when your TV stays in place throughout its range of motion.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.680
Build a world of enhanced connections,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.660
with forward-thinking products

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.220
