00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Hand made watch using PIC and 7seg LED

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.500
7 seg LEDs don't flicker, when I look it actually.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.000
PIC 16F84A is used.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.800
It is double-sided board that is made by etching .

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.200
Accuracy is within 10 seconds per month. (observed value)

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.500
It works for 6 month by a battery. (observed value)

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.200
The case is made from acrylic using a hand made CNC.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.500
The parts is almost chip parts. 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.000
Moreover, I solder them by hand soldering.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The display is turned off, if I push left button.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
"Time" is shown, if I push right button.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.800
"Time" keep on lighting, if I push right button more than 3 seconds.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.000
The display is turned off, pushing left button.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
"Date" is shown, if I push left button.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
"Date" is turned off, if I release left button.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
"Seconds" is shown, if I push right + left button.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I like retro-flavored watch very much! 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's look back face. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
First, it's lateral face.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.500
It's back face.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.000
The battery is "CR2032", (coin battery)

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.500
Back face is almost battery. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.000
It's opposite lateral face.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.500
Front face is shown again.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.000
I can adjust the time and date.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I change the date to March 4.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
First, Left + right buttons are pushed to adjust the "Month".

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The month becomes March.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.500
Next, Left + right buttons are pushed to adjust the "Day".

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.500
The day becomes 4.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.000
Next, Left + right buttons are pushed to adjust the "Hour".

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The hour becomes 3.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Next, Left + right buttons are pushed to adjust the "Minute".

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The minute becomes 10.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Time is adjusted to "3:10".

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I equip the watch.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I am greatly pleased with the watch! 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I am self-satisfied! 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I appreciate that you watch my video until last time.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Thank you very much!
