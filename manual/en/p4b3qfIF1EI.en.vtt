Hey guys, Jon Matix here for Dagame.com. Now
daygame is the art of meeting and attracting

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.490
women during the daytime. This is a little
series we're doing called Daygame Anywhere

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.299
where we show you daygame in lots of different
places. Anywhere basically. This week it's

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.269
my turn to do a supermarket. Now, what can
I expect from talking to a woman in a supermarket?

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:28.630
I can expect a slightly high pressure social
situation, and I can expect a girl to be kind

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.030
of busy with what she's doing and preoccupied
with doing her shopping, wherever it is, whatever

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.120
whatever shop you're going into. So supermarkets
can

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.120
be a tough one but we'll give it a go and
see what happens.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.670
Excuse me. Sorry. Can I just tell you something real quick? Ok, I
know this is a bit weird and you're doing

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.810
your shopping but I saw you and I thought
you looked very nice. Well, thank you. So

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.080
I wanted to come and say hello. But I'll tell
you what

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.580
I noticed about you, is you've got a very
like non-English look. You look kind of maybe

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.750
Scandinavian, like your face, but the way
you're dressed is actually quite English.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.729
You look like you're about to go horse riding.
Something like that, you know.

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.342
Thank you. I'm from Estonia. Huh? I'm from
Estonia so it's near by Finland. Right, okay. South of Finland.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.880
So hence the blonde hair. Yeah, yeah. Well
I've never been to Estonia but when I think

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.070
about it I imagine it's a bit like Russia.
Not at all. So it snows

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.229
a lot. It snows a lot. Everybody wears like
fur. Everybody's really tall and you all drink

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:47.299
a bit too much vodka. Yeah, maybe. So you
like war? Well... I don't understand want

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.520
would make somebody want to go and study war.
Yeah, I do. I like country studies. Yeah.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.340
International security is my thing. So you're
going to end up with a degree in war? In international

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:05.780
security. Okay. That sounds kind of ominous.
So you could end up working for like MI6 or one

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.010
of those big spy companies. Unfortunately
I can't. I don't have a British nationality.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:16.610
Or the Estonian KGB or something. I can't
tell you now can I? No, even if you were you

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.680
wouldn't be able to tell me, you know. So
how long have you been her for? I did my undergrad

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.830
here as well, so... For quite awhile. Almost
4 years. 4 years? Almost. So you're like a

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.390
proper Londoner now, you know. No, I just
moved to London. Where did you live before?

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.350
Between Manchester and Birmingham. I was going
to guess somewhere like in the country where

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.640
you ride horses or something. I don't ride
horses. No? No. It's just the look. I just

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.520
like the look. It went nuts. I started riding
and I was like 'Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.020
god. How can I get off?' The thing is, right,
if you fall off and it kicks you in the head

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.730
you're going to die. Big time. And they shit
everywhere. You know when you see it in the

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.820
street and the police walk with the horses
and they just have to shit in the middle of

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.850
the street and the just leave it, you know.
What to do? Dogs do it, cats do it. But they

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.010
are very beautiful animals, horses. Very like
majestic. You know? Maybe, I don't know. I'm

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.530
not the kind of a girl who goes crazy about
horses and dolphins so. And dolphins? That's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.300
usually a girl thing right? You know, girls
like horses and dolphins. I don't know. Dolphins

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.290
are pretty interesting though. Really? Yeah.
Do you know something? Like, dolphins are

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.710
the only other animals apart from humans that
have sex for pleasure. You know that? Really.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.700
Yeah, yeah. I didn't know that. That's a first.
Yeah, yeah. They're supposed to be really

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.400
intelligent. Every day is a school day. So, I mean,
have you ever swam with dolphins. No I haven't.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:47.820
Okay. No, no. Neither have I. You ask really strange questions. I don't know, you know. Fair enough, yeah.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.760
Well here's a not so strange question... What's your
name? Monica. Monica? Jon. Nice to meet you.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.520
Nice to meet you. Anyway, well listen Monique,
I'll let you get back to buying your stuff

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.520
but I would love to invite you out sometime.
Yeah, why not. Yeah? Okay. Can I put those

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:17.840
in your basket for one second? Is it spelled
Monica, how I think it's spelled? With a k. Oh, with a k? Okay. 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:35.830
Yeah, go on... Uh, zero
seven... Yeah. Yeah. Cool.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:42.830
Alright Monica, I'll take my coffee back. Take your coffee back, yeah. And it was lovely to meet you.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:51.600
And I'll talk to you soon, yeah? Alright,
bye. Okay guys, I think that went quite well.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.600
She was pretty fun to talk to. We had a bit
of banter, she was quite chatty, quite flirty.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.960
One thing I would mention is when you're in
a supermarket it's a very good opportunity

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:12.000
to use a situational opener and to use like
the environment you're in as things to talk

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.140
about. As it happens in there, her basket
was empty so I couldn't comment on stuff that

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.440
she'd bought. You know? But yeah, it went
well. I got the number and while I was in

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.360
there I also got some coffee too. So I'm going
to go home right now and drink it.
