00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.400
A nod to the classic, and WOOHOO to the new stuff in this Showcase!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.500
Summoners, I'm Nika, and it's no surprise that fans have been creating ridiculously rad content at breakneck pace, 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.900
so much that we can't keep it all in this same show, but we try to! 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.600
The glory is in the attempt, but success is the icing on the cake.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.200
Catalyyn has attempted to make a cake so artistic that people won't want to eat it. 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.700
Well, she probably didn't, but she succeeded in making a sugary diorama so precise that we wonder whether it's actually covering a cake at all. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.700
Not that it would stop me from asking for the piece with Fiddlesticks on it.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.200
In this new song by The Yordles, we learn a little bit about Fiddle's hidden sorrow. Or... is it hidden?

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:10.100
Everyone wants to know, how do the Yordles do it? Lucky for us they're going to be live on the show later answering your questions, so stay tuned! 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.800
Next, when it comes to cosplay, Kamikaze Miko likes to keep it classic. 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.700
She recreated Karma's original style into a real eye catcher with fierce bladed fans and a mona lisa smile. 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.100
Considering Karma has changed her look quite a bit, I wonder if we're lucky enough to have Miko embody her new and updated style.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.800
Style is hard to define, and harder to express, but if anyone needs a tutorial, Elmagonia has extra to share. 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.600
Zyra's deep defining lines and cat-like pose contribute to a strong, comic-style illustration that begs to be animated. 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.000
I know it's a big undertaking, but watching this picture walk around Summoner's Rift would be divine.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.400
The League has champions both divine and dark. DreamTech appreciates the latter category, it would seem.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.000
This Noxian general spreads the blight of war across the ground he touches, and that takes its toll on any soul. 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.000
There's only one thing to do when possessed by the darkness of human ruthlessness. 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.800
Well... maybe there are a few more options...

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:17.500
WELCOME TO THE SHOWCASE, THIS IS NIKASAUR. TODAY WE DEVOUR FAN ARTISTS SO WE CAN ABSORB THEIR POWER. WHO'S NEXT?

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.600
Sorry, I just... I don't know what came over me. What were we talking about. OH. Papercraft!

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.200
In a segue so fierce it gives you whiplash, RedHands performed an alchemical switcharoo to make this metallic steam golem into paper. 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.300
This Blitzcrank figure is just as cute as can be, with little spirals of tubing and steam.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.800
Why should Blitzcrank have all the fun? 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.400
We have a couple of other robot champions.... like Nunu, Rammus, and Orianna... but who else would make a great robot? 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.500
If you answer that on Facebook, you can debate hextech procedures with our featured fan, Sahmus!

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.100
Now we are here live with Miles and Sonny from The Yordles band. 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.000
They’re going to answer your questions here on the Showcase. 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.700
How’s it going? How are you guys doing?

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.100
Miles and Sonny: Fantastic/Splendid. What's up!

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.100
Nika: And you look super dapper today as well, so that even helps. 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.900
So we've actually brought in a whole bunch of questions from the community. 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.700
I'm hoping you guys haven't seen them, because its going to be a surprise. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.700
So, first off, Superfwizz asked how did you guys meet and how did you guys start making these awesome songs?

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.400
Miles: Well, Sonny and I met in middle school, actually, when we were just we little babies. 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.200
And we kind of just hung out and played video games together. 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.700
Then we went to high school together and that's when I started playing guitar, and Sonny's always been dabbling in music, and vocal, and stuff.  

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:46.200
And ya, I mean, we actually didn't start doing any of the Yordles stuff until this past summer, and that was for the Songs of the Summoned 3 Showcase. 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.700
And I approached Sonny and I was like, “Hey dude, do you want to just maybe write some songs and see what happens?!" 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.200
He was like, "Sure." And we got a ton of positive feedback.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.200
Even some of the Rioters even approached us and were like, "Hey these are pretty good. You guys should keep going.” 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:08.100
And we were like, "Ok, well, I guess we are doing something right. Lets do it man, lets do it!" and haven't looked back since.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.000
Nika: They definitely went around the office like crazy. Everyone loves the "Mundo Loves Who He Pleases" kind of thing. 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.000
So, Dragons Breath also has a question. What is the process of making these songs? 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.900
Do you start with a little bit of the lyrics and then the melody or what?

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.100
Sonny: Well, usually what happens is Miles will be playing some sort of chord progression 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.100
while we are sitting around the table sipping on some tea or something of the sort. 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.900
And then I'll start singing jibberish over them. It's a very sophisticated jibberish. 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.600
Sometimes it doesn't make it out of the jibberish stage, see "Ballet of the Yordles". We'll fit in lyrics afterwards. 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.900
We'll figure out what champion it sounds like, or we'll start out with a champion idea, 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.300
and then kind of fit chords and jibberish that fit with that. Then we'll iron out the lyrics afterwards.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:01.700
Nika: So, Seablade214 asks, "What is your guys' favorite song that you have and which one was the most fun to make?"

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.100
Miles: The most fun song to record was definitely "He's a Ninja". 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.700
We were just so happy and excited to be doing it, we were just so pumped about it.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.100
When we were singing parts, we would actually be dancing while we were singing 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.800
to the point we would have to re-record the vocals because you could hear us jumping and breathing heavily - from dancing! 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.600
So we would have to re-record the vocals multiple times. 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.000
Sonny: I don't know how many times Miles was like, "Sonny, stop moving, we need to get this clean." 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.000
Miles: Like, if the mic was here, he'd would be all over the place!

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.100
Sonny: I was crashing all over the place. I wasn't singing into the mic, and then I was like, "I'm sorry."

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:49.600
Nika: So as our last question. Plastic Buddha really wants to know, "I ate some oranges, but I'm not "K". What now?"

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.500
Miles: Are you sure they weren't tangerines?

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.400
Sonny: It's a common... people get those confused. But if it was a tangerine, its not going to do squat for you, so...

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.400
Nika: Or a tangelo.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.200
Miles: Ya know... just go listen to our song and make sure you're eating an orange. 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.600
Go play Gangplank. I promise it will be "K". I promise.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.500
Sonny: Promise. Scout's honor.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.600
Nika: Thank you guys so much for showing up on the Showcase, this has been an amazing interview, 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.700
and keep doing exactly what you're doing. 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.800
And for everyone else watching, thank you for sending in your questions, and support your local artist, 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.700
and we will see you next episode.
