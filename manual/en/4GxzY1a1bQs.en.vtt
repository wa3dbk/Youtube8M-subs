hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.679
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.059
I'm going to make mince meat preparation which is very popular in Kerala.

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.740
Kerala has got a great combination of
Muslims, Hindus and Christians and

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.480
probably that is the reason why their
cuisine is got so many of dishes and

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.670
varieties and each one of them tastes different and in each area you go you'll

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.719
get a different kind of awesome food and
that is what my experience in Kerala

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.010
Dear friends

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.450
let's go ahead and make this Kheema first
we're going to make a paste of

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.660
coconut, green chillies, cumin seeds that
is jeera and little bit of mint, for

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.550
this preparation add some oil into a pan
add mustard seeds, pieces of red chilli

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.670
and the slices of onion you know one of
the guy said you can never get the real

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.489
taste of this kheema if you use regular onions so I've cut shallots

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:15.180
that is a small onions you know when you
fry the shallots they smell little

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.320
different they're little bit hotter than onions, add turmeric, ginger garlic paste

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.220
add the minced meat

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:40.890
add salt, curry leaves I forgot to add them
before so add some curry leaves and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.009
we're going to cook this for few minutes now after around five minutes of

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.549
cooking with the lid on you know the
kheema will be more or else half cooked that's

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.070
when we're going to add this paste of
coconut green chillies cumin seeds

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.069
and mint in this, this is made into a
little bit of fine paste you can make it

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:13.650
little coarse also now add garam masala powder and mix this you know

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.450
we may have to add little water so that all these will get cooked for

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.920
some more time and then you can choose
whether you want to make it really dry

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.840
or little bit with sauce i'm going to add some water now after around 15 minutes

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.450
you know I don't like to overcook but this
meat you get in India I don't know you

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.120
know I just want to make sure it's
cooked thoroughly wow now look at this

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.120
this is perfect

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.970
haha you know actually what is the best
you cook

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.019
the mincemeat in a pressure cooker
separately and add it after you cook the

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.600
shallots and the masala that's when you get a really nice even better flavor than

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:10.230
what i did so right from the hot pan whoooo i'm going to burn myself haha

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.420
