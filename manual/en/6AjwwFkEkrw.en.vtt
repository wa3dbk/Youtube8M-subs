00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.959
word 4 times and the word is?

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:14.959
Always.

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.910
And when we use the word always we are most
always wrong.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.189
But God is saying, it always protects, always
trust, always hopes, it always perseveres.

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.160
And so if you believe that, wouldn't you say
it sounds like love is a little bind.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.160
Really.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.190
Mean what if there is evidence to the contrary.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.860
Doesn't it sound a little co-dependent to
you?

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.860
Little enabling?

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.100
That it's always gonna protect, always gonna
trust, always gonna believe.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.809
I mean really?

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.371
It couldn't possibly mean that.

00:00:43.371 --> 00:00:45.710
It couldn't always right?

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.220
Well God uses it 4 times and he uses it for
these things and I want you to think about

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.140
it because it's a big issue that you're gonna
struggle with.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.250
That it always protects, always trusts, always
hopes, and always perseveres.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.559
God says that.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.060
Protects, it means that you cover over.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.060
That's what protection is.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.380
You cover over a weakness or a failure.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.600
Now that does not mean that you endure abuse
or that you endure somebody that's addicted.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.469
You know these extreme areas.

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:21.960
But it says that in life generally with a
person what you're doing is your covering,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.499
you're covering their weaknesses.

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:25.649
That you always trust.

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.299
Doesn't mean that you're naives but it means
that you always believe the best.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.290
You hope.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.210
And hope does not mean that you believe or
that you're hoping in the person.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.289
But that you're hoping that there is a God
who can truly change the heart of a person.

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:43.700
That's why it always hopes.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.090
You can't look at somebody and always hope
that they are gonna change.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.149
But you can always hope that God can create
that change.

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.799
Now for us we're always looking for you know
some instant change in the people that we

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.049
love in our spouses or our friends.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.609
We want to find a little room we can put them
in and then they just go through a miraculous

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:01.609
change.

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:05.420
Like the farmer who never came off the farm
and his son got to go to college.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.970
And the first time he ever went to a city
he was in a hotel and he saw this little room

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.240
with doors that opened and closed.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.400
It was an elevator but he never seen one before.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.660
He saw this old lady walk in to an elevator
doors close, 2 minutes later they open and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.140
a beautiful young woman walks out he turns
to his son, and says son go get your mom.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.940
Alright.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.940
Now whether we want to admit it or not that's
what all of us want.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.490
We want a little room where we can just go
in there and change, alright.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.280
But it doesn't happen but we can always hope
because?

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.010
There's a God who can change and bring change
in people's lives.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.830
And it always perceivers.
