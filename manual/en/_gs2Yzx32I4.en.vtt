stew then thermos and I I got a little

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.830

carrots cut up real small so they'll fit

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.519
through the neck of that and got some
beef broth I'm going to put all this in

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.969
that pan and bring it to a boil for five
minutes and put it in the thermos using

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.190
my homemade funnel because I think
everything will fit through that hole

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.829
and I think I'll give it about oh no
what time is it 10 so if I check it

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.579
about 11:00 or midnight sorry about that
I had a phone call while I was in the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.050
middle of recording and it automatically
stops and goes to the phone so anyway

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.620
I'm going to dump all this in that pan
