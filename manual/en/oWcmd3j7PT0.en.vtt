Hi, I'm Jasimine and I'm 14, I'm from Glorious
Cooking and today I'm here on behalf of Expert

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.540
Village and I'm going to show you how to boil
an egg. Okay welcome back so our eggs, if

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.540
you look closely you can see. The top was
hot. The water has just boiled out of our

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.360
eggs so we are going to bring them over to
the sink. Actually we are going to grab a

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.360
big spoon okay if you don't have a big spoon
you can use tongs and you are carefully going

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.360
to bring it over here into a bowl. Careful
not to break the shell open yet and we are

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.390
going to drop the 3 eggs in there. We are
going to rinse our eggs with cold water, just

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.630
like we started out with the water cold we
want to rinse for a good 5 minutes cold water.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.539
That is going to help the peel come off when
it is time to peel it. While we are rinsing

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.570
I'm going to tell you all the things you can
do with a boil egg. Now you can just eat them,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.260
just boil with salt and pepper or you can
cut them up and put them into your tuna salad

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.260
and chicken salad or you could use slit them
open you know take the peel off the shell

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:46.660
and you cut them in half. You take the yolk,
that is the yellow part and you put it in

00:00:46.660 --> 00:01:02.559
a container. You add a couple of seasonings
salt, pepper, really anything that you like

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:18.740
and you mix it up just the egg yolks. Then
you put some paprika in the yolk and I'm telling

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.190
you how to make deviled eggs and you put the
paprika inside the yolk. After everything

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:48.930
is mixed up and you scoop the yolk out of
the dish and put it right back into the hole

00:01:48.930 --> 00:02:03.830
that you got the yolk from. Right on top add
some more salt and a little bit more pepper

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.991
and some more paprika and you have deviled
eggs. So these have been rinsing in cold water,

00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:10.539
if you touch it you can still feel it is a
little warm so we are going to rinse them

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.320
a little longer. Strain out the water that
is in there, holding the eggs to make sure

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.450
they are not cracking them. So back in the
cold water and we are going to keep rinsing

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.010
them really until they don't feel warm anymore.
