00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.500
They've been doing it all their lives. What

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.100
they do know today, they learn from 
their father. And Reno hopes that this passion that

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.700
he loves so much will carry on, not only through him and his brother but his sons and even after that.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.130
With his brother, he does a lot of the lab
work. He is in there most of the day, working

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.300
to improve the quality of the product.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.200
From  the very beginning, as we

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:20.560
talked about the oils and how we would create
quality, it wouldn't be possible without processes

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.430
like this. It wouldn't be possible without
growers who are as committed and who are as

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:31.389
dedicated as we are. They're caretakers. They're
caretakers of a great process in the very

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:36.620
beginning how it begins with these plants
and how it ends with such an amazing process

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.669
of giving the essential oils to the world
in an unmatched quality and in an unmatched

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:49.230
opportunity. And for that, I think we all
have great gratitude. Reno has been looking

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:55.710
to expand their horizons for a number of years
now and eventually, now he feels that he found

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:02.780
the right people through doTERRA to expand
and improve. As we've been here and been able

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.810
to visit with the people who are producing
the lemons and the bergamot for doTERRA.To

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.030
be able to see how we've been able to expand
their operation. It's just an awesome thing to

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.110
be able to think about how we're able to do
that all around the world. Their labor of

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.800
love is benefiting so many people because
this means so much to them. They're so passionate

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.220
about their work and for us to be able to
give them an opportunity to be able to take

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.000
that out. To be able to bless the lives of
so many people around

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
the world is just an awesome thing to behold.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.500
Is that Sicilian lemon?

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.000
[laughing]

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.200
That's your lemon!
