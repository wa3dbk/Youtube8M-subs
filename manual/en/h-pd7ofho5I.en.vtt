Green Ninja! Green Ninja!
Teaching kids to keep it clean!

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.800
Green Ninja! Green Ninja!
Needs to build a ninja team!

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.500
Green Ninja! Green Ninja!

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.800
Green Ninja! Green Ninja!
Never going to stop until we do this thing!

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.179
Green Ninja!

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:23.000
On this episode of the Green Ninja show,
Mina from Bhimavaram, India asks:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm really worried about how much trash we produce.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.840
Sometimes, this makes me scared.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.500
Mina, your concern about waste production is no rubbish.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.500
Mina, your concern about waste production is no rubbish.
[Rimshot]

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.980
But it doesn't have to be scary.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.559
Here's a perfect example of someone
who overcame that same fear.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.260
Sure, I used to throw things away.
I mean, everyone does.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.000
So I don't know why it happened to me.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.500
At first, I thought it was just my imagination.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.500
I kept feeling like
I was being followed.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.000
No matter where I went,
I couldn't shake this sensation.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.670
From the time I woke up
to the time I went to bed,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.000
it was like a piece of my past was
lurking in the shadows.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And then one day,
it became too big of a secret to hide.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.000
I tried to ignore it, but it just became worse.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.500
The things I threw away were
following me everywhere!

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Get a grip on yourself, man.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.689
You're not the only one
who throws things away.

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:50.219
The earth is like an island with limited room.
The more you consume, the more space is wasted.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.740
We can never get away from our waste! 
But there is something we can do.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.000
The more we can reduce, reuse and recycle,
the less trash we generate.

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.500
And by generating less trash,
the less we have to worry about it

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.000
being with us all the time.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.720
Since that day,
I've come to terms with what I throw away.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.000
I know I'll never be completely alone,
but I sure have less of a following these days.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So there you have it.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.500
Recycling and reusing potential waste products
is something none of us should... "refuse."

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.310
These puns are killing me, man.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:45.000
