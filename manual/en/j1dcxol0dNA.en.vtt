My name is Mike Jones and I'm a barista at
Third Rail Coffee right by Washington Square

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.530
Park in New York City.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:22.480
I'm gonna teach you some basic coffee-making
skills.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.320
Alright so I'm gonna give you a couple tips
for preparing espresso, a couple things that

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.650
are overlooked and that will really improve
the results you're seeing.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.120
One of those is consistency.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.559
There's now an endless amount of information
on the internet and in books on how to make

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.739
espresso and there are some there are definitely
standards that everyone knows to do which

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:51.340
is to dose evenly in the basket, to tamp evenly
and consistently, and then to have a shot

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.340
that's pulled between twenty-one to thirty
seconds, yielding 1 1/2 to 2 ounces volume.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.219
That's sort of the if you just look up how
to prepare espresso on websites like coffeegeek.com,

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.180
that's what they're saying.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.330
But there are also people giving opinions
on whether or not to use your finger to distribute

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.610
the coffee once you put in the portafilter,
whether or not to knock the portafilter which

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.520
is called settling it, which is a technique
used to overdose, meaning to put more coffee

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.080
in the basket than is intended to be in there.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.110
And all I can say is, as long as you're just
doing the same thing every time, and it's

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.630
consistent and even - that is the biggest
thing.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.960
So at least as far as how you've dialed the
new espresso.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.460
So if I got a shot that tasted good and I
just like, filled the basket, knocked it around

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.290
to get the grounds even in there, tamped the
certain way, and then pulled it for a certain

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.170
amount of time I'm just gonna wanna do that
every time.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.400
And if it starts straying, I'm going to adjust
so that I can do the same consistent actions

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.210
to get the same result.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.670
The other tip is cleanliness - very much overlooked.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.350
If you taste a shot that's pulled from a portafilter
that has been used for two hours, not cleaned,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.299
and then taste that side by side with a brand
new sparkling clean one, the difference is

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.359
incredible.

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:18.599
There's no hashy, bitter, aspirin-y taste
to it.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.859
It's just clean, balanced, beautiful.

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:28.350
I'd rather have a just kind-of okay shot from
a clean machine than a well-pulled shot from

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.739
a dirty portafilter.

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.700
So cleanliness, consistency - a couple tips.
