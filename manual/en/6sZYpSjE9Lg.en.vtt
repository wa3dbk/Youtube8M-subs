00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:10.339
Samsung overhauls Galaxy range.

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:14.200
Samsung's ever increasing range of Galaxy
smartphones is getting a bit difficult to

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.730
understand, so Samsung have decided to overhaul
their naming convention, and at the same time

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.599
they have previewed four new handsets.

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.839
In future, Galaxy models will be named in
the following way, from high-end devices down.

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:35.940
S (Super Smart): Very high-end devices.
R (Refined): High-end devices.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.360
W (Wonder): Upper mid-range phones.
M (Magical): Mid-range phones.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.250
Y (Young): Entry level smartphones.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.210
In addition, the handset may be a "Pro" (with
a QWERTY keyboard), "Plus" (an upgraded version)

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.660
or "LTE" (for an LTE compatible handset).

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.329
We've tried to think up a way of remembering
S.R.W.M.Y. but the best we could do was "Samsung

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.490
Really Wants My Yak".

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.810
Samsung have also previewed four new Android
handsets using the new naming convention.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.189
The Samsung Galaxy W has a 3.7" screen and
a 1.4GHz processor, and as the name suggests

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:28.060
this is an upper midrange phone that is probably
all most people need. The Samsung Galaxy M

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.000
Pro is a QWERTY equipped messenger with an
optical trackpad and enterprise support. Another

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.749
messaging phone is the Samsung Galaxy Y Pro,
an entry level device that is still quite

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:45.889
powerful. The final one of the four is the
Samsung Galaxy Y which has a 832MHz processor

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:50.520
and is aimed towards the lower end of the
market.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.310
Remember though that "entry level" is relative
when talking about Android devices. Any one

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.899
of these Galaxy smartphones is likely to be
pretty impressive. We don't know when these

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.969
new Galaxy phones will be out or how much
they will cost, but our best guess is that

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:05.780
these will be in the shops by Christmas.
