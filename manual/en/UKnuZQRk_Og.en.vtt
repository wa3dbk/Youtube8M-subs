00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.321
Let's talk tension.

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:08.200
Now, tension has always been the place where
people blame their sewing machine.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.680
We hear it all the time.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.030
Really, when everything is threaded correctly:
You have your right needle in.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.300
The bobbin is spinning in the right direction.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.759
You have quality thread in machine and everything
set up as it should be.

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.669
You probably don't need to be working much
with the tension especially if you're using

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.800
the same thread in your needle as you do in
the bobbin.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.380
We all have those times when things just don't
go right or you are finding your thread that

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.800
you have selected, maybe one is a little heavier
that you're putting through your needle and

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.160
you don't need that decorative thread in your
bottom, so you have a different weight down

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.160
below.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.050
That's more when you need to adjust your tension,
when the balance is off between the two.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.710
Some people remember that they were told "Never
touch your tension."

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.710
Well, guess what?

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.010
You can roll this little dial either way.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.010
It doesn't matter.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.550
Once it comes back to kind of 4, (That's kind
of a default setting here.)

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.230
it will go back to where it should be.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.010
We have little fingers that visit our store
all the time; and they love to turn dials

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.409
and buttons and they do.

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.800
Sometimes all we have to do is just roll that
back to where it needs to be and it's all

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.860
set to go.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.910
Now, tension - sometimes as you stitch, you
might see where your stitches maybe pull to

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:14.910
the topside.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.430
You're seeing your bobbin thread on the top
of your machine.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.830
That means your needle thread is too strong,
so that would be reducing the tension.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.720
I'd go, at least, a number of a number-and-a-half
worth of change.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.690
One little 'eek' of the tension dial is not
going to do anything for you, so give it a

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.690
good turn.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.690
Guess what?

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.890
If you don't remember which way to go, go
ahead and go that number, number-and-a-half

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.210
and if it gets worse, well go the other way.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.410
That's how easy it is to go.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.780
If you see that on the top, we're loosening
it.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.660
If you see your threads on the backside and
you don't them there, you want them a little

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.740
bit more balanced, you're tightening up your
top thread and that will fix it there.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.410
Now, there's also this problem.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.220
Who has had this happen before in their machine?

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.130
People say, "Oh, my tension is off."

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.430
Well, technically, yes; but you know what?

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.780
All this is, is that your machine is not threaded
correctly or actually in the little disks

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.660
that are inside with the dial adjust.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.170
The thread actually runs through two disks
and when the presser foot is down, that disk

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.480
closes on the thread.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.870
Remember when you tugged on the thread with
the foot down at the needle, that made it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.870
tight.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.730
It's that the thread never got down in those
disks and that is the case with this issue

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.730
here.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.730
Here's the thing.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.330
A lot of people turn it over and realize,
"Oh, that bobbin is just awful," and they

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.520
go digging down here.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.520
Guess what?

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.420
The bobbin is probably just fine.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.420
Don't look at the bobbin.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.660
The reason I sewed with two different colors
of thread right now ... I've got kind of a

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.390
blue in the needle and I've got pink in the
bobbin.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.580
Guess what color is showing down here?

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.580
Blue.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.470
That means the problem is the blue thread.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.830
So, all you need to do is rethread your machine.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.830
Sew on it.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.920
You should be good to go or do that little
test that I did earlier where you are testing

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.130
that as the needle thread is being pulled
it's loose; and when the foot lowers down,

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.130
it's tight.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.200
You lower that foot down and it's still loose?

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.710
Well, you still need to get it in those tension
disks and then the tension will actually work

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.670
for what your project is.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.250
That's the lowdown on tension.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.500
Don't get hung up on it.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500
Don't change it first.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.500
Make sure everything else is correctly positioned
before you get to tension.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.200
It is usually not the culprit.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.400
It's just what people blame their sewing machines
on.
