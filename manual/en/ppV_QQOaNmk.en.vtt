00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.710
often light experiments are shown with ray
diagrams on the black board. this is not a

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.879
good way. using glass slabs, prism, lenses
you can show much more graphically. now take

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:17.879
fish tank and fill this about 1/3rd with water
and a couple of drops of dettol. stir the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.470
dettol well. the drops of dettol will help
disperse the waves and you can see it much

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.470
more graphically. you need a toy laser. now
place a plane mirror and if you shine two

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.310
laser beams you can see both the incident
and the reflected ray. this is with the single

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:46.310
laser. if you have a double laser you will
see that both the rays are parallel and so

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.790
are the reflected rays. this is so much graphic
when we have a concave mirror. you can see

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.030
that both the reflected rays meet at a same
point known as the focus. in the dark you

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.490
can see the focus much more clearly, what
is bending of light mean with the help of

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.490
a lens.. if you have a convex mirror then
you have the reflected rays diverge and you

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.830
can see them bend outwards as you go away
from the mirror. now if you pass the laser

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.520
beam through a glass slab then light is refracted.
the light bends as it moves from a rarer medium

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.040
to the denser medium. if we have two prisms
where one light bends in one way and the other

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.040
the other way. over here you can see the bending
of light towards the base but the other prism

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.810
will nullify it and so the incident and the
refracted rays may be parallel. if you use

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.450
a convex lens you can see on the left side
that the rays meet at a focus. in dark its

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.319
much more graphic. if you use concave lens
then the refracted rays diverge or move away

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:21.180
from each other. and of course if you just
shine the laser as such you can see total

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.150
internal reflection. now a days most of the
communication is done through fiber optics

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.150
which uses the same principle of total internal
reflection. you can see how the incident ray

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:42.599
and reflected ray change. now this is a very
very graphic demonstration of how light behaves

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.009
with different types of lenses and mirrors.
