00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.990
[music] Narrator: Operation IceBridge has arrived

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.000
at Thule Air Base to kick off this year’s survey of Arctic sea ice 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.000
and the ice sheets and glaciers of Greenland. But just a week ago 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.010
they were still at Wallops Flight Facility outfitting a brand new aircraft

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.010
for the trip.Actually the NASA C-130

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.020
four-engine turboprop cargo plane has seen five decades of service, 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.030
but it’s a new aircraft to IceBridge. With its distinctive nose, 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.070
elevated cockpit, and open cabin, it’s a change of pace for the team, 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.080
but functionally, it’s built to do the job.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.100
Sonntag: Yeah, so the C-130 it's an interesting aircraft … Again this one for us is a new airplane.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.100
It's about my age, actually, but Wallops just got it about a year ago. 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.110
First time we've installed in it. It has some advantages, some disadvantages

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.110
over the P-3 that we normally take to Greenland. Pretty similar performance really. Roughly similar range roughly similar 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.150
ground speed, maneuverability characteristics that sort of thing.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.150
Narrator: For the past few months, the Wallops and IceBridge teams have been busy 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.160
making sure the aircraft is properly configured for the mission’s many laser, 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.160
radar, and photographic instruments.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.160
Sonntag: That was a long road -- it's always a big deal putting all these instruments -- there's a whole suite of them on board

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.170
what to us is a new airplane. A lot of design work, a lot of machining, a lot of cutting

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.170
of metal, a lot of re-designing and re-machine work and re-cutting of metal 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.180
when the first one doesn't always work out like we hoped. 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.190
Once we're modularized and designed into the system it'll be pretty easy, but the first time is hard 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.190
and that's what's been an issue with this particular deployment because all 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.190
all of our optical instruments have to be machined to fit to look out a 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.200
particular viewport in the bottom. All the wiring has to work. 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.200
The equipment you see behind me here which is precise navigation equipment

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.210
which helps us put the airplane directly underneath the satellite path 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.220
or directly over one of our previous paths from IceBridge all that has to be wired into the system, 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.220
tested, flight-tested and that's what we're in the process of doing now. 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.230
Narrator: One week later, with all test flights a success, 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.230
IceBridge is now 6,000 miles to the north, already has its first flight in the books, 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.270
and will be flying out of Greenland and Fairbanks, Alaska for the next two months.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.579
