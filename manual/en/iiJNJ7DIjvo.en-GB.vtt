I'm Jean Bishop, I'm 91 years old, and I'm
from Hull. I'm known as the Bee Lady. And

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:35.200
I dress up as a bee, and go out and collect
the money for Age UK. Oh, I really love it.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:43.390
I do. I love the people. They're so friendly
to me. You can't describe it, it's wonderful.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:01:00.870
Everybody, they hug me and kiss me, and they're
so nice to me. There hasn't been one person

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:14.960
who has been disagreeable or nasty; they're
lovely. I try and keep young inside myself.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.310
There are such a lot of things I want to do.
I'm looking forward to still carrying on,

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.310
doing my collecting for as long as I can.
There's nothing going to stop me because I

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:43.979
want to get my next 100,000. I've got 100,000.
I think it's everything if you love everybody.

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:53.280
I think if you love everybody, and even if
it just turns to liking everybody or loving

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.759
everybody, I think you feel more cheerful,
and happy.
