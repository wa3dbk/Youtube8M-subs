00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.569
A lot of times we need to cut chicken into strips.

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:17.119
Pain in the neck.

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.570
Have you ever taken a sharp knife and a wiggly piece of chicken and it's just like okay

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.130
who's going to go first?

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.509
Well first of all, you know the tip.

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.819
Underneath your cutting board there, you want to put a little bit of a

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:32.850
wet damp cloth to hold the cutting board. That's going to help a lot.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.230
The other thing that will help... If your chicken...

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.889
It's stuck to the plate [laughs]

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:41.670
If your chicken's partially frozen..

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.660
I have a partially frozen chicken breast. In 
other words, don't let it

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.760
thaw all the way.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.470
You take your fork like you're going to cut into it and eat it.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.560
Get rid of that little piece of fat.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.769
I just want you to see how easily my knife glide through

00:00:58.769 --> 00:00:59.970
and makes these

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.370
beautiful little strips of chicken.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.720
You can't get it this thin

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.170
when it's all the way fresh.

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.350
So partially frozen,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.660
look at these strips.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.380
See how nice that is?

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.340
You can do that when it's

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.770
all the way fresh.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.300
So either freeze it

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.590
or if you're thawing frozen chicken,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.070
don't thaw it all the way. Let it come like this, then it's still much easier to cut.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.980
You can even cut it in half when you have a really thick piece.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.740
Cut it lengthwise and then cut, cut.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.409
Get rid of the garbage

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.250
that you don't want, like fat.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.750
Like here you have fat,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.030
cut it and voila.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.910
You've got chicken for stir fry.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:54.680
That was easy.
