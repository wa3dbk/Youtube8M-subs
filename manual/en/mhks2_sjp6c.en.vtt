Hi! My name is Adria. I am one of the professional
jugglers here at Expert Village.com. We are

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.240
working with scarf juggling. Quick review,
we have learned how scarfs differ from balls,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.310
in that you lift and drop rather than tossing
and catching. We have learned that they have

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:27.580
a special hold because you have to have the
scarfs held separately. We have learned how

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.300
to throw a scarf under the leg. We have seen
how it is possible to throw one scarf under

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.820
each leg sequentially. Well now we are going
to take scarfs and we are going to throw them

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.200
sequentially under one leg. Now remember I
am going to be trying to talk while I do this

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.640
I will be out of breath and panting a lot.
So, here we go. Remember what we learned about

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.329
under the leg throws with scarfs is that we
cannot reach very high so the throws will

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:09.600
be low, like that. Now we are going do to
it sequentially with one leg. Keeping my leg

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:28.590
in the air every scarf that ended up in my
right hand went under the leg. It is very

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:42.899
fast for scarfs and it is not easy to get
the scarfs confused with each other, but again,

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.770
up, up, up, scarfs sequentially under one
leg.
