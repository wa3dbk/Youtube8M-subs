00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.970
Right next to me 
I got the Samsung NC10, 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.970
and I'm going tell you all about this
ultra-cool Netbook. 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.680
Don't go anywhere. 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.220
You are looking at the 
Samsung NC10 Netbook, 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.790
and you know I went online to check out
reviews for this netbook, 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.200
and they were all very good. 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.900
I would say 4.8 out of 5 was the lowest, ok? 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.340
So, it doesn't surprise me though. 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.960
Samsung makes great quality products, 
and this netbook is without exception

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.780
another one of them to add to the list. 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.460
Alright, so this netbook, it runs on the 
1.6 GHz Intel Atom Processor N270. 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.200
You have 1 Gig of DDR2 RAM,
160 GHz hard drive at 5400 RPM.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.700
Comes equipped with Windows XP Home
802.11 B and G

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.110
plus Bluetooth 2.0 so you can pair 
the netbook with your Smartphone

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.220
or any other Bluetooth device, 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.910
and share pictures and files and music 
and whatever else you want to share. 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.520
Also, you are looking at the 
10.2-inch LCD screen, 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.060
and this has a 1024 X 600 resolution.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.660
Now, this netbook right here 
comes with a 6-Cell Battery, 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.510
and going by netbook standards, 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.630
it's going to last you between 
five and six hours of battery life

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.540
not having to be plugged in. 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.320
So, let's say you're going on a trip, 
just make sure you're fully charged, 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.240
and this netbook should last 
you through most flights. 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.910
Unless you're flying somewhere really far,
like, I don't know, Italy or Indonesia, 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.820
or, I don't know, 
somewhere far. 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.260
Alright, this netbook also comes equipped 
with Intel Integrated Graphics N 45 GSE.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.360
You have a three-in-one card reader for all
your SD your SDHC and your MMC Cards. 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.330
And this whole thing, 
this entire Netbook weights...

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.230
Now hold on, let me, let me...

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.110
Let me think here...

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.180
Ok, about 2.8 lbs. 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.170
I think that's about right. 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.260
So, it's not going to give you any cramps
while you're travelling

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.490
out and about with this netbook. 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.980
Alright, so let's take a tour so you can see
more of what this Samsung has to offer. 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.270
Starting up top here in this shiny blue
bezel you have your 1.3 Megapixel Webcam.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.630
You can't go wrong with a built-in Webcam.
Great for Skyping or video-chatting. 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.670
Moving down along, you'll see you have 
a 10.2-inch LCD screen

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.740
with a 1024 X 600 resolution, 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.970
and then you have your 
nice sized keyboard right here. 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.980
So much better than typing 
on your Smartphone. 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.610
You can actually nail out some papers, 
even a Power Point presentation or two

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.460
with this nice keyboard. 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.390
Alright, moving down below, 
you have your touchpad 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.810
with your scrolling bar on the other side,
and you have a one-click mouse here. 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.210
It's just one click. 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.070
Alright, let's go on to the other side. 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.570
And you'll see you have your headset 
and your mic jacks.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.880
You have one USB 2.0 Port right here. 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.280
Your VGA, 
your Kensington Lock, 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.020
and built in right here to this panel, 
your power button. 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.760
Let's go on over to the other side. 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.100
You'll see you have two more USB 2.0 Ports,
so that's three total. 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.940
You got your Ethernet port right here, 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.810
and last but not least, 
your power. 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.160
So then moving along to the front,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.110
you'll see you have all of your
status indicators right here.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.820
And let's not forget about your nifty-difty
card reader right in this slot.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.120
And this is a three-in-one Card Reader:
SD/SDHC/MMC cards.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.160
So, all in all, 
this is a fantastic netbook. 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.300
And netbooks are great 
if you're always on the go, 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.550
and you find yourself, you know, 
at your favorite cafe 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.740
 always wanting to check emails and 
check sport scores and keep up with the news.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.000
