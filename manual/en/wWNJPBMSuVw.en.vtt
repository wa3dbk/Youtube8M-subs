00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.700
I'm Marcus Monson, and I'm the Celebrity Makeup
Artist for Guerlain Cosmetics.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.200
I'm going to show Sarah a new take on the new neutrals.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:21.000
We're going to start with Abeille Royale Daily Repair Serum. You take one pump and massage this right into the skin.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.300
This is going to help to repair, heal and firm the skin.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:34.000
Bronze really isn't just a color, it's a state of mind. This is Joli Tient Healthy Glow Duo Powder.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
What you're going to do is swirl, then start it at the forehead, work it down on the cheek, down the jawline, and down onto the neck.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.150
Beautiful. What I love about
this product is that it's multifunction.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.740
You can actually use this product as an eyeshadow.
Take a little touch of the bronze,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.600
put that right on the eyelid and then take the little
bit brighter color and take that right at the outer corner....

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.200
It does look beautiful.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.200
To finish up your eyes, I'm going to add a little bit of Kajal kohl pencil,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:15.710
just to give them a little bit of drama before we go into mascara. All you're going to do is put this right along the lash line.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.100
You can smudge it with a brush, or you can take one of the best brushes that you have, which is your fingertip,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.200
and just lightly blend that. You tap it right in.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.000
Now we're going to add some volume to your lashes with the new Maxi Lash So Volume Mascara.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.270
Start at the outer edge, and go all the way
to the inner corner. What this is going to do,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.850
it's going to separate your lashes so
you're not going to have clumping.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.920
Now I'm going to make sure that your lipstick stays on all day. That's where Liplift comes in.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:02:00.500
What you do is you take this, apply on and
around the lips. Let it adhere for about 30 to 60 seconds.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.000
It's going to make any lip
liner that you use go on easier.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.200
What I love about this season is that natural lips are in. This is KissKiss Lipstick.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.769
Apply this all over the lips. It's this beautiful, soft 
rose. This is an absolutely gorgeous shade on you.

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.519
A great tip: if your lips feel a little
bit dry, just take a little bit of lip gloss

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:35.100
and lightly hit the center of the lower lip....
Do this (rubs lips together), and now you've got that perfect pout.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.909
Sarah, we're done.
You are absolutely gorgeous.
