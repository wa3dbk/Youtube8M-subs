Hi I'm Karen for Expert Village I'm going
to finish off my peanut butter fudge pie with

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.849
a little extra whip cream to put around the
end. I whip a extra 1/2 cup of whip cream,

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:20.740
I'm going to fill a pastry bag with the whip
cream. You fill a pastry bag by folding it

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:29.500
back to make a little cup and your hands holds
it open like that and just scoop in that whip

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:40.940
cream. Fill it right up and when you decorate
with whip cream you want to use a nice wide

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:57.180
tip, nice big wide tip and then just scoot
that down and gather up the top and twist

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.230
it in your hand like that and now when you
decorate with whip cream you want to use big

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:21.320
full motions and use a lot of whip cream.
Stop, turn it around

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.810
and just keep going around in nice swirly
motion. Usually when you decorate with whip

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.100
cream you can' really make any mistakes if
you make some nice big swirly motions you

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:46.750
get a pretty decorate.
Just continue around into we get to the end

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:58.350
and then maybe just a little bit of that graham
cracker around the edge. We can do just a

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:10.349
little something in the middle and we would
top it off with a chocolate chip and a little

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:17.780
sprinkle and that really also festive. Now
this is great to be stored in the freezer

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.110
if you are going to store it for a few days.
You can also store it in the refrigerator

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.189
for maybe 2 days.
