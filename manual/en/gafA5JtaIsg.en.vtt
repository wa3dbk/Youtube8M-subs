Hey, what's up everybody? I'm Rob and you're watching Man vs Pin.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.300
The show where I find something awesome on Pinterest and put it to the test.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.220
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.100
Today I saw this pin - Remove red wine stains using white wine.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.960
Seems like a miracle, sounds like *BS* to me. So, we're going to put it to the test.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.540
Alright, so you're at a party, you're having a good time, not a care in the world.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.740
And then this happens. Well, son of a *B*.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.680
The first thing you're gonna want to do is get yourself a towel or a cloth and dab the stain.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.820
Don't rub it, don't scrub it, just dab it. This is the most important part.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.640
The whole point is to get as much of the liquid out as possible.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.880
Alright, we're gonna get a little nerdy and adhere to the scientific method for a minute.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:53.260
Now, both sides of the shirt have red wine on them, so we're gonna establish one side of the shirt as our control, and the other side of the shirt as our experiment.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.960
Now, if this party is even halfway decent, and it should be because you're there, they'll probably have white wine as well.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.120
So, get yourself a glass or a bottle. Now, pour your white wine onto the one side of the shirt, covering your stain.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.400
Again, you're going to take your towel and you're going to gently dab the shirt to soak up as much moisture as possible.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.500
Now, already it looks like the white wine is diffusing the red wine stain. So... so far so good.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.740
Now, when it comes to red wine, time is definitely not on your side. So, you're gonna want to wash this as quickly as possible.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.440
Running it under some warm water definitely helps, but if you can find a washing machine that's the most ideal.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.040
For experimental sake, I threw this in the washer along with some detergent.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.140
I then followed it up by throwing it in the dryer.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.920
Now, remember to read your labels on your clothing, because you don't wanna *F* this up even more.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:48.460
Once it was all dry, I took it out and... hmm.. uhhmm.. Well as you can see, the stain is still there, on both sides.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.020
Now, the white wine side looks actually like there's a little bit less, and to that I will give this pin credit.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.740
It's not as bad as the regular red wine side, but still the shirt looks like *S*.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.160
It's ruined. That shirt, goin' to Goodwill. I don't even know if Goodwill takes stuff like that.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.380
In conclusion, this pin completely didn't work.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.820
It's a bummer because that was a pretty nice shirt too. Oh well.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.300
