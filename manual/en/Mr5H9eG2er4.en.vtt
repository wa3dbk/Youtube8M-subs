BRANDON SARKIS: Hi, my name is Brandon Sarkis
on behalf of Expert Village. Today, I'm going

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:09.280
to show you how to make Manhattan-style fish
chowder or Manhattan-style fish soup. All

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.059
right, so 20 minutes of simmering has passed,
so we're going to take our lid. Don't burn

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:24.810
yourself. It hurts, trust me. All right, so
let's give it a stir here and, you see, we've

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.590
got this wonderful tomato and potato soup
here. Now, your potatoes should be pretty

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.239
near done, if they're not done completely.
What I like to do is I like to let them break

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.719
down a little bit more, but since we're going
to show you the normal way to do this, which

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.600
is basically just to cook the chopped-up potatoes,
which I have done. It means we're at the point

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.320
we needed to be at. So let's take our fish
and dump that in. I'm going to put them in

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:10.010
waves just so I don't kind of shock this too
much, and I'm going to stir that. That's my

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:19.610
first round of fish. Here comes some more
and some more. And you can see the two pounds

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.390
of fish diced up. That's a whole lot of fish.
You won't be able to escape the fish in every

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:34.720
bite, not that you want to. I'll have to say,
if you don't like fish, why are you making

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:44.351
Manhattan-style fish chowder? All right, so
I've got my heat up all the way. I'm going

00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:53.710
to take this opportunity to get some seasonings
in there. And what we're going to do now is--this

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:01.840
fish doesn't take long to cook, so we're going
to give it about seven minutes. And we're

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.050
just going to add a little bit of salt and
pepper. In this one, you can add really whatever

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:15.870
you want for seasonings. Salt and pepper--and
for me just 'cause I'm funny like that. I'm

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:26.749
going to throw in some--just a little bit
of thyme, just some dried thyme, not a whole

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:38.210
lot. And that should be good for me. So let's
stir this all up here. Get those seasonings

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.530
working through here. And one thing you might
have to do, you might have to add more water

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.870
to this. It just really depends on how much
evaporates and how big your potatoes were

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.980
and all that stuff. I think right now I'm
looking pretty good with this, though. I might

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.639
have to add a little bit more at the very,
very end. So we're going to come back in five

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.799
minutes. This is ready to go and--have one
last look at it.
