00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.200
[ MUSIC ]

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:20.849
RICHARD NIXON: My fellow Americans, I come
before you tonight as a man who's honesty

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.290
and integrity has been questioned.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.770
MICHAEL A. COHEN: In 1952 Dick Nixon is selected
to be Vice President of the United States

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.750
by Dwight Eisenhower.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.370
Story breaks that he had access to this fund
that had been put together by some wealthy

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.860
business men out in California and that it
was a personal fund for Nixon.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.841
ROBERT LEHRMAN: It was so sensational that
Eisenhower was thinking about dropping him

00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:44.841
from the ticket.

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:47.510
Nixon felt his entire career was threatened.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.010
NIXON: The best and only answer to a smear
or to an honest misunderstanding of the facts

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.010
is to tell the truth.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.940
CHARLTON MCILWAIN: In this speech, Nixon is
aided by television.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.100
He's sitted down in what appears to be his
own living room.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.130
His wife is sitting right off camera.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.960
He's able to connect with people in a real
authentic way.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.920
NIXON: I want to tell you my side of the case.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.249
ROBERT: He did exactly what Aristotle recommended.

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:21.429
He said there are three ways you pursued people.

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:24.859
Logos, pathos, ethos.

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.340
Ethos really doesn't mean ethics, it means
the personality of the speaker.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.880
If you like the guy, you're going to be persuaded
by him.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.609
NIXON: I don't believe that I ought to quit.

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.000
Because I am not a quitter.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.390
And incidentally, Pat's not a quitter after
all, her name was Patricia Ryan and she was

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.850
born on St. Patrick's Day.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.209
And you know the Irish never quit.

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:46.290
ADAM FRANKEL: Part of what makes the speech
so effective is how personal it is.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.740
He goes into such detail, explaining his own
finances.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.159
NIXON: Everything I've earned, everything
I've spent, everything I owe.

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.359
ADAM: He starts talking about information
that is almost shocking.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:02.021
MICHAEL A. COHEN: Today it's sort of, no one's
really surprised by it, but it would have

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:03.490
been unheard of in 1952.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.240
NIXON: We've got a house in Washington which
cost 41 thousand dollars, and on which we

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.480
owe 21 thousand dollars.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.050
Our family was one of modest circumstances,
and Pat doesn't have a mink coat.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.099
But she does have a respectable, Republican
cloth coat.

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.319
And I always tell her, that she'd look good
in anything.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.129
ROBERT: Logos, logic - reasoning.

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.260
He builds a lawyerly like case for his having
done nothing wrong.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.250
NIXON: The question is, was it morally wrong.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.209
And I say that it was morally wrong if any
of the contributors got special favors.

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.519
Not one of them has ever asked me for a special
favor.

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.650
ROBERT: And then Pathos, you move people - emotion.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.409
And that's why the speech is called "checkers."

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.650
MICHAEL A. COHEN: As part of this fund that
Nixon had been receiving he'd gotten some

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.439
gifts, and one of them was a dog.

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.250
NIXON: And our little girl Tricia named it
Checkers.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.450
The kids love the dog, and I just want to
say that regardless of what they say about

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.219
it, we're going to keep him.

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:09.920
CHARLTON: At the very end of the speech he
is able to make a plea saying, look I could

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.790
resign, some people say I should.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.260
NIXON: And I'm going to ask you to help them
decide.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.209
Wire and write the Republican National Committee
with whether I should stay on, or whether

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.849
I should get off.

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.319
And whatever there decision is, I will abide
by it.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.760
MICHAEL A. COHEN: The reaction to it was overwhelming.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.969
Telegrams streamed in to the RNC for months
afterwards, praising Nixon, saying you should

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:34.969
keep this guy on the ticket.

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:38.099
And of course he stayed, and he ended up becoming
Vice President and eventually President one

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.099
day.

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.959
But it's maybe the first example I think of
how a politician can use television as a means

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.569
of humanizing themselves.

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.129
NIXON: Regardless of what happens, I'm going
to continue this fight, I'm going to campaign

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.230
up and down in America until we drive the
crooks and the Communists and those that defend

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.849
them out of Washington.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.560
And remember folks, a vote for Eisenhower
is a vote for what's good for America.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.400
ANNOUNCER: Time purchased for this program
has now elapsed.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.549
This is WCBS TV, channel 2.
