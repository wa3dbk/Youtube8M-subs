00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:17.730
Hard edges draw attention. They draw the viewer’s
attention because it’s just very stark.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.529
It almost forms a line is what it does and,
by forming a line, it immediately grabs the

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.630
viewer’s attention. Now, the opposite of
a hard edge is what I would call a soft edge.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.251
A soft edge is just what it implies. It’s
very soft, it’s a transition. A soft edge

00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:45.620
would be something like this, between this
light value and this dark value underneath

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.790
the lips. Do you see that transition right
in there between the light and the dark? It’s

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.500
very soft. Soft edges can be used to downplay
certain areas in your paintng. They can be

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.710
used to de-emphasize things, areas that you
want to sort of downplay a little bit. Soft

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.140
edges come into play when you get very close
value relationships. I’ll give you another

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.100
example. When you get up into the head here,
say in the cheeks. See the pinkish color in

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.080
these cheeks as it comes around and starts
to turn towards more of the jaw line? Do you

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.000
see the transition betweeen this color, this
pinkish color and this yellow color? Do you

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.960
see an edge in there? Not really, because
it is a very close value relationship. Thery’re

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.610
very close in value, so you sort of lose the
edge altogether. So, that’s another example

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.950
of a soft edge in there. Now, we also have
different types of edges. There’s an edge

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.010
called a broken edge. A broken edge would
be something like this right up here in the

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.440
hair. You see how it’s not really a hard
edge and it’s not quite a soft edge, but

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.369
you get all of these broken pieces in there.
That’s referred to as a broken edge. The

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.840
same thing goes with the flicks of the hair
up here. Those are what I would consider broken

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.590
edges because they’re not completely solid
and they’re not completely soft, not totally

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.480
hard, not totally soft, so they’re broken
edges. The same thing is down here in this

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:19.560
shoulder. That is what I would consider a
broken edge. And then there’s an implied

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.209
edge. I’m trying to find an implied edge.
That’s an edge that doesn’t really exist,

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.390
but you’re eye fills it in. I’ll give
you an example; this is sort of an example

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.989
here. The way that the eye comes in the back
here, do you see how close these values are?

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.950
You don’t really see an edge there. You
don’t really seen an edge between this transition,

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.720
this value next to that slightly lighter value
in the corner of the eye but when you squint

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.099
down or step back and look at this painting,
your eye sort of fills that shape in. And

00:02:51.099 --> 00:03:06.020
that’s what I would call an implied edge.
Today, I want to give you an example, a little

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:14.590
demonstration. I have up here on my easel
just a picture of a statue of a little rabbit

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.760
and, basically, I just want to paint the rabbit
to give you an idea as far as the variety

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.950
of edges that you can use in your painting.
I’m going to do the same thing over here.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:46.870
I can get a soft edge right in here by just
using my fingers. That’s a soft edge. Let’s

00:03:46.870 --> 00:04:01.330
try another transition. It’s almost a soft
edge but not quite as much, just like that.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:18.810
A lot of these soft edges I can get with my
finger. I can’t do it too many times or

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:52.650
else I’m going to remove too much paint,
but I can do it a couple of times. I can do

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:29.890
the same thing on the back here.
This book needs to come up. Okay, I’m going

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:57.020
to put a very light value right here because
that’s my lightest value, and then we can

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:13.960
work a few edges into there. I don’t want
this value to be totally white so I’m going

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:20.310
to knock it down just a little bit with just
a little bit of that color, but it will still

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:37.660
appear very light in comparison to what’s
there. When I did this, when I pulled this

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:44.620
across in sort of one motion, you can see
right here that I’ved ended up with more

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:52.110
of a broken edge that happens. And, usually,
you can get broken edges more so when working

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:58.319
over dry paint. So, if you paint over something
that is already dry and then you go back and

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:03.889
re-work over top of that, you usually end
up with a broken edge because it is not a

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:09.229
fluid surface to work into like it is with
wet paint.
