00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:05.480
In this clip we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure for removing and

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:13.809
replacing a rear axle u-joint on a ford explorer.
In this step we're going to talk about the

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.820
proper service procedure for installing your
drive shaft mounting bolts and the torquing

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:29.449
procedure required in tightening them. What
I'm going to do now is start all of my drive

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.970
shaft mounting bolts. You're going to want
to start all of them before tightening any

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.700
of them down just to make sure you can get
them all lined up, two here and two just like

00:00:40.700 --> 00:01:06.610
it on the top.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.940
Alright, take my three eighths socket wrench
with a twelve millimeter twelve point socket

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:25.060
on it and go ahead and tighten them down.
There is a tightening procedure for these.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.010
What you're going to want to do is do an "X"
pattern with it. You're not going to want

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.590
to go from here to here and then here and
here. What you're going to want to do is go

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.460
from here to the one diagonally across from
it. So it would be from here up to the one

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.720
on top, from there you can drop straight down
to this one and then complete your "X" pattern

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.670
by going over here to the other one on the
top. What that will do is ensure that your

00:01:50.670 --> 00:02:36.540
drive shaft is seated flat and true on the
pinion flange.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.799
These bolts are made of hardened grade A steel
and you're going to want to go ahead and tighten

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:53.840
them down just about as hard as you can.
If your vehicle happens to be equipped with

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:07.989
smaller bolts, of course reduce the tension
you apply to them. And now for the last one

00:03:07.989 --> 00:04:18.970
in my torque sequence, complete my "X" pattern
here.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:26.240
Alright, that is the proper torquing procedure
for reinstalling your drive shaft mounting

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.310
bolts.
