Hi, my name is Michael Burton, with michaelburtonfilms.org.
We're located in Salt Lake City, Utah, and

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.390
we're here talking about using Microsoft Windows.
Now, what I want to talk to you about is how

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.290
to rename a file or folder. This is a very
simple process and I'm going to show you two

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.150
ways on how to do that right now. Let me start
out by saying that Windows XP is a registered

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.060
trademark of Microsoft, and I am in no way
affiliated with Microsoft. One of the easiest

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.869
ways to rename a file or folder is first of
all to find a file or folder. While we've

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.570
got this this video here, this HD opener video
on the desktop, I might as well show you how

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.680
this is to be done. There are a couple ways
to do this. One, the easiest way, is to right

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.870
click on the the the file or folder, scroll
down to where it says Rename; click Rename,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.530
which now highlights your text. Now, you can
either delete the entire thing by hitting

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:01.079
backspace or you can re-click on it and just
erase an individual word or or you can even,

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.190
you know, add in text from where you left
off. You know, that that's the easiest way

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.470
to do it, so we can type this in as you know
Renamed File, and we hit enter. There's our

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.170
file renamed. Now, if we want to rename this
file again there's another way. You hold your

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.930
mouse over where the text is, you click once
to highlight it and click twice, a second

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.760
time to bring up where you're able to type.
So now we can rename it again. We can say

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:36.350
Renamed File #2, and hit enter. There's our
newly renamed file. Of course, if you go into

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.799
the start menu; let's go to My Documents and
change a folder. So this is the same process.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.799
For example My Videos; if we want to change
that to you know Mike's Videos we'd right

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:55.260
click on it, scroll down to where it says
Rename, type in our text Mike's Videos, hit

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.350
enter. We have just successfully renamed our
folder. The other way to do it; left click

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.950
on the text, left click again. If you left
click too fast it'll actually open that folder,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.000
so you want to make sure you left click slowly.
Now, what we're going to do is change it right

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.540
back to My Videos, hit enter. We have successfully
changed the name of that folder. So, that's

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.430
how you change the name of any file or folder
if you need to.
