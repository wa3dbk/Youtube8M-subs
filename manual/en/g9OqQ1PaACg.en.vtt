00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.019
Any given week, there’s always plenty of
news that reminds us how messed-up our environment

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.019
is.

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.960
But this week, let’s talk about something
we thought we had started to fix.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.960
Plastic.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.699
You see it everywhere -- it’s all over your
grocery store, and at the Target and the Walmart,

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.619
and also on the roadways, and in the water.

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.670
And this is a problem, because plastic doesn’t
biodegrade.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.850
Biodegradation is nature’s recycling system
- microorganisms eat waste and convert it

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.300
into nutrients that other organisms can use.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.250
For things like dead plant matter, that works
really great.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.380
But microorganisms can’t eat plastic, so
those grocery bags and shampoo bottles that

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.969
you throw away just hang out until they’re
broken down by heat or the sun’s ultraviolet

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:48.969
radiation.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:49.969
And that can take centuries.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.451
That’s why you’ve probably started to
see more things made from biodegradable plastic

00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:57.350
-- it’s your usual, run of the mill plastic
that’s treated with chemical additives that

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.399
allow it to biodegrade faster.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.399
Sounds great right?

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.399
Well.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.120
This week, chemists from Michigan State University
said they tested these biodegradable plastics,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.920
and found that … they don’t work.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.450
The scientists studied the kinds of plastic
that you and I use all the time -- like polyethylene,

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.810
which is used to make grocery bags, and polyethylene
terephthalate, which goes into soda bottles.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.100
The chemists prepared these plastics with
five different additives -- like compounds

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.479
of iron, cobalt and nickel -- that have been
said to speed up the degradation process,

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.979
by breaking the bonds in plastics’ carbon-rich
chains called polymers.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.320
To put these additives to the test, the researchers
put treated samples, along with additive-free

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.900
plastic, in containers that simulated the
different conditions that garbage is usually

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.090
exposed to:

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.729
One was an oxygen-rich environment, like you
find in a compost pile; another was an oxygen-poor

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.939
environment, like a landfill, and the third
was just in regular soil.

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.509
They then measured the daily output of methane
and CO2, which microorganisms release when

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.840
they digest matter.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.810
After six months in compost, a year and a
half in a landfill, and three years in soil,

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.420
the amount of gas released from both kinds
of plastic was the same.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.729
And, under a microscope, both plastics showed
almost no signs of physical degradation.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.979
Interestingly enough, this research was paid
for by companies that use so-called biodegradable

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.590
plastics in their packaging, because they
wanted to see if they were getting what they

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.690
were paying for.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.930
And now, it seems, they know.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.930
Also in environment news, you’ve probably
heard of the Gulf Stream -- that’s the neverending

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.990
current of warm water from the Gulf of Mexico
that helps keep North America’s east coast

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.620
somewhat bearable during the winter, and also
goes on to keep the British Isles nice and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.620
mild.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.440
Well, that Gulf Stream is just one component
of a bigger climate system known to scientists

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.880
as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation,
or AMOC.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.950
It acts like a massive conveyor belt, pumping
warm water from the equator up to the North

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.280
Atlantic and back down again.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.800
And the key to this cycle is the ocean water’s
density.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.400
That might sound kinda weird, but cold water
is denser than warm water, so after warm ocean

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.260
currents run to the North Atlantic and release
their heat, they sink and flow back south

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.260
to warm up again.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.990
So this cycle that’s been shaping our weather
as we know it?

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.610
It’s been acting kind of strange lately.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.540
A team of German scientists reports this week
in Nature Climate Change that the AMOC appears

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.470
to be drastically weakened.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.730
For a while now, it turns out, the North Atlantic
has been cooling.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.230
Which is weird, because the rest of the earth
is getting warm, right?

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.620
But judging by more than a thousand years’
worth of temperature data that these scientists

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.500
mapped out, the AMOC began weakening rapidly
in the 1970s.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.690
Then in 1990, it dipped to its lowest point
in more than a millennium.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.061
It’s rebounded slightly since then, but
it’s still in decline.

00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:25.940
And the researchers think that it’s all
due to the rapid melting of the Greenland

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.940
Ice Sheet.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.410
Greenland’s melting ice is dumping tons
of fresh water into the ocean, which is making

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.270
the salt water less dense.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.980
That less-dense water is less likely to sink
and flow south toward the equator like it

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.140
has been, so it’s interrupting the circulation
that’s been giving us the nice, temperate

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.220
weather that we’re all so familiar with.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.150
So if the ice sheet continues melting, the
scientists say, the cycle will keep weakening

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.380
for at least the next decade or two, and,
things are gonna change.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.870
Exactly how that change is going to happen
is still mostly a matter of guessing.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.100
A previous report by the same scientists in
2009 said that less dense Atlantic waters

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.450
could cause sea level rise in cities like
New York and Boston, while a severely weakened

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.070
cycle could lead to more extreme cold snaps
and snowstorms on both sides of the Atlantic

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.370
... even as the planet’s average temperatures
continue to climb.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.510
At least, they say, the forecast doesn’t
call for us to be drawn into some kind of

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.720
modern-day Ice Age worthy of, like, casting
Jake Gyllenhaal.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.060
But still, I’m pretty happy with the way
things are now.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.810
If the climate could just stop changing, that
would be great.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.140
