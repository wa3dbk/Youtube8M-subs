&gt;&gt; Lana: I arranged for a friend of mine 
 in Europe to take care of Ema.

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:22.862
She's a coroner. I think Ema will be pleased.

00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:27.671
As for me, this affair has pretty much 
 ended my days at the Prosecutor's Office.

00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:30.817
Still, I'll manage to find my way back to the field somehow.

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:36.295
Then I'll be able to Investigate crimes together with Ema.

&gt;&gt; Gumshoe: Yikes! I thought I was a goner 
 for a moment there! In the end though,

00:00:57.104 --> 00:00:59.904
they overlooked my unauthorized investigation of the Chief's office.

00:01:00.534 --> 00:01:04.334
"If we penalized you any more, it'd be worse than firing you!"

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:06.401
Yep. That's what they said.

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:11.095
It just goes to show... You can't shake me off that easily!

&gt;&gt; Meekins: My new mission is to guard the 
 main entrance and take care of Billy!

00:01:38.403 --> 00:01:41.200
Can you believe it!? I've been demoted to a security guard!

00:01:41.695 --> 00:01:45.600
My partner's keeping an eye on the entrance for me today.

00:01:46.292 --> 00:01:49.390
I'll show them, though! Someday I'm going to make detective!

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:54.620
Yes sir! Then I can be just like that Dick Gumshoe!

&gt;&gt; Marshall: What is it? Can't you see I'm havin' 
 me a showdown with a steak lunch, pardner?

00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:52.920
Miss Starr managed to sneak this in to me. 
 She's seeing one of the guards it seems.

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.850
Well, cowboy... It looks like you did it.

00:02:56.274 --> 00:02:58.270
You even gave Bambina back her smile.

00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:02.780
Can you make sure Billy and the gang get their water?

00:03:20.725 --> 00:03:23.720
As a farewell gift, I put a new meal 
 on the menu: The Wright Way Lunch.

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:29.000
The top layer tastes as bitter as defeat, but 
 the bottom layer's as seet as victory.

00:03:29.554 --> 00:03:33.150
Kids seem to dig the turnabout theme, it's a hot seller around exam time!

00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:37.950
Just make sure not to eat it backwards!

&gt;&gt; Judge: I'll never forget what that young defense lawyer said after the trial.

00:03:59.203 --> 00:04:03.200
Let's see, what was his name again? Mr. Left...?

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:07.930
Anyway, he said he's been doing, er, something 
 or other for, uh... how many years...?

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:11.930
Well anyway! I've got another trial to get to, so I'd better be...

00:04:12.473 --> 00:04:17.970
Huh? Oh no! I forgot my gavel! Sorry, gotta go!

00:04:45.055 --> 00:04:48.060
Still, sometimes I do miss hearing Nick and his "objections"...

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.900
Still, I can't go back until I'm a full fledged spirit medium!

00:04:52.362 --> 00:04:55.360

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.920

Well, see you around Nick!

I can't believe I'm going to Europe.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.450
Thank you, Mr. Wright! Thank you so much for everything!!!

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.830
I'm a little sad, but I'll be all right!

00:06:11.513 --> 00:06:17.010
Whenever I want to see Lana, all I 
 have to do is open this book...
