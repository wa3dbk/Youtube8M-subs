00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hi, I'm Paul Brent. I'm an artist who licenses my work, 

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:06.966
and I'm here in my studio tonight. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.578
I have a few products with me that I designed. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.511
Here is the very first product that I ever designed 

00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:19.923
and it’s a series of bookmarks that I 
 designed for Quality Artworks in 1988. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.657
here is another mitt that I designed for Cyprus 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.022
a melamine tray, 

00:00:31.022 --> 00:00:38.731
and here's one of my tote bags for Sun and Sand. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.604
People ask me how I began licensing 

00:00:45.604 --> 00:00:49.904
and I first began my art career when 
 I was selling my art in 

00:00:49.876 --> 00:00:56.657
outdoor art shows and in galleries, and I decided that 

00:00:56.657 --> 00:01:00.279
I would start publishing my art work and I started attending 

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:04.979
the publishing trade shows like Art Expo and 

00:01:04.923 --> 00:01:10.437
the ABC shows at that time - that stood for Art Buyers' Caravan. 

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:17.555
So, at one of those shows, I believe it 
 was one of the Atlanta ABC shows, 

00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:20.898
I was approached by Mr. John Harrison, who 

00:01:20.898 --> 00:01:22.942
is the President of Quality Artworks 

00:01:22.942 --> 00:01:26.854
to design a series of bookmarks for his company. 

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:30.691
I really didn't know what licensing was at that time 

00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:34.830
but he gave me a contract and I 
 had my lawyer look it over, 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.128
and I thought: Well, this is just another 
 way to sell my art work. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.280
From there, I soon heard about the SURTEX show, and thought, 

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:48.670
if I'm going to be in licensing, I really 
 need to go to that show, 

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:59.260
so I went to the show and it was 
 really the second show that SURTEX put on,

00:01:59.258 --> 00:02:04.550
and I found out where I had my 
 strengths and where I had my weaknesses.

00:02:04.552 --> 00:02:08.550
Most artists who were there were selling their work for a flat-fee 

00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:11.190
and that included the copyright. 

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:15.460
I really had to educate people about licensing. 

00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:24.100
I had hired a friend to help me in 
 licensing in the position of Licensing Director 

00:02:24.103 --> 00:02:29.580
and so from there I just progressed one company at a time. 

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:31.950
At the first show, I made contacts with 

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:38.130
an insulated barware company and that turned out 
 to be a very good project, 

00:02:38.128 --> 00:02:44.130
and the other company that I found at the very beginning was 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:48.620
Custom Designs which was a division of Springs Industry, 

00:02:48.623 --> 00:02:53.870
and I went on to design ten different bed linen sets for them. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.720
People do ask me how did my career 
 progress to what it is now, 

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:08.080
and from that point I really found that my 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.210
unique style was desirable to manufacturers and at the next show, 

00:03:18.206 --> 00:03:22.800
I signed a contract actually for a flat-fee to design 

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:27.540
one wallpaper border that was going to be marketed by Seabrook, 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.140
and on the strength of that, the following year, 

00:03:30.141 --> 00:03:34.370
I signed a contract to design an entire book for Seabrook, 

00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:40.190
and I went on to design eight full wallpaper books with Seabrook 

00:03:40.187 --> 00:03:46.580
and that really put me on the map with collections and "repeats"

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.090
that could go in to a lot of other industries. 

00:03:49.088 --> 00:03:53.960
People do ask me how I find time for everything. 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.460
My wife is my business person, and I have a Licensing Director who 

00:04:02.463 --> 00:04:05.340
has been with us for 13 years now, 

00:04:05.342 --> 00:04:10.080
and there are two graphic designers who work with me 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.960
and I have adapted from doing all of the artwork myself,

00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:16.250
painting every single repeat, 

00:04:18.252 --> 00:04:19.830
painting every single element over and over again 

00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:24.150
and putting it in the right place to where I now have

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.210
two graphic designers who work with me who manipulate my work digitally 

00:04:29.212 --> 00:04:32.600
and put it into different formats for all sorts of different products. 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.550
People do ask me what is the major reason for my early success, 

00:04:38.547 --> 00:04:42.680
and I really do believe it’s that I had a unique style. 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.410
I could put things into repeat and there was definitely a need for

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:54.520
for coastal designs in the marketplace, so all of those three things together 

00:04:54.522 --> 00:04:58.980
really made for an early success that I was 
 able to build my career around. 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.370
The categories that I've had the most success at are:

00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:06.220
home, gift and stationery. 

00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:09.940
In the home category the strongest area is the bath. 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.840
I've designed everything for the bath that you can think of, 

00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:19.450
including wallpaper, tile, shower curtains, shower accessories, 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.290
and rugs -

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.330
just about anything that has even gone into the bath, I've designed.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.040
After that, pool and patio is a great category for me. 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.090
Then the bedroom and the kitchen are also strong categories. 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.890
Right now, I'm working with Tara Reed 

00:05:43.888 --> 00:05:46.400
to give information to artists about licensing, 

00:05:46.395 --> 00:05:52.150
and we've had several teleseminars and a branding seminar 

00:05:52.154 --> 00:05:56.470
that are recorded and you can go and listen to these, 

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.460
and you can also join us - free - 

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.720
for our next lively teleseminar which 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.000
is going to happen on May 26th. 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.060
You can find out more information about that by going to

00:06:07.061 --> 00:06:11.100

00:06:11.101 --> 00:06:13.420
 - hope to see you there. Bye.
