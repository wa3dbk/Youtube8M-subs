00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.430
- And so the reason why
we're kind of differentiating

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.310
these two spots on the promoters
because different things

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.130
happen at the TATA box
versus the initiation site.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.700
The TATA box is where some
of the helpers of the RNA

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.880
polymerase bind to.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.470
And the name of those
helper proteins, they're

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.450
called transcription factors.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.680
So that's where, again,
the transcription factors

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.620
bind to that TATA box
of the promoter region.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.340
And it turns out that there
are several different types

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.780
of transcription factors, and
they all bind to that TATA

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.960
box of the promoter.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.350
Again, the purpose of
these transcription factors

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.020
is that they help the star
of this show do their thing.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.320
And when we're talking
about transcription,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.970
remember again that the star
of this show, the enzyme that

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.090
makes it all happen,
is RNA polymerase.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.130
And where it binds to,
it binds to the promoter,

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.680
but specifically it
binds to this initiation

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.610
site of the promoter.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.570
It turns out that in order for
the RNA polymerase to bind,

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.530
it has to be associated with
a protein called the sigma

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.940
factor.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.370
So it turns out that
RNA polymerase will only

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.850
be able to find this initiation
site if there is this sigma

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.610
factor that's bound to it.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.040
If the sigma factor was not
bound to the on RNA polymerase,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.950
the RNA polymerase
would never make its way

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.476
towards the initiation site.

00:01:29.476 --> 00:01:30.850
So again, here is
another protein

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.420
that's helping the RNA
polymerase do its job.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.200
It turns out that RNA
polymerase needs a lot of help

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.330
if you're talking about
if eukaryotic cell.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.070
in order to transcribe a gene.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.550
So there are usually several
transcription factors

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.720
that glom on and make sure
that the RNA polymerase stays

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.590
attached to that
initiation site.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.680
There's other helpers too--
so there's another portion

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.396
of the promoter that's called.

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:01.020
So that's another
transcription factor.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.310
A whole bunch of them are
needed to help RNA polymerase.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.980
But again, it turns
out that there's

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.790
a lot of help that's needed.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.449
So there is another portion
of the promoter that's

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.660
called the regulatory site.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.430
And it's here that another
helper protein binds to.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.150
So there's something
that's called

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.550
a regulatory protein that
binds to the regulatory site.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.280
And again, the job of
this regulatory protein,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.870
like all these
other proteins, is

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.990
that it plays a
role in making sure

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.700
that they are in a
RNA polymerase stays

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.474
bound to the initiation site.

00:02:36.474 --> 00:02:38.890
It turns out that that's not it.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.760
The RNA polymerase and
eukaryotes, at least,

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.590
need even more help.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.370
So if you consider
this region here--

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.290
so there is a region in
front of their promoter,

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.170
a little bit upstream
of the promoter,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.560
called an enhancer region
and a silencer region.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.300
And it turns out that
there are proteins

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.460
that also bind here that help
RNA polymerase do its job.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.700
And so that protein
that binds here that

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.890
helps RNA polymerase that's
called an activator protein,

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.686
that's what A stands for.

00:03:15.686 --> 00:03:17.060
And so again, when
you're talking

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.360
about eukaryotic cells at
least, transcription again,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.510
requires RNA polymerase
but it'll only

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.640
do its job if there is all
of these proteins also bound.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.470
And basically all
these proteins help

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.990
the RNA polymerase do its thing,
which is to go down that gene

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.190
and transcribe it.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.430
And so remember that after it
hits the terminator region,

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.440
that's when it knows
that it's found

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.800
the end of the gene,
that's when it comes off.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.570
And again, what
the RNA polymerase

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.450
does is that it as it
goes down that gene,

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.860
it uses it in order to make.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.730
It reads it in order to make
a messenger RNA molecule.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.510
And the messenger
RNA molecule, again,

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.170
goes to the ribosome to
tell the cell how to make

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.890
a particular type of protein.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.970
So the take home point here
is that in eukaryotic cells,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.960
there are a lot of
proteins that are required

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.909
in order to help RNA polymerase
bind to the promoter region.

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:18.950
So we mentioned that there
is these things called

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.940
transcription factors.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.324
There are these things
called regulatory proteins,

00:04:23.324 --> 00:04:25.490
and there is these things
called activator proteins.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.930
Again, they all help the RNA
polymerase transcribe a gene.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.500
You might be wondering in
this picture here-- so,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.990
check out this activator
protein all the way over here.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.750
You might be wondering
how does a protein that

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.000
binds all the way
over here, how's

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.520
that going to help RNA
polymerase attach way up here?

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.810
And it looks like there
is a big disconnect

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.100
between the activator protein
and the RNA polymerase that

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.200
binds to the promoter.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.000
How does this help
something that

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.990
binds all the way over here?

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.460
Well, it turns out that
DNA, it's kind of flexible,

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.870
so it can bend.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.370
And because of that
bending, that's

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.270
what actually allows the
activator protein to interact

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.660
with the RNA polymerase
and make sure that the RNA

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.090
polymerase stays there.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.840
Here's what we're talking about.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.780
So again, here is
the promoter region,

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.660
here is the RNA polymerase.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.550
We said that there's
all kinds of things

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.040
that help it stay attached,
including something called

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.800
an activator protein,
which is way over here

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.470
on this portion of the DNA.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.950
But what you're seeing here is
that the DNA can actually bend,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.840
and it's because of
that bending, that's

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.480
what allows the activator
protein to actually

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.100
be in the neighborhood of
where the RNA polymerase is.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.800
And again, all of
these proteins here

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.260
basically help
the RNA polymerase

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.082
attach to the promoter
and perform transcription.

00:05:56.082 --> 00:05:57.290
One last thing we'll mention.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.530
So basically, you have
the whole story as far as

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.504
what happens during
transcription.

00:06:03.504 --> 00:06:05.420
So one last thing we'll
mention before then we

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.540
leave transcription and
look at translation is this.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.720
So again, what we've just looked
at is how does a cell read

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.870
a DNA molecule in order to
make a messenger RNA out of it?

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.410
It's this messenger
RNA then that's

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.190
going to go to the ribosome in
order to instruct the cell how

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.320
to make a protein.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.550
It turns out, though,
that in eukaryotic cells,

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.800
things happen to
this messenger RNA

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.980
before it heads over
to the ribosome.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.680
And one of the major things that
happens to this messenger RNA

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.360
is that things are added to it.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.990
So to one end of
the messenger RNA

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.050
is added just a
string of guanines.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.060
And to the other end is
added a string of adenines.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.880
And basically by
adding the string of Gs

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.640
on one end and the string
of As on the other hand,

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.980
it makes it so that
the messenger RNA,

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.200
once it gets to the ribosome,
it can stay attached there.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:09.050
And so these Gs and these
As play a role in helping

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.080
stabilize the interaction
between this messenger RNA

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.500
molecule and the ribosomes
after it gets there.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.000
All right, so again,
the big picture

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.874
is that the messenger
RNA and the eukaryotes,

00:07:18.874 --> 00:07:21.890
after it's been made,
and after it's had the Gs

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.830
and then the As added--

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.830
so the G is just poly G cap.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.060
So poly means many.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.390
So a string of many Gs
are added to one end,

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.390
and a string of many As
are added to the other.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.660
After that happens,
then the messenger RNA

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.250
ends up going to the
ribosome to be translated.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:47.310
And so we'll take a look at how
that translation happens next.
