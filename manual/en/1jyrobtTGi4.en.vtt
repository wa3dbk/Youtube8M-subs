Hey everybody!  This is Randy Santel, "Atlas" with Atlas &amp; Zeus Promotions and FoodChallenges.com

00:00:12.123 --> 00:00:15.287
I'm here going for win #5 here in Florida on my birthday week.

00:00:17.807 --> 00:00:23.950
I'm at Bokamers taking on their Beast Burger Challenge!  This has a beastly bun as you can see!

00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:33.544
Massive sourdough loaf.  It's also got a 2lb patty of beef, bacon, 4 eggs, surrounded by fries.

00:00:33.544 --> 00:00:39.607
The fries are optional, so we'll see how I do with all this burger and bread.  Then there are pickles too!

00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:50.191
Looks delicious!  I've got an hour to defeat the challenge.  It's about $40 if I lose but if I win I'll get the meal free

00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:53.284
and my name on their plaque.  Very few people have won, so lets get this started!

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.226
Alright I have to catch my flight home so lets get this down!  One, two, three!

00:02:07.735 --> 00:02:11.405
Just over five minutes in - Burger is cooked perfectly!

00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:17.374
I asked for it rare to medium-rare.  Very good!  It's nice and juicy which will help this bottom bun go down

00:02:17.374 --> 00:02:23.418
I think there were five eggs on it, but they were cooked good.  Nice and runny, which is helping the burgers go down

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.724
so lets get the rest finished!

00:03:03.501 --> 00:03:08.926
Less than 8 minutes in - Burgers down! I'm going to get the pickles and the bun down!

00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:11.118
Fries are optional, so I'm going to do those last.

00:03:14.146 --> 00:03:18.374
Okay, so it was 3 lbs of meat, not 2.  3lbs of meat down in 8 minutes.

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.779
Alright, 15 minutes in.  We got this top bun to finish.

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:57.535
I know you all are probably wondering why I'm not dunking.

00:03:57.535 --> 00:04:01.744
You'll never see me dunking in a challenge unless I have to in order to beat the time limit.

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:07.607
I eat because I enjoy the food.  Once it's dunked into anything it becomes nasty.

00:04:09.163 --> 00:04:13.631
Nobody wants to watch somebody dunk either!  Lets get this bun down!

00:04:59.503 --> 00:05:01.019
Last bit of the burger!

00:05:17.353 --> 00:05:24.334
24:38 - Very good burger!  I still got six minutes until I really have to leave.

00:05:25.028 --> 00:05:26.942
 I didn't come all the way to Miami to leave food, so lets get these fries down!
