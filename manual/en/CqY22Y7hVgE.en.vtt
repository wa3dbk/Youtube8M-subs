00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.020
Hi everybody, today I'm going to show you how to make some emergency kimchi.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.800
If more than one week I travel I always bring some Korean ingredients.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.320
It's hot pepper flakes and fish sauce.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.900
And the rest of the ingredients you can find anywhere.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.000
I went to the market near here today

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.080
and there I found this usual, like a regular cabbage instead of Napa cabbage

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.740
so I'm going to show you how to make emergency kimchi

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.740
Okay, let's start!

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.740
I'm going to make a very little amount.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.500
Wow, it sounds like a watermelon split, doesn't it?

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.280
Wow, inside I am so satisfied. Delicious looking.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.600
It's crispy and a lot of juice.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.300
I'll just make this amount only.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.520
Cut it just in thin pieces.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.880
I'm going to put it in the large pot.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.960
(Chopping noises)

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.440
Around 1 cup of water you add to this.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.000
Some salt

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.400
Just mix it like this.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.120
If you saw my two kimchi recipes,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.540
you probably saw that I made kimchi porridge.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.900
But for this episode I'm going to skip this because...

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.200
Emergency!

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.200
Okay, let's make kimchi paste.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.220
Hot pepper flakes I brought from New York

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.800
one third cup

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.800
Sugar,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.800
around one tablespoon

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.280
This guy is very important for me to make kimchi

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.420
You know this is, like color is this, what do you think it is?

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.920
It is fish sauce!

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.500
And garlic,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.700
around a quarter cup.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.780
Looks delicious.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.240
(Chopping noises)

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.760
And mix this.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.320
Wow, smells so good.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.040
This cabbage used to be like this.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.320
Only ten minutes later this amount has really decreased,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.280
like this.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.740
So I'm going to rinse this

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.040
Okay, drain this well.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.640
and, we are going to mix this.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.260
That's all, kimchi making!

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.940
I don't have a really big bowl here,

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.820
so, I'm going to...

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.160
Like this.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.900
Press it down.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.060
Our emergency kimchi is done.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.060
So you can make kimchi even though you don't have Napa cabbage,

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.880
so you can use regular cabbage.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.880
'K, let me taste it.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.880
My emergency kimchi.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.420
You can start eating from just now.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.200
Then, I brought these roasted sesame seeds.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.220
Let me taste it.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.620
Mmm.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.980
Good!

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.780
Very good.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.280
Okay, see you next time! Bye bye~!
