00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:11.740
Once Saved Always Saved is a LIE that people
like to believe because it gives them FALSE

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:21.310
SECURITY. Many people say a SINNERS PRAYER
and they promise Jesus that they will follow

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:29.750
and obey Him for the rest of their lives and
then they believe they are saved but they

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.610
never follow Him and they never obey Him,
they turn away from Him, because they believe

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:44.610
that they are saved.
Nobody is SAVED until the very end. Jesus

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:53.740
said:”he who endures until the END will
be saved.” If we keep on following Jesus

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:04.140
and we keep on obeying Him until the very
end of our lives then we will be saved. Someone

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:12.740
asked Jesus whether those who are BEING SAVED
are FEW and He said:”Strive HARD to enter

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:23.630
the narrow door because many, I tell you,
will try and not be able.” Very few people

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.380
will endure until the end. Very few people
will follow Jesus Christ. We have to follow

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.360
Jesus UNTIL THE END.
Jesus said that whoever puts his hand to the

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:46.720
plow and looks back is not worthy of Him.
If we start following Jesus and we long to

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:57.080
go back to our previous life of self-satisfaction,
of self-service and sin, if we love the things

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.799
of the world , then we are not worthy of Jesus
and we will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven.

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:13.059
There is not such thing as ONCE SAVED ALWAYS
SAVED. That is a LIE! Many people make marriage

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:21.860
vows and they say:”Until death do us part.”
But very few of those people nowadays stay

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:34.290
together until the end. If we do not follow
Jesus and stay with Him until the end then

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:44.330
we will not be with Him for eternity.
Our salvation depends on our relationship

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:55.740
with Jesus. The day we meet Him that relationship
starts and the quality of that relationship

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:04.540
will determine whether we will be with Him
for eternity. If we have not come to know

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.540
Jesus INTIMATELY because we have not CLOSELY
FOLLOWED Him then He will say to us:”Go

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:25.980
away I never KNEW you, you worker of wickedness.”
We can only KNOW Jesus when we WALK WITH HIM

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.530
every day and STAY WITH HIM UNTIL THE VERY
END.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:42.900
Jesus will never leave us nor will He forsake
us because He is FAITHFUL but if we leave

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:53.060
Him, if we deny Him and turn away from Him
He will not hold us back, He will let us go

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:01.200
but when we come to the end of our lives and
we stand before Him He will say to us:”Go

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:12.640
away I never knew you, you worker of wickedness.”
We have to ENDURE and STAY WITH Jesus until

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.449
the very end.
When we stand before His judgment throne the

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:26.580
books will be opened and we will be judged
by what is written inside of those books.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.580
What will OUR BOOK look like? What will our
book say about our relationship with Jesus?

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:49.159
Will our works testify of our relationship
with Jesus, our love for Him and our OBEDIENCE

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:56.879
to Him, because we have ENDURED with Him until
the very end?

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.250
May Jesus bless you.
