She is just a wonderful employee of Crowley Webb

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.279
Just a magnificent
employee

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.899
Her exact title I'm unsure of

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.160
He's not an account supervisor. He's an account person.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.620
This Isn't good.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.720
I don't really know what she does

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.500
I know she puts in really long hours and she works really hard

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.239
and she loves Crowley Webb

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.080
Mary Kate is an Analysts, but I couldn't tell you what that is actually

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.960
Other than doing things numbers I guess.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.520
When I first heard that she was employed here, you know

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.830
I heard ad agency. And so naturally I assumed she would show up at work

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.460
In a tight fitting dress, wearing a grey fedora

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.320
And you know, chain smoking and drinking bourbon all day.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.180
And I understand thats not what she does.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.650
I don't know but that looks Russian.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.280
See my kayak

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.740
I'm sorry I can't even think of anything.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.360
All I can think is Cindy Meckler, you know.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.680
Creative marketing youth knowledge.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.020
I don't...Oh my gosh

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.470
Crowley men your ketchup.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.720
Print option?

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.680
Personally obnoxious

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.740
I have no idea. Once again, where did you come up with these?

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.020
These are crazy.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.850
The only thing I can think of is pissed off.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.700
P.O. I don't know what that is.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.700
Post Office

00:01:59.856 --> 00:02:02.976
Post Office activities

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.140
Post Office, meaning, Post Office

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.900
Meaning you guys go out after parties. After hour parties

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.120
Something with fonts.

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.129
Fast pronto on time.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.640
Father is positive

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.030
Free people offering

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.740
I don't know.

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.839
You guys Im really doing bad at this. I have no idea.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.040
First print option. Going with the theme from the other one.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.299
friends people obviously

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.859
I can take some ideas on FPO.

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.019
No I can't on screen.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.080
Did anyone know any of those?

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.620
Mom is mother

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.880
Thats me. Thats me.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.420
Me

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.500
Well that would be me.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.220
I'd have to say mom thats me.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.980
Mom. Me.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.500
The most important person in your
life

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.960
Mom.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:21.360
Mom yeah. She loves me. She absolutely is devoted to me.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.540
I can certainly speak to that. Its a joy and a pleasure to be a mom
