Eric: What is going on internet, it is your
boy Eric Bandholz back again getting my hair

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.110
did.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.910
Sebastian, what do you think I should do?

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.370
Sebastian: Well we've done your hair before,
you're a loyal client of mine.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.240
We keep about the same concept.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.820
Last time Eric wanted to keep some length
here in the back.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:33.550
He wanted to do some sort of offset Eurotrash
Mullet is what we like to refer to it as.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:49.210
So we keep some length in the 
back of him, we're going to fade up the sides

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:59.030
right here and do a little kind of horseshoe
pattern on the sides and shave all that nice

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.390
and tight.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:13.299
Fade it up into some length and we're going
to keep 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:42.369
a nice disconnected line here at the ridge
of the ridge of his head, the recession points

00:01:42.369 --> 00:02:11.890
and we're going to keep the length on top

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:24.709
so he can comb his hair back, he can comb
his hair up, he can comb his hair to the side,

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.860
he can wear it however he wants.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:41.579
And I think a lot of things men look for in
style is just for their haircut to be versatile.

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:56.220
They want to be able to do several things
with one haircut rather than be tied down

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.499
to just one look.

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:31.830
So Eric can do a lot with 
this one haircut and I think that's why he

00:03:31.830 --> 00:04:09.349
wants to keep it like this for who knows how
long.
