00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.940
&nbsp;        Music.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:15.950
&nbsp;        On Dec. 14, 2009, A United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket carried NASA's Wide-field     
    Infrared Survey Explorer,

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.830
&nbsp;        or WISE, space telescope into a high polar orbit.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.210
&nbsp;        WISE lifted off from Space Launch     
    Complex-2 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.990
&nbsp;        beginning its 10-month mission to map the entire sky in the infrared.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:37.150
&nbsp;        Preparations for launch started earlier in the year when WISE's builder, Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp., in Boulder, Co.,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.090
&nbsp;        shipped the spacecraft to the Astrotech payload processing facility at Vandenberg.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.010
&nbsp;        During the months of August, September and October the spacecraft was uncanned,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.460
&nbsp;        uncovered and moved to a clean room for testing, weighing and balancing.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.840
&nbsp;        Meanwhile, at Space Launch Complex-2, build-up of the Delta II began on Oct. 19 with the hoisting of the first stage onto

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.240
&nbsp;        the launcher platform, shortly followed by the interstage section.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.980
&nbsp;        Once the first and interstage sections were secured, workers attached the three solid rocket

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.350
&nbsp;        boosters around the base and then lifted the second stage section into position.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.700
&nbsp;        By the end of October, the rocket was complete and testing began on its Tracking and Data Relay Satellite transmitter.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.570
&nbsp;        A demanding workload followed in     
    November as technicians tested the rocket's propellant and guidance control systems,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.920
&nbsp;        in addition to performing first stage leak checks.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.030
&nbsp;        At Astrotech, work continued with loading of     
    the cryogenic hydrogen that will keep the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.740
&nbsp;        spacecraft's infrared telescope super-cold during its months of observations.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:49.930
&nbsp;        After one final week of testing, technicians gingerly lowered a transportation canister over WISE for its move to the launch pad.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.130
&nbsp;        Then, the 1,460-pound spacecraft was lifted atop the Delta II rocket.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.530
&nbsp;        By the end of the month, an integrated     
    electrical test was conducted to ensure the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.430
&nbsp;        two crafts communicated with each other and with mission control.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.280
&nbsp;        In a clean room environment, the spacecraft was carefully encased in its protective shell, called a fairing.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.080
&nbsp;        The two-part fairing protects the spacecraft during the harsh environment of liftoff, and fell away once it reached orbit.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.590
&nbsp;        Technicians at the launch pad continued mechanical, electrical and avionics system checkouts of the rocket,

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.730
&nbsp;        while cooling of the spacecraft's cryogenic systems continued until liftoff.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.790
&nbsp;        With a successful launch accomplished, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer soon will begin scanning

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:41.330
&nbsp;        the entire sky to uncover hidden cosmic objects, dark asteroids and the most luminous galaxies.
