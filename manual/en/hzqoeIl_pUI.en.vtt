00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.960
Hi, I'm

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.480
William Moss and today I'm at Hatcher Garden and Woodland preserve and we're

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.740
talking about containers. Containers are a great thing for small space

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.770
gardens. They work just about anywhere. No yard? No problem! Even if you 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.269
happen to be in a city or let's say you have an apartment with just a little deck or 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.920
balcony, 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.099
you can still grow beautiful plants in containers. You want to make sure you start

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.919
with a good container and don't use dirt. 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.979
You need to use a nice potting soil. 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:35.240
And also, when you fill the pot up, you never want to go all the way to the top. You

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.860
want to make sure that you keep it

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.690
at about 3-4 inches of height to use for that. You want to make sure you still have some 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.170
space to work with. Now when you are putting your containers together, 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.700
you want to choose plants that 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.480
not only look good in flower, but also look good in foliage. 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.580
You see we have a great collection to choose from up here and I haven't decided what

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.540
this container is going to look like yet, so

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.570
we'll experiment around - maybe a couple of
these in the back, some trailers, 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.310
put a couple of those up here

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:09.360
just to kind of show. Basically, here's what your trying to do - meat, vegetable, starch. 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.079
So basically, the meat is like the focal point of

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.430
what you're trying to do.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.710
And then the vegetable would be the filler, the plant that kind of covers up a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.200
lot of space. And then finally, you would have the starch - the potato or whatever

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.950
will be on the side to kind of hang over the side. In this pot we've got our

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.150
meat, or our focal point, is going to be a bell pepper plant. It's going to come up

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.680
and grow and be the focal point. It will be the tallest plant in here. And then on the side we've got

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.219
two fountain grasses - which are going to fill this container up and

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.009
really give it a nice appearance. And then finally we have this Coleus that's going to

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.869
weep over the sides a bit. To get my stamp of approval, that's what you have to have

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.670
for your containers. Because I've chosen this

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.840
plant for foliage

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.920
it's going to look good now, all of through
summer, and up to frost and that's what we're

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.030
to do back here. 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.019
So we've got a couple of plants that are going to fill the space

00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:02.779
and now we've got some trailer plants. Now we need some sort of focal

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:05.200
point in the middle here and I love to add

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.189
edibles to pots, so

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.629
maybe we'll choose a tomato

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.730
to place in the center. 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.069
I changed my mind. I don't want to use this. Something you can do when your

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.969
planting, especially in the summertime because you have so many choices. You can

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:27.059
change your mind and move things around. I want something with a little bit more

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:29.539
"zazz" to it, so maybe have

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:32.079
this as our

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:37.889
focal points - Ismene - and we'll add some Pentas, not only for color

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:40.239
but for butterflies. 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.110
Butterflies just love this plant. And then maybe we'll use a

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.630
different trailer. Something, maybe something edible. 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.459
We'll plant this squash

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.929
right there on the side.

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:59.019
And I've got a little bit more space  in the back here so I've got enough space for a chili pepper,

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.689
not quite for a bell, but I'll

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.809
tuck this chili pepper in on the side here so it's going to fit in with the 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:08.839
Pintas. So we still have our three elements - the center piece, the focal point, the

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:12.010
spreaders and that we have the trailer coming out the sides. And you can even 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.379
see we have some squash already. Once again, if you're going to take the time to plant a 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.170
container, add something edible to it because it just makes it more useful for you.  

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.129
Now let's go ahead and plant them up. 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.889
We're going to start with the Ismene, pop this guy out. 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.979
I'm going to make a little hole, you don't want to go too deep because I want to make sure

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:34.159
that the plant gets everything that it needs and isn't covered up. We'll bust 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.330
the roots up as we're putting them in.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.079
We just don't want the roots to grow in a circle. Next we'll do the Pentas,

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.430
add in the 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.269
chili pepper.

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:57.269
Now the squash has to be the most delicate process of all. We want to just to sit it down. 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.959
I managed to do that without knocking off the squash! Alright and so it's planted,

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.409
but not completely done - I still have to fill in with soil. Whenever I'm growing herbs

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:08.999
or vegetables, I try to keep everything, if I can, organic. 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:10.670
That way I know that it

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.339
has the most nutrients, most vitamins,

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:17.359
and the fewest toxins. Planted! Let me

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.889
tap it down.

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.179
And now look at that! Now you can imagine this 

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:27.729
in about a month under this hot, summer sun, you're going to have flowers all around this. 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.199
The color of the stems of the Ismene 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.810
picks up on the colors of the Pintas.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.419
And then you're going to have this yellow from the squash,

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.760
picking up on the variegation in the Ismene, And finally your going to have the chili peppers

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.810
in the back for people like me who like it spicy

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:43.919
and good.

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:44.850
Alright, so this one is done!
