[car honking]

00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:34.161
Are you Canadians?

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:35.943
Yeah we're both Canadian

00:00:35.943 --> 00:00:36.903
Oh you miss things, yeah

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:37.860
What do you miss?

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.640
The Habs

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.620
[laughter]

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.129
Are you going back for the holidays?

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.560
We just couldn't budget it

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.720
My Mom is really sad that I'm here

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.475
It will be hard because it will just the four of us

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:48.655
and we're used to about 25 people so

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.660
my son is very sad that we're not going home

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.020
[bell ringing]

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.520
[bell rings again]

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.559
We have an announcement

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.300
Because we are in the holiday season,

00:01:06.403 --> 00:01:08.403
I'd like to take this occasion 

00:01:08.724 --> 00:01:11.764
to offer everybody here present this evening

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.060
a round.

00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:16.866
[crowd cheers]

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.720
But there's more to the story...

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.880
when we say "a round"

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.180
we mean round trip tickets for everyone

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.900
to go back to Canada for the holiday season!

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:57.660
[crowd cheering]

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.760
My husband's sister is pregnant,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.860
so we're going to get to see her!

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.640
 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.040
We're thinking about it [laughs]

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.480
we will go home now!

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.840
Who will you go see?

00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:23.225
My sister! 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.420
Thank you

00:02:27.456 --> 00:02:49.336
[Crowd singing Oh Canada]

00:02:50.013 --> 00:02:54.373
[Crowd cheering]

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.320
