00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.988
(soft electronic music)

00:00:03.988 --> 00:00:06.153
- So, as I discussed in the introduction,

00:00:06.153 --> 00:00:08.315
we're now gonna be talking
about dermal filler

00:00:08.315 --> 00:00:12.453
and it's replacing the areas
of lost volume in the face.

00:00:12.453 --> 00:00:16.609
So, the areas we're going
to be looking at treating

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.930
are along the tear trough.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.438
That's this little line
that tends to form here

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:24.167
when we start to lose volume in this area.

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:26.454
In the cheek area.

00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:29.420
Actually, underneath the brow bone

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.754
we start to get a little
bit hollow in there.

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:34.076
It can tend to make the eye
look a little bit sunken in.

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:36.492
It can tend to be a little bit aging.

00:00:36.492 --> 00:00:38.659
So, we can treat in that area and it tends

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.368
to give a more youthful look.

00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:43.613
The nasolabial area,

00:00:43.613 --> 00:00:46.455
and we can pop a little
bit of filler down here

00:00:46.455 --> 00:00:48.255
along this line.

00:00:48.255 --> 00:00:51.064
We can also treat in
the area of the temples.

00:00:51.064 --> 00:00:53.372
That's another area
that tends to hollow out

00:00:53.372 --> 00:00:54.892
a little as we age.

00:00:54.892 --> 00:00:57.998
And also this area here
in the lower cheeks.

00:00:57.998 --> 00:01:00.707
We can pop a little bit in the nasolabial,

00:01:00.707 --> 00:01:03.078
so I don't like to do
too much in that area

00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:05.259
because it can change
the natural contouring

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.275
in particularly when you smile.

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:09.273
If there's too much filler
in that area it can look

00:01:09.273 --> 00:01:10.921
a little bit unusual.

00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:13.072
So, we go very light in that area,

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:16.170
and a little bit here in
the corner of the mouth.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.112
We're gonna do a little
bit of filler in the lips

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:20.694
just to give a bit more volume.

00:01:20.694 --> 00:01:23.604
As we age, the lips also
tend to lose their volume

00:01:23.604 --> 00:01:25.472
and tend to fold in a little bit.

00:01:25.472 --> 00:01:28.426
We're not wanting to
produce really large lips.

00:01:28.426 --> 00:01:30.762
That's not gonna be a
natural look for Avon,

00:01:30.762 --> 00:01:32.412
but we're just wanting
to replace a little bit

00:01:32.412 --> 00:01:34.412
of the volume that's lost.

00:01:34.412 --> 00:01:36.792
Avon, I'm actually gonna
start injecting now.

00:01:36.792 --> 00:01:39.042
It's going to feel unusual.

00:01:40.274 --> 00:01:44.007
You can often feel like a
pulling and a tugging feeling.

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:46.525
Every now and then you
get like a sharp twinge

00:01:46.525 --> 00:01:48.192
but it's very short.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.717
And the main thing is just to try

00:01:50.717 --> 00:01:53.296
and stay really relaxed and just stay

00:01:53.296 --> 00:01:55.168
really still while I'm treating.

00:01:55.168 --> 00:01:57.378
Some bits will feel
almost like it's kind of

00:01:57.378 --> 00:01:58.823
along your bone,

00:01:58.823 --> 00:02:00.060
but I'm not going down to the bone,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.572
it just has that sensation, okay?

00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:04.432
If it's too uncomfortable I want you to

00:02:04.432 --> 00:02:07.599
hold your hand out and say stop, okay?

00:02:32.604 --> 00:02:34.685
So, now we've finished
with the dermal filler

00:02:34.685 --> 00:02:37.770
and we've actually placed dermal filler

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.004
subtly along the cheeks, tear troughs,

00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:42.569
underneath the cheeks,

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.461
around the temple area,

00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:46.403
under the eyes,

00:02:46.403 --> 00:02:49.982
a little along the marionettes area

00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:51.729
and even along the jawline,

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:53.091
and some in the lips.

00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:56.769
As you can see, it's all a very subtle

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.442
positioning of the filler.

00:02:58.442 --> 00:03:00.794
Nothing is standing out as too dramatic

00:03:00.794 --> 00:03:04.524
but it's a really nice
overall refreshing look.

00:03:04.524 --> 00:03:07.592
As you can see, with dermal
fillers it's an instant result.

00:03:07.592 --> 00:03:09.933
You actually see the
final results stray away,

00:03:09.933 --> 00:03:12.224
so it's incredible satisfying.

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:13.631
Over the next few days

00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:15.414
there may be a little bit of swelling.

00:03:15.414 --> 00:03:17.261
The dermal fillers can actually absorb

00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:19.190
a little bit of water and bit of fluid,

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.165
so you can have some areas
of puffiness and lumpiness,

00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:25.922
but that will settle down
and it actually starts

00:03:25.922 --> 00:03:28.534
to integrate through the tissues

00:03:28.534 --> 00:03:30.054
over the next week or so,

00:03:30.054 --> 00:03:32.298
and it has a very natural look.

00:03:32.298 --> 00:03:34.750
Obviously with Avon's
treatment we've treated

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.569
several different areas of the face.

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.468
We've done a full facial treatment,

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:40.619
used a fair amount of filler

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.170
but we've achieved a
beautiful subtle result.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.455
You don't always need to
do everything all at once.

00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:49.711
We can certainly tailor
your treatment plan

00:03:49.711 --> 00:03:52.901
to suit your individual needs.
