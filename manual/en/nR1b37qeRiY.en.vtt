00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.160
(wind)

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.000
(swoosh................thump)

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:06.880
Cal: Hup

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:13.480
(sounds of ball play)

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.880
Ip!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.760
(Boink!)

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.400
(Tonk!)

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.800
(Whoosh!)

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.200
Chalchiutlicue!

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.000
Time!

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.000
You are suppose to be helping me with this.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.000
Uch! I've sang all the songs in Tlaloc's notes.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.400
(ringing)

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:44.240
Sings: Cry, I made you cry.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.600
Cry! (sploosh)

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.000
No matter which one I do it just screws with water in the area.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.560
Why would there be four songs if it can only do one thing?

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.080
Now come study Tlaloc's notes!

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.000
You do that stuff though.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.160
YOU found it! YOU made the thing work!
YOU must be the one to figure it out!

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.480
If I'm supposed to figure it out,
won't I figure it out by being me and not being you?

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.000
I... suppose.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.520
More stick ball!

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.840
Will you listen to me for once!

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.160
Think about what could have happened to Kajortoq
the other night if Paula hadn't...ah!...ah!...(sneeze)....

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.200
What day is it?

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.160
Miquiztli

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.160
Sneeze on Miquiztli.....that means danger!

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.720
Is that really...

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.840
Are we going on an adventure today?

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.200
Icky: That cloud... looks ominous...

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.520
Oh! That's Hatfield....

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.920
We gotta go! Come on!

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.800
(music)

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.360
Plague?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.920
No.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.560
Death?

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.200
No.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.480
Black Tez-ca-poky?...Zombies?....Amaroq?

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.240
Zombie Amaroq!

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.280
Huehuecoyotl, it's Hatfield. If anything's wrong, it's McCoy.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.760
(Huey gasps!)

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.160
Harvest week!

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.720
Huey: I forgot it's harvest week! Woo-Hoo!

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.400
(music and crowd noises)

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.080
Calamity: Oh, what mayhem has been wrought this day.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.880
She'll come around.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.560
Hatfield's Chief: Huey!...

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.040
I'm so happy you're here.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.120
Chief: Look how well we've done.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.840
Everyone has worked so hard, and it's really paid off!

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.680
What smells like bad eggs?

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.560
It's coming from that barn.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.560
Oh...that's new. We smelt in there.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.600
Normally we go to Hollow for our larger tools,...

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.720
...but since the road is so dangerous with McCoy around,
we need to start making our own farm equipment.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.880
Ma'am, the reason we're here is because we believe
Hatfield is in danger.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.200
Really! Is it immediate?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.840
Well, I don't know. I received a rather ominous premonition...

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.160
A sneeze and a cloud!

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.880
And we thought that we should warn you to be on...uh...the lookout.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.520
McCoy might be up to something!

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.120
Oh, that's our darling Huey. He's so helpful.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.760
It's very nice of you all to look out for us.
I insist that you stay for supper.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.600
Chief: So,...these signs...do you see them often?

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.520
Yes,... I suppose.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.280
I think that is a wonderful talent!

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.080
I would be gratified to pick your brain.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.200
Vinkle: Excuse us!

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.120
He does mean well, you know.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
Well yeah, that's why we're here. Isn't it?

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.360
You...believe him? I thought you didn't.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.400
Kind of. I don't think McCoy's attacking Hatfield,...

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.000
...but we should probably do something about this barn
full of chupacabra.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.640
Vinkle: What?

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.760
(rattling hisses)

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.760
Calamity: Oy, Chief!

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.200
Chalchiutlicue, these people might be attacked. This is hardly the...

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.320
Icky. No one is attacking Hatfield. Hatfield is attacking McCoy.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.680
Mind telling us why you have a barn full of chupacabra?

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.240
McCoy is a ranching town. Chupacabra eat livestock!

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.720
Can't help but think that's why they're there.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.680
Well, they deserve it!

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.200
They stole our food!

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.480
And it's not just for us. We provide the agriculture for many other villages!

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.320
Icky: I think you'll find, ma'am...

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.240
...that your food is delivered on wagons
pulled by McCoy's Jackalopes.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.840
You aren't justified!

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.520
And I'm afraid we can't let you do this.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.040
We are finally on the same page!

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.040
Vinkle: Where's Huey?

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.120
Ah...Come on!

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:09.880
(hissing...dramatic music....hissed growls!)

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.000
Huey!

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.040
Huey: Heeuh, heeaaah.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.120
Calamity: Hooah! Eeaaah!

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.000
Icky!

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.440
Icky: Chalchiutlicue! I'll get it to you!

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.640
NO! You use it! Sing one of the songs!

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.400
I'm not meant to...

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.440
Calamity: JUST DO IT!

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.160
(Fork rings!)

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:51.880
Icky sings: Cry!...............I made you cry!

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.320
(metallic buzzing sound)

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:03.000
Thunder clap............fire crackling)

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.200
Icky!.......Icky!

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.320
(Fork rings!)

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:23.120
Calamity: Cry!..........I made you cry!

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:32.480
(Falling rain)

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.640
What was the plan there, Huey?

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.840
I don't want my village to be as bad as McCoy!

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.880
Sooo,... no plan then.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.120
Hatfield Chief: What happens when McCoy attacks us again?

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:54.600
(flute music)

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.840
Ah, we'll beat 'em off like we always do.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.840
(knocking)

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.840
Oy, Corn!

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.520
We got holes in us, Corn

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.560
Calamity: I know your home.
