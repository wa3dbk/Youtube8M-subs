Students:
Welcome to Bridgeport, Washington!

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.300
Tamra Jackson:
Bridgeport High School
is a very unique

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.800
high school for our
students to attend.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.166
It's very rural.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.934
Our population is 90% Hispanic.

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:39.166
Our students come from poverty.

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.200
The parents do what they can to
support these kids and here at

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.834
school we try to fill that gap
with the rest of the support.

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:48.000
Xenia Valdovinos:
As a senior at
Bridgeport High School, I've

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.467
have really been privileged
because the teachers really help

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:50.633
me out a lot.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:54.133
I speak Spanish at home but
English at school and they

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:57.233
understand that and they really
support me in whatever I want to

00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:02.967
do and at whatever I do.

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:04.233
Jeff Jackson:
The students at Bridgeport High

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:06.533
School, they are generally first
generation Latino students who

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.533
basically are going to be
the first in their family to

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.767
graduate from high school,
let alone go on to college.

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:15.333
Baltazar Munoz:
Teachers make a difference
in my life just by

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:18.233
being there, supporting me,
giving me confidence and to help

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:19.600
me out with the homework.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.967
But they also challenge
me to do better!

Mr. Telly is really there
for me and he has

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.900
taught me lifelong lessons that
will follow me through college.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.400
Norma Camacho:
Mr. Jackson
is very inspirational.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.300
He has gone through the same
struggles that I'm currently

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.700
going through and
he surpassed them.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.967

me lifelong lessons in

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:41.700

Mr. Jackson has pushed
me since I was a

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:49.633
freshman and he is still pushing
to take greater risk courses.

As a senior graduating
from Bridgeport High

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.000
School, having the opportunity
to take both AP and college

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.867

committed to our education and

00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:15.600
