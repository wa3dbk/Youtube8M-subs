00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.320
&gt;&gt; Larry Grobel: In the year 2020, you'll
be seventy years old.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.300
&gt;&gt; Robin Williams: Oh, my god.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.340
&gt;&gt; Larry Grobel: Now what will the world be
like, then?

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.160
&gt;&gt; Robin Williams: It'll be one giant film
corporation. There'll be no longer any government.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.160
It will be one nation, under God, indivisible,
with circuits and VCRs for everyone.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.840
I don’t know. 2020. There'll be cold fusion.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.840
We'll actually be able to power our cars with
our own feces. That's right.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.540
The emissions problem will be a little intense,
but just light a match.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.900
&gt;&gt; [Music]

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.720
&gt;&gt; Robin Williams: Things that I see in the
future. I see...

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.611
it could be quite incredible if we can master
a few problems,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.850
like the air and the water thing might be
nice.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.219
I see governments dissolving. These barriers
are all falling down for economic reasons.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.109
They're all so interbound. That's why when
one market crashes

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.409
it's almost like a world stock market. And
this a very long economic explanation...

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.529
something I haven't got a fucking clue about.

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:11.720
&gt;&gt; [Music]

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.359
&gt;&gt; Larry Grobel: Do you think that there's
a role of the artist in society?

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:16.960
&gt;&gt; Robin Williams: Yeah. For a comic especially,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.700
to constantly never let it take itself seriously,
to play with, to fuck with the parameters.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.399
The premise that comedy is there to basically
show us we fart, we laugh.

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.549
To make us realize we still are part animal.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.189
As intellectual as we think we are, you still
trip, we still have human foibles,

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.320
sexuality, all the different things to still
make you aware of your humanity.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.640
That's what we're supposed to do. It's just
to keep us awake,

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.940
cut through the shit, peel off the mask and
go, "Oh, you got a big nose."

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.620
Or put on the big nose and make you realize,
"Wait a minute, I don't have a big nose."

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.580
All that stuff. So you don't take yourself
seriously and destroy the species.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.700
&gt;&gt; [Music]

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.160
&gt;&gt; Larry Grobel: Do you ever worry about running
out of material or ideas?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.240
&gt;&gt; Robin Williams: No, there's a world out
there. Open a window, and it's there.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.000
&gt;&gt; [Music]

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.160
&gt;&gt; Robin Williams: Sex… if you view sex
and just go, “you look pretty ridiculous.”

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.600
Even the face. The face you make when you
have an orgasm, is pretty much… no one looks...

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.560
Probably even Warren Beatty, gets that kind of [shouts].

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.400
Everyone looks pretty fucking stupid.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.700
[Makes noises]

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.100
You get like the wind tunnel face [makes noises].

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.020
Baby, baby, baby, baby. Oh, baby, baby, baby,
baby. Baby, baby, baby.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.670
Everything kind of goes [noise]. It's nature
going, "You look like an animal."

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.020
It's that one thing you got to know. You look
a little silly.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.260
I don't care what type of lighting you use

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.640
you still sometimes look like a poodle and
someone's going to get a fire hose.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.240
These are the things you wonder.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.200
&gt;&gt; [Music]

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.860
&gt;&gt; Larry Grobel: Let me ask you about birth as a topic.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.120
You did do the birth of all 3 of your children?

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.060
&gt;&gt; Robin Williams: I just remember it was
like a magic act.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.300
All of a sudden they put this little tent
and next thing I heard this [sound] and then...

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.240
They don't scream the first few seconds,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:18.920
they just kind of go, “Eh! Wait! It's cold!
It's very cold!”

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.260
Then they wash them off and they suture them
and they put those little yarmulke on.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.100
The little teamster cap. The little longshoreman cap.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.060
"Yo, Dad! Yo! Excuse me! You want me to unload
this ship?"

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.720
Then they handed her to me.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.080
&gt;&gt; Larry Grobel: I don't think I asked you
any about your faults,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.020
if you have any and what they are.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.120
&gt;&gt; Robin Williams: In comedy, not pursuing
things.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.700
Committing to an idea and taking it to its
fullest extent

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.630
because it started when I first started performing,
it was all jumping around.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.860
Explore an idea until you've exhausted it,
really go to all the different parameters of it.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.180
I think another one is not working so much.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.560
This is very interesting, "look at what's
bad about you."

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.420
&gt;&gt; Larry Grobel: What's bad, yeah.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.880
&gt;&gt; Robin Williams: Look in the mirror, and
go, "nostril hair. The fact that I braid them."

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.960
I don't know.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.980
Sometimes, keeping track of people.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.680
It's always a weird combination of worrying
so much about the outside world, and not…

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.820
you have to be more aware of the inner circle,
the folks that matter.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.400
Because it comes from performing,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.940
you always want to make sure that everyone
in the audience is all taken care of.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.240
That constant desire to please all the time.
That can get you in some shit.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.220
&gt;&gt; [Music]

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.940
&gt;&gt; Larry Grobel: Do you have or ever make
any New Year's resolutions?

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.000
&gt;&gt; Robin Williams: I haven't in a while, I
haven't made any in,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.600
I think, since I was about a kid.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.120
I used to give up a lot of things for Lent,
too, and then I still got hairy.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.620
&gt;&gt; [Music]

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.980
&gt;&gt; Robin WIlliams: Here's the best birth control
in the whole world, if you really…

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.100
if you have no pills, if you have no diaphragm,
if you have no other form of contraception.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.600
Use it for ladies, if he comes at you with
that little thing in his hand, just go [laughs].

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.580
Just laugh at it. They can't deal with it, ok? It will be gone.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.440
The little thing will be out of there.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.540
Then it's assault with the macaroni. Put it
away.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.440
&gt;&gt; [Music]

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.000
