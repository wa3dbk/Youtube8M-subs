00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.700
Good evening

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.700
It's time again

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.500
to present you

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.200
Khmorr the fantastic saga

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.400
presented each week

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.400
In this show called

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.000
N'ajustez pas votre sÃ©cheuse

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is what happend last time

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.600
While Khmorr and his friends are walking

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.600
Belle is pissed off toward Mononc

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.610
and, with her magic rays,

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.710
transforms him in Brazil.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.010
As for Khmorr,

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.610
is hearing a suspect noise

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.610
everyone is hiding

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.010
but it was only Titedent

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.010
who tells them there is

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.210
a monster.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.310
So, set your VCR

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.010
be ready with your VHS tape

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.920
and press RECORD, because

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.920
after the intro, you'll see

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.820
the last image from the previous episode

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.520
You'll have exactly 5 seconds

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.820
to start recording

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.920
Have a nice piracy everyone

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.620
Khmorr the conquerror

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.820
It was the 6, Ha! Ha!

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.620
The next number

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.920
Mononc! Watch out!

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.830
6

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.830

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.330
And now for the 3 numbers Quotidienne lotery

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.530
Not again!

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.930
No more the same lotteries anymore

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.630
Indeed

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.630
First, this is the number 6

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.830
followed by

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.330
6

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.030
Hey? it's only 6s!

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.740
Give me that!

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.140
Check for the EXTRA

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.540
He didn't play it, the fool

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.140
You didn't play the EXTRA?

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.140
and finally...

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.540
6

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.640
I was sure the guy talked about the gum

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.240
that doesn't make bubbles

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.140
Where's Titedent?

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.840
We don't care

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.550
He's under warranty

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.250

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.750

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.250
Devil - Power - Destruction

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.650
She changed me into Brazil.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.750

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.750

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.250

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.850

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.850
You didn't hurt yourself?

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.160

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.260

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.360

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.460

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:56.970
My friends...

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.370
Yes Khmorr ?

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.070
I think we made a mistake about him

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.770
YOU made a mistake

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.870

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.980
we are not gonna fight about words

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.680
I just think that, from now,

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.480
We're gonna listen more...

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.480
when he's...

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.280
When he's drying his teeth.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.780
What he's saying now ?

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.980
Nothing

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.380
he's drying his teeth

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.580
...

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.980
Titedent, you, my little funny face

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.980
So...

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.490

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.490

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.790
