Hi! I’m David Kaynor for expertvillage.com,
and I’m going to talk about some of the

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.929
repairs that are done to violins and I’ll
like to start with the setup. Depending on

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:20.820
who you talk to, the setup has to do with
the height of the strings over the fingerboard,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.890
the spacing of the strings at the nut and
at the bridge. The height of the bridge, the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:36.430
curve of the bridge, the length of the vibrating
the vibrating length of string, the swing

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.530
length of the string which is the length that’s
between the bridge and tailpiece, the length

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:52.030
of the tail cord which secures the tailpiece
to the body of the fiddle, and then the most

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:05.050
discussed mysterious sound post: a little
dowel really made of spruce. And this has

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:13.940
both a structural role in that it adds some
support to the instrument between the treble

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:25.280
side of the bridge and the top and the back,
and it fits into the fiddle approximately

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:36.530
near the treble foot of the bridge. The sound
post has to be cut with a bevel on each end

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.430
so that’ll fit perfectly against the interior
of the back and the top, and this has to be

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.140
done with a combination of guessing and trial
and error, finding the post in, looking in

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:00.860
with a mirror seeing where it fits and where
it doesn’t, taking the post back out, doing

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:08.009
more carving, putting it back in over and
over again until it finally fits. Where it’s

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:16.940
located has a very, very profound impact on
the instruments tone, so the sound post is

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:27.200
not nearly a structural element of the fiddle
but it’s also an acoustic coupler between

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:35.970
the vibrating top and the vibrating back.
A violin without a sound post has a much different

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.250
and really much less pleasing sound.
