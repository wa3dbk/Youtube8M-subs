JSN PowerAdmin tutorial : Module management

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.160
Go to "Site manager" in JSN PowerAdmin.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.600
Here you can manage all Modules of the current default template.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.460
Click the blue square button to show or hide all modules and positions.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.070
Choose to show or hide all unpublished modules.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.590
Here you can choose to show or hide all empty positions.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.900
You can edit module easily in modal window.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.670
Here I simply edit the title of module. 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.230
You need to save after change.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.610
You can change module position by selecting new position.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.290
All the available positions in template will be shown in modal windows.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.700
The current position is highlighted with orange color.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.070
Select the new position as you want.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.910
You can see the module is automatically moved to new position.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.200
Or you can simply change module position by drag-n-drop.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.650
You can assign/ unassign module to this page with one click.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.700
...Or you can assign module to all pages or custom pages easily.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.440
You just need to choose the pages you want to show the module in the list.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.440
Save your choice.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.600
All changes are saved automatically. You can go to the front-end to check.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.840
Here is the old page.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.590
Focus on the module I've changed: "Mobile Ready"...

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.590
...Docs Download,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.400
...and Native RTL Support.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.440
Now, we will refresh this page.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.260
Now, the title is changed into Download Documentation.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.890
Stunning colors is moved to the left. Mobile ready module is off.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.030
Native RTL Support module is in the center.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.570
Now go to the page: Typography to see the module "Yellow box" I assigned to.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.080
Here it is.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.330
