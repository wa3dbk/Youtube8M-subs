It's very hard to spot talent. Talent tends
to find us we're fortunate to say. We get

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.360
kids that are dragged here by their parents
because they've worn out the bed springs or

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.359
the sofa and they start working; we're fortunate
enough in Huntingdon to be able to have a

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.780
recreation section and an elite section. Any
kids that show an aptitude for Gymnastics

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.250
should be able to be passed on to another
coach that can give them the time.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.710
We've been training together, with the guys
in the club, for years and years and years

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.030
– I mean they're like my brothers – they're
family – and everyone has their tiffs and

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.100
disagreements but we all get on so well, we
all support each other. You know, if you're

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.860
in such a high demanding sport, it's hard
to kind of do that on your own, but the fact

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.620
you've got support there and people to make
that experience a bit easier, I think plays

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.040
a big part.
We're training six days a week. Most of those

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.410
days is twice a day, so about thirty-two hours
a week – high demand – and the fact that

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.230
I've had quite a lot of success, I have to
balance training with media work and charity

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.990
work and try and combine the two so I can
work efficiently but also sort myself out

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.950
for the future.
I feel like I'm the type of person that kind

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.649
of gets everyone going, gets the moral going,
I'm quite an anchor I'd say in the team, because

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.840
some people can kind of fall into their shell
a bit and the pressures of competition can

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.859
really effect them.
Most of us normal people don't really like

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.490
to be up, stood in front of thousands of people,
performing something that's right on the edge

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.200
of making an embarrassing mistake. Louis shines
in that area, he can work at an Olympic games,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.119
he can work at any competition and when he
puts his hand up to present a routine it's

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.600
his domain, he loves to do that. His ability
to perform is probably his biggest asset.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.109
When I saw Louis winning in Beijing the biggest
feeling for me was one of relief strangely

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.301
enough. It was the culmination of a lifetime's
work for both of us and to see him perform

00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:56.560
the routine, that I knew he could do thousands
of times, was a wonderful feeling.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.100
I've never felt like crying, through a performance
in my life, apart from then. The fact that

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.609
I'd been training, like, sixteen years, up
until that competition, I mean every second

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:12.590
I spent in this Gym was for that moment and
all I have is fifty seconds to prove my life's

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.000
work. Trying to comprehend all that and focus
on your job, I mean it was just mad. To finish

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.700
that routine and to land and just be lik,
‘do you know what? That's what all my training's

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:35.420
gone towards' and I've landed it clean, it's
just the best feeling, ever!
