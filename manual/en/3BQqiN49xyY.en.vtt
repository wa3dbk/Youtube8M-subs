00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.359
I'm phil and I'm here to do the
research

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:08.510
for you. today I'm covering a cat deterrent

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.750
more specifically the PestBye
battery-operated cat repeller

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.190
ultrasonic cat scarer. I'll be finding out if this product works

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.640
what exactly does it do? the pros of this
product

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.180
are there any better ultrasonic
cat repellers out there? and what are

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.520
if any the problems with the PestBye
battery-operated ultrasonic

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.480
cat scarer. does it scare cats? yes it does

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.280
and surprisingly with immediate and
excellent results. it also scares other

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.390
pests depending on what settings its
on

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.640
How does it do it?  it makes an ultrasonic
sound

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.800
too high for most humans to hear which either
annoys the cats

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.520
or scares it away. the inbuilt motion
detector  turns the cat repeller on by detecting

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.360
both motion

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.850
and heat from the cat which gives a cat
no chance to aclimatise itself to the

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.390
noise

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.560
pros of the Pest Buy cat repeller. 1st of all

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.920
is very cheap currently 50 percent off
through the link downbelow.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.860
it very quick to set up giving instant
results

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.040
that runs on batteries and be set up
anywhere in the garden

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.630
is fully waterproof so can be left out all the
time

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.430
it has an infrared heat motion sensor

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.740
can scare cats up to 7 meters away. birds are not affected

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.710
and it has settings both for fine-tuning and for
strength

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.170
during my research I found another Amazon best-seller

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.200
giving the same sort of results as the
Pest Bye battery operated cat repeller

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.310
but the difference between two cat repellers
was it the more expensive

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.909
model has a plug and wire which means it
can be mains operated

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.350
saving on batteries. problems with the 
Pest Bye ultrasonic cat scarer.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.630
the instruction manual that comes with this
product is pretty useless

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.979
however if you follow the link down
below there is an easy to follow

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.670
comprehensive list of instructions.
Another concern with this product

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.229
is that if you use cheap batteries, the battery
life is

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.539
extremely poor of say only a week or so

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.379
however if you use high-quality
rechargeable batteries

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.680
people getting three to four months per
battery charge

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.129
Another problem is that your own cat is
affected

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.400
which is fair enough because it is a cat scarer.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.829
something that other owners of this

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.719
model have commented on is that there's
no on/off switch they find that they

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.709
themselves

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.889
a starting the the cat scarer

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:41.510
just moving around the garden while they are gardening it's not a big problem

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.719
just just drains battery the quick a and
finally some people say

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.159
that it doesn't work however during my
research

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.439
i think thats either that proper didn't
work

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.989
or they are set it up wrong because the
vast majority people

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.540
had excellent results from this product
not gone on to buy extra scarers

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.359
to cover the whole garden.  in conclusion
this is an effective cheap

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.659
ultrasonic cat repeller giving excellent
results

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.909
all in all a great buy and this is Phil
saying

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.969
I hope my research has been awesome you
see a returns please give it a like

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:26.730
if not does dislike it also put them in
the comments what you didn't like about

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.230
it

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.659
not be able to improve my videos in
future this is Phil saying

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:32.359
bye for now
