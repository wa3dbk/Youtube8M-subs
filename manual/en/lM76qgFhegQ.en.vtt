00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:01.789
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.789 --> 00:00:03.709
Michael here from The Daily Note II/3 YouTube
Channel.

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:08.120
Welcome to part 3 of What's New on Android
4.4 for the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.799
Today I'll cover about a dozen changes related
to the notification panel and everything inside

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.920
it including new settings for new features.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.189
So let's check those out.

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.980
First, changes to graphic elements in the
UI.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.831
You'll notice that all the notification icons
have been changed to shades of gray, and a

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:36.620
lot of the app developers have jumped on board
as well but you'll still see color icons for

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.820
a lot of 3rd party apps.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.410
Another thing about the notification bar.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.370
When an app is in full screen and you pull
down the notification bar, it will now be

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.120
transparent until you react with it.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.370
If we pull that down, you should be able to
see this notification bar has changed color

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.150
and the clear button has a flat look to it.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.530
The font for the notifications text also seems
to be much thinner.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.170
One interesting thing about this brightness
control bar.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.750
Now, inside apps that let you control the
brightness within the app, when you bring

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.220
down the notification panel, the volume lever
is not shown.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.360
If you go out of such apps, the brightness
lever comes back.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.290
Next, when you have multiple items to open
for an action, your last selection is highlighted

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.960
to quickly guide you with your decision.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.810
Here's something I never knew before.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.370
You can even long tap on the selection and
choose to uninstall the app from here if you

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.370
no longer need that app.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.340
Next, a nice touch that I noticed since the
update.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.670
The Note 3 now vibrates briefly when it's
done starting up.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.229
There's now a popup message when you unplug
earphones...which I felt was unnecessary.

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.220
You can also see that the default template
for popup messages is rounded rectangle.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.090
In my opinion, this rounded rectangle and
font choice really looks out of place.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.300
In the settings, when you go to "more networks",
you can change the default SMS text message

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.770
app here.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.979
You also have options to disable or enable
the print services that came with your note

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.229
3.

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.970
You might as well turn these off if you don't
plan on printing on your mobile device.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.590
The GPS settings are much more defined.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.709
You can choose whether to use the GPS sensor
which does take a lot of battery, or if you

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.769
would rather just provide your phone with
GPS information based on your network or wifi

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:21.769
location.

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.209
That should be fine for when you don't need
pin-point accuracy by the second.

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.169
You can also choose which apps have access
to your gps location here as well.

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:36.540
There's a new option in the NFC toggle button
called NFC card mode.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.439
Unfortunately, I haven't figured out what
this is or how this works.

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:46.139
And it's different from the tap and pay feature,
which I believe is also new.

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:50.599
The tap and pay feature can be enabled if
you have the google wallet app installed and

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.010
configured.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.099
I'll try to do an extended video on these
features if I can figure out what this does.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.459
Next, here is a really valuable feature in
my opinion.

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.919
Inside developer options, you will see the
new process stats list.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:11.500
It is different from battery stats which doesn't
seem to list much of anything anymore.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.299
Much better information is now provided in
the processes stats.

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.219
It shows what process is running actively
for the duration of the time your phone has

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:20.439
been on.

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.909
If you can't see process stats because you
don't see developer options, you just need

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.689
to go to about device and tap on the build
number a few times.

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.790
And since we're in here, I'm sure you've seen
it by now, but here is a way to get to the

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.349
easter egg that changes whenever Google updates
Android OS.

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.090
Click on the Android version about 5 times.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:48.590
Then you get this rotating K. You can long
tap on that, and get the Android 4.4 KitKat

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.799
logo.

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.040
And you can long tap on that and you get this
animated screen saver that you can interact

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.040
with.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.040
It feels like a game, but it's not.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.339
I wouldn't be surprised if there's another
easter egg in here though, but no one has

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:01.950
found anything yet.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.949
So anyway, that's about it for today.

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:08.139
In the next video for this series, I'll return
to changes related to the apps that Samsung

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.989
provides found on Android 4.4 for the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3.

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:17.850
