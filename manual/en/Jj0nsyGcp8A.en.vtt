00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:17.390
Today Iam going to make Banana Walnut pancakes for pregnant women.

00:00:20.512 --> 00:00:29.512
We are using wheat flour, fibre rich wheat bran, energy packed bananas and walnuts..

00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:41.341
Now I will make the pancake batter.

00:00:56.546 --> 00:01:01.546
Banana contains potassium which takes care of our bones

00:01:07.357 --> 00:01:10.357
walnuts contain lot of fibre, protein and omega 3 fatty acids

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.229
Which is good for childs brain development

00:01:16.498 --> 00:01:21.498
It contains lot of Vitamin E which acts as an anti-oxidant in our bodies

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:27.832
which protects us from stress, smoke and uv radiations

00:01:46.994 --> 00:01:55.990
Mix all these ingredients well

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:22.420
Add water, and whisk well till no lumps remain.

00:02:22.795 --> 00:02:24.800
The batter is ready, let's make the pancakes.

00:02:25.872 --> 00:02:28.870
Heat a non-stick tava(griddle), 

00:02:31.204 --> 00:02:43.200
Pour a portion of the batter into a 4” diameter thick circle.

00:02:43.885 --> 00:02:51.880
Put butter on the edges and cook on medium flame

00:02:53.942 --> 00:03:05.940
cook till they turn golden brown in colour on both the sides.

00:03:14.096 --> 00:03:24.100
Pancakes are ready. Serve immediately with banana slices and drizzled with honey.

00:03:27.247 --> 00:03:31.250
