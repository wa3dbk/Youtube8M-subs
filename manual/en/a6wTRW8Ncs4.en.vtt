00:00:05.698 --> 00:00:08.268
Hi, and welcome to the ValveTime news.

00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:12.178
Each week, we’ll bring you the biggest talking
points regarding Valve and the community.

00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:14.320
Now, the news:

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.044
Dota 2’s International Compendium has
been obliterating records this past week

00:00:19.044 --> 00:00:21.595
despite only being released over a week ago.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.560
Since the release late on May 9th, the total
prize pool for The International 2014 tournament

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.703
has already risen to well over $5.9 million,

00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:33.760
a pretty significant increase from the $1.6 million starting point.

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:38.828
Thanks to increased compendium sales over last
year and the addition of “Compendium Points,”

00:00:38.828 --> 00:00:41.378
all but one of the stretch goals have currently been met,

00:00:41.378 --> 00:00:44.625
leaving only Base Customization at $6 million.

00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:48.494
That said, we wouldn’t be surprised
if the total had surpassed $6 million

00:00:48.494 --> 00:00:52.263
by the time this episode airs given how fast the total is increasing.

00:00:52.574 --> 00:00:59.378
For a quick comparison, the total prize pool
for The International 2013 only reached just under $2.9 million,

00:00:59.378 --> 00:01:02.607
meaning this year’s prize pool has already more than doubled it,

00:01:02.607 --> 00:01:07.863
which is crazy when you consider there is still another
two months to go before the tournament even begins.

00:01:08.108 --> 00:01:11.364
Valve released a new blog post to the Dota 2 website on Tuesday

00:01:11.364 --> 00:01:14.785
to express how shocked they were at the
continuing growth of the prize pool

00:01:14.785 --> 00:01:17.792
while also announcing a slight tweak to the stretch goal page

00:01:17.792 --> 00:01:20.842
which now shows the current status of all rewards.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.167
While Valve are still working to put the finishing
touches to many of the stretch goals,

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:29.040
a number of them have already been released
in various patches over the past week.

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:34.983
The Loading Screen treasure, Arcana Vote,
“Triumph” HUD, and the Solo Championship Vote

00:01:34.983 --> 00:01:36.889
have all been unlocked at the time or writing,

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:41.181
and we’re sure Valve will add one or two more
of the other rewards over the next week or so.

00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:44.734
The Loading Screen treasure and the
“Triumph” HUD will both be awarded

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:47.952
to Compendium owners once they next access their Armory,

00:01:47.952 --> 00:01:51.298
while the Arcana and Solo Championship Votes can both be found

00:01:51.298 --> 00:01:53.712
on their respective pages within the Compendium.

00:01:53.872 --> 00:01:59.209
More information on the Compendium and the prize pool
can be found over on our full write-ups on ValveTime.net,

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:01.585
which you can check out via links in the video description,

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:05.021
which, as always, will be available alongside a variety of other links

00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:08.287
related to every other topic we’re going to be discussing this week.

00:02:08.682 --> 00:02:11.811
With the prize pool rising steadily, the pressure is also building

00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:16.771
for every team involved in The International
Regional Qualifiers, which are now underway.

00:02:17.134 --> 00:02:21.350
The Americas qualifier, which began
on May 12th, concluded on May 16th

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.004
with North American Rejects taking the first place

00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:27.491
after a closely fought Best-of-5 event against Team Liquid.

00:02:27.717 --> 00:02:32.103
After a slight delay pushed the final match of
the series back from the 15th to the 16th,

00:02:32.103 --> 00:02:37.760
the game was over in just 19 minutes after some aggressive
kills from NAR’s Batrider and Templar Assassin

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.178
helped their team exploit an early gold and
experience advantage over Team Liquid.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.778
A series of aggressive pushes forced Team Liquid to call the gg

00:02:45.778 --> 00:02:49.087
before any of their hard carries were able to get enough farm.

00:02:49.364 --> 00:02:52.950
This 3:2 victory over Team Liquid puts North American Rejects

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.976
into the main International event as the 12th team.

00:02:56.404 --> 00:02:59.774
On Monday, the South East Asia qualifiers also concluded,

00:02:59.774 --> 00:03:04.545
with Arrow Gaming taking out MVP Phoenix 3:1 in the finales.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.842
Arrow Gaming have now been named as
the 13th team to join the main event,

00:03:08.842 --> 00:03:12.771
and we imagine they could likely make an
interesting splash at the main event in July

00:03:12.771 --> 00:03:17.717
after only managing to give away less than
a handful of games in the entire qualifiers.

00:03:18.084 --> 00:03:23.270
Both Team Liquid and MVP Phoenix will be given a
second chance to join the main tournament in July,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.268
where they will fight against the runner-up
teams from the other qualifiers

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:29.430
in the hopes of securing the 16th and final position.

00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:33.011
The Chinese qualifier is set to begin on Tuesday May 20th,

00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:37.265
with the European qualifier following
several days later on May 24th.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.225
As always, we’ll be sure to bring you the results
of each event as soon as they are available.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.750
A new blog post released onto the Dota 2 website

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.004
has detailed the previously revealed
“Dota 2 Fantasy League Season One,”

00:03:50.004 --> 00:03:53.755
which began on Monday, the 19th May 2014.

00:03:54.018 --> 00:03:57.411
The Fantasy League system functions similarly to Fantasy Football,

00:03:57.411 --> 00:04:01.515
allowing groups of friends to create their own
unique custom teams of professional players

00:04:01.515 --> 00:04:06.291
who will compete based on how many points these
players are awarded in real professional matches.

00:04:06.517 --> 00:04:10.390
Unlike last year’s Fantasy League, which was
simplistic and didn’t really feature any way

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.865
for players to easily compare scores with friends,

00:04:12.865 --> 00:04:16.028
Season One will allow players to create
their own independent leagues

00:04:16.028 --> 00:04:20.437
which can be used to privately compete with
each other in weekly head-to-head battles.

00:04:20.602 --> 00:04:25.971
Season One of the Dota 2 Fantasy League is
currently set to run all the way until July 28th.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.865
To compete, players must purchase a compendium and use

00:04:28.865 --> 00:04:32.640
the ticket delivered to their armory
upon completion of the transaction.

00:04:32.847 --> 00:04:37.689
A detailed FAQ released to the Dota blog has
revealed many important details about the event,

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.023
including how the team drafting system will work,

00:04:40.023 --> 00:04:45.962
and the fact that a “Season Two” will begin shortly after
the conclusion of the International 2014 in late July.

00:04:46.268 --> 00:04:51.242
Be sure to check out the FAQ for yourself if you
and your friends are looking to get stuck in.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.710
Oh, and before we start talking about other games,

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.230
we thought we would throw out a quick plug
for The Stanley Parable announcer pack,

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.868
which was officially added into the Dota 2 Store earlier this week.

00:05:02.174 --> 00:05:05.515
The pack sees Kevan Brighting return to his role as the Narrator,

00:05:05.515 --> 00:05:10.390
who provides commentary on Dota 2 matches
in his typically sarcastic and demeaning tone.

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:13.011
As you would have guessed if you’ve played The Stanley Parable,

00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:14.145
or if you’ve checked out our review,

00:05:14.145 --> 00:05:17.745
the pack is absolutely hilarious, and is definitely
worth picking up if you’re a fan of

00:05:17.745 --> 00:05:20.098

A few weeks ago, we discussed the
reveal of a new port of Left 4 Dead

00:05:24.164 --> 00:05:29.736
known as “Left 4 Dead: Survivors” being developed
by Taito exclusively for the Japanese arcade scene.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.072
Earlier this week, the first real trailer for the game was released,

00:05:33.072 --> 00:05:38.014
which has revealed the game will likely look and
function almost identically to the original version,

00:05:38.014 --> 00:05:42.912
something not true of the “Half-Life 2: Survivor”
port previously developed by Taito.

00:05:43.138 --> 00:05:46.348
The main difference between the
original Left 4 Dead and “Survivors”

00:05:46.348 --> 00:05:49.374
appears to be the addition of four new Japanese characters,

00:05:49.374 --> 00:05:54.856
who will likely replace the Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2
casts with new appearances and voice lines.

00:05:55.101 --> 00:05:57.298
That really is all we have to say about the trailer.

00:05:57.416 --> 00:06:00.790
It’s definitely far from the best or
highest quality trailer ever released,

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.769
but it might still be worth a watch if you’re interested.

00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:07.901
On last week’s show, we reported about the cryptic announcement

00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:12.503
regarding the possibility of an Android port
of Half-Life 2 for the Nvidia SHIELD.

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.112
Well, we were all rather stunned to learn
that Nvidia actually released the game

00:06:16.112 --> 00:06:18.597
onto the platform on Monday alongside Portal,

00:06:18.597 --> 00:06:21.425
something nobody really expected to see happen this quickly.

00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:28.658
Both games are now available from the Google Play
Store for £5.99 in the UK and $9.99 in the US,

00:06:28.658 --> 00:06:31.265
but... that isn’t quite the end of the story.

00:06:31.472 --> 00:06:34.352
Shortly after the release of Half-Life 2 on Nvidia SHIELD,

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:38.578
we were notified about some previously unseen
content hidden within the game files.

00:06:38.701 --> 00:06:42.103
The content, which was left within the
maps folder of the Android port,

00:06:42.103 --> 00:06:45.802
appears as 9 separate developer test levels likely used by Nvidia

00:06:45.802 --> 00:06:49.454
to experiment with the capabilities of
Half-Life 2 and the Source engine.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.778
Various tests are used across the maps
to find out what would or would not work

00:06:53.778 --> 00:06:56.108
on the SHIELD at different stages of development,

00:06:56.108 --> 00:07:00.715
including different types of lighting, physics,
AI behavior, and a whole lot more.

00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:03.962
After bringing the map files over to a PC version of the game,

00:07:03.962 --> 00:07:06.385
we were able to play these test levels for ourselves,

00:07:06.385 --> 00:07:09.557
so we thought it might be interesting
to release a new Spotlight Exclusive

00:07:09.557 --> 00:07:12.776
to provide a close look at how each of the maps functions.

00:07:13.044 --> 00:07:17.628
The video features a few minutes of commentary to
provide some context and to introduce the maps

00:07:17.628 --> 00:07:22.174
before a full 20 or so minute runthrough of
each and every map included in the files.

00:07:22.437 --> 00:07:25.985
A link to the video will be provided on screen in a few moments.

00:07:26.414 --> 00:07:29.764
And that brings us to the end of another week of Valve news.

00:07:29.985 --> 00:07:32.668
