00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:02.463
(howling)

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:08.641
(electronic music)

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.198
- The moon has been saddled
with a lot of baggage.

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:12.545
Just think of the work lunatic

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:13.833
(laughing)

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:17.023
Which contains the Latin
work for moon, Luna,

00:00:17.023 --> 00:00:18.428
not to mention the idea that

00:00:18.428 --> 00:00:21.018
once a full moon appeared
in a darkened sky

00:00:21.018 --> 00:00:23.343
the most sensitive to it's luminary charms

00:00:23.343 --> 00:00:24.623
would fall under it's spell

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:26.997
and become raving mad men or worse

00:00:26.997 --> 00:00:28.520
Werewolves

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.402
now there is link to the
electrochemistry of the brain

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:33.301
in the epileptic patients which changes

00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:36.165
the few days surrounding a new moon.

00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:37.364
Making seizures more likely

00:00:37.364 --> 00:00:40.398
but that's hardly the
terrain of werewolves

00:00:40.398 --> 00:00:43.417
and marauding loonies
in a fit of violence.

00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:45.498
The moon just isn't responsible
for increases in crime,

00:00:45.498 --> 00:00:47.042
pregnant woman going into labor,

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:49.147
or any other number of superstitions.

00:00:49.147 --> 00:00:50.759
But when it comes to slumber

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:53.409
could this celestial
body be messing with us?

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.548
Have you ever experienced
a sleepless night?

00:00:55.548 --> 00:00:57.089
And found yourself nursing

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.976
a full moon hangover the next day?

00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:02.744
A 2013 report in Current
Biology looked into this

00:01:02.744 --> 00:01:05.936
and between 2000 and 2003
the data of 33 subjects

00:01:05.936 --> 00:01:08.860
were collected on and off in a sleep lab.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.052
The data gathered included brain
wave activity during sleep,

00:01:12.052 --> 00:01:14.794
levels of a sleepy time hormone melatonin,

00:01:14.794 --> 00:01:17.575
the amount of time the
subjects took to fall asleep

00:01:17.575 --> 00:01:20.530
and the amount of time
they spent in deep sleep

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.341
and their subjective reports

00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:24.434
about how they felt the next day.

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:25.836
All of which was an attempt to get

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:29.249
at a general sense of
human sleep patterns.

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:31.571
It was only a decade later
when some of the authors

00:01:31.571 --> 00:01:33.629
of the study were having
drinks in a local bar

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:35.437
one evening during a full moon

00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:38.810
did they think, hey, let's
have a look at that dataset

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.528
and see if there are any
connections to lunar patterns.

00:01:42.528 --> 00:01:44.891
They found that on average
the subjects in the study

00:01:44.891 --> 00:01:46.835
took five minutes longer to fall asleep

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:49.464
on three or four nights
surrounding a full moon

00:01:49.464 --> 00:01:51.943
and they slept for 20 fewer minutes.

00:01:51.943 --> 00:01:54.646
In addition, EEG activity
related the deep sleep

00:01:54.646 --> 00:01:56.210
fell by 30 percent.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.213
Melatonin levels were lower

00:01:58.213 --> 00:02:01.443
and the subjects reported
feeling not so refreshed

00:02:01.443 --> 00:02:03.137
on those other days.

00:02:03.137 --> 00:02:04.674
In case you're wondering the participants

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:07.806
weren't exposed to even
a sliver of moonlight.

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:09.720
They slept in a completely darkened lab.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.766
And since the point of
the initial 2000 to 2003

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:14.676
study was just to study
general sleep patterns,

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:17.401
there was never any
mention of lunar cycles

00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:20.307
which could have primed sleep behavior.

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:22.095
That being said, a group of researchers

00:02:22.095 --> 00:02:24.287
at the Max Planck Institute analyzed data

00:02:24.287 --> 00:02:25.935
from more than 1, 000 people

00:02:25.935 --> 00:02:28.210
and about 26,000 nights of sleep

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.359
only to find zero correlation,

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.192
zabido

00:02:33.098 --> 00:02:34.642
so it sounds like the
jury is out on this one

00:02:34.642 --> 00:02:36.845
that means it's up to us to solve it

00:02:36.845 --> 00:02:39.100
Are you a full moon lunatic?

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.466
Do you exhibit the signs of restlessness?

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:42.789
Feeling like you have a hangover

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:45.146
whenever there is a
full moon out and about?
