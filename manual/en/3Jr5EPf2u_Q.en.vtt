-Hey everyone.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.165
I'm Mindy, from Cute
Girls Hairstyles.

00:00:08.165 --> 00:00:09.540
This morning,
we're going to film

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.520
a braid that's really
different but fun,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.269
and I think you're
going to like it a lot.

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.340
And I'm going to call
it the Cage Braid.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.980
Also, for those of
you that don't know,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.060
I'm really utilizing my
Twitter account lately.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.680
So you can tweet me
anytime you want.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.405
@CuteGirlHair is my account.

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:28.530
And I'm finding that it's
a really great way for me

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.090
to stay in contact with you,
or answer your questions,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.509
or anything like that.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.330
So feel free to tweet me,
@CuteGirlHair, anytime.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.850
OK.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.850
So for this hairstyle, I
started by just pulling it up

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.400
into a ponytail.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.820
And her hair is damp.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.660
It's not wet wet, but
it's not dry either.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.340
And I'm just going
to take a comb

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.920
and grab a little chunk of hair
at the top of the ponytail.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.430
Like so.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.870
And divide that
into three sections.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.069
And start just
your regular braid.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.690
Tip back a little
bit for me, thanks.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.770
So this is where it
gets a little different.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.120
You're just going to pick up
a little chunk from the side

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.000
and add it in, sort of like
you would on a French braid.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.830
And go ahead and braid it in.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.670
And then grab a chunk from
this side and add it in.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.170
So what the trick is,
remember that we're always

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.049
pulling the stranding down,
we're not pulling it over.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.090
Like a normal French braid,
you'd grab this piece

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.750
and you'd pull it tight over.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.639
We're not going to do that.

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:33.180
And you'll see as
we get farther down

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.120
the ponytail how that affects.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.170
So pull it down into the braid.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.250
Grab little chunk,
down into the braid.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.130
And now because we're
taking little chunks,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.520
this does take a little
bit longer to do,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.260
just like the fish tailing does.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.280
So grab a chunk.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.760
Add it in.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.740
Pulling it down.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.690
Now you can see that our drops
are getting deeper and deeper

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.360
the farther we go
down the ponytail.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.970
And that's exactly what we want.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.294
So just keep going.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.340
All the way.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.510
So while I'm doing
this, I'll just

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.700
mention that it's sort of the
beginning of the new year,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.660
and everyone's always making
resolutions, of course.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.900
So you'll have to
leave me a comment

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.450
and tell me what your New
Year's resolution is this year

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.050
to get better at.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.790
Oops, sorry.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.080
So just keep adding hair in.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.205
I know it looks really funny
right now, but trust me.

00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:43.420
In the end, it's so amazing.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.520
And add it in.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.540
So we've had a whole bunch
of birthdays recently,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.370
which is always a busy
time of year for us.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.130
They're are all over now.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.180
OK, I'm kind of getting
to the end of my hair,

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.760
both in the ponytail
and hair back here.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.770
And when you get all
done with the hair,

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:35.200
then just go ahead and
finish off the regular braid

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.700
and secure it with an elastic.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.320
OK.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.100
Now this is where
the magic comes.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.860
So you take-- I'm going to grab
maybe an inch down the ponytail

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.559
and pull up.

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:54.600
And look at what happens.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.099
Vrup!

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.770
Do you see that?

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.720
It almost looks like
a little rib cage,

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.130
which is why I'm calling
it the Cage Braid.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.470
I'm going to just take
that loop and tuck it

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.660
back on top of her head, just
over the ponytail holder, which

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.960
also helps hide the
ponytail holder.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.185
And I'm just going to
bobby pin that into place.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.910
OK.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.180
And so when you've got
that secured-- now,

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.490
I don't love this little endy
thing, so I also take that,

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.000
tuck it up into her hair.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.250
And you can see-- I'll try
to pull that out of the way

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.720
so you can see what I'm doing.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.980
Just kind of pin it
flat against her head.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.910
OK.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.680
And there you have it.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.030
And then just spray a
little hair spray as needed.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.300
And I just love the
way that these loopies

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.770
hang out and stick out
and almost sort of look

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.170
like a rib cage.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.580
But it's really fun.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.190
I think it's so different
looking, but so easy.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.560
So there you have it.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.870
You want to say goodbye?

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.420
-Bye.
