00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.790
Thanks for the serious reply! (´･ω･`)
Not giving a reaction is really hard...

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.059
I might have done so without even realizing
it.

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.059
Hobbies...

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.660
Uh, I like H games and comics, but no real
hobbies...

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.930
Do you think things would settle themselves
if I didn't go to school for two months?

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.660
Do you have any idea how much trouble you've
caused Tendou?

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.780
You need to apologize to Tendou for everything,
now.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.780
Uh?

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.310
(´･ω･`) You know Denko's nickname?

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.220
Are you from school?

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.980
You know the nickname Tendou?

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.619
If you're acquaintances, I want her to reply...
(´･ω･`)

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:54.640
This isn't any time for you to be interrogating
me, you creep.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.820
A loner like you never considering the other's
feelings and pushing himself on her is the

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.170
worst of the worst.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.009
If you don't get that, then you're beyond
all help.

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.480
^ Could you tell us more details about the
flower-viewing if possible?

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.930
IF YOU'RE SAYING THINGS ABOUT DENKO AND ME
THEN I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU I'LL FIND YOU

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.930
I SWEAR

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.930
Eep...

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.930
Oh bajeezus.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.570
I know he'll do it, too.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.570
uh

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.060
uh

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.370
i peed a little

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.310
There was no (´･ω･`)...

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.759
GUYS HE'S SERIOUS!!!

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.630
Do you really know Denko?

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.780
If you really know her, tell me what she was
wearing to the flower-viewing! (´･ω･`)

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.620
Say, if Denko filed a stalker report, is it
likely this guy would get arrested?

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.140
Very likely, surely?

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.890
If this guy gets ignored, then law enforcement
is a joke when it comes to stalking.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.020
This would all be seriously traumatic to almost
any girl, especially a fragile one.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.010
OP still doesn't seem to understand the ramifications
of his actions.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.560
Maybe we should get a hold of people nearby
to file a claim for Denko.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.200
So in short, OP stalked Denko and is getting
bullied for it, but is acting like he's the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.200
victim?

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.450
^ Yes sir.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.670
I don't want to hurt anyone, but I do know
karate.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.660
I really don't like violence...

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:29.209
But this might be my chance to overcome my
traumas... (´･ω･`) It's this or put

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.400
up with it for two months...

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.540
Where are you getting two months from?

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.350
I was advised here that if I endured it for
two months, it would go away.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.350
(´･ω･`)

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.630
What're your plans for today, OP?

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.350
Wondering if I should go to school or not...
(´･ω･`)

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.860
Why can't you tell us a straight cause for
the bullying?

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.910
Are you just going to keep saying "rumors"??

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.569
So, she didn't like the thing at the flower-viewing,
did she?

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.750
Apparently not...

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.950
I can't take any more wounds.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.120
Just seeing "Denko" makes me feel like my
chest is being carved out of me...

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.410
Hey, stop making fun of OP, okay!!

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.240
Can you say everything you want to talk about,
OP?

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:32.260
About the cause for bullying, the rumors you
haven't specified about, about Denko...

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.610
We'll talk it all out with you.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.610
Okay?

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.610
Sniff...

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.410
Thank you...

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.900
I'm glad there's a few good people... (´･ω･`)

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.940
You goddamn...

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.379
Were you threatening Denko with violence?

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.640
Not saying anything to guys and threatening
women?

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.150
You're the worst.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.680
What a waste of space.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.850
It's obvious why you're being bullied.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.900
WHAT I WASN'T THREATENING HER (´･ω･`)
I just grabbed her, okay?

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.080
If you're that guy from school, please don't
talk about this anymore...

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.520
You got in an argument with Denko, grabbed
her arm, and groped her.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.040
You're a piece of shit is what you are.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.790
^ Hooray, Denko's friend!

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.910
Whoa, wait, I let go right away...

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.350
I didn't grope her!

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.379
(´･ω･`)
Everyone, please, don't let this guy lead

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:24.379
you astray.

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:28.189
Do you honestly think you're convincing anyone
at this point?

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:30.180
You damn liar!

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.610
Don't use your stupid-ass emoticon with me!

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.789
You gonna do something about that attitude
problem?!?

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:37.909
Hear it from me, guys.

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:42.889
This guy says he's being bullied in college,
but in reality he's a sack of shit who Denko

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.289
loathes for chasing her around, and he sees
the situation as him being goddamn bullied.

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:49.870
He's the epitome of creepy stalkers.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.219
If I talk more about the flower-viewing, it'll
agitate the situation!

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.770
All your name-calling is really hurting me...

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.009
I want you to promise you won't make fun of
me.

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:08.080
It's a really delicate situation, so I don't
want things to get worse, or I'll go nuts...

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.349
(´･ω･`)

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:17.879
Too late.
