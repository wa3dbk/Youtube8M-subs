00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
(Text on screen): Using a Brake to Bend Steel, Kevin Caron, www.kevincaron.com

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The Voice: Hey, Kevin. What are you doing?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Kevin Caron: Well, I'm going to make a box.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The Voice: A box?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Kevin Caron: Yeah. Just a little piece of sheet metal. This is a brake.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Have you ever used a brake?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The Voice: Nope.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Kevin Caron: Come here. I'll show you.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's really kind of neat. It's got a jaw that opens up.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Don't put your finger in there!

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So you can get the metal inside.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And then these fingers will come down and trap your metal in there and then it's just got a table that moves.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
There's a little lip on the front that moves. And that's how you get your bend.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The Voice: So, what's the value of it? Why do you use that instead of just doing it by hand?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Kevin Caron: Well, I don't know about you, but my grip's not quite that strong. And to try and just bend this by hand. . .

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Here; come here.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000
See, you've got a pretty nice 90-degree bend right there. Real smooth and real tiny little radius on it.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If I tried to do that by hand, it would wind up kind of lumpy. It would wind up crooked. It would wind up very uneven.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It wouldn't; it would look like you did it by hand rather than in a machine.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
You can clamp in the vise, bend it over that way if your metal's standing up.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
You could clamp it to your workbench, take a hammer, pound it down. If you had a nice, sharp edge on the edge of your workbench.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Or, you get a brake.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So, I can do this edge, and then I can come back and do that edge.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:11.000
But then you think, now, whoa, wait a minute. I put this in here, these two bends that I; sides that I just bend up will hit here.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So, you take out one of the fingers.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
You can kind of match it up to, well, this finger's about the right size of the work on this width.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So, I come in here and just . . .

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:43.000
play dentist and pull a couple of teeth.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And then just come back in and line it up again.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And then I've got a nice, even bend. Nice, straight corner.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
It would help if I lined it up right where it came out the same length.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And then I could just come back and weld all the edges.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
You could leave an extra tab on there so after you bend this up, you bend the tab over and rivet it, bolt it, weld it.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Whichever way you want to do it; however you wanted to make it.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
But you think, well, OK, I can bend it up that way. Well, can I do anything else with it?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Sure.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Now you can come in here. Hang on . . .

00:03:37.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And I can put a foot on it that way. So then I can come back . . .

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and bend my edges back up. Bend my sides back up.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Now I've got a foot here where I could put a top on it. I could turn it over, or I could bolt it down, or weld it down.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Or I could have a box; have something; you know, put a piece of machinery on it or something on it.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
It's a great, handy little tool. Saves a lot of time. Saves a lot of effort. It does nice, neat corners.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
It's got a stop in the bottom where you can adjust it to whatever degree you want of a bend, so it's repeatable.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So you can sit here and make them all the same.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
It's a great little tool. Handy thing to have.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
See you next time.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:50.000
