00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:07.320
"Bartenders are ice artisans and poets of alcohol"
Patxi Troitiño

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.149
of the many tips that
Patxi gave me in the world championship of 2005 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:17.369
the one I remember best is when he said,
he looked me at eyes and said:

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.369
Yoli quiet, go up there and do what you know, as you known.

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.369
Watching the world through the eyes of a Bartender

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.090
Patxi Troitiño for me is like the Ferran Adria of cocktails. Because he was a man who in cocktails

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.550
has innovated a bunch. I'd known in the beginning

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.660
back in 2000 or so

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.370
and well, he has undergone a sizable evolution

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.319
from making international cocktails

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:55.359
to try to distance himself from all that and 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:02.359
to make his own versioned cocktails

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.310
my teacher has put me in the Stick for a stage, in the bar of Patxi

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.080
and I liked the way of working that has Patxi and how he got me into the contests

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.570
working a lot with him, in the end I decided

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.000
practically, to devote myself to the bar instead of the kitchen

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.770
a fighter, a person who is constant

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.850
given for his work 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.870
and well, there he is

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.450
being a reference in all that is cocktails and especially the word bartender

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.420
so trendy that is bartender, bartender ...

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.420
for me bartender is Patxi

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.790
He tries to convince everyone that

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.220
to do things right costs nothing

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.590
costs very little effort

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.590
and the reward is great

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.850
for me the Stick is an amusement park

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.060
He has gone beyond the world of cocktails. For example

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.319
versioning international cocktails

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.939
for example

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.939
putting other different things that they could not before:

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:26.939
liquid nitrogen, makes spherifications, aerosols, he does a lot of things today

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.619
a person who is

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:39.109
in San Sebastian, a city landmark in the kitchen theme, can not be less

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.029
in reference to the level of Spain, is Patxi

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:44.159
in the mixology. Why?

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.090
because he has innovated

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.989
he brings at the panorama of mixology at Gipuzkoa

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.119
many things

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:53.369
but above all he has been capable of bringing people mixology

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:57.409
I think that the cocktail was forgotten or at least very reserved

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:04.409
to a certain type of people or public

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.350
one of the details that caught my
attention of Stick, they said:

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.159
that they met on thursdays

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.709
to investigate, to innovate, to mix things. Foams, airs

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:16.879
which sounded amazing to me

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.059
molecular mixology and I was astonished, those details: spherifications

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:26.029
airs, foams, for me it was an amazing world. I loved that

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:30.509
and Patxi has explain me that they met here on thursdays

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:34.039
and we started to do things, to do tests. With this,
with that

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.679
and it caught my attention, that well, so far

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:39.869
They say I am the R&amp;D, but well

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:46.869
the truth is that we all are

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:53.269
he seeks a point more, it's like a free spirit in the mixology

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.309
he always goes beyond, does not like being enclosed in the international cocktail

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:06.649
He always seeks another twist, I think

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.300
his quest to make the cocktail closer

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.240
has succeeded

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.090
that kids

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.389
very young

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.800
come in one of his first appointments to Stick

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.830
to drink

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.830
a cocktail, because

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.400
because they have understood that neither is so expensive

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.930
nor is anything so luxurious

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.610
nor have to carry excessive alcohol

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.340
is unbelievable all he can do and all he will do. Why?

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.249
because he has a team behind him, that is supporting him

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:07.699
and they are working in one direction. That is going to be the best and they will get it

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.589
Why? because they are innovating

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:12.169
people who innovate and that's what is today

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:19.169
Do we want R &amp; D &amp; i? That is Patxi, the R &amp; D &amp; i in the topic of cocktail

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.430
We had been in the classical

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.719
and Patxi has completely innovated it

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:39.439
his head is a machine, doesnt stop,it's all day

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:45.179
watching the world through the eyes of a Bartender
