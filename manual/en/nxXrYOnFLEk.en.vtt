00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:12.767
[Subtitles by danielsangeo]

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:15.734
So, what are my options here?

00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:20.241
I could shoot down every one of
these tentacle things individually,

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:22.970
but then they would puke up so
much, this ramp would turn into

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.031
a Slip 'N Slide of blood, and I
just washed that off of me.

00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:28.074
Again!

00:00:28.074 --> 00:00:32.207
What I want to do is lay that satchel charge
in here and watch these things blow up.

00:00:32.207 --> 00:00:35.662
But, call me old-fashioned,
but I'm still squeamish

00:00:35.662 --> 00:00:37.996
about setting off explosives underground.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.559
I'm sure the studies show--oh, look, ammo.

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.237
[teleportation sound]
Ow, shit!

00:00:43.237 --> 00:00:44.822
[vortigaunts charging]
I'M BOXED IN!

00:00:44.822 --> 00:00:46.091
[shuddering]

00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:47.033
PISS OFF!

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:48.367
[shuddering]

00:00:49.747 --> 00:00:52.271
YEAH, THAT FISH IN A BARREL
TRICK DOESN'T WORK SO WELL

00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:55.017
WHEN THE FISH HAS A SHOTGUN, DOES IT?!

00:00:55.017 --> 00:00:56.675
Well, that was interesting.

00:00:56.675 --> 00:01:00.292
Looks like the aliens are taking
a page from the military's book.

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:03.934
The military put soldiers in a
box to pop out of,

00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:08.571
the aliens wait out of
the box for me to go into.

00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:09.684
And it worked!

00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:12.949
Tactical combat is strange, man.

00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:15.934
No wonder people have to train
so much for this stuff.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.524
Ah, "Wet Floor". Thank God for that sign.

00:01:19.524 --> 00:01:23.934
That is the number one hazard
around here: wet floors.

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:27.371
Whoa, shit, these floors ARE wet.

00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:30.091
I bet a higher percentage of
janitors survive this mess

00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:31.877
[strange chittering noises]
more than any other type of employee.

00:01:31.877 --> 00:01:33.338
[strange chittering noises]
If they were holding a mop,

00:01:33.338 --> 00:01:36.116
[strange chittering noises]
they already had a weapon in their hands,

00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:38.000
[strange chittering noises]
they know the entire building,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.737
[strange chittering noises]
and they have the keys to everything.

00:01:39.737 --> 00:01:40.934
[strange chittering noises]
What the hell was that?

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.072
[strange chittering noises]

00:01:43.072 --> 00:01:45.405
[strange chittering noises]
I saw something in the water.

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:48.379
[strange chittering noises]
And these annoying fucking chittering noises

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:49.652
[strange chittering noises]
don't inspire confidence

00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:51.236
[strange chittering noises]
that everything's fine.

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:53.493
[strange chittering noises]
That and it smells like mildew down here

00:01:53.493 --> 00:01:54.140
[strange chittering noises]
so you know that--

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.416
[teleportation sound]
Oh!

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:56.359
[vortigaunt powering up]
Wait! No!

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:57.167
[shuddering]

00:01:57.167 --> 00:01:58.770
[strange chittering noises]

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.245
[strange chittering noises]
Oh my God! That is SO unfair,

00:02:01.245 --> 00:02:03.191
[strange chittering noises]
attacking while I'm distracted!

00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:03.844
[strange chittering noises]
You're acting like

00:02:03.844 --> 00:02:05.361
[strange chittering noises]
you're trying to kill me!

00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:06.934
[strange chittering noises]
What is wrong with everyone?

00:02:06.934 --> 00:02:07.681
[strange chittering noises]

00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:09.460
[strange chittering noises]
I am finding it disturbing how little

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.529
[strange chittering noises]
I'm seeing aliens fight the soldiers

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:13.454
[strange chittering noises]
or soldiers fight the aliens.

00:02:13.454 --> 00:02:14.778
[strange chittering noises]
Everyone is trying to kill me

00:02:14.778 --> 00:02:16.543
[strange chittering noises]
and unarmed civilians.

00:02:16.543 --> 00:02:18.675
[strange chittering noises]
How dysfunctional is that?

00:02:18.675 --> 00:02:22.400
It's like if they think if I die, all their
problems will magically be solved.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.829
What are they thinking?

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.923
When the Japanese invaded Pearl Harbor,

00:02:26.923 --> 00:02:29.147
was our first priority to send the troops in

00:02:29.147 --> 00:02:31.910
to start killing off all the
remaining dockworkers?

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.614
No! It wasn't!

00:02:33.614 --> 00:02:35.955
Whoa, that looks dangerous.

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:38.066
And it's refreshingly non-subtle.

00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:41.067
Okay, people, let's hear
options.  MacIntyre, you first.

00:02:41.854 --> 00:02:44.544
"Well, I don't really want to get
back in the water this quarter.

00:02:44.544 --> 00:02:47.927
"For starters I just killed a shark, okay?

00:02:47.927 --> 00:02:49.856
"And I saw something swimming down there.

00:02:49.856 --> 00:02:51.718
"So, how can that be good?"

00:02:51.718 --> 00:02:52.734
Knox, what do you think?

00:02:53.262 --> 00:02:57.631
"Ah, see, I thought of that, too, but
the Big Gaping Hole Strategy is flawed

00:02:57.631 --> 00:02:59.944
"due to the ragged chunks
of metal surrounding it.

00:02:59.944 --> 00:03:02.742
"No, gentlemen, I think there's
only one course for our company.

00:03:02.742 --> 00:03:04.033
"Allow me to demonstrate."

00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:07.734
Yeah, I'd like to see a fish do this.

00:03:08.246 --> 00:03:14.537
I think this proves that, in addition to
aliens, I am superior to fish as well.

00:03:14.537 --> 00:03:15.334
There's--dammit...!

00:03:16.022 --> 00:03:17.667
[underwater mumbling]

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:23.073
I'm starting to get pretty sick
of all this swimming--aaaah!

00:03:23.073 --> 00:03:25.718
I don't think this suit's
really designed for it.

00:03:25.718 --> 00:03:27.280
I'm all waterlogged.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.334
I can't have that. That's how Bruce Lee
died; too much water in his brain.

00:03:32.843 --> 00:03:35.712
Of course, I don't think that
happened to him from swimming,

00:03:35.712 --> 00:03:37.529
it was painkillers or something.

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:39.445
But then, hey, look at me.

00:03:39.445 --> 00:03:42.444
I am the Bruce Lee of physics.

00:03:42.444 --> 00:03:43.778
Wickazhaw!

00:03:43.778 --> 00:03:45.521
Oh, look, there's somebody over there.

00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:46.253
[bullsquid grunts, spits]

00:03:46.253 --> 00:03:48.400
[bullsquid grunts, spits]
No, hey, I wasn't looking at you!

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:51.144
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT?!

00:03:51.144 --> 00:03:51.634
[teleportation sound]

00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:52.367
What?

00:03:53.676 --> 00:03:54.981
I JUST KILLED YOU!

00:03:54.981 --> 00:03:56.234
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?!

00:03:58.183 --> 00:04:01.941
Okay, no more making COPIES of
yourself after you're dead!

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:03.834
You should've learned about that in school.

00:04:04.475 --> 00:04:05.685
Hey, what's this do?

00:04:05.685 --> 00:04:07.237
[klaxons sound]
Uh-oh.

00:04:07.237 --> 00:04:09.796
[klaxons sound]
Um, off... OFF!

00:04:09.796 --> 00:04:11.232
[klaxons sound, machinery starts up]

00:04:11.232 --> 00:04:15.150
Wait, I was supposed to stop
pressing strange buttons, wasn't I?

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.834
I haven't learned anything.

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.460
Oh, is that all it did?

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.734
That's not so bad.

00:04:21.196 --> 00:04:21.934
What is this?

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.999
Knowing us, I bet these machines serve
no other purpose than to crack nuts.

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.960
That button says "Generator"
but, give me a break.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.335
Why would you have two sets of ENORMOUS
pistons slamming into each other like that?

00:04:35.335 --> 00:04:37.443
It's obvious what's going on here.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:39.568
It's the same as the
crate-smashing room.

00:04:39.568 --> 00:04:42.534
If we don't spend a billion
dollars one year,

00:04:44.056 --> 00:04:47.007
then we don't get a billion
dollars the next year.

00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:49.469
And if we don't get a billion
dollars the next year,

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:53.469
then we have to go and spend more
money on lobbyists to get the laws changed

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:56.109
so we get our billion dollars
the year after that.

00:04:56.109 --> 00:05:00.765
And nobody wants that because then we
might have to compete with other lobbyists.

00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:04.348
We could get into a bidding war.
That's how democracy works.

00:05:04.348 --> 00:05:07.790
On the other hand, the
nutcracker room here is a sure thing.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.964
I make fun of it, but in the long run,
it's probably faster and cheaper

00:05:11.964 --> 00:05:15.500
just to build the giant nutcracker,
write it off and be done with it.

00:05:16.277 --> 00:05:16.834
BAH!

00:05:17.982 --> 00:05:18.834
There we go.

00:05:21.658 --> 00:05:23.610
Man, if I had known
about this place earlier,

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.407
I would've been tempted to get a dead pig,

00:05:25.407 --> 00:05:27.106
dress it up in a lab uniform,

00:05:27.106 --> 00:05:28.789
then throw it into the crushers here.

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:30.017
Freak everybody out.

00:05:30.017 --> 00:05:33.716
You wouldn't be able to identify
a damned thing without a lab report.

00:05:33.716 --> 00:05:36.124
The pig would probably be
drained of blood, though,

00:05:36.124 --> 00:05:38.887
so I'd have to pick up some
donor packs from Eddie to do it right.

00:05:38.887 --> 00:05:40.167
[teleportation sound]

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:40.542
[bullsquid spits]

00:05:40.542 --> 00:05:41.901
JESUS CHRIST!

00:05:43.363 --> 00:05:45.851
THAT WAS HELLA CLOSE TO ME!

00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:48.708
ANOTHER FOOT, THAT WOULD'VE
BEEN INSIDE ME!

00:05:48.708 --> 00:05:50.121
[shudders]

00:05:50.121 --> 00:05:52.480
Maybe that's what the crushers are for.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.436
For when those things teleport inside your
head and you become a walking xenomorph.

00:05:56.436 --> 00:05:59.390
They provide a nice easy way for
you to kill yourself.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.850
Like "The Fly"!

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.005
"Help meeeee..."

00:06:02.005 --> 00:06:04.453
[vortigaunt powers up]
No, not you, dammit!

00:06:04.453 --> 00:06:06.892
Your help isn't any help at all!

00:06:06.892 --> 00:06:08.367
You're just breaking things.

00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:11.200
I can do that!

00:06:12.132 --> 00:06:13.767
AND I COULD DO IT BETTER!

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:18.249
Oops.

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:18.889
Uh...

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.396
That was to prove a point.

00:06:20.396 --> 00:06:22.393
Guess nobody needs that computer now.

00:06:22.393 --> 00:06:25.145
I wonder if I just screwed
somebody using our network.

00:06:25.145 --> 00:06:26.835
Network errors are lame.

00:06:26.835 --> 00:06:29.100
They're always "404!" or "503!"

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:34.097
Why can't there be "Error 482 -
Somebody shot the server with a 12-guage.

00:06:34.097 --> 00:06:35.840
Please contact your
administrator."

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.895
Oh, uh.

00:06:36.895 --> 00:06:40.532
Quiero un poco de drogas.
¿Donde estan? Tengo dinero.

00:06:40.532 --> 00:06:41.957
SCIENTIST: Gordon Freeman,
it is you, isn't it?

00:06:41.957 --> 00:06:43.928
SCIENTIST: The Science Team has been tracking
Oh, you speak English. Even better.

00:06:43.928 --> 00:06:46.725
SCIENTIST: your progress with
the Black Mesa Security System.

00:06:46.725 --> 00:06:49.017
SCIENTIST: Unfortunately, so has
the military.

00:06:49.017 --> 00:06:51.328
SCIENTIST: That suit of yours is
full of tracking devices.

00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:51.795
What?

00:06:51.795 --> 00:06:54.167
SCIENTIST: Still, it's better
than going naked in this place.

00:06:54.532 --> 00:06:57.298
SCIENTIST: It's cold in there and you'll have to hurry.
"Tracking devices"?!

00:06:57.298 --> 00:06:59.749
SCIENTIST: It could sap your suit
power in a matter of moments.

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:00.725
I'M BEING TRACKED?!

00:07:00.725 --> 00:07:02.564
SCIENTIST: If you're bent on
reaching the Lambda Complex,

00:07:02.564 --> 00:07:03.670
SCIENTIST: then you'll want to keep
No...

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.769
SCIENTIST: to the older industrial areas
where the security system is full of holes.

00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:07.107
What?

00:07:07.107 --> 00:07:08.709
SCIENTIST: It's worked for me... so far.

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:09.990
No, shut up, shut up.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.173
What the hell is this? I have
tracking devices on me?

00:07:13.173 --> 00:07:16.102
No wonder everyone keeps
popping out to kill me!

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.740
Why could no one else be
bothered to tell me this?

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.912
You said everyone's monitoring me.

00:07:20.912 --> 00:07:22.966
That means everyone's in on this.

00:07:22.966 --> 00:07:26.000
I... I'm going to need
a minute to think about this.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.053
Okay, YOU get to live.

00:07:31.053 --> 00:07:33.934
That's about all I've decided so far.

00:07:35.208 --> 00:07:37.267
So no worries. You're good.
