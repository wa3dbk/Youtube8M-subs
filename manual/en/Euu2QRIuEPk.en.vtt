00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.230
 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.440
Dear Motorist, Dear Motorist, Dear Motorist

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.820
I am a mother, I am a daughter, and I am a cyclist

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.900
over the years cycling has kept me
healthy

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.100
It has given me a way to escape from the
pressures and stresses that life can bring

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.880
bring

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.820
I am out there riding my bike to stay healthy, to enjoy the beautiful place

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.199
where I live, and simply because I love it.  I
love the wind on my face

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.870
the sun on my face

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.500
the scenery flashing by and the feeling of satisfaction
I get from living an active

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.719
lifestyle.  Dear motorist,

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.600
I'm not a cyclist, but and my husband.  I
have a wife

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.039
she loves to ride someone almost hit for
the other day my heart stopped when I

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:48.690
heard the news

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.600
I know that cyclists can be annoying.  We may ride in your lane or

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.940
force you to slow down and wait before turning.  Until I bought a bike

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.590
I too was easily irritated by cyclists impeding my commute.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.200
The thing that a lot motorists don't realize realize is that
cycles are gonna put themselves in

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.300
whatever position they feel is safest

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.009
when you are driving a car and road
conditions become dangerous

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.050
you move

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.740
around them to keep yourself safe. It is the same with cyclists.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.820
I've taken a right hand turn in my car and
nearly missed a cyclist I

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.600
failed to see around the corner.  I've been
cycling in the shoulder of the road

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.470
and almost hit by

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.430
a distracted driver.  I live on both sides to this
discussion.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.250
I recently had a good friend of mine
killed while riding his bike

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.420
it was tragic and unnecessary.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.320
He was too young to die.  My friend lost his life doing what he loved

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.030
doing what I love.  He had a wife

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.110
and four kids.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.780
I wanna be there for my family.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.110
He no longer can be.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.200
It is easy to feel invincible, like you
are the exception to the rule

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.290
like it would never happen you or somebody you know.  In an instant

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.270
his wife and four young children's lives
were changed forever and not just theirs

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.200
but the life of that motorist will never be the same either.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.759
I think that's everybody's worst fear...

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.790
is actually

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.530
having taken someone's life or even injuring somebody.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.240
I can't imagine the guilt

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.390
I would feel like

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.920
not only for the person and I injured, but

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.890
for everybody else in that person's life. 
My friend does not have to live with that

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.960
memory every day, but the

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.040
driver who hit him

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.640
will live with that guilt every single day

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.610
for the rest of his life.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.600
I've had a really hard time getting back on
my bike since the accident

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.190
I'm afraid that every car in here coming
from

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.960
behind is gonna hit me and I  just don't wanna
ride that way.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.410
I'm at the mercy of the motorist I am
sharing the road with

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.700
you are bigger than me, you are
traveling faster than me.  If we collide

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.410
my chance of injury in the 100 times
greater than yours.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.900
every single person's life is worth a few seconds of your  time.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.560
I understand where cyclists would be
angry with the situation

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.069
I understand where motorists get frustrated

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.400
with slower-moving objects on the road.  I
have seen my fellow cyclists do some really not so

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.489
not so smart things on the road and it hurts me to think,

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.140
this is where our image comes from.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.620
Accidents can be avoided by both parties.  Cyclists need to be

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.710
conscientious of drivers and obeying the law and not just assume

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.940
that drivers are gonna look out for
them.  As a cyclist I pledge

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.130
that I will be as visible as possible

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.170
to stay as much out of your way as possible

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.440
I've made a new commitment to myself, I
will stop the distractions

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.140
when I'm behind the wheel.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.030
Please slow down and drive cautiously.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.100
There isn't anything that's going to
happen while you're driving that's more

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.760
important

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.290
than the actual act of driving.  I don't want
to leave my kids without a mother

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.600
because I didn't respect you as a motorist or you didn't respect me

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.460
as a cyclist.  More importantly, I want you to

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.500
respect my kids, even if they're still
learning to respect you

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.320
so my plea is for us all to be safe, to
be aware

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.959
to be courteous and to share the road.

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.109
sincerely your friend, sincerely

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.370
your your brother, sincerely a mother, sincerely

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.979
a cyclists' husband,

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:28.979
sincerely a cyclist.

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:37.099
