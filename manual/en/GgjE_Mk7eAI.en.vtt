00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:12.230
 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.219
 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:23.219
 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.509
Uhh, that's what you get when you hire a con-man...

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.629
 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.960
I can convince anyone of anything.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.660
See, there's a science to getting people to trust you.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.170
- I want in. - With your current skill set you don't.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.679
Maybe, you could teach me...

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.419
...in your room?

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.780
- That is so bad. - Is it?

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.300
Does it feel sexy on your face?!

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.090
- A little... - It does? Okay. Let's go.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.220
We're about thirty strong, everybody gets a percentage.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.730
Make it quick and get out.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.290
- Who's the girl? - She's our intern.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.040
- You hittin' that? - I'm right here.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.297
- No, Farhad, I'm not hittin' that. - You should hit that.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.560
 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.420
You never drop the con. Never break.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.220
 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.350
Where are all the black people?!?!

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.880
- I got this. - What?

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.780
 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.790
Sorry!

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.080
- Congratulations, you're a criminal. - You
might be one of the best I've ever seen.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.240
So what about the BIG con? I thought you were all big time.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.710
You mean the one where we make so much money we all retire?

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.950
 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.630
This needs to be discreet, no holes.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.020
You seem trustworthy, but you don't know me.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.930
 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.010
Is he a mark? That's fantastic.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.830
 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.510
He's not a guy you want to cross...

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.150
- All of it. $1.1 million. - Nicky, that's MY money too...

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.020
Now you make things interesting.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.800
There's no room for heart in this game.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.950
It'll get you killed.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.640
- How's it feel? - Wow...

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.400
There's two kinds of people in this world. There's hammers...

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.940
and nails.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.050
You decide which one you wanna be.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.900
this trailer
looks so much better than I thought it

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.480
would be

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.880
I was already this trailer which means
it's that

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.110
good it was able to not only overcome by
are prepared just like Fort

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.319
but then push me into the lake sounds so
what I like about it so much more

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.600
first law it seems like a return to form
for Will Smith this is the worst minute

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.060
everybody loves it and everybody loves
to pay to see

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.180
other Will Smith I think he's been
trying to become

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.980
with his last few movies which is
largely the father to Jade Smith

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.860
a present some other misfires to be fair
I wouldn't put it all on Jan

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.840
and the other thing is surprising to me
here is that Merkel robie looks like

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.080
she's doing a really

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.459
good job I had a big problem Michael
rupees role in the wall to wall street

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.650
as you might recall from my review I
know

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.170
she won over a number male fans with
that role I and

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.760
by other problem with urs she's been
really capitalizing on

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.489
you know michelle pfeiffer's another
actress you Mughrabi get a lot of

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:25.459
comparison

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.640
I comparisons to michelle pfeiffer
quickly moved away from that kind of sex

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.140
pot

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.340
I image but margo really seems to be
embracing it which is a very risky

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.280
strategy for one's career because

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.769
I think it really distances that actress
for having female fans

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.390
and female fan to the secret to a long
career you can be a

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.989
a flash in the pan as sexpot but it's
going to be hard for you to sustain that

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.280
career going on and that's something a
lot actresses have had to learn the hard

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.600
way

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.150
because I'm the biggest grossing actress
is about time been actresses like

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.880
Doris Day Julia Roberts actresses that
women like

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.090
MN still find attractive that's really
the sweet spot you know for

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.310
for actresses image and tomorrow the I
have felt

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.880
is making a mistake because she has this
role which is obviously very sexy

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.280
and then she's going to be in on the new
tarzan opposite Alexander scar scard

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.410
and you don't cast Alexander Skarsgard
margo will be

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.709
in less I you want the boat to take up
most of their clothing

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.030
based on their previous track record
setting that's going to be a very

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.450
fifty shades in green I as I've said
before

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.430
but she looks like she's doing a really
good job here

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.760
I hope it's a well-written role now the
only potential pitfall for this .mobi

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.900
is that you have a a blackly and

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.750
white female lead black male lead in a
white female lead and hopefully

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.830
this won't be a problem is there are so
many interracial couples today

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.370
but in the past this has been a problem
for hollywood and I've even seen people

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.240
couple people comment on this trailer

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.270
and your anger that yet another funeral
has been taken away from our

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.610
actresses caller because you could go
with multiple different ethnicities year

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.670
once again given to a white woman and
it's just a touchy

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.780
subject denzel washington had to deal
with this quite infamously when he made

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.630
I believe the pelican brief opposite
Julia Roberts and a lot of his female

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.270
fans are very upset to see him

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.050
with no on you know potential I don't
think it was too romantic in that movie

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.160
I was mostly focused on legal aspects
but to see him have like some any kind

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.010
of romantic vibe

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.010
a white female E so we'll RCC away from
that

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.870
even though their way actresses in his
movies he would protect more they were

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.570
kids

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.940
like Dakota Fanning her most recently
Chloe grace breast

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.500
he didn't wait love interest though in
flight and that

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.920
film still performed pretty well not a
huge denzel

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.410
very strong close to 100 million
domestic I well over a hundred worldwide

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.550
I N honor decent budget so it didn't
really hurt that on too much

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.210
but as you can see black male actors
have to be very careful to make those

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.400
days are numbered maybe

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.330
this will be the film bogus which really
shows that that's no longer concerned

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.630
mines is broken

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.860
I'm interested how you guys feel you
think it's an issue

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.910
I am sure it's not just from guys I'm
sure number

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.490
you know guys will jump in there and
speak up and say it's not

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.800
but the real issue is I you know
non-white women howdy

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.520
had those on how do you feel that's a
category you fall into what do you think

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.370
I've been casting

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.000
you know blonde white actors in this
role opposite Will Smith

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.260
I it's it was very interesting situation
will see

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.640
I do think the movie looks very very
good and hopefully that's not something

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.220
that's going to

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.150
bring it down began very pleasantly
surprised like the way Will Smith looks

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.990
you quite a bit

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.450
and I might win Michael Robie look so
it's quite a fan of hers on pan am

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.840
and maybe she'll find a way to I'm you
know pull this off

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.880
after all but we'll see we'll see or
what do you guys think the trailer

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.280
if you like it please leave your
thoughts down below

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.660
I've seen a few people say they think
this looks a little too obvious and how

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.800
it's going to play out

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.980
your typical you know woman i know i
double crosses the guy

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.500
you know caper film you know about
pressures are plotted famous grifter

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.310
movies course

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.190
the Drifters I so let's see if this one
to hold a candle to those spreading the

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.400
very least it looks like a

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.130
a fun you know they have a mister and
missus mint kinda by Jewett

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.960
going on there because the intense
interest from male audiences margo robie

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.460
and that of course will Smith back in
top form I think the very least

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.940
if it I memorable film would be a strong
box-office performer

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.590
potentially it's not undone by that one
problem are the other problem but

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.950
a sloppy predictable script follows a
right %uh
