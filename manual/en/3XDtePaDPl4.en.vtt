00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.448
"Egg Industry Blind Spot"

00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:07.554
The egg industry loves to boast that 
eggs have these two compounds,

00:00:07.554 --> 00:00:08.949
lutein and zeaxanthin,

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:14.830
that appear so protective against 
cataracts and macular degeneration.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.048
What the industry does is 
feed hens yellow corn, alfalfa,

00:00:18.048 --> 00:00:19.547
even marigold petals—

00:00:19.547 --> 00:00:27.080
anything to boost the egg content 
up to 166 micrograms per large egg.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.369
So, they say, don’t worry about 
the whole cholesterol thing;

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.741
eat eggs to protect your sight.

00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:41.197
Eggs can actually have 
up to 250 micrograms;

00:00:41.197 --> 00:00:45.319
a cup of carrots, 
though, has over 1,000.

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:52.218
A single serving of collard 
greens, closer to 15,000,

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:59.420
and a serving of kale tops
the chart at nearly 24,000.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.696
One spoonful of spinach 
has as much as nine eggs.

00:01:06.696 --> 00:01:08.829
One spoonful!

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:13.601
For eye protection, the 
recommendation is to get 10,000 a day.

00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:16.510
So that’s like a third-cup of spinach

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.718
or 40 eggs.

00:01:19.718 --> 00:01:23.539
More than three cartons 
of eggs a day, every day.

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.488
That’s nutrition unscrambled?

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:32.901
Here are the top ten sources of these 
critical eyesight-saving nutrients.

00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:36.041
All greens.

00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:39.880
Eggs don’t even make the top 100.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.691
To get to eggs, you have to 
scroll down a couple pages,

00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:44.879
and according to the USDA,

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:50.238
come in right behind Cap’n 
Crunch with Crunch Berries.

00:01:50.238 --> 00:01:57.290
There are more phtyonutrients in 
Crunch Berries than there are in eggs.
