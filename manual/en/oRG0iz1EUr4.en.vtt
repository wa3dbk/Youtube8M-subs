00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.679
and this is "Dressed To The Nines."

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:12.010
As you know, it is Breast Cancer awareness
month.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.010
Nine West is helping to support

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.910

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.920
Lets kick of THIS week with

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.940
our red carpet round up.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.930
Jennifer Hudson is a Breast cancer

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.980
awareness ambassador

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.950
and we love her style.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.500
She rocked this gunmetal Donna Karan

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.630
dress in her native Chicago this week.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.690
The simple St Laurent sandals are

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.430
a great finisher since it's not that cold
yet.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.430
We also saw Jennifer perform at a

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.500
fundraiser in this fun Peter Pilotto

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.500
jersey print-dress.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.530
Again, the Oscar and Grammy winner

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.480
opted for St Laurent stems.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.700
These ankle booties are to die for!

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.800
We love her!

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.650
Kate Hudson hit a dinner in Malibu

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.860
looking red HOT in Versace.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.220
The mother of two has a ridiculous body

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.921
and this dress hugs every curve.

00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:07.020
I love her choice of the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.680
grommetted pointed toe pumps.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.040
We saw this dress in black on the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.460
Spring 2011 runway with fun nude sandals.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.940
Kate made a great choice

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.780
adding the embellished pumps for fall!

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.010
Katy Perry is playing a show to

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.510
benefit breast cancer at the

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.240
Hollywood bowl on October 23rd.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.690
I can't wait!

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.161
Katy was on Jimmy Fallon this week

00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:25.940
looking like a funky schoolgirl

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.030
complete with pigtails!

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.750
She rocked a House Of Holland Spring 2014

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.369
collared top with a black mini skirt

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.900
black over the knee socks

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.409
and killer buckle biker boots!

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.420
On the runway, we saw this top with

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.980
textured cigarette pants and simple sandals.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.800
We love that Katy made this her own

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.000
like she always does!

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.140
Nine West has these amazing

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.420
buckled biker boots called the Tyler.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.770
These will add a sophisticated edge

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.170
to any look from dresses

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.250
and tights to pants or jeans.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.250
And with the 1 inch heel

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.890
you can wear them all day at school or work.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.890

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.460
Are you ready to Guess whose shoe?

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.400
Which hot actress recently went blonde

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.080
and rocked these killer spiked pumps this
week?

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.080
It's Ashley Green!!

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.321
The beautiful actress rocked a

00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:10.269
Pierre Balmain little black racer dress to

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.529
the New York Premiere of CBGB: The Movie.

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:14.459
Major trend alert with those Christian Louboutin

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.459
studded pumps!

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.249
She looks like a sexy rocker

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:19.209
ala CBGB's back in the day

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.810
with a modern twist!

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.749
Awesome, Ashley!

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.680
All hail QUEEN!!!

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.120
This week our shoe queen is Sandra Bullock.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.569
Sexy Sandra SMOLDERED at the

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.069
BFI film festival in London.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.870
Of course, her latest film,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.049
Gravity is a huge hit

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.180
and so is this look!

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.180
WOW!

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.739
Sandra chose a black lace Stella McCartney

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.769
Spring 2014 long sleeve mini-dress

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.989
with black satin peep toe Charlotte Olympia
pumps.

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.930
These shoes are super sexy superstars!

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.790
I also lover her wavy locks

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.340
and that pop of color on the lip!

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.340
Stunning, Sandra!

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.530
It's time for shoe shock!

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.409
We were in shock over Anna Faris's

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.090
look at People's "One To Watch" party in LA.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.849
The funny lady opted for an

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.569
ill fitting blue dress with a hemline

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.260
that's supposed to be calf length

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.030
but hits almost at her ankles.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.930
We saw this dress on Debby Ryan

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.109
this summer and it fit her way better!

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.170
Anna has a HOT figure
so I wonder why she didn't have it form fitted.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.370
Also, the black pumps seem heavy

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.180
and next to that bad hemline

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.809
totally cut off her 5 foot 5 frame.

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:24.779
Sorry girl - this look needs a tailor

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:25.810
and a different shoe.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.120
BUT hey, I TOTALLY love your new show, Moms!

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.120
It's funny and totally a guide of what

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.779
I'm NOT going to do as a Mom!

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:34.779
No really...

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:36.689
Well, that's it for this week.

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:37.790
Check back next week for an

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.029
