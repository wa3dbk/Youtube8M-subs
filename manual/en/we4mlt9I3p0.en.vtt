When the batteries are full or even if they
are not quite full, with these big wires here,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:14.570
the energy runs to this inverter. The inverter
is an electronic and electric unit that is

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:22.920
able to use the 24 volts that are going in
here and then changing it from a direct current,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.120
what they call DC, to Amplitude current, called
AC. An outcome, here, is what you use for

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.600
your house. That's a normal switch, that's
a normal plug here, where we have out light

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.350
in here. So, in a moment we are working with
solar to get the light in here and to show

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.739
you that it's so easy to store the electricity
in batteries, to convert it to the power you

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.800
want to. This one is 110, this black box,
here, we brought with us from Germany, and

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.460
this one will convert not to 110 but to 220
because that's what we use over in Germany.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.440
Then it goes up there to the house and we
have our plug-ins and you can run your TV

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:16.210
and your computer and your everything. What
is not using too much power, you can run on

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.140
solar. And, this way, usually when you have
weather like today, beautiful sunshine and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.220
wind, we use no electricity from the grid
at all. Grid, the grid means, the grid is

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.799
called what the electric provider is providing
to you. So, in a moment our meter does not

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.119
run at all because all of our electricity
for the freezer, for the refrigerator, everything

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.979
comes out of the batteries. When we have bad
days, what happens too, there is no sun, no

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.189
wind, then about after two days the batteries
are empty. So they shut down by themselves,

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.659
nothing can happen, but then we need the power
from the grid. And so, we have an electricity

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.110
bill and what we pay for electricity a month
is sometimes $2, sometimes $8, sometimes $12,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.489
but in average we are about $5 to $7 a month
what we pay because the rest of it we get

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.480
from our solar and wind energy.
