00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:09.360
he he everyone's gone off from the
founder David out the Sony Xperia Z

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.990
dual are not this is Sony's a new selfie
centric smartphone

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.240
as you can see haha front camera with a
flash

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.859
was a finding a pixel count of so you
know you can take better pictures of

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:21.589
yourself

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:26.130
and also to bacha we have an 8 megapixel
camera with an LED flash

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.249
on that thing although already in design
I

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.149
in documenting to life no like 15 min
720

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.680
display Bart are to be very honest its
while the slimmest

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.570
like that be seen are even though it's
like a huge are

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.280
you can see thicknesses very slim are
sony has been always going to have been

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.379
designed

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.030
smartphone is no exception I UK Ave

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.699
nice-looking are you know chrome finish
on the edges

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.859
of course you have your standard only
about design which

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.769
Sony are so young Ron Paul gotten the
volume control

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.180
there was on account a sharp cookie on

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.390
up you can't see back to Idaho clearly

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.510
but this law for you to put dog the same

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.920
or has are tree inside

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.920
to micro sim slots Leah

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.200
it will send a wise overall I think it's
are very good looking device

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.750
even though it's quite big heart is also
my credit card

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.210
function micro USB or on

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.870
talk with his only 23.5 jock are you
cannot remove the bar

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.540
on so I is a unibody design I think of

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.470
is vented on you know even the plastics
they don't look on doctor you know

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.050
she although it's saw slightly does take
up a bit ok you know

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.430
games onto dog in all doctor gets lower
talking

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.500
or a lighting design and scored I know
you know a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.830
marzo are so he is always like I said
all that good design

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.370
I'd front you have big lost on re-define

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.340
15 min 720 display it is you know Chris
Paul the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.770
pixel density goes down because lot
size: it still looks pretty good in all

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:09.270
Sony

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.600
other so while driving I trying to
manage the space technology

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.090
which to stop the caller well as you
know the shoppers on

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.410
on display I find look at the front W

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.240
to PCR to lots thing these on our

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.580
the loudspeaker arms you be consistent
about you

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.970
this the microphones the GOP's
loudspeakers actually on the Bach

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.210
so yes I you think you know you get us
to you all

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.010
speakers you know it's on the front
small are are there is a small any

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.630
are indicate over hapless some loss and
so does of course like I said that the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.660
front cam on

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.150
small saw of any you know you can be

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.340
Google all century or I think

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.500
fits right in the heart and is are very
slim like I said

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.010
by a big science I'm not be in our

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.990
no both cook have a big fans of peace he
would sign devices right thing you know

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.780
of or something like twenty something
that 22,000 back at this is a very good

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.720
looking device

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.319
are all die mentions are court its land

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.500
yes you conduct the Bach by and you know
extremes very nice

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.080
lower so I think c3 are from Sony

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.440
are I'm device going for something that
looks really good quite good now

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.480
he hits
