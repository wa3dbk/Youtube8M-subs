00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.330
Whereas our native grasses are are long adapted to the climate that we have here

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.839
One of the big constraints is that the native grasses?

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.319
If you look at the cool season grasses, they're very pliable and palatable the native grasses are

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.319
stiffer and that's because they

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.000
because

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.389
Nitrogen and moisture were so limited

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.540
They actually build structures in their leaves they have a different kind of photosynthesis than our typical forage grasses

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.559
So there's a lot of fiber in this and even actually less

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.160
Fewer nitrogen rich enzymes for photosynthesis so our native grasses are just a lot more

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.869
Efficient in terms of using the resources here, but that doesn't make them so good for

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.460
cattle forage so the idea of what we wanted to try here is introducing native leggings since these systems, so

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.079
Looking at something that's complementary to the to the prairies to boost

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.579
nitrogen versus adding fertilizer or even trying to add

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.849
typical forage legumes which just with the way their growing season is it doesn't coincide very well with what the

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.289
prairies do so if you

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:16.660
Seated in a lot of red clover

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.479
You could kind of shade out a lot of the things that you really wanted in the Prairie in the long run, so

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.639
We looked at primarily two things we looked at this across the diversity gradient, so

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.789
in our switchgrass monocultures our lowest diversity just one native species and then

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.439
successively more diverse prairies with more native species incorporated

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.389
And what we then we looked at management so things that we could do to limit the?

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.679
Competition for those legumes two things so we looked at rotational stocking with cattle bringing in

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.069
janet's Holstein heifers to graze periodically and

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.369
Open up the canopy and let more light down to the soil

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.829
and then we also compared that to mowing which is a tool that most farmers could do and

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.219
many conservation organizations already do some

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.089
so we looked at diversity and the tools and

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.220
interceded

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.519
leggings in a split split flat design and

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.789
Unfortunately after two years we basically saw

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:25.539
Zero recruitment of leggings there there were seedlings here and there but from a biological or ecological

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.459
Forage aspect those those legumes aren't really a major

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.430
component of the system so

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.548
Future research I think would have to drill down more on

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.110
timing of interceding or different kinds of management to really try to

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.299
Complement that so we were trying to do a broad range of things here and that

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.039
We weren't able to drill down as well on that, but we were still able to

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.410
Quantify the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.979
Forage quality in these different diversity levels which is something that we hadn't been able to do for this part of the country

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.200
Previously, and we also looked at the effects of mowing and grazing and just typical more hands-off conservation

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.089
Management just with prescribed fire on the prairies and what we found was that

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.739
Grazing didn't really cause a big change in the plant community over time so

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.510
this is

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.090
Rotational grazing with cattle where they're allowed to be selective and choose grasses and legumes

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.530
Actually, it could be integrated with a lot of our existing conservation

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.759
lands so we could do more more adaptive management research going in the future on that I think and

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.500
make our

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500
restoration of native species more

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.349
economic for all landowners of all stripes

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.019
the mowing really

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.889
Depressed a lot of our native forbs, so if you look out across here

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.820
The tall species with brought these that you see standing up those are

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.960
native

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.479
Sunflowers we see some. There's some yellow coneflower already flowering here

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.490
Goldenrods, so those are really important species for pollinators

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.329
And they help support the food web with all the insects that they support

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:19.189
so we like to see those, but in some cases things like Canada goldenrod can be a real problem in our perennial grasslands and

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.290
mowing that twice during the summer really started to depress some of those more weedy species

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.950
So I think what's exciting about this project is it

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.880
Starts to scratch the surface more on some of the more active management

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:39.709
we could be taking with our native grasslands, so not just burning and you know doing some hand cutting to get rid of shrubs but

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:48.140
mowing and grazing and different combinations of these things could really start to create more niches for different kinds of plants and wildlife and

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.770
also, I think

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.770
Helped to integrate

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.440
These types of community communities more into working farms. Where people also need to be able to make a profit

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.440
off of the land that they have out there
