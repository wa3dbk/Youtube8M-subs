00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.079
Hold on slow down 

00:00:23.992 --> 00:00:28.426
Again from the top now and tell me everything.

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:31.448
I know I`ve been gone for 
What seems like forever

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.392
But I`m here now waiting

00:00:33.773 --> 00:00:35.803
To convince you that I`m not
A ghost or a stranger

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:40.770
But closer than you think

00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:43.425
She said just go on to what you

00:00:43.763 --> 00:00:48.255
Pretend is your life but

00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:52.149
Please don`t die on me

00:00:52.178 --> 00:00:55.696
Wings won`t take me

00:00:55.696 --> 00:00:58.853
Heights don`t phase me

00:00:58.853 --> 00:01:01.276
So take a step

00:01:02.158 --> 00:01:06.778
But don`t look down, take a step

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:11.714
Now I`m standing on the rooftop 
ready to fall (ready to fall)

00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:15.342
I think I'm at the edge now but
 I could be wrong

00:01:15.294 --> 00:01:21.243
I'm standing on the rooftop ready to fall

00:01:25.303 --> 00:01:29.296
Perpetual motion 
the image wont focus

00:01:29.175 --> 00:01:32.358
A blur is all that's seen

00:01:32.824 --> 00:01:36.870
But here in this moment like
 the eye of the storm

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.545
It all came clear to me

00:01:39.837 --> 00:01:41.701
I found a shoulder to lean on

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:47.603
An infallible reason to live all by itself

00:01:47.552 --> 00:01:50.956
I took one last look from the heights that I once loved

00:01:50.956 --> 00:01:54.912
And then I ran like hell

00:01:55.437 --> 00:01:58.928
Wings won't take me

00:01:58.928 --> 00:02:02.023
Heights don't phase me

00:02:02.023 --> 00:02:05.099
So take a step

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.560
But don't look down take a step

00:02:10.814 --> 00:02:15.115
Now I'm standing on the rooftop 
ready to fall (ready to fall)

00:02:15.115 --> 00:02:18.598
I think I'm at the edge now 
but I could be wrong

00:02:17.952 --> 00:02:24.614
Now I'm standing on the rooftop 
ready to fall (ready to fall)

00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:30.252
I count the times that Ive been sorry

00:02:30.368 --> 00:02:33.312
I know I know

00:02:33.312 --> 00:02:36.848
Now my compassion slowly drowns

00:02:36.848 --> 00:02:40.378
I know I know

00:02:40.504 --> 00:02:44.020
If there's a time these walls could guard you

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.696
I know I know

00:02:48.452 --> 00:02:54.835
then let that time be right now

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:05.679
Now I'm standing on the rooftop

00:03:06.712 --> 00:03:09.136
Now I'm standing on the rooftop

00:03:09.136 --> 00:03:10.791
ready to fall

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.959
Now I'm standing on the rooftop 
ready to fall (ready to fall)

00:03:13.856 --> 00:03:18.002
I think I'm at the edge now 
but I could be wrong
