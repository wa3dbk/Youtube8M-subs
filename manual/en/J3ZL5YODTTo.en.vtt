00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.770
My name is Jill Weiss, and I'm going to tell
you just a little bit about how to play third

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.760
base. Third base is one of those positions
where the athletes have very, very strong

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:22.250
arms. Their reaction time is super quick.
They're able to retrieve balls from the right

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.470
side, retrieve balls from the left side, from
their backhand, retrieve line drives right

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:36.250
at their face. They're agile. They can move
forward. They can move backward. They communicate

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.059
with the pitchers. They communicate with the
catchers. They communicate with the outfielders.

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.510
And they communicate with the shortstop. The
main thing is is remembering that short game,

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.090
as a third baseman. On the short game, they
have to be able to field the bunt. They have

00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:01.059
to be quick, and they've got to get rid of
that ball. Because the ball is coming so fast,

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.170
usually, to third base, they do have a little
bit more time than the shortstop to set up

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.390
and throw to whatever base that they need
to throw to. Third base is also one of those

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:25.570
positions where they have to communicate and
know where they are in position to their base,

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:40.360
if they have to cover for a steal. Overall,
third basemans have to, they have reaction

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.520
time. It's all about where the ball is and
thinking about that next play and whether

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.810
they have to cover the position on a steal,
and overall, just communication with their

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.530
teammates. My name is Jill Weiss, and those
are just a few tips on how to play third base.
