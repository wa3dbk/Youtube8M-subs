00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:08.880
NARRATOR&gt;&gt; Two kilometres offshore from Smoky
Cape,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.230
near South West Rocks, NSW, is Fish Rock.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.129
This popular destination for divers has several
possible dive sites,

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.560
and its most famous is a 125-metre cave, which
cuts through the rock's centre.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.289
Fish Rock Cave's deepest entrance is 24 metres,
and from here,

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.150
you make your way through and up an area known
as the Chimneys,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.259
on through a still-dark 62-metre tunnel,

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.309
until finally reaching a 25-metre stretch
blessed with ambient light.

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.980
The cave finishes with a cavern at a depth
of about 12 metres.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.010
I'm here today with South West Rocks Dive
Centre,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.610
and after an initial dive on the rock's outskirts
and an hour's rest,

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:54.940
I follow dive guide Matt towards the cave's
seaward side, its deepest entrance.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.430
Before commencing our journey into the cave's
confines,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.300
we test our dive torches and make sure we
have at least 150 bar of air.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.790
And then it's time.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.920
Following Matt and telling myself I can do
this,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.079
I enter the cave's narrow, dark reaches,

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:12.880
thankful that my powerful video lights return
a much wider beam than a tiny torch.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.600
Being underwater, in a situation where I can't
just swim to the surface should something

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.759
go wrong,

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.590
is a bit freaky, I admit.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.600
This is my first cave dive, and I do have
to focus on remaining calm.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.600
After rising from the Chimney into the Tunnel,
Matt points out some crayfish.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.150
I take a quick look, but I'm more interested
in reaching the ambient light than observing

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.570
anything at this point.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.290
Soon after passing a resting wobbegong shark,

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.680
a dim turquoise glow appears in the distance:
the cave's end.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.450
Seeing the light is reassuring,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.640
and, finally, I begin to relax and enjoy this
experience.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.470
As we approach the cavern, schools of brilliant
fish cloud the water.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.300
And then I see the star of Fish Rock: the
critically endangered grey nurse shark.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.680
The rock is a critical habitat for this species,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.050
and since the cave's waters are about one
degree warmer than the surrounding waters,

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.630
they often swim here.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.770
Kevin, one of the dive shop's owners,

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.110
said he's seen over 50 sharks here on more
than one occasion,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.950
and over 100 in the rock's deep end gutter.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.330
Only a couple are swimming in the cavern this
morning,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.040
but that's enough to completely spellbind
me.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.500
I watch, awed by the power and grace of these
beautiful creatures.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.090
The grey nurse isn't the only shark species
in this cave.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.250
About a half dozen wobbegongs are nearly piled
upon one another,

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.740
competing for space in these warmers waters.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.360
Finally, we leave the cave and make our way
back towards the boat.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.090
This has been the most exhilarating dive I've
ever experienced,

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.170
and, now, the thought of swimming through
the cave isn't nearly as intimidating.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.000
I relish the thought of pausing in its cavern
again sometime

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.030
and observing the gentle majesty of those
beautiful sharks therein.
