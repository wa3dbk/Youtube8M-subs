I'm Kaye, and I'm a late bloomer.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.320
(whistling logo)

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.320
One of the most rewarding things to grow in an

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:19.580
urban garden is kale. It's hearty, its
nutritious, can be delicious, and it comes

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.120
in different colors and it's what I've
had the most luck with. Come check out my

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.630
kale story. The parkway got a makeover
the end of November, and I planted almost

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.399
half of it with 11 kale plants, which I
started from seed in diatomaceous earth

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.220
on October the ninth.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.960
Look at those roots
in D.E.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.600
I used a lot of biodynamic compost in
the planting hole, which got the kale off

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.780
to a great start.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.920
I covered the parkway in red voile, to
keep off cabbage moths and sat back and

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.180
watched them grow. Wow, this is Lacinato kale. This looks awesome.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm going to juice this today.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.340
There's probably enough
servings of kale right here to feed a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.100
whole school classroom. I could probably
make do with two plants but, no, I have

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:41.580
three red bore, big purple one, I have
three winter bore, I have two lacinato,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:50.190
and I have three white Russian, over here.
Winter bore and red bore are basically

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:58.890
the same kale, same leaf structure, but
red bore is this deep red purple color

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.240
and winter bore is beautiful green. That is
the healthiest color of green, really, when

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.150
you think about it. It's Easter, and every
gardener I know has already planted

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.260
tomatoes, so I'm going to be giving a lot
of his kale away today, so I can clear

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.930
the space for tomatoes. Just cut from the
bottom up. That should be enough to start.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.190
Ryan, you just happened to walk
along and you got some free kale. That's

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.390
right, look at this, the whole bundle
worth! This is amazing. I've walked by a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.880
few times and admire your garden and I
really appreciate that you... You like kale?

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.540
I love kale. What do you like best about
kale? Just the taste and the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.450
healthiness of it, being able to eat
healthy. There's nothing like it.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.680
Just before I gave away the kale, I was
featured in a spring home and garden

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.269
section of the local paper.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.170
Kale is so versatile. You can eat it raw
in salads, you can make chips out of it,

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.020
you can stir fry it, saute it, braise it,
put it in soups and stews, but today I'm

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:25.230
going to make kale mallung or mallum, which
is Sri Lankan kale with coconut. So,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.709
let's see how that goes.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.230
Okay, here goes.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:58.090
That's pretty good!
The coconut makes it. I tried chips made

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.239
out of this lacinato kale. I'm cutting
all of the leaves today. It's unfortunate

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.270
I could probably keep this year all year.
It's such a monster healthy plant. So I

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:20.220
made my first kale chips yesterday and I
thought I'd try one for breakfast.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:31.750
Let me try different one. That one wasn't
particularly crispy. You know what? They

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:39.060
lost their crispiness overnight. Wait.
No, no it's got to be, ah! This one looks crispy.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:55.170
Okay, if at first you don't succeed, try,
try again. Kale has so many attributes. I

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.140
have to read them, I can't even remember
them all.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:05.370
Kale is low in calorie, high in fiber, and
zero fat. It's high in iron, high in

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.290
vitamin K, it's filled with powerful
antioxidants, it's a great

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.690
anti-inflammatory food, it's great for
cardiovascular support, high in vitamin A,

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.720
vitamin C, calcium, and it's a great detox
food. What are you waiting for?

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.460
You've got to grow kale.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.780
I hope you
enjoyed this episode and please share

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.600
with friends. Everyone needs to be
growing and eating kale. Please come back

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.980
for the wrap-up of my third winter
garden. I'm Kaye, I'm a late bloomer,

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.480
thanks for watching, see you next time.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.120
(bloopers) It's Easter, and every gardener I know is

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:53.000
already planted it's Easter it's Easter
and every gardener I know has already

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.980
planted there  it's Easter in every
guard it's Easter the parrots are right

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.550
over there.
They're so mad I didn't plant

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.100
sunflowers. They just come around to remind
me why didn't you plant sunflowers

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:18.240
and I have three white Russian oops, kind of
breaks, kind of easily

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.140
