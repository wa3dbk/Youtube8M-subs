00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:08.079
The IQ260 gives photographers a unique
opportunity to shoot exposures of up to

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.000
one hour and get images that
are virtually noise-free from

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.700
this massive 60 megapixel sensor.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.740
It's not ideal to shoot long exposures
in bright outdoor conditions but

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.030
with a bit of help from this 10-stop ND
filter, I should be able to exploit

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.680
the capabilities of this digital back.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.020
For the shoot today I'm using the IQ260.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.840
I'm using a Phase One 645DF+,
a 35 mm lens, and a cable release.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.700
I'm mounting the camera system on
a really steady tripod to make sure

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.940
it doesn't move during exposure.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.000
The conditions are pretty still
today but if is a bit more windy,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.649
I might want to weigh it down
with a camera bag or a sandbag.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.800
To activate the long exposure mode, 
simply tap ISO on the home screen,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.250
go to Long Exposure Mode, On, 
and I'm going to use the default

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.129
ISO 140 setting.

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.260
All IQ backs have useful tools to help
aid composition, so before I take a shot

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.860
I'm going to use the alignment tool to 
help ensure I get a straight horizon.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.640
Before I attach the ND filter to the front
of the lens, I'm going to compose my shot

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.280
and then set the exposure setting in the
current ambient conditions at ISO 140.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.700
I want a shutter speed of around 1/30s,
so I'm going to adjust the aperture to f/16.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.510
Once I have captured the test shot I'm 
going to press the context menu icon

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.030
in the plain mode to get
some really useful options.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.600
Press the grid option to get an
overlay on your current image.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.750
Long press this option to
get some preset Grid Mode.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.790
There's also Line Style and Color choices to help
the grid stand out against the captured image.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.590
This plain mode also has an useful
tools to help check exposure.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.340
There's a histogram option, there's also an
exposure warning tool that will highlight

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.780
any areas that may be blown up.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.030
There's also Black and White preview
mode that'll help you instantly see what

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.980
your image looks like in monotone.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.960
I'm happy with the composition and
exposure, so it's time to fit this ND filter

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.970
that's known as the big stopper.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.990
It's now time to change the
shutter speed on the camera.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.560
I currently shoot on 1/30s but if
I rehearse the table on this back,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.400
I can see that I've go to adjust the
shutter speed now to thirty seconds.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.080
Before I take the shot, I'm going to
firstly put the camera in mirror up mode

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.660
to stop any vibrations that that may cause.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.470
I'm going to close the eyepiece
shutter to stop any stray light.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.200
If you're really cautious you can also
wrap the whole camera with something

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.170
like a lens wrap to stop any light
leak that might get into the camera.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.270
I'm now finally ready to take the shot.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.180
I really like the effect but I'm going to
experiment with some different shutter

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.200
speed settings as the ambient
light is dipping at the moment.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.880
I'm also hoping the weather
conditions will change.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.769
It's a bit clear at the moment and I'd
like a few clouds to add a bit of drama.

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.650
I'm also hoping the wind will pick up to
give the water a bit more of a fluid look.
