00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:08.029
'I love the excitement of getting onto the
motorcycle and knowing that theoretically

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.783
I can ride for as long as I want and I can
go absolutely anywhere.

00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:23.040
That kind of independence and freedom is for
me as close as one can get to Nirvana.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.040
My name is Chris, I'm a former Royal Marine.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.410
I served for eight years.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.240
I was injured and medically discharged.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.839
I've been in Afghanistan for two years and
I decided some time ago, probably about a

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:39.690
year and a half ago, that it would be terribly
exciting to buy a motorcycle here and ride

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.140
it back.'

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.804
1 motorcycle / 1 4x4 / 16 countries / 7500
km / Some of the most hostile terrain on the

00:00:48.804 --> 00:00:49.804
planet.

00:00:49.804 --> 00:00:55.519
'It was still going to be very much a rag-tag
affair sourcing vehicles from Kabul, Afghanistan

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.010
and riding them back to London.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.100
I got in touch with a charity called Mission
Motorsport, which is an affiliated charity

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.460
of Help for Heroes.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.330
So I got in touch with the guys and said,
"I would like to do this and raise money for

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.890
you".

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:22.960
They do a lot of pretty unique work taking
guys who have been through the system and

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:31.030
who are leaving the military, who have been
injured, guys who have got sick and putting

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:38.130
them into an environment where you can recreate
some of the teamwork, the camaraderie, the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.710
adrenaline, in a positive environment whilst
the guys are undergoing medical treatment

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.210
and other types of treatment.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.870
I was completely overwhelmed by people's interest
in what I wanted to do, to the point where

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:59.900
the trip became bigger than just me on a motorcycle
and so we decided to have a support vehicle

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.659
come with us, come with me, and I asked Domenic
to come along.'

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.780
'He said "Let's go" and I said "Sure why not"
and very quickly it started becoming more

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.780
real.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.780
We got a car.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.980
We got somebody to help fix it up.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.850
Everything got painted, we got some gear,
we started taking day trips.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.069
Now it's about two months out and it's starting
to get quite real, so yes, a little apprehension

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.069
starting to pop up.

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.370
So we're going to head up through Afghanistan,
which I guess is the hairy part, then a few

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.980
of the other 'stans' and I guess we'll just
pull off to the side of the road every night,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.620
pitch a tent, heat up some beans and keep
going.'

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.370
'Not everybody out here is the enemy.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.540
Actually the reality is that 99.9 per cent
of the people here are desperate to get along,

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.080
they're very, very friendly, they're kind,
they are normal people and I like getting

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.349
out and seeing that.'
