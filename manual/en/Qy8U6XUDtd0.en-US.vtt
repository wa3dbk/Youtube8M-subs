00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Oh! That's a little penguin!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Don't be scared, little one. 
You must have 
fallen out of the nest!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Don, let's get him home, eh?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Don't be scared, little one!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
That's it. We have come.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You should come again! 
Then we can play some more!

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
All right, I'll come. Good-bye!

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'm back!

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I have a real friend now! You know...

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Lolo! Didn't I tell you 
not to go anywhere alone?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Have you forgotten? 
I should punish you.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Sonny, you shouldn't 
do that anymore

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Mommy was so worried about you.
And Daddy too.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We thought that you were 
gone. We almost went crazy.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
You promise us that 
you won't do so more?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I won't.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
In the middle of January, little penguins, 
which is already a bit grown up, 
are gathered to a kind of a kindergarten.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
There tutors train them 
by various everyday knowledge.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now then... Children!

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Quiet now, children! 
What did I say?!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Quiet.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So. We, penguins, have 
two kinds of enemies -

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
- on the land and in the sea.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Our first enemy... m-m-m is... 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
There! Skua-seagulls.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
They watch you, little 
penguins, from the sky.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Here's how now. See? Here.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Therefore you always should watch 
if there's any of them above your head.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And if they attack you, 
run and hide somewhere! 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Got it?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Yes!

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Good fellows. And our 
enemy in the sea is -

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
- here! Do you see?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
There is a black fin 
sticking out of water right there.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
That's a Killer Whale.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
He has a lot of power, 
a lot of anger, a lot of teeth.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And if someone 
goes near it...

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It'll eat you 
in a moment!

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And there, on a block 
of ice, is a Leopard Seal.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Why are you laughing?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Well, they can only 
attack you in the water. 
00:03:57,00:03:53
But you've got nothing to be 
afraid of when you're on the shore.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Grandfather Pigo, and 
do we have any friends?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Friends? M-m-m... 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Look, do you see 
fountain of water there?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
There. That's a Blue Whale.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
He is our friend.
That's a very kind friend.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Grandfather Pigo!

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
What now, Lolo?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And what about 
that great beast?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Oh,that!

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
This beast is called 
as the Elephant Seal.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
He only eats fish and he's 
of no danger to us absolutely!

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And he's very calm
Wait a moment.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Here, do you see? He's very 
calm. And totally harmless.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Let go! Let me go, I said!

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Listen to me attentively, kids.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
To run fast, you need to pull 
forward your neck. That's it.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Spread out your wings. That's right

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And now, run! All together!

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
You're running too fast, Lolo! 
You'll get tired quickly!

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Today we'll learn to jump.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Try to jump, Gigi.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
One, two, three! Great!

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Now you, Zizi.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
One, two, three! Good!

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Now you, Pepe.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
What's wrong, Pepe?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Oh, I'm scared!

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Don't be scared! If you 
want, I'll jump with you.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
All right! Jump 
together then! One, two, three!

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Lolo, you overdid it again!

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Mentor Nini, when are you going 
to teach us how to swim in the sea?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
It's too early yet. You don't have such 
strong feathers as grown-up penguins

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
So it's too early for 
you to go out to the sea.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
What a pity!

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
O! Interesting...

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Nini! Lolo has fallen into the water!

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
You see! I told you, it's 
too early to go into the sea!

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Look what may happen to you!

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Let's learn to roll down from mountain.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
May I?
