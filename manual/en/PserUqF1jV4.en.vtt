bjbj Mike Chang: Hey, what s up guys? This
is Mike Chang with sixpackshortcuts.com and

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:11.050
we are doing big ass arm day today. So we
are at my buddy s gym, private gym, really

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.330
simple. Got some barbells and dumbbells, heavy
ass weight, and in big ass arm today we are

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.880
going to be working on big ass triceps. So
follow me. We are going to be doing three

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.350
exercises today. First one is going to be
Skull Crushers and I just have a barbell right

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:33.260
here. You can do this with straight bar or
you can do this with easy curl bar. And next

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.690
exercise we are going to walk over here. This
is just a basic simple pull up station, and

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.350
pretty much every gym has it. We are going
to be using the dip bars. We are going to

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.329
do dips and then afterwards we are going to
go to the bench-press and we are going to

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.280
do close grip bench. So let s make sure you
get your form right before we build big ass

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.930
arms and not get a big ass injury. Alright
let s do it. So with skull crushers, there

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.270
is a lot different ways that people do skull
crushers and I have pretty much experimented

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.680
with all of them and what I have found to
be really, really effective. I am going to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.720
show you two ways. So most people they do
a skull crusher. They come down to their skull

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.939
or their forehead. They go like this and then
they come back up. Well that is the proper

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.200
form of how to do a skull crusher, but you
want to go ahead and make sure you get a good

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.049
stretch on your muscles and your triceps that
s what going to make them bigger if it is

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.170
that full right posture. So instead of going
to your forehead, you are going to go above

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.720
your forehead, above your head, right here
and then come back up. It is going to look

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:51.590
like this. Just like that. Now, what I recently
have been doing now to really go ahead and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.490
bring out those triceps to get more range
of motion so I can work on more triceps is

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:04.299
I come to here and prepared to give that extra
stretch, back to here and then I come up.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.979
So I am going to go and show you that again.
Come down above your head, go ahead and get

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.550
that stretch and then one movement back up.
So it is almost like two movements going down

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:40.550
and one movement going up. So I am going to
do a few reps to show you. That works and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.420
good buddy of mine name is Moe New York showed
me that. Dude has some sick, sick ass arms,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.599
huge triceps. He showed me how to do those.
I have been doing those now. Really, really

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.920
good. I can really feel those in my triceps.
So thanks a lot Moe. And even though the weight

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.300
is not very heavy, but when you get that full
range like that it really, really works your

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:11.599
triceps. So you want to go ahead and do a
superset between the skull crushers and dips.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:18.830
So this is pretty basic. On here, a lot of
guys like to go all the way down to where

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:26.310
their elbows are way beyond 90. Personally
for me it is a lot of stress on my shoulders

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.810
and I feel some stress here on the elbows
also. So personally for me I go by 90 degrees.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.930
It is up to you. If you are really, really
flexible you can come down a little more.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.720
I would probably recommend even though a full
range of motion is good, but when it comes

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.742
to like dips you probably want to stay at
about 90 just to be safe, as we do it. And

00:03:45.742 --> 00:03:50.990
if doesn t hurt right now and you can do it,
it is probably only a matter of time before

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.260
it starts to hurt and you are going to have
to limit your range of motion anyways. And

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.887
then when you do you are also little injured.
So you want to be safe, stick with my 90 degrees

00:04:01.887 --> 00:04:20.280
here and just come back up. Just like that.
So on your dips you want to do pretty much

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:27.000
as many as you can. You can go to failure.
On your skull crushers you want to go with

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.050
about six sets. So six sets total, six sets
of about 8 reps, 8-10 reps. When you come

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.720
to your dips either go to failure or go to
about 10-15 reps. And if you feel like you

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.780
can do about 30 reps because you are very,
very light you can always go ahead and grab

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.590
one of those weight belts and hang like a
dumbbell on there or plate on there and you

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:55.280
can do more reps or more weight. So make sure
you do six super sets nonstop, back and forth

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:02.280
with no rest, six sets total and after that
you can come to bench-press. We are going

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:11.360
to go with the closed press bench. Alright,
so on a closed press bench you want to make

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.240
sure that your grip is everybody has a little
different. Ideally for me I like to grab about

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.460
six inches apart. Some people like to go little
closer. The closer it is the more triceps

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.620
it works, but at the same time the more pressure
on your wrist. So ideally I would say if you

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.550
have weak wrists or if it doesn t really feel
right, the farthest out you want to go before

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.410
you starting working too much on your chest
is probably about 12 inches. So 12 inches

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.880
is about right here. If you go any more than
12 inches it is almost like a regular bench-press

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.300
and even though it will work your triceps,
it is going to work too much of your chest.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.580
You may want to go and do another exercise.
But a close grip bench if you can hold it

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.200
to about 6 inches apart that s perfect and
it is going to really, really bring up the

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:07.041
triceps. It is a really good mass builder
for big ass arms. Alright so lift it up. You

00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:13.431
have to come down and keep your elbows slightly
tucked in and right back up. Okay you don

00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:33.340
t need to flare your elbows out like that,
keep it tucked in and back up. So close grip

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:39.190
bench you want to do about 4 sets and about
8-10 repetition. So that s a little light

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.949
for me so I probably have to go up a little
more weight. If you haven t done it before

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:47.949
test it out, always start off like work your
way up in pyramid of weights until you find

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:52.870
a weight that you can do comfortably about
8-10 reps especially if you don t have a spot

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.440
mixture of the pyramid up. Next thing you
want to do is to get one of those guys that

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.350
put on too much weight and fall off the bench
and thereby stare at you and you kind of feel

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:06.500
weird. So make sure you pyramid up so it is
safer and you will find that weight level

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:13.870
that s good for you. So six sets, supersets
back and forth. 4 sets of close grip bench-press

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.810
and your triceps are going to be toasted.
