Hi,

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.319
In this video we'll do a CamDolly Table Top
Orbit configuration Handling test,.. wow,..

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:07.479
that's a mouth full.

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:09.870
And that was with a Push and Pull T-bar.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.870
Hi,...

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.620
I'm Met, the creator of the CamDolly System

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.490
Well,.. let' jump right in to it.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.950
Everybody keeps asking me,.. »can the CamDolly
handle big cameras, with big lenses and the

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.950
full rig.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.160
You know,... we have seen the CamDolly with
DSLRs,.. a few light weight cameras like the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.600
old Panasonic HVX 200 or now the new Sony
FS700,..

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.499
Met,.. the CamDolly looks more like a Lightweight
System,.. you know,.. can it handle BIG Cameras...«

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:42.749
So I took it out to our Film institute,..
got the heaviest gear available on there,..

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:48.039
and this was the old ARRI Film camera,...
yes the old ARRI with the Film Cassette,...

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:55.250
the heaviest O'Connor tripod head with Mitchel
mount, Cooke 25-250mm lens, matte box, follow

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.749
focus,... you know, the whole rig,.. and we
did some tests of how our Camera Dolly and

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:03.190
Slider System can handle the weight.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.130
We set it up as an orbital dolly in a compact
configuration and attached the T-bar so it

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.590
could be pushed and pulled in any direction.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.219
It was great,.. the guys at the Film Institute
couldn't believe how smooth it flow and how

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.680
stable that huge rig was on top of our Table
top orbit dolly.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.289
They thought it might trip over,... they even
tried to push it over,.. but it stood solid

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.810
on the ground... as you can see in this video.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.960
Well guys,.. the CamDolly System is light
weight only in the sense that 1 person alone

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.030
can carry it,.. and 1 person alone can set
it up in about 5 minutes in just about any

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.990
configuration,... BUT it's not light weight
in the sense that is CAN carry and superbly

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.609
handle the heaviest cameras like Fully Rigged
ALEXA Cameras or RED Cameras and so on.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.369
Oh,.. and it's also light weight as far as
the price goes.

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.560
Well,.. thanks for watching.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.890
