TOM: Ready?

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.020
PAUL: Yeah.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.410
TOM: Pedal.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.109
[CREAKING]

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:06.499
PAUL: Back.

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:07.899
TOM: Yep.

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.290
I am in the foothills of the Dolomite Mountains,

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.400
about an hour north of Venice, in Italy.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.660
And this is a place called Ai Pioppi, The
Poplars.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.849
40 years ago, a man called Bruno opened a
restaurant

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.599
and then, he learned to weld,

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.509
and he thought, okay, I'll make some small
bits of playground equipment

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.240
for the kids who come to my restaurant.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:39.090
Well, it's now 40 years later, and Bruno's
welding looks like this.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.880
This is the terrifying Wheel of Death? Bicycle
of Death?

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.110
-- I'm not sure how to translate it -- at
Ai Pioppi.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.110
Like all the rides at this bizarre, kinetic,
playground, theme pa--aahh!--rk --

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.210
it is entirely human-powered.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.259
Everything here has no more energy that what
people put into it,

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:06.539
in this case by pedalling.

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:11.219
There are all sorts of bizarre contraptions,
and --

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:12.270
Augh!

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.380
Go on!

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.499
[BOTH YELL]

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:19.670
Here we go!

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.780
Pedal! Pedal!

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.890
[LOUD YELLING]

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.179
Go on! Go on! Yes!

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.289
[MORE YELLING]

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:38.289
It is astonishing. It exists only in -- come
on!

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.920
Keep pedalling!

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.119
That is... oh boy, that's my phone!

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.999
That's my phone. That's my phone.

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:58.389
All right, let's -- oh, here we go again.

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:59.200
Break there?

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.639
PAUL: I'm done.

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:06.979
TOM: So, um, I might have broken my phone.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.160
Good news! I didn't break my phone.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.890
Bad news: I did break my face.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.030
About five minutes after filming that.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.500
Entirely my fault, not theirs.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.040
I ran on a bit of metal that I shouldn't have
done.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.690
Tripped, fell face first, next thing I know
a lovely Italian doctor

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.690
is putting seven stitches into my cheek.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.820
Obviously there's an acceptable level of risk
when you go and do something like this.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.700
If you're not willing to take that risk, then
don't go, but --

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.620
I do recommend you do. It is wonderful,

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.850
everyone there was wonderful, they provided
first aid as well.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.530
But if you go: please, don't get reckless.
Don't do what I did.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.530
Don't think you're invincible just 'cos you've
done a couple of somersaults on a bike.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.950
Follow the safety warnings, be really careful,
and I'll see you around.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.740
And if there's no video next week,

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.569
it is because I'm having seven stitches removed
from my face!

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.080
