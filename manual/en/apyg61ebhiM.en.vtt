Hey guys, today I wanted to show you and talk
about this website I found called YourPerfectBody.net.

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.949
Before I get into this, I wanted to talk about
how much this site has helped me. I used to

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:18.070
be overweight and would always get into those
trendy diets that after you are done, you

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.070
feel like crap and gain the weight back. This
site helped me get into changing my whole

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:32.259
lifestyle into a healthy one and in the end
I now look and feel better than ever.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.250
Getting started this website is really, really
great and caters to individuals. I'm going

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.309
to give you guys the end-product at first.
The website basically gives you a personalized

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.769
plan based on your interests and what you
like to do. This is what they gave me and

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:57.769
I've been following it for 14 weeks really,
a really long time and I've seen great results.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:06.179
I wanted to focus on weight lifting and it
really helped me out.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.120
The main page here is just an introduction
to the website and gives a little info on

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.120
what you are going to be doing. Here are some
great testimonials if you want to know more

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:26.230
about people that used the site. Here you
will want to enter your information so your

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.590
height, weight, and current weekly exercise
which is including work. This includes your

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.300
day job so if you are in the office or you're
a teacher and on your feet all day chasing

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:58.300
kids. Interests are what you are interested
in the working out realm. This here is basically

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.439
a guideline of where are you now and where
you want to see yourself. Some people are

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:18.260
on the fatter side, or right on the fringe
trying to get to the wash-board abs. It isn't

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.260
about where you are, it is where you are going
to be at, so it doesn't matter where you are

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.329
right now, it is about where you are going
to end up. So when you hit submit you get

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:37.329
to the end page and you get your PDF sent
to you and you get the information and it

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:43.659
is just great in general. I hope you guys
enjoy it and I hope it helps you on your journey

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.469
to be a healthy individual.
