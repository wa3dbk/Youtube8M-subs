Hi, my name is Rachel. I'm a freelance fashion
journalist, and I also own austinstylewatch.com

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.960
street fashion site, and today we're going
to talk about how to put together a 60's costume,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.000
for a party for women. Now, the 60's were
an era where there was a lot going on, so

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.021
depending on your personality, you can choose
a lot of different ways for a 60's costume

00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:26.481
to go. There's really three main kind of directions
you can go in, and those are mod, kind of

00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:34.520
go-go girl. You can also do the kind of 60's
Jackie O look,and then there's also the classic

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.820
hippie look, so we're going to start with
the sort of Jackie O kind of look, that's

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:48.980
been popularized lately by the show Madmen,
and that's with kind of a classic 50's, 60's,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.170
kind of looking dress, that's maybe got like
a nice, kicky little skirt to it. Pillbox

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.710
hats were hugely popular by Jackie O, at the
time, so looking in the hats is a good idea,

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.470
and Jackie O also wore a lot of pearls, so
just kind of a more formal look. Then, there's

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:16.240
also the go-go girl look. With the go-go girl
look, look for short, kind of, not skimpy

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.900
dresses, but something that falls at the mid
thigh, that's usually brightly colored, and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.020
we have a paisley dress here. Solids are also
fine, and usually big blocks of color are

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.710
a good idea, and then pair that short dress,
kind of balancing the proportions as well.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.930
Pair it with boots, and these are a little
pointier, and more contemporary. A lot of

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.580
go-go boots you'll see have the rounded tips,
and the kind of classic image we have of go-go

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.990
boots, is the white, kind of patent leather
shiny, but the makeup that you're going to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.950
want to put with that too, is that's the time
to bring out your big fake lashes, do the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:04.369
pale lips, and think Twiggy, if you want to
look up a mod kind of look, and then finally,

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.750
the last one we're going to discuss, is hippie,
and we all know this one. It's very easy.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.980
You're going to want to take, tie dye is a
really good place to start. Natural beading,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.459
leather fringe, moccasins, also all capture
that kind of hippie look. If you want to get

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:28.739
examples, look for Beatle's era photos at
the time. Just kind of channel that Woodstock

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.340
vibe, so those are your three 60's directions,
you can go. You can go conservative Jackie

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.909
Onassis, crazy, wild mod or free spirited
hippie. That's how to dress in 60's costume

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:40.340
for women
