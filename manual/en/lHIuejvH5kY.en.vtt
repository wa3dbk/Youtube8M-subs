00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:53.030
Now, this is the story all about how
My life got flipped, turned upside down

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:02.920
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right
there

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.920
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a
town called Bel Air

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.920
In West Philadelphia, born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.920
my days

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.920
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
And all shootin' some B-ball outside of the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.920
school

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.920
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.920
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said, "You're movin' with your aunty and

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.920
uncle in Bel Air"

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.920
I begged and pleaded with her the other day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.920
my way

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.920
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my
ticket

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.420
I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as
well kick it"

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:34.740
First class, yo this is bad
Drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.400
Is this what the people of Bel Air are livin'
like

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.420
Hmm, this might be alright

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:53.510
But wait, I hear the [incomprehensible]
Is this the type of place that they should

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.930
send this cool cat?

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:06.830
I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.039
Bel Air

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:19.540
Well I, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude look like a cop standin'

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.970
wavin' my name out

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.239
I ain't tryin' to get arrested yet, I just
got here

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.030
I sprang with the quickness like lightning,
disappeared

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.123
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and had a dice

00:02:33.123 --> 00:02:34.123
in the mirror

00:02:34.123 --> 00:02:35.123
If anything I could say that this cab was
rare

00:02:35.123 --> 00:02:36.123
But I thought now forget it, yo home to Bel
Air

00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:37.123
I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabby, "Yo holmes, smell

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:38.123
you later"

00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:38.141
Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
To settle my throne as the prince of Bel Air
