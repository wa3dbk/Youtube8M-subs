00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.760
Oh shit! Overdose!
Today we'll learn about opioid overdose.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.930
Opioids are drugs that come from opium poppy,
like heroin, morphine, hydrocodone and methadone.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.230
All opioids cause respiratory depression,
which means if you take too much, you might

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.120
not breathe enough or you might stop breathing
completely. This is why people die from opioid

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.280
overdose.
“*Cough* Turn it down!”

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.989
You have much greater risks of opioid overdose
if your tolerance is low because you haven't

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.469
used more than a couple of days; you have
ever overdosed before; you are very sick or

00:00:50.469 --> 00:01:03.499
have HIV or chronic liver disease; you mix
opioids with alcohol or pills.

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:09.560
There are many different signs: weakness of breath, or not breathing at all; turning blue, ashy or very

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:18.650
pale; pinpoint pupils, passed out and unresponsive,
vomiting, making gurgling noises or struggling

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:26.440
to breathe.
“HEY WOLF! WOLF!”

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.120
But it's easiest to focus on two things:
One, do they respond to stimulation? Call

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.900
their name, or shout: “Police!” 
Rub your knuckles on their chest.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:49.940
Are they breathing? You need about one normal
breath every 5 seconds to stay alive.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.280
First turn them on their side and clear their
airways. Next provide rescue breathing: tilt

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.460
their head back, pinch the nose closed and
give two quick breaths followed by regular

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.310
breaths every 5 to 7 seconds. Every 30 to
60 seconds you should assess the situation

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.920
the person's colour should start coming back
if they're getting oxygen and they may begin

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.730
to breathe better on their own.
If you can, it's always better to call an

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.700
ambulance in order to get professional medical
help. If you're worried about police or other

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.400
problems, you don't need to say overdose on
the phone.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.780
"HELLO MY FRIEND HAS CHOKED ON A LADDER”
Don’t punch, kick or otherwise hurt the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.510
person. Don’t put them in a bath or try
to make them drink anything: they could choke.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.000
Don’t leave the person alone, if there’s
no one to help, they could die. Don’t inject

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:53.120
anything except Naloxone, it won’t help,
it might make the situation worse. Naloxone

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.569
is an opioid antagonist, an antidote for heroin
or other opioid overdose.

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:05.750
It has no effect on alcohol, stimulants- like
speed or benzodiazepine. Naloxone is safe

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:15.340
and you can’t overdose on it. One dose of
Naloxone is 1 ml or 0.4 mg of Naloxone. Inject

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.240
Naloxone into any big muscle: the upper arm,
thigh or butt. Don’t waste time trying to

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:28.020
inject in a vein, it’s unnecessary and no
more effective than injecting in a muscle.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.680
Naloxone usually takes 1 to 3 minutes to act.
If the person has not responded by that time,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.250
you can give them another shot. In the meantime,
be sure to continue rescue breathing and supporting

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.610
the person. Naloxone will act for about 45
to 90 minutes. Because it temporarily blocks

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.209
the effects of opioids, the person may feel
dopesick. Using more before the Naloxone wears

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.180
off won’t get them high and may cause another
overdose later.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.220
“What the **** is going on?!” “You overdosed
and I had to give you Naloxone! You need to

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.590
relax and I will stay with you for a couple
hours to make sure you’re okay!” “Ughhh”

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.860
“We’re going to take you to a doctor soon
too because overdose can lead to long infection

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.950
and other complications! It’s time for check-up
anyways, right?” “Oh okay…”
