00:00:00.096 --> 00:00:03.395
Footwork Skills - Front Left Corner

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:06.227
I would like to show you the steps

00:00:06.949 --> 00:00:11.593
the movement from base to the left forehand corner

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:15.146
same there are many different types of movement

00:00:16.127 --> 00:00:18.398
but I am going to show you the standard one

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:20.430
ready here

00:00:22.846 --> 00:00:25.249
first step is same one

00:00:26.462 --> 00:00:29.342
if shuttle is center - one

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.459
if shuttle is there, you face it and one

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:36.153
if shuttle is there, you face

00:00:36.153 --> 00:00:40.577
you face the shuttle cock when shuttle goes rear corner

00:00:40.577 --> 00:00:42.600
you face, let's say shuttle is center

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.966
you face center

00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:48.390
1 2 3 4

00:00:49.512 --> 00:00:55.817
where - here - ready - ready and then go

00:00:57.177 --> 00:01:00.947
so recovery make you recover fast

00:01:00.947 --> 00:01:06.053
there fore you have more time to see opponent hit

00:01:06.053 --> 00:01:10.036
during the second recovery, so you need two recoveries

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:13.163
number 1 short and small 

00:01:13.163 --> 00:01:18.590
number 2 little big and pause it

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.647
so like this

00:01:19.647 --> 00:01:21.578
1 2 3 4

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.511
1 2 3 ready

00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:27.839
1 2 3 

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:28.589
1 2 3

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:32.956
rather than 1 2 3

00:01:32.956 --> 00:01:34.248
too heavy

00:01:34.248 --> 00:01:35.384
ready

00:01:35.614 --> 00:01:36.202
lower

00:01:36.202 --> 00:01:37.052

00:01:50.938 --> 00:01:51.753

00:01:51.753 --> 00:01:54.297
1 2 3 ready

00:01:54.297 --> 00:01:55.334

1 2 3 4 ready

00:02:03.794 --> 00:02:05.760
next thing kill

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.426
1 2 3 

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:10.376
1 2 3 4

00:02:10.376 --> 00:02:12.324
1 2 3 

00:02:12.324 --> 00:02:14.250
1 2 3 4 ready

00:02:15.172 --> 00:02:17.574
smash

00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:18.574

00:02:18.574 --> 00:02:19.591
ready

00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:21.458
1 2 3 

00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:22.324
1 2 3

00:02:23.658 --> 00:02:25.740
make the last one clear

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.357
lower

00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:28.723
1 2 3 

00:02:28.723 --> 00:02:29.874
1 2 3

00:02:29.874 --> 00:02:30.742
yes

00:02:31.926 --> 00:02:33.581
1 2 3

00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:35.314
1 2 3 

00:02:35.314 --> 00:02:36.454
yup

00:02:36.454 --> 00:02:40.510
because he is doing the last one he can change any where

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.809
now random, any where after this one

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:44.730
so you have to wait

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.682
ready watch this

00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:48.023
1 2 3 

00:02:48.023 --> 00:02:49.951
1 2 3 4 ready

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:52.452
1 2 3 

00:02:52.452 --> 00:02:54.118
1 2 3 4 ready

00:02:55.335 --> 00:02:58.585
1 2 here bang

00:02:58.585 --> 00:02:59.702
ok

00:02:59.702 --> 00:03:00.386
one more

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:01.767
ready

00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:02.166
go

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:03.634
1 2 3 

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:04.151
push

00:03:07.832 --> 00:03:12.582
always remember start with one, finish one

00:03:12.582 --> 00:03:19.010
that's the way to move faster accurately and real way

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.809
that's what is happening in the real match

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:26.511
so backhand standard way is 4 steps

00:03:26.511 --> 00:03:31.326
where here ready and then ready again

00:03:31.326 --> 00:03:37.007
instead 1 2 one big step you loose timing

00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:38.208
you loose balance

00:03:39.596 --> 00:03:40.848
you loose control
