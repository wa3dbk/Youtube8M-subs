00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.690
recently i made Malai prawns using

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.970
coconut milk but today i'm going to make

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.340
prawns using real malai that is

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.160
cream so let's go ahead and learn how to

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.710
cook prawns in cream sauce along with

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.470
ridgegourd, now I'm going to add an

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.450
ingredient which you least expect that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.100
we'll go as the first ingredient in

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.450
making any dish so first add some saffron

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.780
and we're going to let them slightly

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.829
heat up the pan is slightly hot so in

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.660
this add butter once this butter melts

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.600
add chopped garlic you can add lot

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.940
of chopped garlic I always love chopped

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.760
garlic in lot of my preparation wow

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.480
what aroma what an aroma, in this add

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.560
chopped onion, add salt in this, in this add

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.159
pepper and now add ridgegourd you know

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.860
ridgegourd cut them the same size that

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.390
your prawns size haha now you're going to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.670
let this cook till this ridgegourds are

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.780
slightly soft just toss these ridgegourd

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.689
and then add bell peppers also so they

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.299
also get cooked along with this ridge-

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:30.869
gourd

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.290
wow it is better to use the red color

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.450
bell pepper because that'll give a very nice

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.880
color to this dish; I was not really

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.220
careful see my onions have slightly

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.740
browned you know I don't want brown color

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.360
in this but that's okay

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.119
they're not that bad so now in this add

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.930
the prawns and even toss the prawns

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.380
there's a lot of heat in here the prawns are

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.040
just getting cooked really fast

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.580
and if you want you can put the lid for

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.680
just for one minute okay because the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.240
prawns I don't want to cook them more

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.640
than two or three minutes just saute it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.680
for one minute one minute with the lid

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.240
on and then we're going to put the cream

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.170
and make a nice sauce, after one minute

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.530
of sauteeing them add little bit of

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.350
oregano not too much little bit will

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.710
give a very nice flavor,  in this pour in

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.580
