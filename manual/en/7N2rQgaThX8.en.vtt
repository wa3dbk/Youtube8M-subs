00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.300
Today, we're going to be installing the CIPA
Custom Tow Mirror, part number 11801, on our

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.750
2012 Ford F-150.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.270
The CIPA Custom Towing Mirror will simply
slide over your existing mirror to give you

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.880
added vision for towing and extend your current
mirror to 6 inches.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.650
The CIPA mirror is fully adjustable and it
will not obstruct to your existing mirror.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.100
The casing is made up of a thicker plastic
which makes them extremely durable and corrosion

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.110
resistant.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.670
They also maintain the aerodynamic shape of
your mirror to prevent wind noise or vibration.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.020
This mirror is for the driver's side.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.520
The mirror does actually come with two different
wedges depending on your vehicle's mirror.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.370
It also comes with a neoprene strip.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:56.979
The wedge will actually set here in the mirror
and the neoprene strip will adhere to the

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.510
wedge itself before installation.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.550
It's also a good idea to get your mirror head
cleaned and waxed as the tow mirror does slide

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.070
over the top of the mirror head itself and
it can mar to finish.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.740
To install the mirror, we'll simply hold the
wedge up to the mirror where it will sit and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:46.640
slide the piece over the top of 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.710
the mirror head.
