Hi, I am Eugenie. 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.260
People normally make egg rolls with a retangular frying pan.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.740
Today I am going to show you how to make egg rolls with a round frying pan.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.580
For this recipe, you will need:

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.720
3 eggs

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.970
1 tablespoon milk

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.060
1 tablespoon carrot, chopped

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.320
1 tablespoon onion, chopped

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.720
1 tablespoon Spring onion, chopped

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.580
Salt and freshly ground pepper.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.020
First, crack the eggs into a mixing bowl 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.540
and add in milk and salt. 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.400
I am adding about ½ teaspoon of salt. 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.500
Whisk until combined. 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.640
Then pass through a fine sieve to remove chalaza. 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.760
Chalaza is known to contain cholesterol 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.000
and it’s frequently removed for finer texture of dish.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.940
And add in carrot, onion, spring onion, they are all finely chopped.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.620
And add in pepper.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.720
And stir until combined.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.220
Lightly grease a frying pan with vegetable oil, 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.700
today I am using a spray oil and a 10 inch pan. It’s a small egg roll. 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.460
And heat the frying pan. 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.940
Then pour in 1/2 egg mixture and cook it over low heat 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.680
until half done.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.000
Roll omelet half way up to the middle. 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.220
And if there is not enough oil, lightly grease the pan each time you roll up. 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.960
And add in a ¼ of egg mixture to the side of unrolled omelet. 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.860
And cook until half done. 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.620
And roll half way up again and move the egg roll to the center of the pan. 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.740
And add in the remaining egg mixture and cook until half done. 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.420
And finally roll all the way up.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.080
Transfer to a cutting board. 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.220
When an egg roll is hot, it’s easily broken. So let cool before cutting.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.820
Now slice into bite-size pieces. 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.080
And serve.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.280
It’s quick and easy. 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.220
Everyone can make it, and everyone likes it. It's beautiful.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.260
Bon appetit.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.300
