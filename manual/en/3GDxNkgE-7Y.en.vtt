00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:12.770
This video shows how to create system recovery discs for your HP computer using Windows Vista.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.029
Recovery discs contain backup files of the original operating system, drivers, and application

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.930
software that came with your computer.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.980
In the event that you want to perform a System Recovery and the recovery data on your hard

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.250
drive has become damaged. Recovery discs can be used to restore your computer to its original

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.309
condition.

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.220
NOTE: HP recovery software allows you to create recovery media only once.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.360
It's important to use blank, writable CDs or DVDs to create the recovery discs. For

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.360
best results, HP recommends using DVD+R if your disc drive supports it.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.980
During the creation process, several discs will be required. It may take 30 minutes or

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.149
more per disc.

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:09.759
Although it may take some time to create these discs, the disc creation software can be aborted

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.909
at any time, except during the writing (or burning) process, by clicking cancel. The

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.060
disc creation software program will automatically start where it left off the next time the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.799
program is started.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.999
Before you begin, close all other programs running on your computer and disconnect from

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:35.249
the internet.

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:39.700
Open the HP Recovery Disc Creation tool from the Start menu.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.950
Click Start and then All Programs to bring up a list of software. The Recovery Disc Creation

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.759
software can be found in either the Recovery Manager folder or the PC Help and Tools Folder.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.029
Select either Recovery Disc Creation or Recovery Media Creation.

00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:03.200
A User Account Control window may appear. If so, click Yes.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.869
A recovery manager window opens.

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.230
Click Next.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.980
The next screen informs you of the number of discs that will be required and prompts

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.450
you to insert the first disc.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.650
Before inserting the disc, it's a good idea to use a permanent marker to label the discs

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.610
in case you need to use them to perform a system recovery.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.390
Insert the first disc and close the disc tray.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.500
Click next.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.500
A verification window will then open. This window shows the type of disc you've just

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.050
inserted and the number of discs still required.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.930
Click next.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.440
The Recovery Disc Creation software then begins the disc writing process. It's important to

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.930
not interrupt this process once it's begun writing.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.260
After the successful writing of each disc, a disc creation successful message will appear

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.230
and the disc tray will open automatically.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.620
You may be prompted to insert another disc to continue. If so, insert a new blank disc

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.920
into the disc tray and close it.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.920
The Recovery Disc Creation software then begins the same process with the second disc.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.930
Repeat these steps until you have successfully created all recovery discs and a message appears

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.160
stating system recovery discs creation complete.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.290
Click Finish.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.260
After successfully creating all of the required discs, make sure each of the discs is appropriately

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.630
labeled.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:06.630
Keep all the discs together when storing them. It's important to protect the discs you created.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.640
Store these discs in a safe place out of direct sunlight.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.479
If these discs become lost or damaged you will need to contact HP to obtain new discs.

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:29.479
