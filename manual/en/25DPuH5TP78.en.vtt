Welcome to Draw Tip Tuesday.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.950
Food illustrations are so much fun to do!

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.960
I get to combine my two favorite things: food
and drawing.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.860
In illustrations, there are so many styles.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.560
You can create your own style, or develop
even a whole range of styles.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.470
The only way to create your own arsenal of
styles is to experiment a lot.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.070
Each drawing style will tell a different kind
of story, or serve different purpose.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.030
Here, I'm making a very simple line drawing
and when I combine it with color, the drawing

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.930
comes to live.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.350
You can also simplify even more and make a
pattern out of the simplified and recognizable

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.530
shapes

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:12.880
Or choose a sketchy style and use a bit of
hatching, plus a dash of color pencil.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:28.240
And, if you use your imagination, you could
make a character out of every shape!

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.080
Here, I'll give this little guy a hat as well.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.740
There you go, a cookie quartet.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.040
Are you liking this?

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.400
Hungry for more?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.490
Well, lucky you!

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.000
My online workshop on drawing food and illustrating
recipes just started yesterday, and you can

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.500
