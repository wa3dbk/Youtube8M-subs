00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.580
This video is provided as supplementary
material for

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.980
courses taught at Howard Community College, and in this video

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.760
I want to show how to solve some
trigonometry problems

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.089
by using Pythagorean identities. So
here's the first problem.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.670
This says find the sine of theta

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.240
if the cosine of theta equals negative

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.050
square root of 3 over 2 and theta
terminates

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.570
in quadrant three. So we want 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.450
the sine of theta and we're given the cosine, and we've got a trig identity

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.579
that relates

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.540
sines and cosines. It says that sine-squared

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.510
of theta plus the cosine-squared

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.820
of theta equals 1.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.550
Since we're looking for the sine of theta,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.530
let's get this sine-squared by itself.
We'll have sine-squared of theta

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.760
equals 1 minus

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.020
the cosine-squared of theta.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.080
And let's put in the value for cosine of theta.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.640
That was negative square root of 3 over 2.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.330
negative square root of 3 over 2

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.220
We hae to square that, so we're going
to have

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.900
1 minus square root of 3 squared

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.900
is going to be 3. 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.840
And 2 squared is 4. So that's 1 - 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.470
3/4, which equals 1/4.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.689
and that equals the sine-squared

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.869
of theta. We want the sine of theta, so
we'll take the square root both sides.

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.420
The square 1/4 is 1/2.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.750
Now signs are sometimes positive and sometimes negative --

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.770
it depends on what quadrant the angle
terminates in,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.920
and in this case it terminates in quadrant 3.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.860
So we're going to have an angle that
begins in standard position

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.129
and terminates in quadrant 3.

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.660
In quadrant 3, sines are negative

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.300
because the y-values are negative. So this
sine of theta is going to equal

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.090
negative 1/2. So pay attention to the
quadrant

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.319
that your angle terminates in -- that
would tell you whether

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.690
the function is positive or negative.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.690
Here's another one. Let's do one with tangents and secants.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.489
So we're gonna have

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.739
find the tangent of theta if the secant

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.819
of theta equals

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.080
negative 2 times the square
root of 3

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.640
over 3 and theta terminates

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.010
in quadrant 2.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.190
The Pythagorean identity we want is going to be

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.970
the one that says tangent-squared

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.069
of theta plus 1

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.519
equals the secant-squared of theta.

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.720
We're looking for tangent,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.159
so let's isolate tangent-squared

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.560
on one side of the equation and will
have

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.810
that equal to secant-squared of theta

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.409
minus 1. And the secant of theta

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.959
was negative 2 times square root of 3 over 3.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.549
So that's -2 times square root of 3 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.250
over 3 squared

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.720
 minus 1. Well -2 squared

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.090
is 4. The square root of 3 squared is 3, and
3 times 4 is 12.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.140
And 3-squared is 9.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.700
So this is 12/9 -1. I'll take that 1 and
turn it into 9/9.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.680
So this is 12/9

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.049
minus 9/9. That's 3/9,

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.269
and that's the tangent-squared

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.800
of theta. So we want to take the
square roots of both sides.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.669
I'm gonna have tangent of theta equals

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.270
the square root of 3 over 3.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.490
And theta terminates

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.490
in quadrant 2, so

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.180
over here in quadrant 2, tangets

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.530
are negative because y-values 
are positive

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.610
and x-values are negative. So this

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.389
is going to be negative
square root of 3

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.710
over 3. And let's do one more.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.229
 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.340
Let's find the cosecant of theta

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.750
if the cotangent

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.729
equals 1.

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.840
And let's put that in the first quadrant.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.610
So the Pythagorean identity

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.509
that I want to use is the one plus

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.820
the contangent-squared of theta

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.970
equals

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.690
the cosecant-squared of theta.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.720
I'll swap the sides of this 
equation so the cosecant

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.150
is on the left side. And that

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.270
equals 1 plus the cotangent

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.590
squared of theta.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.900
I'll put in the value for the
cotangent of theta. Cotangent of theta was

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.490
just

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.889
1. 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.449
So 1 plus 1-squared is 2. So the

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.180
cosecant-squared

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.330
of theta is 2. Which means that the cosecant

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.460
of theta will be the square root of 2,

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.680
and let's see if it's positive or negative.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:40.680
It terminates in quadrant 1, and in quadrant 1

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.800
all trig functions

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.509
are positives. So we're going to have
cosecant of theta

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.780
equals the square root of 2. 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.849
That's about it. Take care. I'll see you next
time.
