00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.740
Multi-generational family vacations have become very popular,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.620
they're very complex.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.010
Because there are so many different needs for these families as to what

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.280
they like to do, the types of activities

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.420
and what they're interested in

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.600
the whole aspect of the multi-generational travel 
is putting all of this together and

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.330
finding the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.730
perfect kind of all-inclusive vacation
that covers everyone's needs.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.480
When I'm putting together
multi-generational travel there's a lot

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.540
of different aspects to look at.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.620
A lot of the times like different members of the family are not coming from the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.700
same gateways

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.890
so we want to make sure everybody gets to
their destination

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.110
about the same time. We want to make sure
they all get their transfers around the

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.010
same time so they can start their
vacation off together.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.090
One of the best programs for traveling
with multi-generations is the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.780
Tauck Bridges

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.780
what a fabulous opportunity to spend
time with your family. They have so many

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.400
wonderful destinations

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.930
from the National Parks in the United States
to foreign destinations

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.520
to even African safaris, so if you're
looking for something to do with your

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.020
children and your grandchildren you
can't beat Tauck.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.450
Our challenge is to find the perfect fit
for what your family

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.689
needs at all levels whether it's
babysitting,

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.299
sitting on the beach, wine tasting,
cooking classes

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.879
or that tennis academy that you've been
dying to try.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.060
Another great way to spend time with your children and
grandchildren is an all-inclusive

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.079
that was the first trip I took my whole
family on it also included my mother too

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.950
so there were four generations and let
me tell you it was a blast!

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.770
With an all-inclusive vacation like Club
Med you get added value

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.399
right away. There's water sports there's land
activities

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.670
they put together Olympics it just gets
everybody involved and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.940
everybody in the family is bound to
have a good time.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.900
We are very familiar with matching

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.950
right destination or the right cruise ship to your

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.590
particular needs as a family.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.860
There is nothing nicer than showing your grandchildren all the beauties of the world

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.910
We've had families come back just raving
about what we've matched them up with.
