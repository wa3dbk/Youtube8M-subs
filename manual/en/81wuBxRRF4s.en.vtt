00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.120
Here I've got the mince from our muntjac.
Now this the simplest recipe ever. I'm going

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.370
to put this mince straight in my dish here.
I'm going to throw some parmesan and ricotta

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.260
in because this is very wet I'm going to start
with like half of it. Now I think I'm going

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.350
to need more parmesan actually. Now the whole
idea is that these are melty, gooey and hellâ€”the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.010
whole lot. These are melty, gooey meatballs.
These are a New York style meatball okay.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:08.010
So the cheese is actually putting fat into
the meat and it might seem a bit odd but these

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.700
bad boys are proper New York, old-school Italian.
Okay, that's mixed. Now I think a little bit

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.479
of lemon zest and you might think lemons are
odd too but it's going to be delicious. That'll

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:26.299
do. I'm going to add a lot of salt to this
so please don't freak out, but a big pinch

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.440
like that and I'm going to add another one.
Now give it a good mix. The salt has to be

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:44.720
completely, evenly mixed right through that
venison and cheese mixture. Last ingredient,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.720
one egg. I'm just going to use a single, lovely
brown egg in there.

00:01:51.879 --> 00:02:03.450
That is sticky as they come. Quick hand wash
and for the next bit I leave my hands wet.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.229
Right, whenever you are handling something
really greasy, if you've ever got wet hands,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.120
things wont stick. I'm going to create some
lovely, big balls. Now, you want to have these

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.120
like tennis balls, like one per person. Think
of a meatloaf in tomato sauce.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.530
Just make sure they're nice and even. There
we go.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.530
Next up, use the same pan to make the sauce.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.520
Way too much butter. It's not healthy, it's
very New York, you kind of feel you need a

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.520
beer when having it. Gonna let that melt,
then smash garlic like so. Give it a little

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.250
stir around. That's pretty much melted now.
These are jars of tomato passata. Now passata

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.080
is just sieved tomatoes, couldn't be any simpler,
dump them in.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.730
Italians would actually serve these on their
own but obviously they'll be great with spaghetti

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.650
or tagliatelle, even buttery mash or polenta
will do. They are really versatile.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.400
How strange is this. We're not browning them,
we're not doing anything to them. Just drop

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.400
those in. Okay, clap a lid on the top. Twenty
minutes, maybe twenty-five, do not be tempted

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.140
to muck around. Don't prod them, don't turn
them over they'll cook fine.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.700
Let's have a look at these. Now first off
you have to press the ball with your forefinger

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.520
and check it's firm and if it's firm it means
it's cooked. Now spoon a bit of the tomato

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.450
sauce over the exposed bits. That's it.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.450
Here we go. One big, beautiful muntjac ball.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.200
And I'm going to serve these meaty bad boys
just as the italians do. Solo, with a sprinkle

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.190
of fresh green basil. A delicious way to use
that amazing muntjac mince.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.569
Here we are, New York muntjac balls. I'm going
to dive in and try it, it should be pretty

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:29.520
hot. So if I can just carve a piece off the
side. I love the fact that I went out and

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:39.030
harvested this muntjac from the wild and now,
oh boy. You've got to try these, these are

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.960
delicious. If you do want muntjac you can
get it from me harwoodgame is the website

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.280
to visit, harwoodgame is where the finest
muntjac come from.
