00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:11.040
George Diller/NASA Launch Commentator: T-minus
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, main engine

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.929
start . . . ignition . . . and liftoff of
the Atlas V with MAVEN, looking for clues

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:21.339
about the evolution of Mars through its atmosphere.

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:26.460
(thundering roar of the ascending rocket)
(inaudible background)

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.939
Xxxxx/ Atlas V Ascent Commentator: (Inaudible)
. . . Mark.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:31.939
Everything looking good.

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.379
Still at 100 percent rated thrust on the RD
180.

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:35.739
Vehicle rates are looking good.

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.340
We do have roll program in, right as expected.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.809
We're actively controlling mix to ratio.

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.339
Valve position looks good.

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.940
Thrust regulator valve position looks good
Speeds are good.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.460
And vehicle is operating as expected.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.100
Down the center of the range track.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.249
Everything is looking good.

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:10.383
We're now 1.6 nautical miles altitude . . . point
1 miles down range, traveling at over 1,000

00:01:10.383 --> 00:01:11.383
miles per hour.

00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:17.960
And we've ended our roll programs.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.040
Everything is looking good.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:31.630
Continuing at 100 percent thrust.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.010
And we are now passing through the sound barrier.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.440
MAVEN is now supersonic.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.340
RD 180 continues to operate at 100 percent
rated thrust.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.490
We are about to pass through Max-Q.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.100
And MAVEN is passing through Max-Q, rates
look good.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.990
(Inaudible) Operate at 100 percent and we
have throttled down to 95 percent, thrust

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.770
right on time.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.120
And we are now 10 nautical miles in altitude,
7.4 miles downrange, traveling at 2,200 miles

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.680
per hour.
