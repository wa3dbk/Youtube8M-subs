00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.760
We are with the Opel Mokka.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:14.120
The Mokka that is the small crossover of the Opel aims to increase its assertion with the new 1.6 liters diesel engine and automatic gearbox.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.420
Let’s see if the Mokka has become more attractive with this new combination?

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.060
Let’s analyze it together.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.540
In my opinion, the design of the Mokka is very successful.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.760
At first glance, it looks much more powerful and grand than the rivals in its class.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:38.540
With its high ground clearance and black plastic coverings that surround the car, it gives ‘I can go off-road whenever I wish’ message.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.380
The ascending shoulder line from the rear doors has a share in the Mokka’s dynamic appearance from the sides.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.780
At the rear of the Mokka the projecting boot lid and the gray protected area draw attention.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.620
The interior of the Mokka has similar design as the current Opel models.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:28.520
As soon as you sit on to the driver’s seat, the 3 spoke steering wheel, legible indicators and mid consul with lots of buttons welcomes you.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:37.220
The classic type analog indicator is very legible but the red trip computer in the middle, in my opinion, is now very out-of-fashion.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.340
Instead of that, I think, they should get through to colorful screen swiftly.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.660
The multimedia screen’s position and its resolution are very good.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.860
You are able to follow it very easily.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.860
There are lots of places in the cockpit for your articles.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.260
In front and behind the gear lever is ideal for your small items.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.300
Two glove compartments being offered increase the Mokka’s practicality.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.160
At the rear, good knee and head room is offered, there is no drawback for the adults.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.720
The 356 liters loading capacity is in the similar level as its rivals the Nissan Juke and the Jeep Renegade.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.640
Let us consider the hotly-anticipated, engine and the driving features of the Mokka.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:51.320
I have tested the Mokka’s 1.4 liters turbo engine and automatic gearbox version exactly one and a half years ago.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.580
If you like, you can click on the right top corner of the screen and watch that test by a short time travel to the past.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:05.180
But, now is the time for the Mokka’s 1.6 liters diesel engine and automatic gearbox version which is hoped to strengthen its hand.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.000
I have tested this engine which develops 136 HP and 320 Nm of torque in the Astra with manual gearbox.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.820
The power of the engine in general terms is good.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.980
But due to 6 speed automatic gearbox with torque convertor, it is hard for me to say that it is as lively and dashing as the Astra.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.940
Nevertheless, this twosome answers the performance expectations adequately.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.280
The gearbox with its valid and smooth passes contributes to the driving pleasure.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:44.480
But for manual drive, you have to move the gear lever to the manual position and make the changes by the buttons on top of the lever and in my opinion this is very adverse to the regular practice.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.600
Even though you get use to it after a time, I still think it is very impractical.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.880
As I see it, it would have been better if the Opel engineers and designers had copied their rivals instead of going to this discrepancy.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.000
The driving comfort of the Mokka on the highway is good. It is able to advance on the smooth surfaces calmly.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.700
On road fluctuations, due to the firm suspension the car body shakes exceedingly.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.220
But, in my judgment the real distress show up in the city and on rough surfaces.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:20.460
When the firm suspension try to absorb the impacts the strange noises annoy you.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:28.800
Even when driving over slight uneven asphalt as now, you can almost feel every burr on the road.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.120
Of course, I think the 19 inch wheel rims on the test car have also a share in this.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.640
The driving dynamics of the Mokka is not bad at all.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.680
You can corner the curves in safety if you do not force the limits too much.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.820
The steering is not very sensitive but it gives determined answers to your guidance.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.380
In the matter of fuel consumption, I can say that the Mokka will not upset its owner.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:04.880
I have been with the Mokka for 6 days and covered 300 kilometers and at the moment the trip computer indicates 7.1 liters fuel consumption averages

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:12.700
Even though this value may come as high firstly, in my estimate it is not bad at all for 1.5 tons crossover with automatic gearbox.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:22.000
The Opel Mokka with its successful design, quality cockpit and the new diesel engine with automatic gearbox seems extremely assertive.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.960
However, because the driving comfort is low, in my opinion it decreases its charm even if just a drop.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.320
See you.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:38.740
