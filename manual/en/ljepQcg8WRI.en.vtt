00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:09.579
I’m Helen McMahon for Expert Village. One
thing that happens as you’re beating is

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:20.080
that the mixture becomes thicker as the flour
is added, and then it’s sometimes difficult

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:30.539
to remove it. Here’s a secret: if you gently
raise the beater and accelerate a little bit,

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:42.249
it’s centrifugal force well send a lot of
the batter off to the side into the pan, so

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:48.670
that it makes the scraping job that you have
to do a little bit easier. Most of the batter

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.569
will wind up where it belongs, but you don’t
want to leave any on the beaters unless you

00:00:54.569 --> 00:01:02.899
have children who like to lick the beaters,
then you can leave some for them, but otherwise

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:16.720
scrape it down thoroughly so that you get
full measure into your bowl. A rubber spatula

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:29.100
does the job very well, and some folks prefer
the new silicon spatula, which also works

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:39.820
very well.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:47.820
Just scrape the excess on to the side, and—the
side that you’re going to pour from—and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.870
that will help get it into the pan when you’re
ready to do that.
