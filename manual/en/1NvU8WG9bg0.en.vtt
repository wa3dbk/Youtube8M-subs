00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:17.990
Of the 10000 bird species on Earth, only five,
all in the finch family, have crossed bills.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.750
The White-winged Crossbill is found in the
higher latitudes of North America, traveling

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.320
from coast to coast in large flocks in search
of white spruce trees.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:39.309
Females are greenish yellow, males red, and
both have two distinct white bars on the wings.

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.230
Their unique crossed bill, with the lower
mandible curving under the upper maxilla,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:53.390
is adapted to reach heavily protected seeds
found under tough cone scales.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.070
To reach the seeds a White-wing places the
tip of the curved lower mandible against the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.330
cone while inserting the upper maxilla under
the scale.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.720
Beak partially open, the bird uses the curved
mandible as a lever, twisting his head as

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.010
he pries up the scale.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.570
He eats the seed, discarding the husk.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.070
The curve of the mandible provides the leverage
needed to force the scale up, enabling crossbills

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:34.940
to feed on seeds that are not accessible to
other species.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.440
A White-wing often twists the cone off, and
carries it to a perch, where it holds the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:47.640
cone in one claw and rotates it like a corncob.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.640
Lower mandibles cross either left or right,
and each individual always holds the cone

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.100
in the claw toward which their mandible curves.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.000
This ensures that the tip of the mandible
is facing the cone, giving the bird the best

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.520
leverage to quickly pluck the seeds.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.130
White-wings are remarkably efficient at harvesting
their food.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:18.540
An individual bird can eat up to 3000 seeds
per day.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.940
Crossbills are able to swiftly bypass a conifer's
armor as a direct result of their specialized

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:32.909
beaks, an excellent example of evolutionary
adaptation.
