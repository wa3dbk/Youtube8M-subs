00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.430
Welcome back you're watching the Global
Cycling Network, with me, Martyn Ashton....

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.630
and this week I'm joined by a very special
guest, Martyn, good header, That's right

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.630
it's Lee Dixon, Arsenal and England soccer
legend, and all round cycling nut, I didn't

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.710
know that, it's true. Plenty coming up in
the show, let's dive straight into the pro

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.810
ranks and the organisers of the Vuelta have
announced this year's route, featuring a

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.720
summit finish in France - the race's first
foray over the border in ten years it's

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.440
going to be one of eleven summit finishes
in the 2013 edition Martyn the race includes

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.300
the mega-steep Angliru which is arguebaly
where Chris Froome lost the Vuelta in 2011

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.390
and certainly Bradley Wiggins fell out of
contention. Yer it really is one for the climbers

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.980
there's only 1 team time trial at the start
and 1 individual time trial, this one's

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.860
gonna be a hell of a race. News now from the
Aussie road championships, that took place

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.109
over the weekend - Matt Keenan joined us on
a google hangout, from Melbourne. So Matt

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.020
what went down in Balerat this weekend? Well
Mart it probably seems like an odd time of

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.850
the year to you guys for us to host our national
championships but this is the only period

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.610
where all the best riders in Australian cycling
are at home and Luke Durbridge at 21 years

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.110
of age became the first to do the double he
won the time trial and the road race, you

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.020
better get used to his name. Wow so Luke,
Luke Durbridge he's GreenEDGE right, he's,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.400
is he the next great hope for Australian cycling?
He's our next, or he's our answer to Fabian

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.829
Cancellara he's not our next Cadel Evans,
he'll be our first Luke Durbridge, I think

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.240
he can win prologues at the Tour de France
he proved that at the Critérium du Dauphiné,he

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.579
beat Wiggins and took the yellow jersey so
he could be doing similar things to Fabian

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.899
Cancellara we hope so at least. Well he sounds
like an exciting rider and you mentioned there

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.299
was some breaking news over there right now.
There is, when the Lance Armstrong affair

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.920
broke we saw Matt White an Australian confess
to doping along with Steven Hodge who was

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.360
a former member of cycling Australia, that
led to a federal investigation there's been

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.280
a finding handed down today with 16 recommendations,
most of them pretty generic; don't have people

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.599
who were involved in doping involved in the
sport but one that really caught my attention

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:20.090
stated that those who were on the board in
cycling Australia needed to go on a course

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.660
effectively as how to operate on a board,
which I saw as a sign of a lack of faith in

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.790
those who are actually running the sport here.
Well that's interesting and we'll see how

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.540
it develops, Matt we're going to be listening
to you soon again about the Tour Down Under

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.080
is that right are you going to come back and
give us some news? I look forward to giving

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.810
you updates and maybe Simon Gerrans going
back to back, nice one cheers Matt.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.800
One team that definitely won't be going
to the Tour Down Under is Katusha. That's

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.730
right Lee,
the Russian outfit, featuring World number

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.340
one Joaquim Rodriguez, failed in its latest
attempt at the Court of Arbitration for Sport

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.160
to regain its ProTour status. Now they're
trying for a Pro Continental licence ,which

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.790
is a step down, with a view to riding in the
Tour de San Luis in Argentina. Well if they

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.700
haven't got a license they can't ride
anywhere.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.409
The Italian Federation has backtracked on
its ban against ex dopers riding for the national

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.330
team meaning that the likes of Ivan Basso,
Michele Scarponi and Franco Pelizotti can

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.330
all ride for Italy at the word championships
in Florence later this year.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.730
Elsewhere, Steve de Jongh has joined Saxo-Tinkoff
as Sports Director. If you cast your mind

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.209
back the Dutchman was released from his contract
at Team Sky last October after admitting to

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.409
using banned substances during his racing
career -- something that fell foul of the

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.019
British team's zero tolerance policy. Team
principal Bjarne Riis had been on the lookout

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:45.480
for another director to bolster his line-up.
And it's the end of an era as Former World

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.379
and Olympic champion Nicole Cooke announces
her retirement at the age of 29. The British

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.129
rider enjoyed the best season of her career
in 2008 when she won Olympic Gold on the roads

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.840
of Beijing, followed up with the World title
in Varese. At her retirement press conference

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.260
Cooke was critical of the UCI for it's lack
of support for Womens racing.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.860
And now from skinny tyres to knobbly tyres Martyn,
that's right news of a ruckus in the world

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.549
of downhill mountain biking. Aaron Gwin has
been forced to deny breaking a three year

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:21.220
contract with Trek World Racing after sensationally
leaving and joining Specialized. Trek are

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.650
claiming a letter of intent signed by Gwin
last August is legally binding -- he's

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.900
claiming a subsequent contract sent to him
was not what he'd initially agreed. Expect

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.360
this one to rumble on.
Every where you look at the moment, one story

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.030
is dominated the cycling headlines, Yes, it's
Lance Armstrong That's right this is the

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.110
week, it's the Oprah Winfrey show and what
can we expect, well I was lucky enough to

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.340
speak to Richard Moore, cycling journalist
to see exactly what was going to go down.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.910
Are we going to get what we want, are we going
to get an admission? I think we're going to

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.030
get an admission I think it's going to be
a partial admission and it won't be very specific

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.990
it will be a general kind of confession I
also wonder if because of that mainstream

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.539
American audience who might not be that interested
in the specifics or aufait with the specifics

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.539
of doping and cycling whether Armstrong might
be allowed to fudge the issue a little bit

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:18.440
and talk about the health and the medical
practices rather than the doping. I also fear

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.020
that Oprah Winfrey and again that mainstream
American audience won't be all that interested

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.380
in the roles of people like Johan Bruyneel
or Hein Verbruggen or the UCI that kind of

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.699
specific information that cycling fans would
be very interested in finding out but I don't

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.199
think that mainstream American audience will
be all that interested in. Ok so we get the

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:43.930
admission, that's what we want, for cycling
what are the implications once we've got it?

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.449
I don't think there are many implications
for cycling, we know what went on it's more

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.880
about Lance Armstrong now and that's why he's
doing it, he's doing it to try and manage

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.610
some kind of return I think to public life
in some way shape or form, I don't think that

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.910
can be in sport now, certainly not in cycling
but he clearly you know doesn't want to go

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.800
quietly, he wants to return otherwise why
would he be giving an interview to one of

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.919
Americas most watched television programmes.
Well it's certainly an intriguing story, one

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.380
of the biggest stories in cycling and it happens
on Thursday, it's live on the net and GCN

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.850
will be following up on that next week.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.520
Quite appropriate really being in a padded
cell because I'm joined by Liz Dimmock who's

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.569
just about to cycle around the world on an
epic journey, Liz tell us about it. In July

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:35.800
i'll be cycling 80,000 miles across 5 continents,
averaging around 130 miles a day and hopefully

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:42.009
breaking a world record and I'll be sending
regular updates to GCN, don't forget to follow

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:47.190
on GCN.
That's about all we've got time for this

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.110
week, my thanks to Lee Dixon, it's been
awesome, coming up next week we've got the

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.880
debut of Cavendish on the Omega Pharma Quickstep
team, don't forget the tour down under,

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.160
the Tour Down Under, lots of exciting stuff,
this has been GCN, don't forget to leave
