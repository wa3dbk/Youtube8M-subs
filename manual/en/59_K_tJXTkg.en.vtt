00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.609
&gt;&gt; I know that there's a big culture of
computer gaming,

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.109
you know, and actually a thought
that went through my mind is that

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.579
if there's any person on earth that
deserves the ability to play 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:17.849
a fantasy computer game, it's a kid who
can't move his arms and legs anymore.

00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:23.849
&gt;&gt; I've played video games ever since

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.599
I was a wee lad. I got into
computers, you know,

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.310
just tinkering around with hardware
because I wanted to make my games run

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.980
faster. You know, the old cliche of,
you'll rot your mind, I don't think that

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.240
necessarily true with these games.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.040
During my freshman year here at the
university, I took a class called

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.650
gaming for the greater good.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.070
&gt;&gt; I always had this notion of,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.620
we should in our classes do projects
that have a strong social context.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.090
&gt;&gt; We're going to Eastern's Autism
Collaborative Center

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.960
that they have for working with patients

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.170
across the autism spectrum.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.660
&gt;&gt; I teach a software engineering class
and I teach an introduction to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.190
engineering class. Students need to work
on real projects, so I come up with some

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.530
contrived projects, where we can come up 
with projects that do something good.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.430
&gt;&gt; So this is Path. The idea behind it 
is very simple. So you have a

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.800
path displayed on screen and what you're
supposed to do is just follow it

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.880
with whatever body part

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.600
you choose. Right now we offer either
hand, either foot, either knee, either

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.710
elbow, or your head.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.630
So the idea is, let's see if I can do this here, is to follow it like that.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.950
And it's pretty simple and we like to think it's pretty fun.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.020
Our goal is to kind of improve gross 
motor control so over time you can

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.640
repeat these paths again and again,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.490
and you can get finer and finer control
over gross motor functions.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.940
&gt;&gt; The landscape is so huge, I mean,
there is a lifetime worth of 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.190
work that we could do in, you know, 
physical, cognitive -

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.850
there's a lifetime worth of work that
we could do just related to autism.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.180
&gt;&gt; Price point for Kinect, 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.079
for example, is a couple hundred bucks
and the price point for therapies and

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.079
interventions is just astronomical

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.730
if we could develop even one game

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.430
that has some therapeutic value and we
can demonstrate that empirically,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.010
I mean I can't even say enough about
what that would be. It would be huge.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.340
&gt;&gt; It's basically, I think, this is one
of the more important parts

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.859
of developing

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.519
games like these. When you're developing
games you're usually just testing,

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.249
well is it fun? Do I hate myself while
playing this game? And when you're

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:42.459
developing games for therapy, there's
an extra component you have to worry

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.879
about, there's a real human factor.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.620
and the only way to get that when
you're dealing with a 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.550
special audience is to actually go out 
and work with that audience and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.060
actually try it with them.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.599
&gt;&gt; We don't want to get to the end of
the production cycle and realize that

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.930
the game has no practical therapeutic
value, and all the time and energy spent

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.270
designing the game to be therapeutic
was wasted.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.670
&gt;&gt; All of us are from U of M, the 
College of Engineering..

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.239
&gt;&gt; Hey I'm on TV - blabeblabebab.

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.709
&gt;&gt; Have any of you had experience with
individuals with autism?

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.019
&gt;&gt; So right now we've just finished a
demo release, which is basically a

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.170
stable build of everything we had

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.709
done over the last half a year.

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.010
Now we are working on building a
workflow to kind of get more rapid

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.799
releases done and we're trying to
build up a more

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.910
stable product that we could eventually
say that this is our flagship product

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:47.530
right here.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.480
And that we want to get this to the
hospital, we want to get this into hands

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.740
of researchers, we want to do this,
this, and this with.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.950
&gt;&gt; Make a new game. &gt;&gt; Isn't that neat?
&gt;&gt; Yea, Path. &gt;&gt; Yea. &gt;&gt; A new game.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.940
&gt;&gt; There needs to be games that
are accessible to

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.110
everyone and a lot of more complicated
games that involve

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.440
social interactions may not be as
immediately accessible

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.890
to kids with autism.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.050
&gt;&gt; One of the hard, I think, parts which Pam can talk about to is, 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.780
low muscle tone in their upper body is
typical.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.750
So it's hard for them, you might have
seen William kind of holding here,

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.420
because that's the way - yes - 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.000
the way their arms were more
floppy toned.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.410
&gt;&gt; Yesterday it sounded like the most
valuable thing

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.830
was getting these kids active, and
focus, for any length of time.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.670
Like, that's what seemed valuable
yesterday.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.640
&gt;&gt; Yea, so it's not necessarily the
skill of jumping rope. &gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.240
&gt;&gt; It's just doing something physical.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.030
&gt;&gt; It's pretty magical that this class
teaches people: you can

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.340
go out, you can make money, you can work
in industry, but you can also do good

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.030
and I think, I just think it's
really cool.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.960
&gt;&gt; Clearly, the first goal is to
help people.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.220
But if we can help people and create a
company around helping people,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.970
so that we can create the next product
that helps people, then we're all the

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.600
better. Part of what we need

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.260
to learn now is what's the
method, what do we have to create

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.580
in order to commercialize it. Like do
we have to form a corporation?

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.560
How do you do that? Don't know. Need to
work with,at the University of

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.530
Michigan, work with the office of
technology transfer, 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.370
work with the Center for 
Entrepreneurship and figure out how

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.330
these things happen. How do

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.470
we get intellectual property
protections for these tools and apps.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.900
We have to figure that out as well. And
so we're working through all those steps

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.450
right now.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.370
And I think, I think the fruit is ripe 
for the picking.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.220
I mean I think the tools are ready. I think we have all the pieces in place

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.700
as a university to build those.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.910
It's just kinda putting it all together
and filling out the forms and

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.330
just making those parts happen and
that's what we're working through

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.890
right now.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.279
I feel like we're this close.
