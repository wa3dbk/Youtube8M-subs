Hi, we are Cutie pies.

00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:06.237
So cute!

00:00:08.931 --> 00:00:13.151
We are going to dance hiphop, locking, and poppin'.

00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:15.079
You guys are going to dance?

00:00:22.853 --> 00:00:23.751
Hi

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.271
Hi, we are Cutie pies.

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:33.012
Cutie pies? You guys are so pretty!

00:00:33.013 --> 00:00:34.458
Thank you.

00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:38.665
Do you all go to the same school?

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:42.181
No, we all go to different school.

00:00:42.182 --> 00:00:43.440
All different school?

00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:45.281
How did you meet each other?

00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:49.253
Because we like to dance, we practiced with each other.

00:00:50.381 --> 00:01:00.362
I can't wait to see it! On the paper, it says one of you really like Ms. Park? Who is it?

00:01:00.363 --> 00:01:12.966
It's me. My dad's also American and my mom's Korean. 
I want to become a musical actress!

00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:19.935
Except the fact that my dad's Korea and my mom's America, it's good.

00:01:20.952 --> 00:01:27.240
I hope you meet Ms. Park in the future!

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.876
Thank you.

00:01:28.877 --> 00:01:30.567
Please show us your performance.

00:01:30.568 --> 00:01:32.109
Music please.
