00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.430
If you've been using Windows
for a while, you'll notice

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.220
that there are a couple of
options for starting

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.300
applications.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.210
One is that you can go through
the menus in your Windows

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.150
system and find the application
you're looking

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.280
for, but you can also start
applications right

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.500
from the Run line.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.060
You can usually find this in
Windows XP under the Start

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.980
menu, there's an
option for Run.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.490
And in Windows Vista and Windows
7, this is integrated

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.660
into this command prompt for
Search Programs and Files.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.670
You can also start these
applications right at the

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.659
command prompt.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.380
So if you have a command window
open, you can type in

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.060
the name of the program you'd
like to run and you can launch

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.430
it from there, as well.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.650
One the most popular programs
to run is the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.630
command prompt, the CMD.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.550
Type in CMD at that Run option
and you hit Enter, it pops

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.620
open this command
prompt window.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.100
And that's all running
behind the scenes.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.910
That's all inside of Windows.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.900
So you can perform all of those
Windows capabilities

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.190
using a number of different
command line utilities right

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.950
here at the Command prompt.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.140
This Command prompt is
pretty powerful.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.340
You can perform a lot
of batch utilities.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.880
You can perform automated
scripts, all inside of this

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.530
command line view that you would
access using the term

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.780
CMD at the Run prompt.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.440
The Windows registry is an
enormous database inside of

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.480
your Windows operating
system, and it's

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.190
organized in a hierarchy.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.500
A lot of different configuration
options are

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.110
stored in this massive
registry.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.270
To be able to edit this
registry, you can go to the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.480
Run prompt and type REG EDIT,
and that will launch this view

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.140
of the registry editor.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.800
Inside this editor is kernel
information, device driver

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.250
details and configurations,
information and configuration

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.560
about your services.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.170
The Security Account Manager
information is all inside of

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.110
the registry.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.050
And every user interface, every
application you use is

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.630
probably also going to store
information to the registry.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.450
If you're troubleshooting the
Windows operating system, you

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.550
may be asked to make changes
to the registry.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.930
So an easy way to start up the
registry editor is to simply

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.230
go to that Run line and
type in REG EDIT.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.790
Because you're making
configuration changes to this

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.410
very important database,
make sure that

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.190
you back up the registry.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.240
There are third-party tools
that can do this.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.560
There's also options inside of
the registry editor itself

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.240
that would also allow you to
back up either sections or the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.450
entire registry all
at one time.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.380
We would normally start the
Windows Services view by going

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.950
to the control panel, choosing
Administrative Tools and

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.650
having Services under that.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.650
But at the Run line, you can
also type in Services.MSC and

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.550
it will also launch the
Windows Services view.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.080
This is obviously a view that's
very useful if you're

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.290
trying to troubleshoot
a start-up process.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.070
You can also control background

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.550
applications this way.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.560
Applications that are written
with no user interaction are

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.560
often configured as services, so
this would be a good place

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.320
to enable or disable
those capabilities.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.930
You can also view, inside of the
services, if there are any

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.590
dependencies between
applications, and you can

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.585
access this very easily just
by typing in Services.MSC.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.850
The Microsoft management console
is a framework that

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.080
allows you to build your own
management front-end for the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.620
Windows operating system.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.660
It uses something called
"snap-ins" that allow you to

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.510
create a modular display.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.900
And you can configure this
however you'd like.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.940
If you use a lot of the Windows
built-in utilities,

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.130
you'll notice that they are
simply a pre-made Microsoft

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.800
management console view, where
you cannot change any of the

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.400
snap-ins, it's already
pre-defined for you.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.400
But by going to the Run prompt
and typing in MMC, you can

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.810
start up an empty Microsoft
management console view that

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.510
allows you to customize
it however you'd like.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.260
To start the Microsoft Terminal
Services Client--

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.450
this is sometimes also called
the Microsoft Remote Desktop

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.280
Connection--

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.100
you would simply go to the Run
line and type MSTSC, for

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.330
Terminal Services Client.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.340
This is the remote desktop
capability.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.170
So if you need to access a
system that is somewhere else

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.380
on the network, or you need to
connect to a terminal server

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.970
and be able to use those
capabilities, this is the

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.110
utility that would allow
you to do that.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.720
This is also useful if you're
managing a series of servers

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.510
that may not have keyboards
and mice and monitors

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.490
connected to them.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.490
We call those headless
connections.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.230
So you would use the MSTSC at
the command line to launch

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.390
this utility that would
allow you then to

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.750
connect to those servers.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.630
If you're managing Windows
servers and Windows desktops,

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.910
then you're probably looking
at a lot of text files.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.760
And if you ever need to view
or edit any of those text

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.380
files, you can use the built-in

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.900
utility called Notepad.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.610
So you can go to the Run line.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.420
Simply type in Notepad
and hit Enter, and it

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.130
will launch that utility.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.290
Notepad is included
with Windows.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.860
It's automatically installed
with the operating system.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.220
So it's something you should be
able to find regardless of

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.190
the Windows version you
happen to be using.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.930
If you need access to the file
system itself, you might want

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.270
to use the graphical interface
called the Windows Explorer.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.650
And to start Explorer, you would
go to the Run line in

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.260
your Windows environment and
type Explorer and hit Enter.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.660
And that way, you're
able to do file

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.460
management of that computer.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.040
From there, you can view files
and launch files and copy

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.740
files from one place
to another.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.320
You have complete control over
the file system right here in

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.810
this graphical display.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.780
And if you need to access
network resources or look at

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.860
files and manage those files on
a different device, you can

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.530
also do all of that through
the Explorer, as well.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.690
If you sat down at a brand new
computer or one that's not

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.370
familiar to you and you'd like
to get more information on the

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.170
configuration of this system,
you might want to use the

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.250
Windows System Information
utility.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.920
And at the Run line, you could
start that by using MSINFO32,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.750
and that will start up the
system configuration view that

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.650
tells you all about
this system.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.240
It will give you information on
hardware resources, so you

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.690
can see exactly what DMA and
IRQ settings might be

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:06.740
configured as.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.070
You can look at the individual
components, as well, to see

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.560
what type of video card, what
type of audio system is inside

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.710
of this computer.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.890
And you can also see the
software environment.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.670
You can see what drivers
are installed.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.210
You can look at print jobs.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.030
You can look at what
tasks are running.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.570
It's all contained within
MSINFO32, or the Windows

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.210
System Information utility.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.770
For additional troubleshooting,
you might

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.940
want to go to the Run line
and type DXDIAG.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.000
That's D-X-D-I-A-G. That is the
DirectX Diagnostic Tool,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.230
and that allows you to manage
the DirectX installation that

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.580
happens to be on this
particular computer.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.360
DirectX is a multimedia API.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.980
It's an application programming
interface, so that

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.320
developers don't have to write
for particular graphics cards

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.120
or particular audio cards.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.200
They can simply write to this
generic API, and then Windows

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.590
does the translation
behind the scenes.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.260
So all of those applications
that use graphics, that use

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.610
audio, there's different types
of input capabilities, they

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.350
are all using this Microsoft
DirectX capability.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.580
This is also a very nice
diagnostic tool, even if

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.710
you're not interested in the
DirectX side of it, because

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.950
you're able to test video
information, you're able to

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.410
listen for audio coming
out of your system.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.650
And it just makes a good,
well-rounded diagnostic tool.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.910
And you can launch that, of
course, right from the Run

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.600
line, by using the
command DX DIAG.
