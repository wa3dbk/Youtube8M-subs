00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.200
I came to the Taster Session, the second one.
How was that?

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.220
It was really good, that's what made me want
to apply to the Summer School, because I didn't

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.060
know about it until someone actually mentioned
it and then I decided to apply and I got in.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.539
I really like getting to meet other Artists
my same age, that's really fun, because it's

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.180
kind of hard to get to do that at School and
not that many kids are interested in it. This

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.371
morning we made really quick sketches of our
partner and they were just really quick line

00:00:36.371 --> 00:00:40.640
drawings, and you had to keep your line on
the page the entire time. I think this was

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.050
in left hand, using angry marks, so you can
see they get weirder and weirder as you get

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.110
less control over the pencil.
Explain to us what you're doing right now

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:00.019
I'm doing an outline of the model here, so
when I paint over it in green these lines

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.890
should come through, so it will give me a
good outline of what I should paint when I

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.399
start to do it in more detail.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.000
I was able to develop new skills, and apply
skills that I've learnt in the past, light

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.270
tones and dark tones, distance, reality and
proportions.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.070
I quite enjoyed drawing Shelly because it's
something different to draw. A lot of people

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.741
draw pictures and stuff and slightly more
boring compositions, but you actually get

00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:33.810
someone who has been in the Olympics, won
medals and is going to win medals again.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.860
The first technique that Sadie taught us was
when you're doing a portrait don't just go

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.600
straight in for all the detail, all the fine
details, try and block out certain areas of

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.729
colour. Then Tanya taught us with her more
expressive, sort of expressionist style, the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.530
same thing, but maybe not to use actual colours,
maybe to use blues or reds or greens and still

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.960
base up how it is supposed to be, so that's
two techniques that we learnt this morning.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.869
The highlight has been probably the artists
coming into talk to us as I really haven't

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.130
had that experience before and to know the
behind the scenes process to their work, is

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.570
really insightful.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.920
You can be a fan of art, but of course professional
advice and professional critique is always

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.859
really helpful.
