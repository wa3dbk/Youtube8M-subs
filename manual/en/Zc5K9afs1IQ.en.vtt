00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.610
Begin by dividing your hair into three sections.
Set the two outer sections aside for now and

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.330
start braiding the middle section. Start off
with a french braid then when you run out

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.000
of hair to add to the braid, finish it with
a three stranded braid.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Keep in mind the braid only serves as a base so it doesn't need to look perfect.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
When you've finished braiding, tie the end with an elastic band then roll
it up towards the center to create a base.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Use bobby pins to secure in place.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.510
Now take a small section of hair from one side and place on top and over the braided base.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.000
Pin it in place with bobby pin.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:24.000
Take a small section of hair from the opposite side over and pin it below the previous section. Repeat the same step with the third section.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.670
For the next section, instead of pinning it
below the previous one, pin it on top, right

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.350
where there's an opening gap. use your finger
to carefully pull the remaining hair under.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.000
Repeat this same weaving technique until you've
covered the entire braided base.

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.709
When you've completely covered the base, braid
the leftover hair into a rope braid, tie the

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.760
end with an elastic band then roll it up and
tuck it under the rest of the hair. Secure

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.000
it in place using bobby pins.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.239
Finish it off using hairspray and gently smooth down any hair that's sticking out with a tail of a comb
