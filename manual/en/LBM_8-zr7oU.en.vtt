00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:07.953
Start the second assault.

00:00:10.673 --> 00:00:11.832
Enough, allright?

00:00:11.832 --> 00:00:14.073
Who started all the talk about Star Wars being real, huh?

00:00:14.073 --> 00:00:19.586
I had a dream about it, allright? You did not believe me 
 and now it happened for real. Don´t blame me for this!

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.578
That was close... How did they even find us?

00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:45.439
Maybe next time we shouldn´t sit directly next to the river in plain sight.

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:49.366
He´s right. They saw us and it won´t take 
 long before the first troops arrive here...

00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:57.406
Schumi! Are you alive?

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.310
Where am I?

00:01:00.074 --> 00:01:01.410
Guys am I glad to see you!

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.638
We thought they captured you!

00:01:02.638 --> 00:01:06.190
They did! But it´s amazing what you can 
 do with bubble gum and some wire...

00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:08.637
Well great thing you got out of there.

00:01:08.637 --> 00:01:10.830
We have to go back!

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.423
Go back!? Go back where?

00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:15.000
Back home!

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.119
Are you nuts!?

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.167
That´s exactly where it all started!

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:20.396
There´s imperial troops all over the place!

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.712
IS THAT SO!?

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:26.033
Well he convinced me...

00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:44.080
... Then I said I don´t believe you! 
 The new VT-16 is the shit! ...

00:02:02.423 --> 00:02:08.600
My loyal warriors... I have a mission of utmost importance for you.

00:02:09.513 --> 00:02:12.040
What is thy bidding my master?

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:24.290
I sense a great disturbance in the force. I underestimated the people of Earth. Apparently, there are more potential users of the force when we thought.

00:02:24.694 --> 00:02:26.830
That´s hard to believe, the earthlings are weak!

00:02:28.026 --> 00:02:29.600
Yes master, how can this be?

00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:41.470
The earthlings don´t know of their potential. They don´t use the 
 powers of the force. This will be our advantage!

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:43.950
Our advantage?

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:52.140
Yessss... I´ve found the one with the most potential... *cough*

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.120
He´s unskilled and naive... We will easily pull him 
 to the dark side of the force!

00:03:02.017 --> 00:03:03.700
What is your plan my master?

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:12.180
Travel to Earth. In the city of... uhm... BREMEN you´ll find him.

00:03:12.472 --> 00:03:14.180
What if he´s not alone?

00:03:15.665 --> 00:03:20.710
I only need the one. Don´t let anyone come between you. *cough*

00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:27.360
Kill anyone who tries to stop you!

00:03:27.424 --> 00:03:29.820
As you wish, master.

00:03:36.705 --> 00:03:37.600
Yes, master?

00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:42.980
It is time, everything is prepared. You can bring the sabers to them now.

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:47.320
Only then we can be sure if we´ve made the right choice...

00:03:47.316 --> 00:03:50.880
Yes master. They´ll receive the lightsabers just in time.

00:03:56.196 --> 00:03:57.340
Suspiciously quiet out here...

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:00.270
A bit too quiet...

00:04:08.662 --> 00:04:10.350
Goddamnit! Is this ever going to stop!?

00:04:16.106 --> 00:04:18.310
Hey guys!

00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:19.380
Hi Peter!

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.910
Here´s a question, what are you guys doing out here?

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:26.540
And who of you numbnuts had the idea to walk around unarmed?

00:04:29.517 --> 00:04:35.550
When the shit hits the fan I won´t sit on my ass 
 at home and miss out on all the action around here!

00:04:36.467 --> 00:04:37.990
I´m going to kick some serious ass!

00:04:38.623 --> 00:04:45.580
Kicking ass! That´s a good point! We need 
 weapons. Can you help us with that?

00:04:56.373 --> 00:04:59.830
Don´t shoot around like some rednecks, I don´t have much ammo left!
