00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:05.040
What does it mean...

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.040
Wait ah..

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.250
I don't know whether I'm focusing on you

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.710
It's a video!

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:10.710
Ah, okay.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.799
Your class loves to take videos
did you know that?

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:15.799
Yeah I know.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:16.799
Which is wierd..

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:17.799
How was it,
you know,

00:00:17.799 --> 00:00:20.610
the experience of you teaching our class?

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.590
Err.. It was fun..

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.439
It was fun? Err.. Anything else to say?

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.460
Good, you all are very vocal students..

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.119
Yeah, I'm sure we're very vocal students,
so now, being the nice NIE teacher you were,

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.500
for the 10 weeks you were with us,
we decided to give you a little something,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.550
Ms Sangeetha!

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.720
Oh no..
Oh you all are so cute!!

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.290
No the bear is, not us!

00:00:52.290 --> 00:01:00.690
It's the bear that's cute, not us.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.690
The bear..

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.690
This is the pink book
You must open it and see what it's about

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.400
Yeah, what it contains

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.010
It's MY idea, MY idea!

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.400
Read the last page first, it's the saddest!

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.330
Hong Sing wrote!

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.330
Oh, SPACING OUT?!

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.330
That's why that time we asked you whether
you liked pink or not..

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.960
Yeah, you remember you said it's BLUE, not
pink.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.030
Oh you all are so sweeet!

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.670
That is Bridget's page..

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.330
We apologise if it's not blue.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:41.212
You all bully me right? You all know!

00:01:41.212 --> 00:01:43.920
You know, actually we were writing and then
you came in,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.020
and I was still writing while you were there!

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.470
So how was the book and everything?

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.300
Kay the book was very sweet,
I'm so happy,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.630
I'm so sad also..

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.030
Why?
Why are you happy and why are you sad?

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.110
I'm sad because I've got WONDERFUL students
like ya'all

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.562
I'm sad because I won't be seeing you all
again!

00:02:07.562 --> 00:02:10.539
Awww, but look in the bright side,
technology advanced and we've Facebook now!

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.510
And all your Facebook statuses are so wierd
and funny!

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.549
That makes me wanna write a new note but
I think I'm gonna offend-

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.121
Write, just write, It'll be very amusing and
yeah, the comments will also be amusing..

00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:24.920
Yeah.. Anything else?

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.739
I don't know.. I just- I mean
We wrote this because

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.010
we felt that you were a very special teacher
to us

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.010
therefore you deserve this.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.010
Thank you.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.359
Lynette, anything to say?

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:44.900
(I'll end up crying if you continue!)

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.900
Err..

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:55.010
Yeah, we'll remember you,
as one of the best trainee teachers,

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.090
that our class has got..

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.989
For the SCHOOL, for that matter.
