00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:00.900
Good morning, John.

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.020
I was just watching a video of yours that you made a couple weeks ago,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.440
and I noticed something that made me remember something.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.350
So, in this video you pointed out that Willie had chewed the arm off of Chewbacca,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.179
and I remembered something somewhat strange about myself:

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:16.019
I used to be a bit of a connoisseur of Star Wars hand removal.

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.930
You know, hands getting chopped off in Star Wars movies.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.949
And there are a lot of hands removed!

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:27.080
In fact, there are characters in the Star
Wars universe who only have two hands,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.355
who have their hands chopped off three times.

00:00:29.455 --> 00:00:31.430
I mean, this has to be a metaphor for something.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.970
Chewbacca was always supposed to be ripping
people's arms out of their sockets, but he

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.110
never actually did it,
and he also managed to keep both of his hands

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.780
throughout the entire series of movies.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.450
So, it was a big deal for me when I saw that

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.150
Chewbacca had finally lost an arm.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.650
Anyway, I decided that for today's video I'm going to walk you through every single

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.510
Star Wars hand removal of a major character in the movies.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.910
There are more in minor battle scenes and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.120
of course if you go into the books,
then you've got a lot more to deal with.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.540
Now, unlike some Star Wars purists, I consider
the prequels to be Star Wars movies,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.450
so let us go chronologically.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.660
The first Star Wars movie, The Phantom Menace:

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.019
arguably the worst live-action Star Wars movie
ever!

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.010
All hands stayed attached to bodies; obviously this is a bad movie!

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.280
Now, Attack of the Clones, that was a much
better movie, and why?

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.440
Well, it starts out with a hand removal!
Jerk in a bar with a gun gets their hand chopped

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.120
off by Obi-Wan Kenobi, something that will happen again later on.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.375
Don't mess with a Jedi!

00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:20.630
Then, later, comes the second hand removal of the Star Wars trilogy,

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.490
that of Anakin Skywalker by Count Dooku!

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.995
[Light saber noise]

00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:25.400
A theme that you will start to recognize is that

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.900
when someone cuts someone's hand off
in Star Wars,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.640
there's a good chance that they're gonna get
their hand chopped off, too,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.030
and that's what happens at the beginning of
Revenge of the Sith.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.950
Count Dooku, who has just recently cut off
Anakin Skywalker's first hand,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.400
gets both of his hands chopped off shortly
before being killed completely,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.230
and this is when things really peak for Star
Wars hand removal:

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.290
Revenge of the Sith, very good movie, lots
of hands getting chopped off.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.860
This is helped along by the fact that General
Grievous has not two, but four hands!

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.900
Unfortunately - and this always sort of made
me angry - he only loses two of 'em.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.970
If you're gonna give somebody four hands,
ya might as well cut off all four!

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.740
Then, the Sith come back to pay back the Jedi
for cutting off all those Sith hands,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.150
and Mace Windu gets his arm chopped off by
Anakin Skywalker.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.570
It's worth noting that now Anakin Skywalker
has chopped off three hands,

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.599
just in this one movie,
and he's only had one hand cut off!

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.669
...So, you probably know what's about to happen:
Anakin Skywalker goes all evil, and Obi-Wan

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.569
Kenobi has only one choice,
which is to cut off both of his legs

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:18.525
and, yes, one of his hands.

00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:21.580
So, now, Anakin Skywalker only has one hand, and it's robotic!

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.919
Moving on to the actual Star Wars movies: the first one, A New Hope.

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.360
C3PO gets his arm yanked off by a Tusken Raider.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.079
Ya don't see it happen, but you do see
see the arm laying there on the ground.

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.689
And then, Obi-Wan cuts off his second gun-wielding arm in a bar.

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:36.180
And now, we must discuss The Empire Strikes
Back, which of course has the most famous

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.330
hand removal probably in all of history!

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.380
But we can't talk about that until we recognize

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.739
the giant snow beast who captured Luke Skywalker, hung him upside-down in the cave,

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:45.334
and then got his arm chopped off.

00:02:45.434 --> 00:02:47.829
Why did Luke do it? Why did he chop off that hand,

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:50.469
because you know now Luke's gonna get
his hand chopped off.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.650
And, in one of the most memorable scenes in
all of science fiction, possibly all of movie history,

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.840
Luke Skywalker gets his hand chopped off.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.959
Luke Skywalker gets a bionic hand, just like
his dear old dad,

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:04.010
and we move on to Return of the Jedi,
in which there is only one hand removal!

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.639
Luke Skywalker gets his revenge, and chops
off Darth Vador's third hand.

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.659
Oddly enough, if you also read the comic books
and the books,

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:16.499
Darth Vador has his hands chopped off no less
than five times!

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:21.350
Luke looks down and realizes it's just a bunch
of wires, and then feels his own bionic hand!

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.869
And, they reconcile or something, whatever
- more stuff happens,

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.859
but no more hands get chopped off,
so as far as I'm concerned, that's the end

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:28.600
of the movie.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.040
Being a Jedi sounds cool and all, but way too dangerous a line of work for me.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.689
And now you know, your life is going to be so much better now that you have this information!

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:38.260
John, DFTBA!

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.260
