00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.050
Hello Food Tubers, Barry Taylor here and SORTED
Tubers, SORTED Fooders.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.050
SORTED Fooders.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.050
Perfect, right.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.640
We are going to do a leek and butter bean
cassoulet in a really simple sauce, garlic,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.810
thyme, plus Cumberland ring and we're going
to finish it with a garlic crumb as well.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.980
Lots going on, really cost effective.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.470
So to start with leek, take off the green
parts and the root parts and then if you could

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.380
just slice that up into small pieces this
bit think saving food.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.540
That is perfect for stock, we';re not going
to throw it away.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.450
This is all about saving money and at the
end of the day I've paid for that so I'm going

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.450
to save it.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.450
Eat it.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.450
I'm not going to eat that, it will be for
stock.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.340
So I'm going to now get the garlic, four cloves
and crush those just to get rid of the peel

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.280
We're going to need two for our cassoulet
and two for our garlic crumb.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.690
Ting glug of oil into the pan.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.760
Leek is going to become the base to our dish
as well as the kind of flavour and the sweetness.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.940
Whereas you'd normally put an onion to start
it off, then you put something else in like

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.940
a vegetable.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.940
This si doing both.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.589
You've got the sweetness of the leek but also
those green bits you're doing there nicely

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.090
they become part of the vegetable as well.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.790
Because leek as a vegetable is so underrated.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.159
So they can go into the pan and start to sweat
that off, two cloves of garlic if you can

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.920
finely slice those.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.230
Season up our leeks at this stage.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.450
The key to simple ingredients is to season
them well and they can taste amazing.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.420
So cheap ingredients going a long way with
smart flavours.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.480
Garlic goes in there and for amazing textures
for this dish, we're going to blend up some

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.480
bread.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.250
Now this is two slices of super stale bread.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.140
You wouldn't want to use it for much, other
than this great part of the dish which adds

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.140
texture, crunch.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.329
One glove of garlic , thyme straight off the
window sill or garden.

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:49.270
If you've got it or not, if not you could
use dried, which is slightly cheaper.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.260
Could you grow all this yourself for this
dish?

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.574
Err totally the herbs, I think a herb garden
is a very sensible thing to have.

00:01:55.574 --> 00:01:56.574
Sausages?

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:57.574
You can't grow sausages no.

00:01:57.574 --> 00:01:59.659
A little bit of oil and then blend the whole
thing up.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.780
Now quickly grab our tray, we've essentially
made our garlicy, herby breadcrumbs.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.810
Ahhh nice.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.260
So they can go into our oven about 180 degrees
celsius for a few moments, just to crisp up.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.530
Leeks just starting to soften off.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.200
And next we have our sausage, the protein
in our dish.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.230
The most expensive part of the dish, but still
relatively cheap.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.230
Just so many cuts of meats.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.770
Because we're doing this cheap are these cheap
sausages?

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.150
No because you're doing cheap it doesn't mean
you have to cut back on the quality of the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.200
sausage.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.620
These are Cumberland sausage so already seasoned,
lots of black pepper, white pepper as well

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.620
and herbs.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.340
Now, top tip a cumberland sausage is often
served in a ring, so quite expensive to buy.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.470
So chap chipolates, all strung together untwist
them and just kind of push the meat down and

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.370
you end up with one long sausage.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.370
No way!

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.001
That's quite cool, I buy these sausages literally
every single week and I'm now going to be

00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:56.790
doing this and people are going to think I'm
posh.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.790
Posh?

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.790
Maybe not.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.940
Okay now we've got the sausage we can now
turn that into the cumberland ring.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.830
You've got to shop smart and this is what
it's all about.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.409
Now we've got a few skewers to hold it in
place.

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.040
So one goes through, start at the end.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.160
It's a sausage lolly pop.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.400
And from the other direction as well, so that's
our sausage.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.720
We can then put that onto a grill tray it
needs to go under a medium heated grill for

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.980
about 3 minutes on either side.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.390
Really easy to turn over because of the skewers.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.390
Okay.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.390
So under the grill.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.730
Keep the grill open otherwise it won't grill.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.090
Okay, another cheap ingredient.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.090
Yup.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.090
Beans.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.129
This is the bulk, the carbs of our dish.

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.500
Costs next to nothing.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.750
So adding this all together.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.239
Are you deliberately being an idiot?

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.239
A little bit.

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.420
The whole dish is less than two pounds.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.420
SO less than a takeaway.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.420
That really hurt.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.239
Well you listened to what I said and you just
tried to undermine me.

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.239
I didn't!

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.590
Honestly Ben I'm a little bit blown away by
what you've just done.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.659
That has changed my life.

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.959
Quickly before these burn I'm going to add
in our beans.

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.879
SO leek, garlic, thyme and a tin of butterbeans.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.780
Is there a sauce with this?

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.569
The sauce is even easier still.

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.630
Creme fraice, goes in there.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.630
And.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.630
And?

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.630
make sure we get all the last bit out/ We
waste nothing here.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.700
Get your finger right in there, that's lovely.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.700
Quality.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.700
No don't you dare.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.290
And then horseradish sauce.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.870
A jar is often just sat in the fridge, the
door of teh frigde.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.300
Wipe your finger it's relaly putting me off.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.970
Once I've done this.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.230
Going in there.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.490
That's everything we need into the cassoulet.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.620
We need to let that heat up and bubble for
a couple fo minutes.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.940
The sausage need to grill for two three minutes
either side.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.970
Our breadcrumbs four to five minutes just
to crisp up and then the whole thing come

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.650
together into a really smart, cheap simple
dish that's perfect for mid week meals.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.229
There we go.

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.800
I know you're impressed with what we did with
the sausage at the start.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.280
But top tip which i forgot to mention.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.260
Give it a little prick, otherwise because
it's curled up quite tight, the ring will

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.400
kind of tear at the edges if you don't give
it a prick.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.400
So here we go.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.930
We've got our beans going in there, we're
going to put both portions in here and then

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.990
our garlic crumb for texture as well.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.990
Perfect.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:09.190
There we have it, our leek and butterbean
cassoulet with cumberland sausage and garlic

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.190
crumb.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.190
Sorted! let me take the skewers off now, make
it easier.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.320
Now that's what frugal food should be.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:23.250
The best thing about that I've got those ingredients
in my fridge, yeah basic ingredients that

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.390
you can turn into something very, very tasty.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.710
I'm making this tonight.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.710
Lunch and dinner.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.009
That is quite cool.

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:29.949
