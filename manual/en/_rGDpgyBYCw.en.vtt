While preparing for a full day of filming, The Brain Scoop team was paid a surprise visit by a university groundskeeper who had discovered a black bear skull in the woods.

00:00:10.413 --> 00:00:15.747
It is so old!
- Yeah, that's what I was saying: it was the oldest one he'd seen. And look at the molars, too.

00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:19.541
- Yeah. Holy cow.
- So yeah, well into his twenties.

00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:25.880
- These P2 normally, I mean, they have a double cusp on there and it's almost worn all the way down to the root.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.043
This...It smells really bad.

00:00:29.043 --> 00:00:31.136
Well, it smells kinda bad.
- Kinda bad.

00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:34.460
- Yeah, this is nice. This is crazy.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.318
This - this is is a huge pathology.
- Yeah.

00:00:37.318 --> 00:00:39.549
- Look at that huge dental abscess!
- That— so, that decayed away like that?

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:42.948
That's the bone decaying away? Or did that just get worn off when he was dead?

00:00:42.948 --> 00:00:47.112
- Well, it kind of looks like...okay.
- Looks like some of the areas of the bone look like it was just sticking out, like right here.

00:00:47.112 --> 00:00:53.586
- Compared to the other side, you have this—this is all swollen here—where this root takes up about so much space,

00:00:53.586 --> 00:01:00.006
you can see where this is expanded and there's all of this additional swelling and growth on there.
- Okay.

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:05.791
- And then you can tell it's an old injury because he lost the tooth—this is worn over—and there is actually wear...

00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:08.094
- So, he lost that tooth when he was alive?
- Yeah, oh yeah.

00:01:08.094 --> 00:01:11.127
- That's friggin' cool.
- Yeah, no, this is awesome.
- Good.

00:01:11.127 --> 00:01:18.068
- So yeah, this is definitely an old injury. This is crazy, is that a broken tooth or is that like actually embedded into the front of his mouth?

00:01:18.068 --> 00:01:21.994
- I have no idea.
- I think that probably just probably broke out.

00:01:21.994 --> 00:01:25.560
- Well, there's a broken thing there, yeah. Maybe.
- That is crazy.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.475
Are you getting this on camera?
- Uh-huh.

00:01:29.335 --> 00:01:33.273
- But look at it, can you see that— how worn that tooth is right there?

00:01:33.273 --> 00:01:35.286
- You can take it out, though it'd probably stink a little bit.

00:01:35.286 --> 00:01:37.916
- Yeah, I don't wanna test it right now.
- I had him in the... freezer for the last few days.

00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:46.635
- This looks great. Oh and this is all crazy, too: it has all this bone loss and swelling and that... I would estimate that this guy is really old. I mean, I don't know how to age definitively.

00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:54.188
- Yeah, that's— I was talking to the game warden; he sent it to his bear guy and he said that one way you can tell is cutting a tooth, and he said late twenties.

00:01:54.188 --> 00:01:56.932
He said well into his twenties.
- Oh yeah. I'd believe it.

00:01:56.932 --> 00:02:04.934
'Cause these are so worn, the cusps are totally gone on them.
- That's cool that you can tell all that was while he was still alive, that that didn't happen after he died.

00:02:04.934 --> 00:02:11.187
- Oh, no way. I mean there's all this wear on this, too. It means that he was still eating on this tooth when—after it was damaged.

00:02:11.187 --> 00:02:14.916
- This is how bears get angry.
- That's why I thought he was a grizzly, I mean, his body was big—I mean, his skeleton was big.

00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:20.784
Do you have a grizzly skull so I can compare it?
- Yeah, we do. They're on that side of the museum, but...

00:02:22.076 --> 00:02:26.449
This guy's crazy.
- Do I need to wash him off before the beetles?

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:29.922
- You know, I don't even think that you need to put it in the beetles.
- I don't?

00:02:29.922 --> 00:02:33.219
- 'Cause there's... No.
- But there were a couple chunks, there was a little bit on his jaw and there's...

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:41.044
- They'll come off if you soak it overnight in hydrogen peroxide— in a three percent solution— and we can do that in the lab, too.

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:45.791
- All of the tissue, it'll become loose once it's rehydrated and we will be able to pull it right off.
- 'Cause yeah, there's a little bit down there.

00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:48.205
- Thank you, Hank!
- This is a big one.
- Holy crap!

00:02:48.205 --> 00:02:55.738
- Yeah, it is a huge one, that is a grizzly bear skull.
- See, now, that's what I was wondering about. So the sagittal crest, I saw a picture out there... Yeah, way bigger on a grizzly.

00:02:55.738 --> 00:03:05.008
- And then this is how you can definitively tell if it's a grizzly or a black bear: obviously this guy's a lot smaller, but this last molar is going to be at least 31 centimeters (*millimeters).

00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:10.831
- Is this a Montana grizzly?
- Yeah. This was collected by John and Frank Craighead.

00:03:10.831 --> 00:03:14.436
- The Craighead brothers?
- The Craighead brothers, yeah. In Yellowstone Park in the 1960s.

00:03:14.436 --> 00:03:23.739
- I guess there was that—those two that died that were 700 pounds or more.
- Yeah. I mean, these guys are huge, too. So this is one whole tooth. And it's absolutely massive.

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.563
- And this guy... doesn't really have any of those left.
- No. And his are pro- I mean...
- Yeah, his are worn, his are missing.

00:03:29.563 --> 00:03:36.487
- They're probably half that size.
- God, that's a... big freakin' animal.
- This guy is massive. He's, this one's really old, too.

00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:45.550
- How big do they think that bear was?
- I wouldn't know, um...big. Large sized bear size.

00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:50.197
But yeah, that's awesome!
- Fo' shizzle!
- That was awesome!

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.381
This is gonna be on YouTube, by the way.

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:07.000
It still has brains on it.
