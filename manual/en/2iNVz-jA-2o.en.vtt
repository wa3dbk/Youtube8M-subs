00:00:00.484 --> 00:00:03.546
Just follow up on the extra
shot and the transom

00:00:03.562 --> 00:00:05.367
and see whether that's
required or not. Yep.

00:00:05.523 --> 00:00:11.836
And then basically the rest of the shots will be
made up of the shots down the front of the vessel

00:00:11.862 --> 00:00:13.439
- 65 and 68 here.

00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:16.751
No worries, Brad. I'll get right onto it.
That'd be great. Thanks, mate.

00:00:26.646 --> 00:00:28.474
All right, guys. I've
just spoken to Brad.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.633
And what we need to get done
today is the 10 x-rays on the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.219
transom area around the jet
cones and jet ducts. Yep.

00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:38.817
So what we need to do is
get it done by lunchtime.

00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:42.825
Can you make sure that happens?
No dramas.

00:00:43.468 --> 00:00:45.111
I work for a
shipbuilding company.

00:00:45.698 --> 00:00:49.405
We construct patrol boats, cruise
yachts and high-speed passenger

00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:51.867
and vehicle passenger ferries that
are sold throughout the world.

00:00:53.578 --> 00:00:55.954
I've worked here for seven
years as a welder and

00:00:55.965 --> 00:00:58.051
have spent the last year
as a welding planner.

00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:02.175
We have around 60 welders
working here on each boat.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.450
They are coded as A class or B
class, depending on their abilities

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:09.322
and I have to ensure the right
person is working in the right area.

00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:20.200
Most of our welders come from TAFE and
complete their apprenticeships here.

00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:24.621
But we recruit welders from
time to time as well as develop

00:01:24.644 --> 00:01:26.783
the abilities of our
semi-skilled trade assistants.

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:30.513
As you're aware, we're
looking for a B class

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.940
welder that's quite
proficient in aluminium. Yep.

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:37.991
We'll get you down to the training bay ... do
a couple of runs just to see where you're at.

00:01:39.414 --> 00:01:41.898
Every new worker is
assessed upon arrival.

00:01:42.742 --> 00:01:46.071
 If they pass training, they
start at B class doing basic

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:48.785
jobs until they learn the
skills to move up to A class.

00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:52.045
It looks like you've actually
welded a bit of aluminium before.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.956
Yeah, I've done a little bit.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.057
What we'll do is look at
getting you in on Monday for

00:01:56.067 --> 00:01:58.555
maybe half a day just to carry
on with a bit of training

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:01.028
get you up to speed and then we'll
look at you getting on a boat.

00:02:04.443 --> 00:02:10.898
Welders have to consider the size of the material,
its thickness, the weather, gas settings

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.095
and heat settings in producing a weld that
is strong and aesthetically presentable.

00:02:18.257 --> 00:02:21.645
I worked as a panel beater for six years
before deciding to move into shipping.

00:02:21.998 --> 00:02:24.668
Some of my skills are
transferable but welding steel

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:26.764
cars is different to
welding aluminium ships.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.376
This is faster and
has to be neater.

00:02:29.398 --> 00:02:32.440
Luckily  I  have a steady hand and got
the hang of it quickly.

00:02:39.188 --> 00:02:41.617
Drinking water and
keeping fit is crucial.

00:02:42.687 --> 00:02:46.323
The warehouse can get really hot
in summer and cold in winter.

00:02:52.962 --> 00:02:56.220
The welds are randomly x-rayed
by an outside company to

00:02:56.224 --> 00:02:58.824
make sure our work complies
with international standards.

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:02.737
An 80-metre ship carrying seven
hundred people at 40 knots in

00:03:02.755 --> 00:03:05.964
two-metre seas undergoes a fair
amount of structural stress.

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:08.287
Okay, guys, well done.

00:03:08.678 --> 00:03:12.379
All those x-rays passed. Done it on
schedule as well, so congratulations.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.028
Cool. Thank you.
Thank you.

00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:17.425
We have a service department
that provides assistance and

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.514
maintenance for both our own vessels
and those of our competitors.

00:03:20.687 --> 00:03:24.014
So I've travelled the world doing
small maintenance jobs on our boats.

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:30.243
Seeing the ship finally in the
water is always satisfying.

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.183
As a tradesman, it's important to choose a
career you're going to enjoy for a long time.

00:03:53.597 --> 00:03:57.851
It inspires you to do your best and then you
can move on to bigger and better projects.
