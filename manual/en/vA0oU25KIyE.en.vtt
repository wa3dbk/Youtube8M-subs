This is how to build a shelter for bees and other useful insects.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.120
With natural and untreated wood scraps.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.460
Several diameters recommended. 4/6/8 and 10 minimettes.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.640
Depth between 6 and 10 centimetres.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.340
Installed on March 02.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.440
48 hours have passed since then.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.720
48 hours have passed since then.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.280
To be installed in a rainproof place, otherwise the earth plugs will be damaged.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.080
They often fall to the ground. Avoid water tanks under these nests, they drown very quickly.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.120
Isn't that wonderful?

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.360
Any ideas?

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.360
A nice shelter for ear piercing. A jar full of straw.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.100
A simple refuge to realize for a large number of insects.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:45.560
Masonic wasps, wild bees... come to scrape the bark to make stoppers and structures.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.020
In a cavity on the floor, it's great too.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.960
Music/video Papy Nounn.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.820
Thank you for them!

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.160
Come on... it's not difficult!
