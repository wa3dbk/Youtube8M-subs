- Oh, Jennifer Aniston.

00:00:11.826 --> 00:00:14.005
(Grace) You look like
a happy Jersey bridesmaid.

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:15.255
- Reese Witherspoon.
- (laughs)

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:16.965
I'm a bridesmaid in a wedding.

00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:18.526
I'm wearing a dress just like that.

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:20.765
I love that she's doing fashion reviews,

00:00:20.765 --> 00:00:23.013
and I know that
she's probably in sweatpants.

00:00:23.013 --> 00:00:25.138
(Grace) Lorde... have mercy.

00:00:25.138 --> 00:00:28.799
It's reminding me of
the Fashion Police, but nicer.

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:30.935
Dude, if I ever end up
at one of those events,

00:00:30.935 --> 00:00:33.578
I'm just gonna wear the weirdest things
just to mess with people.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.039
That's probably what Lady Gaga does. Duh.

00:00:40.288 --> 00:00:41.907
(Finebros) Did you know who
she was before these videos?

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:43.657
I have never heard of her before this.

00:00:43.657 --> 00:00:44.989
Is her name Grace of Hearts?

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.401
Is that-- no? Okay.

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:47.628
I knew she was on MyMusic.

00:00:47.628 --> 00:00:51.241
Doesn't she have a new show
on E! or something?

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:53.993
I was watching Kardashians.
I know, guilty.

00:00:53.993 --> 00:00:55.922
And then it came on next, and I was like--

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:57.288
And then my roommate walked in.

00:00:57.288 --> 00:00:58.961
She's like, "Isn't that
a famous YouTuber?"

00:00:58.961 --> 00:00:59.792
I was like, "I don't know.

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:00.917
I should probably know, but I don't know."

00:01:00.917 --> 00:01:02.857
(Finebros) Why did you
first subscribe to Grace?

00:01:02.857 --> 00:01:04.192
Because she's hilarious.

00:01:04.192 --> 00:01:05.669
She seems like a nice person.

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:09.544
She's quirky, but then
she's super relatable

00:01:09.544 --> 00:01:11.634
and doesn't try to be
something that she's not.

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:13.606
(Finebros) When you compare her
to other types of people

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.445
that do this on YouTube,
what makes her stand out?

00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:16.475
Her sarcasm.

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:17.821
She's very natural on camera.

00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:20.076
She isn't really trying to be anything
other than herself.

00:01:20.076 --> 00:01:21.862
She does stuff that is actually relatable.

00:01:21.862 --> 00:01:23.898
Like, I actually relate to, and it's like,

00:01:23.898 --> 00:01:25.696
that was me every day on the first video.

00:01:25.696 --> 00:01:27.436
(Finebros) In the beginning of 2014,

00:01:27.436 --> 00:01:29.660
went to two million subscribers to zero.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.824
How do you think you would have felt
if that happened to you?

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:32.611
I would cry.

00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:33.875
I would feel kind of betrayed.

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:35.109
Really, really pissed.

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:37.332
Oh my god, I would feel horrible.

00:01:37.332 --> 00:01:39.860
I would've been turning tables.
I would've just lost it.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.048
I feel her stress already.

00:01:42.048 --> 00:01:43.636
I would have been so bummed out,

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:45.586
and I probably would
have felt pretty hopeless.

00:01:45.586 --> 00:01:46.856
(Finebros) And now,
a year and a half later,

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.635
she's back at over
two million subscribers again.

00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:49.714
So what do you think about her fans

00:01:49.714 --> 00:01:52.438
and the YouTube creator community
for doing that for her?

00:01:52.438 --> 00:01:53.924
That is really nice,

00:01:53.924 --> 00:01:57.809
and it's good to know
everyone is there for each other.

00:01:57.809 --> 00:02:01.028
It's cool how when so many
people share a common idea,

00:02:01.028 --> 00:02:01.980
it can happen.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.611
I love that.

00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:04.734
It kind of tells you
that she's actually good,

00:02:04.734 --> 00:02:07.731
that they're watching her
because of the quality videos.

00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:11.185
It's not surprising at all,
just because she's fantastic.

00:02:11.185 --> 00:02:13.608
She's funny. So her viewers
aren't just gonna be like,

00:02:13.608 --> 00:02:16.498
"Oh, um, channel doesn't
want her anymore, so neither do I."

00:02:16.498 --> 00:02:17.773
(Finebros) What do you think
about someone from YouTube

00:02:17.773 --> 00:02:19.614
crossing over and hosting a TV show

00:02:19.614 --> 00:02:22.023
while still having to maintain
a weekly YouTube channel?

00:02:22.023 --> 00:02:23.192
I wouldn't want to be her.

00:02:23.192 --> 00:02:24.101
I'm sitting her stressing,

00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:25.803
"Oh no, what am I gonna
post to Instagram?"

00:02:25.803 --> 00:02:29.108
I admire that. That's definitely
not an easy thing to do.

00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:31.380
I can barely handle
10th grade year in high school.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.685
Like literally, I don't know
how she can do it.

00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:35.426
Jimmy Fallon, some of those--

00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:37.389
they have their YouTube videos on YouTube.

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:39.558
But they don't edit them themselves

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:41.063
or put them out there themselves.

00:02:41.063 --> 00:02:43.492
Grace is doing the talk show
and she's editing

00:02:43.492 --> 00:02:45.315
and putting all her own
videos up on YouTube.

00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:46.520
(Finebros) Usually people who host

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.104
late-night talk shows on television

00:02:48.104 --> 00:02:51.110
are comedians who
did a lot of comedy clubs

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.606
or were writers of a television show,

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:54.446
working their way up the ranks.

00:02:54.446 --> 00:02:56.613
What do you think of the idea
of Grace as an example

00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:58.852
of someone who took
a different route to accomplish that?

00:02:58.852 --> 00:03:00.004
I think that's fantastic.

00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:01.861
Starting from YouTube,
I think that's awesome,

00:03:01.861 --> 00:03:03.796
because so many people watch YouTube now.

00:03:03.796 --> 00:03:06.594
I feel like more people watch YouTube
than watch comedy shows.

00:03:06.594 --> 00:03:09.765
As far as celebrities or big comedians,

00:03:09.765 --> 00:03:12.281
I think that they should
start looking on YouTube.

00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:13.801
People didn't take
YouTube seriously enough.

00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:15.624
So they thought,
"Oh, this would never work.

00:03:15.624 --> 00:03:16.815
You can never get something on TV."

00:03:16.815 --> 00:03:20.319
But she kind of helped pave
the way even more to show that

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.593
you can start off as a small
YouTube channel, grow,

00:03:23.593 --> 00:03:25.016
and then get other opportunities,

00:03:25.016 --> 00:03:27.266
and then eventually get a TV show
and then a movie.

00:03:27.266 --> 00:03:28.597
Her movie was fantastic.

00:03:28.597 --> 00:03:30.179
(Finebros) Do you think
this is the start of a trend

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:31.618
where a lot of YouTube stars

00:03:31.618 --> 00:03:34.070
are gonna start getting these
bigger opportunities on television?

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.195
You know, I really hope so.

00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:37.447
I hope KSI gets his own show.

00:03:37.447 --> 00:03:39.456
(Finebros) Do you think Grace's show
is gonna be a success?

00:03:39.456 --> 00:03:42.599
I think if her fans
are still very loyal to her,

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.096
it's gonna be very successful.

00:03:44.096 --> 00:03:45.961
I hope it is, because she's so funny.

00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:48.430
And this could help out
a lot of other YouTubers

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.523
and help TV take YouTube
a lot more seriously.

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:55.724
If you can lose everything
and get all of your fans,

00:03:55.724 --> 00:03:58.055
like your subscribers back on YouTube,

00:03:58.055 --> 00:04:01.296
I'm pretty sure you can
have a successful TV show.
