Hi, Kim here with ochimp.com and we are looking
at the Crayola Dry Erase Markers today.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.300
Now one of great things about these that they
were designed by teachers.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.480
Crayola teamed up with some teachers to create
the ultimate and dry erase markers.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.119
So as you can see here they are designed kind
of uniquely and this is so that children can

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.910
differentiate between these and just regular
standard markers.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.680
Another great thing is if you look here you
can see there are some holes on the top.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.690
This actually has an extended ventilated cap.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.870
Once again keeping the kids in mind just mix
them all that much more safer for kids to

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.870
use.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.540
Now these are AP Certified nontoxic and they
are also low odour so put all those things

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.730
together they are not gonna harm your children
if they are around these all day or you as

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.430
a teacher either.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:12.159
So they come in either a pack of four or a
pack of eight in some nice bold colours and

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.280
one of the things that I think is awesome
is that these things don't squeak.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.659
Kind of like nails on a chalkboard but not
quite as bad squeaking from dry erase markers

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.979
can get very annoying.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.289
So these are made not to squeak and they go
on really nice and smooth.

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.499
You can see, just the tip here, you can use
one end if you wanted to do a little bit more

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:38.829
fine print or the other you can use the full
surface if you want to get a little thicker

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:39.829
mark.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.700
Now these erase nice and clean.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.799
These are made not to stain or to ghost.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.880
Now some really fun ways that you can use
dry erase markers around your house is on

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.880
mirrors.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.909
Whether you want to leave a love note for
your honey or sometimes we may let our 5-year-old

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.330
get up on her counter and practice her letters
and numbers on the mirror with the dry erase.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.429
She thinks it is super, super cool and we
like it because she is practicing.

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:17.000
The other thing these can be used on like
a glass shower door so if you are trying to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.590
get them from taking baths only over to a
shower another fun way to do it.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.470
You can still have fun time when you are getting
clean even in the shower.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.950
If you have questions on this or anything
else please give our awesome team a call here.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.220
We know buying school supplies, office supplies
may not be the highlight of your day but we

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.070
certainly hope the talking to us is.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.540

bit of chimpy fun.
