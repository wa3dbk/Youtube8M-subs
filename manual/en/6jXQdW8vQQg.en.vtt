Hey guys, welcome back to knifehog.com! Addison
here, and today I'll be reviewing a classic

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:17.670
military knife that continues to be a favorite
among US Airmen: the Ontario Air Force knife.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.410
Once issued by several branches of the U.S.
armed forces, the Ontario Air Force knife

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.440
is a fixed position blade that has proven
itself to be a very effective survival knife.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.670
With a blade measuring 5" in length and made
of 1095 carbon steel, it is perfect for cutting

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.710
through cord straps, wire and even thin leather.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.390
There's also a small serration on the spine
of the blade that is perfects for sawing materials

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.940
for animal traps.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.339
This knife's blade is so tough and sharp that
you could saw through tough materials all

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.940
day without worrying about wearing down its
razor sharp edge.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.299
The handle is made of brown leather that has
circular grooves for better gripping.

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:00.059
The hilt of the handle has a steel butt cap,
which makes it easy for you to dent metal

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.199
and pound in wooden stakes for traps or tents.

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.500
Also, At the top of the handle on its guard,
there are two small holes that you can loop

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.170
cord through and tie it to a stick or pole
and instantly turn this knife into the tip

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.170
of a spear.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.409
The Ontario Air Force knife comes with a brown
leather sheath that can easily be hooked to

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.180
your belt for easy access and deployment.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.170
The sheath not only has a built in metal reinforcement,
which keeps the knife from poking through

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.789
the material when holstered, but also comes
with a field grade sharpening stone held in

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:34.789
the front pocket.

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.299
A tie down cord is also included with this
knife.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.590
Overall, the Ontario Air Force knife meets
the expectation of an ideal military survival

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.590
knife.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.289

make it the knife you would want with you

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.509
in the woods or a survival situation.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.020
It even features two extra accessories that
could aid you in the field.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.210
The handle material is a little rough on your
hands but that could be easily fixed by wrapping

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.979
a more comfortable material around the handle
or by wearing gloves.
