TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey there.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.070
My name is Timothy Jordan, and
I'm a developer advocate on

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.210
the Glass team.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.500
And today I'm going to
talk to you about

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.460
Invocation voice commands.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.600
Now, if you take a look at these
slides, you'll see the

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.420
OK Glass menu.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.390
And down there at the bottom
are two new voice commands,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.270
Take a Note and Post
an Update.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.410
It's pretty cool
how these work.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.050
Let's take a look at some
examples, and then talk in

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.100
some more detail.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.480
First off, Path.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.760
Now, Path is using the Post
an Update command.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.420
All a user needs to do to use
this is to say OK, Glass, post

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.580
an update, and then they
speak their update.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.570
A new timeline item will be
created and inserted in that

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.620
user's timeline and
shared with Path.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.040
Path will get that notification,
grabbed the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.620
transcribed text, and post
it to the user's Path.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.320
Now, all Path had to do to plug
into the OK Glass menu

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.910
was adjust their
share contact.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.300
Now, this is really
the coolest part.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.450
They've taken their existing
share contact and added the

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.850
Accept Commands value and
specified Post an Update.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.550
That's it.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.510
Let's take a look at
another example.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.490
Here's Evernote.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.000
Now, user will say OK, Glass,
take a note, and then they'll

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.400
just speak their note.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.220
A new timeline item
will be created

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.060
and shared with Evernote.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.000
Evernote will get that
notification, grab the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.990
transcribed text, and
create a note.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.330
And again, it was super
easy for Evernote.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.970
They just updated the share
contacts for all their users

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.000
to include Accept Commands
specifying Take a Note.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.240
Pretty cool, huh?

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.170
Now, a couple notes
about this.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.010
First off, if multiple Glassware
want to use the same

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.350
voice command, let's say Take
a Note, then the user will

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.680
have to specify the service.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.460
But it's really easy.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.150
All they'll need to
say is OK, Glass,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.850
Take a Note with Evernote.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.270
And they'll be prompted
to do so with the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.610
list of services available.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.780
Now, if your display name for
your share contact is

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.440
difficult to speak, you'll
also want to include a

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.400
speakable name.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.680
You can strip out any special
characters and make it really

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.160
easy for us to recognize.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.520
One last thing.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.180
We're introducing just two voice
commands with XE8, but

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.850
we'd like to do more in future
releases, and we'd love your

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.580
input and your suggestions
for which ones to use.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.470
So we've set up this form where
you can specify the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.480
actions you'd like a user to be
able to take from the OK,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.390
Glass menu for your Glassware.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.145
Just go ahead over to the form,
put in some actions that

00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:39.940
you'd like the user to take, and
also give us a few details

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.090
about your Glassware.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.330
To get more information about
this feature and to get to

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.430
this form, please follow

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.680
Thanks so much.
