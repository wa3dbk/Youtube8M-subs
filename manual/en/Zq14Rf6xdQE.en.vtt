00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.360
Hey everybody, welcome
to The Flog.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.050
If you haven't seen this show
before, I'm Felicia Day, and

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.560
where the [BLEEP]

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.940
have you been?

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.120
I've done this 30 times
now or something.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.220
Come on.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.030
Some of you may recall our
Fourth of July episode where

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.770
me and my friend Tom Link made
a patriotic music video

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.810
complete with dancing pants.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.369
This week, instead of a segment,
we reunited to make

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.720
another music video.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.860
It's called "Bach to the
Future," and it melds 18th

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.590
century music with 1980s
music videos.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.260
Yes, we played our
instruments.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.620
Yes, it's as weird
as it sounds.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.430
So click here at any time to
take you to the music video.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.120
And if you want, stick around,
because I'm going to serve you

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.320
some Trio Mios.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.860
Number one is for the
adventurous reader and

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.050
aspiring writer out there,
it's called Wattpad.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.290
It's a very cool online social
community around storytelling.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.040
Readers can give instant
feedback on writers' works and

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.770
share their favorite stories
with their friends.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.460
Writers can update their stories
incrementally and

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.420
connect with their audience
through social media and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.010
engagement.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.820
It's a really cool site that
can be quite dangerous.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.737
Because you might get caught
up in reading fantasy and

00:01:13.737 --> 00:01:16.120
paranormal romance all night
before you have to shoot The

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.650
Flog and look like this.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.850
It's scary underneath
the makeup.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.320
It's scary.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.020
Number two this week is Bunny.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.610
It's a kooky web comic that
has insightful social

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.700
commentary, a dash of dark
humor, and a lot of geeky

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.590
references.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.290
I love the way it's drawn, but
also, there's some messages

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.170
here, guys.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.670
Check this one out.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.573
Look.

00:01:35.573 --> 00:01:36.480
[SIGH]

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.690
Check it out at bunny-comic.com.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.070
Lastly is a website called
Jigidi where you solve jigsaw

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.490
puzzles in under a time
limit to beat your

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.650
fellow community members.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.290
You can even upload your own
pictures to turn into jigsaw

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.170
puzzles to challenge
other people.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.910
It's awesome, and
quiet maddening.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.000
Because I am terrible
at puzzles.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.560
I almost rage-quit and took this
off the Trio Mio because

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.690
I was like, this is horrible.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.590
And then finally a piece went
into the right place and it

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.130
went, click!

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.580
And I was like, whoa, this is
addictive, so addictive.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.500
You can get jigidi with
it at jigidi.com.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.340
I know, I didn't want to
say that, but I had to.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.400
And onto the segment.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.570
Which is not here, because it's
the music video, "Bach to

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.690
the Future." So click on the
annotation and share it with

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.370
your friends.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.300
Thumbs up it.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.880
I mean, I had to
wear that wig.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.630
And finally, the Question of
Note this week comes from

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.220
Bridget, who asks, "What would
your job be if you lived in

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.490
the Old West?"

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.620
Dear Bridget, it's always ticked
me off how all the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.130
awesome chicks in westerns
are harlots.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.600
OK, not all of them, but most.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.372
I mean, yeah, OK, it would be
kind of cool to wear one of

00:02:32.372 --> 00:02:35.330
those big silly skirts, but
that's still so disempowering,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.640
even with a sawed-off shotgun
strapped to my leg.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.120
Instead, I would be the
kooky sidekick to some

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.240
grizzled bone gunman.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.820
Like a Zooey Deschanel Tonto
following Clint Eastwood.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.630
My light-hearted and quirky
wit would perfectly

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.950
counterbalance his dower
and gruff demeanor.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.390
Instead of a gun, I would
wield a crossbow, the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.600
hipster's weapon of choice,
because it was totally a gun

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.170
before the gun was, right?

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.320
And every time he would shoot a
bad guy, I would fire off a

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.540
funny one-liner in a
thick Texas accent.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.960
Like, "Well, that wasn't a good
place to put your guts!"

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.280
Yippee ki yay.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.510
Felicia Day.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.380
If you have a unique profession
that you would do

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.760
in the Old West, please leave
it in the comments below, or

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.110
tweet it to us @geekandsundry.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.090
Speaking of the channel,
we have two new shows

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.030
launching this week.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.630
We have "Space Janitors," which
is a scripted web series

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.640
about janitors in space.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.670
That's on Tuesdays.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.380
And then on Thursdays, we have
a new show about tabletop

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.270
gaming stuff.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.290
That's on Thursdays.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.405
Did I say that?

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:27.250
Not sure.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.840
Anyway, check them out,
and if you like

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.900
them, tell your friends.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.930
I will see you guys next week.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.130
Bye.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.730
See that?

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.230
It's a low bye.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.130
It's not this thing.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.530
Bye.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:47.310
