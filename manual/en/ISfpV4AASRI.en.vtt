00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:14.000
I have a Canon EOS 10D

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.064
I have the original box here

00:00:18.064 --> 00:00:28.002
I comes with this strap so you can carry it

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:31.044
One battery with the cover

00:00:31.044 --> 00:00:34.062
And a second battery with the cover

00:00:34.062 --> 00:00:42.019
This is 1500 mAh and this is 1400 mAh

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.060
One of them is quite new

A radio remote control and two batteries

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:42.084
They have a channel you can change on each

00:01:42.084 --> 00:01:46.016
A flash

00:01:46.016 --> 00:01:50.096
It uses 4 batteries which are not included

00:01:50.096 --> 00:01:57.026
It can be set in different angles

00:01:57.026 --> 00:02:00.000
It has a test button

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.092

00:02:45.076 --> 00:02:53.036

00:02:53.036 --> 00:02:58.086

it comes with the 4 original batteries

00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:40.047
which are not very good I think

00:03:40.047 --> 00:03:48.032
you should maybe get better batteries that last longer

00:03:48.032 --> 00:03:52.006

this lens and the 50 mm lens sometimes

00:05:28.021 --> 00:05:31.046
makes some noise when focusing
