[music]

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:12.499
Erin: One of the easiest areas you can save
is feeding your baby. Breast milk is completely

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:16.859
free and healthy. But you are most likely
going to need a breast pump if you don't want

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.109
to be a slave to your feeding times.

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.170
Bitsy: or you want your husband to get involved

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.740
Erin: exactly. Now pumps can range anywhere
from the low range of $20 all the way up to

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.009
$250. But, take it from us, do yourself a
favor and save yourself favor to go with top

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.250
quality here. Now what are you going to do?
Get online, every baby site we've mentioned

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.740
has breast pump deals. So don't pay full price.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.579
Bitsy: yeah and it's not like you're a better
mom if you pay full price.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.230
Erin: No. Figure out which pump is right for
you by getting on forums and community sites

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.140
where mom share info on deals and post reviews.
for that we like mommysavers.com and babycheapskape.com

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.989
(0:47-0:50) Isn't that the cutest name?

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.920
Bitsy: that is a cute name

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.320
Erin: haha baby cheapskate has coupon codes,
daily deals and a deal forecaster, so you

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.320
can anticipate those sales, and plan accordingly.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.030
Bitsy: ahh! For baby big events.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.030
Erin: mmhm

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.295
Bitsy: now some moms are unable or choose
not to nurse and they rely on formula and

00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:11.930
there's some really good ones out there. But
there's a tip you need to know: the FDA requires

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.790
generic brands of formulas need to meet the
same nutritional guidelines as the name brands.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.980
so you're not being a bad mom if you're buying
generic formula. you're just being a frugal

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.980
one.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.550
Erin: mmhm. For discounted formula and virtually
all other baby products, visit babywuvinc.com

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.880
(1:27) they have coupons that are pretty much
everything your baby needs but i've got a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.540
pretty interesting coupon tip for you: did
you know that bye bye baby is owned by the

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.640
same company that owns Bed Bath and Beyond?

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.640
Bitsy: Get out of here!

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.840
Erin: Yes, AND bye bye baby will honor all
the bed bath and beyond coupons! So how often

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.860
do you see a 20% coupon for Bed, Bath and
Beyond come in your mailbox?

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.860
Bitsy: all the time!

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.490
Erin: Save it and use it for your baby needs!

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.340
Bitsy: Now, there are times, where quality
needs to come first.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.340
Erin: That's true.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.390
Bitsy: But that doesn't mean you still cant
save! For an item like a car seat, you cant

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.730
compromise on safety. You want to buy a new
item from a reputable store. So hit the forums

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.500
and find out from other moms what the best
one is. But take that information and look

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.690
for the deals. Here's our three favorite words:
CheapStingyBargains.com (2:12)

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.830
Erin: oaaahh haha

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.709
Bitsy: They have got three in one ____ car
seat at 23% off

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:18.709
Erin: Amazing

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:19.709
Bitsy: Love it

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.459
Erin: Or, if you can, try and time your big
purchases for when Babies R Us has their big

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.439
event called the great trade in. (2:26)

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:27.439
Bitsy: ooooo

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:31.099
Erin: It's once a year and they'll give you
25% off coupon when you bring in an old item.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.230
So say you got that old used baby bed and
you're ready for a new toddler bed, bring

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.750
it in and get it for 25% off. It's a wonderful
program, you can't combine it with any other

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.849
offers but it still provides some really great
deals.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.310
Bitsy: Now that was a sweet deal, as was the
rest of them, so make sure to check out our
