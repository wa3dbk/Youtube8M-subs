00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.420
Welcome to Beyond The Trailer’s coverage
of the 2015 Academy Awards, giving you an

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.149
in-depth look at the top categories.

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.149
And once again, the female actress categories
have been hard to fill, making for some interesting

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:15.889
- and not so interesting choices.

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.320
This is also another category where the winner
is almost guaranteed, but your favorite still

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.310
has a chance in the annual Beyond The Trailer
Oscar poll!

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.980
So be sure to vote via the link in the video
description.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.029
Now let’s take a closer look at those nominees...

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.550
And this is the lock!

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.960
Like JK Simmons over in the Best Supporting
Actor category, Patricia Arquette has taken

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.010
home pretty much every Best Supporting Actress
award there is this year.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.990
And also like Simmons, this is Arquette’s
first Oscar nomination.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.290
However, unlike Simmons, she’s been a household
name - or at least well-known name - since

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.340
True Romance.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.649
But wait a minute.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.690
Co-stars Ethan Hawke and Ellar Coltrane deliver
strong performances too, right?

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.190
Why, in a movie called Boyhood, is the female
actress the one getting all the attention?

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.270
Interesting question indeed...

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.250
Perhaps it’s the lack of competition in
this category.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.570
Perhaps it respect for an actress willing
to highlight the aging process on-screen,

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.060
something most actresses try to hide.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.500
And perhaps the Academy just wants to do something
nice for an Arquette, one of the few Hollywood

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.680
legacy families?

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.610
Hmm, odds are it’s the aging thing...

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:35.000
Speaking of Hollywood legacies, Laura Dern
is the daughter of Bruce Dern who of course

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.530
got his own nomination last year for Nebraska.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.650
His daughter accompanied him to most of the
events on the awards campaign trail and even

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.570
to the Oscars itself - so maybe Academy voters
were just used to seeing her so much that

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.170
she was a familiar name on the ballot this
year!

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.580
Also, like father like daughter, this is Dern’s
second nomination - her first for Rambling

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.960
Rose back in 1992.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.600
And what’s more, like her father she isn’t
going to win this time around either.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.010
But again, when you’ve got a tough category
to fill why not celebrate another Hollywood

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.229
family, plus an actress who’s been able
to work both in blockbusters like Jurassic

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.760
Park and The Fault in Our Stars as well as
smaller films like The Master and...Wild?

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.010
Not to mention, here we have another actress
still working after over thirty years in the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.670
game...

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.310
But while The Academy loves to celebrate long
careers, they also like to anoint new stars

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.510
- as well as reward career choices in their
favor.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.420
Take Keira Knightley, who infamously turned
her back on the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.300
- the franchise that made her a star - so
that she could make prestige films.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.670
Some said she was brave, some said she was
crazy and some said the Pirates movies were

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.000
better off.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.680
But everyone could agree that at least as
first, she was not better off.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.790
Since Pirates, her biggest hits have been
Atonement for director Joe Wright and Jack

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.280
Ryan, where she wasn’t the lead.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.030
Meanwhile The Duchess, Never Let Me Go, A
Dangerous Method, Anna Karenina, Begin Again

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.599
and Laggies were all box office flops that
also failed to earn her any respect as an

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.530
actress, largely due to a lot of on-screen
voguing.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.650
And since action and light comedy didn’t
work out for her either, perhaps it was audiences

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.330
themselves that weren’t interested.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.140
Yet suddenly here she is, co-starring in The
Imitation Game which has done quite nicely

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.980
at the box office - and with an Oscar nomination
to boot!

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.390
Like Scarlett Johansson, Knightley is another
actress learning that letting your guard down

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.860
is just as important as picking the right
script...

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.769
So while Andrew Garfield is still struggling
to come out of the Amazing Spider-Man fiasco

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.370
alive, his co-star and real life girlfriend
Emma Stone is doing just fine.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.000
And hey, he’ll get to go to the Oscars as
her date, so he’s got that goin’ for him!

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.750
Yes, Stone has definitely landed on her feet,
impressive since two Amazing Spider-Man movies

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.519
required her to largely put the rest of her
career on hold.

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.910
But as soon as she was done - and I do mean
done - she came out with guns blazing!

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.831
She’s already done Magic in the Moonlight
for Woody Allen and will also star in his

00:04:10.831 --> 00:04:16.719
next film Irrational Man opposite Joaquin
Phoenix, co-stars in Cameron Crowe’s upcoming

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:22.449
Aloha opposite fellow nominee Bradley Cooper,
and is currently on Broadway in Cabaret.

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.330
That last one is getting rave reviews while
buzz for the other three films has been...meh.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.270
But of course then there’s Birdman, which
is helping the careers of everyone involved!

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.250
Inarritu, Keaton, Norton, Stone - all nominated!

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.479
Only the first two have a shot at winning
but still, with her first nomination here

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.259
The Academy is letting Stone know - and critics
and audiences - that she’s back on the right

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.039
track...

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:53.309
Can you really have the Oscars without Meryl
Streep?

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:58.990
Apparently not, as this is Streep’s NINETEENTH
nomination - making it increasingly difficult

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.589
for anyone to ever break her record as the
most nominated actor or actress in history.

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:09.860
But while Academy voters clearly never tire
of Streep, it seems audiences do.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.830
Many who enjoyed Into the Woods would rather
have seen Emily Blunt nominated - over in

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.169
Best Actress OR here in Best Supporting Actress
if there wasn’t space!

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.900
But don’t worry about Blunt, her turn in
Edge of Tomorrow might prove even more valuable

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.289
when all is said and done.

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:25.879
(cough) CAPTAIN MARVEL!

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:30.569
Anyway, it’s not ridiculous to nominate
Streep for playing the iconic role of the

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:35.330
Witch, and she did sing, do the whole special
effects thing AND look marvelous - all at

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.399
the age of sixty-five.

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:43.050
As I’ve been saying, The Academy loves honoring
long careers - just as they do honoring Streep.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.210
Maybe they really don’t want anyone to ever
break her record, and as long as they’ve

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.819
got the room in a category, why not protect
it?

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:52.960
And those the Best Supporting Actress nominees!

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.759
