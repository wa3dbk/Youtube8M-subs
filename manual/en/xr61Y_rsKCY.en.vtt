Hey everyone; Aquaman here with Water Wisdom
sponsored by Water Filters.NET. Today’s

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:15.259
product is the Culligan US-EZ Series. I have
the Culligan US-EZ-1 here in front of me,

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:21.880
and I’ll explain how this system will receive
a couple of other cartridges from the US-EZ

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.460
line. Why don’t we start by looking at what’s
inside the box. The Culligan US-EZ-1 is a

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:37.020
drinking water system that’s designed for
under sink installation. See, we’ll pull

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.530
this off here, and there are some basic things.
Looks like we’re going to leave these behind,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.910
we’ve got some water line and it looks like
a fitting designed to tap into the cold water

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.260
line so you can supply water to the system.
And like I was saying, this is designed to

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.750
go underneath your sink and supply water to
this dedicated drinking water faucet. We have

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:10.180
this faucet base here, and the neck of the
faucet, and these just simply attach together

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.100
like so. This comes down and tah dah there
we go, we have our faucet. Now the nice thing

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:25.840
about the US-EZ series is that this valve
head assembly is a quick change valve assembly.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.640
In other words, this filter cartridge is self
contained. There’s no housing or anything

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.380
like that. This cartridge simply screws up
into the underside of this valve head. This

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.750
entire system utilizes what are called quick
connect fittings. This is not really new technology,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.840
but it’s newer than the old school compression
fitting technology. It’s a system where

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.710
you simply take a naked water line and stab
it into the fitting with no special attachments.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.861
Just a naked water line; the fitting is integrated.
It’s hard to see here I’m sure, but there

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:15.090
is an integrated fitting for the in and for
the out, and you literally just stab the water

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.431
line in and it stays, and it’s a really
easy technology to use. So you don’t need

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:25.270
special tools. And that’s the great thing,
that’s probably why they called it the EZ

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.500
series, because it’s easy. You simply attach
this valve head to the side of the cabinet

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:38.630
with screws and then screw the cartridge up
inside, and that’s it. Water in, water out

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.130
up to your faucet, and you’ve got clean
filtered water. Now the nice thing about the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.690
US-EZ series; there are 3 cartridges available.
There’s the level 1, then there’s level

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.580
3 and there’s level 4. Now I’ve got those
cartridges here today. The level 3 is going

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:03.980
to look a lot like the level 1 cartridge,
as you can see, but it is rated for more contaminants

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.560
to be removed from the water. So depending
on what you are looking for, the level 1 will

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.300
give you just real basic chlorine taste and
odor removal. You’re just looking for water

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.730
to be better tasting, then level 1 is all
you need, but if you are looking for some

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.870
more specific contaminants to be removed,
then the level 3 is rated for chlorine, of

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.700
course, but then there’s lead, microorganisms,
Atrazine and Lindane, which are pesticides

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.070
and herbicides, and that’s not going to
be something you’ll remove with the level

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:45.010
1 cartridge. Then taking it a step further,
they have the level 4 cartridge. Now obviously

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.740
this is much beefier, but amazingly the system
up here is designed to still fit into the

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:59.680
same valve head. So, you can upgrade; you
could buy the level 1 set up and if something

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.400
changed with your water and you needed higher
contaminant removal, or if you just bought

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.930
the level 1 just so you could get into the
system and then decided later, you know I

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.009
really want more contaminant removal from
my system. You can upgrade to the level 4

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.889
cartridge. Now obviously there is a great
deal more media in here, so you are getting

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.159
more contact time; the water is having more
contact time with the media, and you’re

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:32.409
getting better overall contaminant removal.
Included in this one, in addition to the lead

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:37.530
and microorganisms which were already on the
level 3, you’re also getting heavy metal

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:44.650
removal of mercury and VOC’s, that’s volatile
organic compounds, and there are literally

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:53.110
dozens and dozens of chemical combinations
that are VOC’s, and then also chloramines.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.020
Now chloramines are interesting. Municipalities
use chlorine to kill microorganisms. In some

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.770
parts of the country now, they’re unable
to kill all the microorganisms with chlorine

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:15.110
alone, so they add ammonia, and when ammonia
and chlorine combine, the byproduct is chloramines.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:24.389
It is a very nasty, highly cancer causing
chemical that you do not want to drink. It’s

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.919
likely if you have chloramines in your water
supply, you’ve been notified by your local

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.639
municipality, because they are required to
let you know that by law. So, that will remove

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:39.969
chloramines, and also it will remove MTBE’s,
which is methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether. It’s

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:46.090
a byproduct of fuel production. So, if you’re
living on well water somewhere where there

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.879
is an oil refinery or where they’re otherwise
making fuel, there’s a possibility that

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:57.350
the groundwater is getting contaminated with
some MTBE’s. Of course this is something

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.729
you can test for and know for sure, and then
you’re going to want the better quality

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:08.889
filter, like this level 4 filter. What a slick
system. Buy the level 1 filter; get yourself

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.610
into the system with all the equipment, and
then later on if you decide you need higher

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.669
levels of contaminant removal you can upgrade.
Slick little system, easy to use, that’s

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.330
why they call it the US-EZ series. I’m your
host Aquaman and thanks for watching.
