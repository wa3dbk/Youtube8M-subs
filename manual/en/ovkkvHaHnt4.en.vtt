Hi, I'm Dave Long, the
President of Staticworx

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.700
and in this video we're going to talk
about how to test ESD flooring.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.900
The first thing we're going to talk about
is how not to test ESD flooring.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.000
Typically, if we get a phone call
from one of our clients

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.600
and they tell us that they've tested the 
floor and they can't get a reading,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.160
the first thing we ask them is are you
using a standard volt ohmmeter

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.100
and the answer is always yes.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.000
I have one in my hand and you'll notice 
that there's a red lead and a black lead

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.900
and each of these leads has
a little pin on the end of it

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.100
and unfortunately these little pins do
not make enough contact area

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.900
with the conductive floor
to get a reading.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.500
The probes we use are three
inches in diameter

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.000
and the reason we do that is
because we're contacting a surface

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.900
that has a bunch of veins in it
and those veins are conductive

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.900
and in order to make good contact
with them you need a large surface.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.100
So when you test an ESD floor you have
to use what's called an NFPA probe.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.700
I've got two of them here.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.400
What I'm going to do is quickly show
you how I'm going to test this tile

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.880
and find out if in fact it's conductive.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.000
So what we're going
to do is take the tile,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.600
we're going to place it on this
copper strip which is right here,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.000
which is what we use to
ground ESD flooring.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.100
I'm going to put one of
the probes on the tile,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm going to set the other probe
on the piece of copper,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.500
They're both connected to this ohmmeter.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.700
Hit our test button, we get a
reading.

00:01:40.804 --> 00:01:44.400
if the reading is between 25,000
ohms and a million ohms

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.100
and the spec sheet says the floor is supposed
to be conductive, that's acceptable.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.000
If the reading is between a million
and a billion ohms

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.100
and the spec sheet says it's a static-dissipative
floor, that's an acceptable reading

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.000
and so we're right in the middle of what
we would call a safe specification.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.000
The second test we perform is what
we call a point-to-point resistance test.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.200
In that test we take the two probes,
we set them on the surface of the floor.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.900
We don't attach them to ground.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.400
We actually just test from one point on the
surface to a second point on the surface.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.010
One of the reasons we do that, is we
want to find out if the floor is more

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.000
conductive point-to-point than
it is point-to-ground.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.700
If it is more conductive, that can
possibly lead to a safety hazard.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Sometimes in our testing we've discovered the
carpet tile might read a million ohms to ground

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.900
but when we test the top surface we find out that
it's eight or ten thousand ohms to ground.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.500
That would actually present a
potential shock hazard

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.400
if somebody touched 120
volt line voltage.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.600
So a lot of what we're doing here isn't just to find
out if the floor is adequately eliminating static,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.100
we're also trying to find out, is it a safe condition to turn
over to the owner when people occupy the space.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.940
For a little more information on testing I'd suggest
you go to our website www.staticworx.com

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.900
and look for an article called "Potential
Conflicts with ESD Flooring."

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.800
You'll find out a lot more about testing
than we've talked about here today.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.000
In roughly two minutes, I've covered a topic that
we could really spend all day discussing.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.600
