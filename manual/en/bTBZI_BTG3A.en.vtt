00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.520
One of the reasons I love working with
Powermatic tools is that they just make

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.239
sense. Everything works the way I think
it should and it's just so enjoyable to

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.059
use a tool to expect it to work,

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:35.920
behave in a certain way and then to have
the tool perform up to and even beyond

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.879
those expectations. Hi, I'm Alf Sharp and I
live in Woodbury Tennessee and I've been

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.920
a woodworker for nearly 40 years and actually I've been wanting

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.059
a drill press for several years now, but
until Powermatic has come out with

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.179
the new PM2800B Drill Press,

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.230
I've just never seen one that made me
want to pull the trigger. This drill

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.230
press struck me immediately, it's got
presence.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.280
It''s sturdy, it's obviously well
thought through. Powermatic has clearly

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.909
asked all the questions that drill press
users have wondered about for the

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:22.840
past 10 or 15 years and worked hard to
include all the answers into the Machine.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.570
And so it's not only very
well-built, heavy and sturdy, but it's

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.540
innovative.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.660
The mechanical variable speed on the PM2800B is a great feature. In the middle

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.130
of a project I can't afford to take the
time to adjust and change belts every

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.360
time I need to change the drilling speed
and with the mechanical variable speed

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.220
on this machine, I don't have to. No
belt changes means a lot less headaches

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.340
and a lot more enjoyment during the
project that's for sure.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.229
Along with the mechanical variable speed
on this drill press, Powermatic has of

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.020
course included a handy digital readout.
It makes it easy to track your RPM's for

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.729
optimal spindle speed for any
application. If you've used drill presses for

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.680
any amount of time, you know how important quill travel is. Powermatic has

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.230
done a great thing with this drill press.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.850
You can get a full six inches of quill
travel with just one full turn of the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.590
handle. It just makes things a lot easier
and you spend a whole lot less time

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.480
turning the handle. Powermatic makes great
fences for all of their machines and the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.480
fence on the PM2800B is no exception.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.709
What I love about this fence is that
it's adjustable, so that you can easily

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.250
align a 90-degree angle between the
fence and the table.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.250
This makes aligning the stock quick and
easy.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.190
The adjustable stop, yet another
example of why the PM2800B is great

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.070
to work with. Set the material stop in
place, it stays there, making it easy to

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:02.370
complete repetitive tasks accurately
over and over. I really like this laser

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.330
crosshair system. It makes the ease of
finding your Center so much quicker. i'm

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.730
really enjoying being able to just know
exactly where my drill bit is going to

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.560
enter the wood without having to spend a
lot of time lining up the work and the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.360
drill bit.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.000
Thinking back through the years, I can't
tell you how many times I've had to mess

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.340
around with a chuck or a chuck key that just didn't want to cooperate.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.190
Thankfully that's a thing of the past.
With the keyless chuck that Powermatic

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.160
has these days, things are much easier.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.640
I barely even have to think about bit
changes. Its in and out and back to work

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.860
Powermatic has really gotten smart with
these handles. Depending on which side

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.569
you want to operate, or which hand you
want to use, the handles can be reversed,

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.420
so no matter what's best for you

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.849
it's simple and easy. It's great to have
LED lights in this drill press for a

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.260
couple of reasons. One, the LED lights are
going to last pretty well for the

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.970
life of the drill press,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.390
but beyond that Powermatic has
thought of including two LED lights that

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.060
together combined, to mean that you have no shadows cast on the table while

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:27.860
you're working. And that's another simple
solution that's so brilliant. Powermatic

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.780
has built this drill press on an
oversized cast iron base. It's rock-solid,

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.820
making sure things don't move on you
while you're working. Next the table has

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.020
the highest quality angle setting
mechanism, so no matter what angle you're

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.080
working with, you can trust that you'll
hit it with ease up to a full 90 degrees.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.360
And finally Powermatic has included
these handy square table inserts with

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.830
leveling screws that allow the insert to
lay flush with the top of the table.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.820
I've always trusted Powermatic to make
tools that run smoother and more

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.570
accurately than most of the other tools
that they compete with. I would say to

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.700
someone that there's no point in even
looking at other machines. This machine

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.880
is the one that you'll buy for the rest
of your life.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.860
For the last 90 years,

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.340
Powermatic has been setting the gold
standard in woodworking machinery.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.360
Committed to quality since 1921, Powermatic has been providing generations

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.070
of woodworkers with the tools and the
confidence to create and inspire.
