00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:08.260
This project is a Cherry Blossom ball. This
is a model I learned at the Origami USA convention

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:21.060
in New York City. The original piece that
I folded with was 1 3/4 inches by 3 inches.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.850
But I found that 2 inch by 3 inch works well,
as well. Here I am going to fold it on a larger

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.940
scale, so you can see better. Take your sheet
of paper, with the color side up, fold it

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:48.760
in half, along the long horizontal. Take this
top edge of the top layer and fold it back

00:00:48.760 --> 00:01:00.379
down to the bottom crease. Same thing with
the other size. Fold it, fold the edge. Essentially

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:09.289
what we're doing is doing a cupboard fold,
folding the edges together. Flipping this

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:17.200
unit to the other side, so the open sides
are on the bottom, take one of the top corners

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:26.609
and fold it down, into a triangle. Note this
little white triangle or white square that

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:39.880
shows up. Do, do the same thing on the other
corner. Flip the model 180 degrees, and fold

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:56.229
that, fold that triangle down, as well.
Now, flip your unit back, open up those triangles

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.539
that we made. We are going to inside reverse
fold this triangle.
