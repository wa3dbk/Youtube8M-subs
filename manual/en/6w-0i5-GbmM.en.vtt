00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.849
What we're going to do today is, apparently
Simon's been driving it around a little bit

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:10.490
in his new truck. And everybody's telling
him that he's driving around in a grandpa's

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.679
car. Because the thing looks like a sedan,
it's that low. So we've come down to EFS,

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:23.550
and we've come down to their big Brisbane
workshop. And we're going to put a 3-inch

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.609
lift kit into it. We've come up with a set
of heavy-duty springs that are going to handle

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.370
the punishment that Simon puts onto it once
he puts his canopy on there, loads it up to

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.499
the eyeballs, and heads up north.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.620
I do love hardcore 4-wheel driving. It is
awesome stuff.

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:54.690
So stick around and have a look to see how
we transform Simon's grandpa car into something

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.600
a bit tougher.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.819
Don't need that bit.

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:00.779
So what we've got is, we've pulled the suspension
out of the front end. And we've pulled the

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:07.549
radius arms out. And the radius arms control
the caster of the front diff. So have a look

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.549
over here. We've got the bushes that need
to go in. So generally that would be in the

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.670
centre for the standard one, but these ones
are offset 2 degrees. Now that allows when

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.399
the suspension goes up, it allows the diff
to roll. Otherwise your wheels would end up

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.390
like this. They'd end up like that. And that'd
be a real problem with your steering. So it

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.200
controls your caster. So 2 degrees goes into
the front caster radius arms. And it makes

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.540
the geometry of the steering work.

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:52.649
So this is what's going in to the front end
of the Toyota. We've got standard Toyota suspension

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.179
and what we're going to stick in. Now this
will give us the 3" lift including changing

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:04.329
the bicycle pump, what I call the bicycle
pump for the steering dampener. So big bore

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:12.060
shock absorbers. You'll see they're bigger,
heavier coils, and they've got more of a lift

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.740
in them.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.860
Alright, so there we go. We've got the new
suspension into Simon's truck. It's got itself

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.980
an aboslute huge lift. What do you reckon,
mate?

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.140
It's certainly lifted up in the air, buddy.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.240
It sure has. Well there you go. A 3-inch lift
kit into the old Simon's truck. Next step,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.320
what's the next step?

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.629
Tyres.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.120
Tyres and rims. We'll see how we go with that.
