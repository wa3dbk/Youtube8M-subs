Hello! My name is Louis Ortiz on behalf of
Expert Village and today we’re going to

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.860
show you how to sharpen a knife. I’ve got
a tri-stone here that we’re going to use,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.559
if you’ll notice there’s a small little
guide on here to a 23 degree angle for those

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.760
of you that haven’t ever done this before
so that will give you a point of reference

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.960
as to what angle to hit the knife at. I’ve
got a couple of different knives just to show

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.970
you as an example this is a Santaco knife
and I’ve got a basic chef’s utility knife

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.870
that we’re going to put an edge on, so instead
of using mineral oil I’m actually using

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.180
a honing oil that was provided with this stone
it tends to work a little better and we’re

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:53.360
just going to put a small stream on there.
Okay and you really don’t want to have an

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.460
excess amount of oil simply because it won’t
sharpen the blade it’ll just create too

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.090
much lubrication and we won’t get enough
friction out of it, so at a 23 degree angle

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:11.090
I start I usually use my thumb as a guide
on the back of the blade if you’ll notice

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.299
on the stroke it goes away from me. I’m
just going to go back and forth and if you

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:27.499
notice I started on the course edge of the
stone and you’ll be able to feel with your

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:34.779
thumb there’s a small burr which is actually
a little bit of resistance to your thumb there

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:42.569
so all we’re trying to do is keep that burr
going at a 23 degree angle and we’ll follow

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.380
up on the fine stone, the medium and then
the fine.
