00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.020
"I must study politics and war,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.480
that my sons may study philosophy,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.240
in order to give their children the rights to study the arts."

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.080
President John Adams said that.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.260
What that means to me

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.840
is that I'm here and able to do what I'm doing

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.380
because of what others have sacrificed.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.400
Not just people of the past,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.360
but now donors,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.860
and my family here that I've become part of.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.560
My time to give back is coming,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.360
and I'm on the path to graduating,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.200
and I am grateful.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.280
I think you deserve what you are grateful for.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.060
In a way,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.780
the things you value most

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.760
end up defining you.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.740
So I always make sure I look carefully

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.780
and notice all that's around me.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.620
You see,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.820
your heart tells your eyes what to see,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.620
whether you see some of the mistakes

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.220
or the good in them.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.540
It's just what you focus on.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.120
That is a choice you make in your heart

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.880
and your eyes follow.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.760
So I take something as ordinary as a meal...

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.440
look around me.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.360
We're not a group of classmates,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.360
it's more than this.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.260
We have become a family,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.400
sharing a meal.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.940
Some of the most important conversations I've ever had

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.420
have occurred at this table.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.740
I look around me today,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.820
real close...

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.780
I had a good look.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.580
And you know what I saw?

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.240
I'm able to focus on what matters to me

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.220
because of the support of others.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.200
We are all responsible

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.960
to what we've been given.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.920
I'm responsible for a lot now,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.880
but I am ready.
