00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:03.895
Well, we've discovered gears in an insect.

00:00:03.895 --> 00:00:08.821
Mechanically interacting gears are always
thought of as a man-made invention,

00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:11.236
used in our bikes and our cars.

00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:14.274
But what we've shown is that
a small plant-sucking bug

00:00:14.274 --> 00:00:20.949
evolved gears long, long ago, and uses
these gears to mechanically synchronize

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.979
the very rapid jumping
movements of its legs.

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:32.081
This is the first demonstration of
interacting gears being used by any animal.

00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:36.116
The jump is really very rapid indeed.

00:00:36.116 --> 00:00:40.440
It takes off at a velocity of
about five meters per second:

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.621
that's equivalent to about
twelve miles per hour,

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:46.576
and it accelerates
in less than a millisecond.

00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:50.770
So it experiences enormous
G-forces as it takes off.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.660
About 500 or even 700 G.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.402
I first became aware of these bugs
when I was in the garden

00:00:57.402 --> 00:01:00.648
of my friend and colleague Peter BrÃ¤unig
in Aachen in Germany.

00:01:00.898 --> 00:01:04.911
He has a quite wild garden with
lots of ivy growing all over the place.

00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:09.456
They're very specific sort of bug: 
they only like to eat ivy.

00:01:09.456 --> 00:01:15.244
So I spent a huge amount of time trying to
look on all the ivy bushes in Cambridge

00:01:15.244 --> 00:01:17.815
for these bugs and couldn't find them.

00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:22.178
Then my 5-year-old grandson
Max came to the rescue.

00:01:22.278 --> 00:01:27.032
He found these bugs in his garden and
he rushed up to me one day and said:

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:30.107
Grandad, I found these planthoppers
in my garden. Here they are!

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:33.981
And so we brought them back
to the lab here in Cambridge...

00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:36.429
and that's when I did
the experiment of showing

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.456
that the cog wheels were
actually engaging with each other.

00:01:39.456 --> 00:01:44.050
The high-speed images
that we have taken of these bugs,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.945
to reveal these very short brief events,

00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:50.900
takes us into a completely
different world.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.819
Two artists in London, Emily Tracy and
Lizzy Hobbs, have collaborated with me

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:05.880
on taking these films and doing a community
project in Hackney in East London.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.799
So we've been interacting with a class
of nine-year-old children

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.725
from Gayhurst primary school in Hackney

00:02:13.975 --> 00:02:17.727
and with two groups of senior citizens

00:02:18.157 --> 00:02:21.505
called Rays Geezers and the Sharp End.

00:02:22.735 --> 00:02:25.136
And the interaction has led to

00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:29.403
animating films of the creatures
moving in the water.

00:02:29.973 --> 00:02:32.863
The children have been doing
the animations:

00:02:32.973 --> 00:02:35.728
drawing the animals, painting them.

00:02:35.858 --> 00:02:38.444
And the artists have been
assembling a film

00:02:38.444 --> 00:02:42.119
based on those pictures
and on my pictures.
