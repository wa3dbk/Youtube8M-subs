but anyway be sure to check that out

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.640
and for right now i'll show you how to
make this recipe

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.079
start with 6 clean and cut strawberries

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.079
add 2 tablespoons of sugar

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:14.850
you can add three to four scoops of ice
cream which ever you prefer one teaspoon

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.560
of vanilla extract

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.619
about a cup of milk

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:30.000
this is optional but you can add some
strawberry syrup and just blend until

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
there's no more large chunks

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.920
now just pour it into a glass

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.790
top of some whipped cream and garnish
with a fresh strawberry

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.840
if you're wondering what to do with the
extra you can just put some into the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.910
popsicle containers and freeze

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.900
don't have popsicle to take containers
you can always use ice cube trays

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:14.320
