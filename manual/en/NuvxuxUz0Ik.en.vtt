Hi, welcome to Telonium Thursdays Whiteboard
Web Series. I'm your host for this week, Alex.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.779
This week we will be talking about business
phone systems.

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.130
A phone system refers to all the components
a business needs to get calls from outside

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.640
and make calls itself. In particular, in order
to have a phone # for your business but still

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.970
have multiple extensions for your employees,
you need something called a private branch

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.800
exchange, or PBX for short. What's a pbx?
Well, last time we talked about something

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.800
called the public switched telephone network,
or PSTN. A PBX is basically the private version

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.840
of that for businesses. It's a PSTN in a box.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.460
There are different types of pbx's, but the
first we'll talk about are on-site pbx's used

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.670
for analog phone systems. This has a certain
# of phone lines coming in and extensions

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.670
going out.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.280
The # of lines a business has represents the
# of phone calls it can have going on at once.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.170
In analog phone systems, every line has a
different phone #. Businesses can use hunt

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.630
group so that if the first line is busy, a
customer's call will go to the second, and

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.690
if that's busy, the third, and so on.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.000
Now, even though this business has 15 extensions
connected to their phone system, they can

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.659
have 6 calls going on at once.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.710
There are some advantages and disadvantages
to this system. We'll talk about the disadvantages

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.450
right now but will come back to advantages
by the end of this video. For one , it's not

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.390
very scalable. If your business gets more
employees, you could have to get a whole new

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.590
PBX if you wanted more extensions. Like in
the last example, the busines only has 15

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.070
extensions. So if a 16th employee wants a
phone, tough luck.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.779
The same thing applies to lines. If your business
wants to be able to have 7 phone calls or

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:17.200
more at once, a pbx with 6 lines doesn't support
that.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.450
Secondly, it's really expensive and a huge
headache to install and manage. A lot of companies

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.819
have to hire an IT guy just to take care of
it.

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.290
Finally, if you want your business's employees
to telecommute, they can't do so with an analog

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.989
pbx. If they go home, they're stuck with their
cell phones and can't use their business #.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:43.989
There's a second type of pbx called a hosted
pbx that is most commonly powered by VoIP.

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:51.230
This is the service that Telonium provides.
Basically, instead of having a pbx on-site

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.230
at your business, we host it for you on the
internet.

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.239
So as long as you have a high-speed internet
connection, you can use the Internet to connect

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.790
to us, and we'll connect you to the PSTN.
This is great because it solves some of the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.099
problems of an analog pbx.

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:29.099
The hosted pbx is easily scalable. With a
hosted pbx, you have unlimited lines, unlimited

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:34.760
concurrent calls provided your internet is
fast enough. And if more people at your business

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.150
want a telephone, you can add extensions immediately
by just letting us know. You wouldn't have

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.329
to get a whole new PBX.
Second, in a hosted system, since the PBX

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.680
is online, you can use your business phone
# anywhere as long as you have an internet

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.480
connection. You can be at home, at the beach,
at a park, wherever. This means you and your

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.809
team can telecommute.
Third, because the pbx is online, you can

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:05.309
get rid of your entire analog network. Rather
than having a lot of phone lines installed

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:10.480
at your office, you can just use your one
internet connection for all your phone and

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.480
data needs.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.019
We mentioned that there are advantages of
having an on-site system earlier, so let's

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.680
discuss those now.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.360
First, if your office site does not have high-speed
internet available, the analog option is better

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.159
Second, if you are an enterprise level company
and already have one or more full-time IT

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:36.169
support members, it might be more cost effective
to have physical control over the phone system

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.039
on site.

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:42.039
See, the costs associated with having an on-site
phone system are the following:

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.620
But for hosted, you don't need to pay for
the first part.

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.759
To summarize, a pbx is a private version of
the PSTN that connects your employees to the

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:16.169
public. We talked about some of the differences
between onsite and hosted phone systems, and

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.729
it's clear there are pros and cons for both.
A large company might profit most by using

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:28.300
their own onsite system. But for small businesses,
because of cost, scalability, and convenience,

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.449
the hosted system generally provides the most
benefit.

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.909
Okay everyone, I hoped you learned a little
bit today; don't forget to tune in next week

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:42.330
to a new addition of Telonium Thursdays. And
until then, you can follow us at Twitter @telonium
