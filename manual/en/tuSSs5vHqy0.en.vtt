00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.620
...this should be all right.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.120
What are you doing, Kuroneko?

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.680
!

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.150
Onii-san, say something if you're here.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.380
Oops, sorry.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.880
...so, what were you doing?

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:26.620
Can't you tell? I'm piercing this divine object with this needle fused with the power of the silver thread.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.650
So that just means you're sewing?

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.780
...that's what it would be in the human language.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.380
Aren't you human too?
You aren't human?
I don't get it at all...

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.080
■ Aren't you human too? ■
You aren't human?
I don't get it at all...

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.420
Human language... aren't you a human too?

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.980
What you can see is merely a human projection of me.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.480
I-Is that so?

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.320
Yes.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.550
...one day, I might show you my real form.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.320
I... see.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.550
So basically she's one bona fide chuunibyou.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.450
Aren't you human too?
You aren't human?
I don't get it at all...

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.820
■ Aren't you human too? ■
You aren't human?
I don't get it at all...

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.620
Aren't you human too?
■ You aren't human? ■
I don't get it at all...

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.580
You're saying that as if you aren't human.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.020
...That's exactly what I said.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.080
Because what you see is merely a projection of what I am.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.480
I-Is that so?

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.980
Yes.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.920
...one day, I might show you my real form.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.350
I... see.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.420
So basically she's one bona fide chuunibyou.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.280
Aren't you human too?
You aren't human?
I don't get it at all...

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.620
■ Aren't you human too? ■

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.680

You aren't human?
■ I don't get it at all... ■

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.680
Sorry but I don't get it at all...

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.550
Looks like you're not smart enough... unfortunately.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:09.280
But, one day you might understand what I said, that I'm not just a human.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.680
I-Is that so?

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.050
Yes.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.950
...one day, I might show you my real form.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.620
I... see.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.720
So basically she's one bona fide chuunibyou.
