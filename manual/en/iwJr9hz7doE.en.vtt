Hi, my name is Nate McCullough on behalf of
Expert Village. In these clips we're going

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.980
to talk about the proper way to remove and
replace a front wheel drive vehicle's Ball

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.400
Joint. In this clip we're going to talk about
the proper way to reinstall your vehicle's

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.529
Control Arm. Here's my Control Arm assembly.
I have my socket wrench and my socket and

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:30.080
my retain bolts. We'll go ahead and slip underneath
the vehicle. As you can see, I have a jack

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.129
stand over here. That's a safety device. You
never want to get underneath the vehicle just

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.019
relying on the hydraulic floor jack. I'm going
to get my milk crate out of the way and slip

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:51.180
right underneath. Alright, I'm starting my
first Control Arm bolt right now. Some wiggling

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:09.210
may be required to get everything to line
back up the way they want it. Alright, and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:38.549
now for my rear bolts. We'll go ahead and
get those lined up. It's a

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.420
good idea to go ahead and start all of your
bolts before you begin any tightening sequences.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.740
That way you can ensure that all of your holes
will line up. If you were to snug down one

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.900
bolt, your part is going to be fixed and you
may not have all of the holes lined up that

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:19.760
you needed. Take my ratchet, go ahead and
tighten down my bolts.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.480
Ok, you're going to repeat the tightening
procedure for the remainder of the bolts.
