00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.980
This will be our first group of students
who will graduate in our program so

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.139
they are our pioneers students. We started the Academy at Williams. We're extremely

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.759
excited to be moving forward at Plano
East. This group of students started in

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.869
the Academy in grade 10 with Collin
College courses. Collin College is

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.900
working in collaboration with Plano ISD
to bring this exciting new program to

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.779
the students. It consists of college
education dual credit classes and

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.440
certificate-based success. We believe
that the partnership will do a lot to

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.760
enhance our reputation as a campus.
Collin College professors become a part

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.530
of our campus fabric. I think we'll bring
college readiness, college forward

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.829
thinking to our students. It's great to
have an academy that prepares and

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.760
inspires kids to move into the health
profession. It's remarkable to see the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.149
growth and the maturity level and to
watch their excitement because they

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.010
really are eager to begin putting on
stethoscopes and doing blood pressure

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.180
checks and doing what they signed up to
do. This first group coming to Plano East

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.890
it's exciting because they're kind of
getting an idea now and they know what

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.560
they want to focus on. Space is beautiful.
The faculty that Collin has provided us

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.740
with our outstanding and the resources
at Collin we bring in is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.860
state-of-the-art. So we're extremely
excited.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.700
(music)

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.940
It was great seeing the students seeing
the classrooms for the first time and

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.740
the labs. The excitement on their faces.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:55.900
(music)

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.439
We've created a curriculum and provided
resources for the students that are

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.079
going to be state-of-the-art. They will
be well trained when they hit the

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.490
clinical floors. Beginning in the ninth
grade the students work using phones,

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.690
iPads, laptops. We emphasize collaborative thinking, critical thinking skills, team

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.510
building. We get to introduce them to new
technologies and exposures they might

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.760
not have gotten to see going into a
specific workforce program a simulation

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.500
manikins, simulation cadaver. They'll be
able to apply that to what they learn in

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.209
a theory in class, in the lecture in
class. The students really get to stay on

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.590
top and in front of that leading edge in
healthcare. After they graduate and they

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.290
get out into the field they're gonna be comfortable they're gonna

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.489
understand what's going to be required
and the equipment that they use. We've

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.110
created a series of workshops that the
students at Williams will do during

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.860
their lunch and during that time the
students will be able to choose whether

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.630
they want to do remediation, whether they
want to attend a guest speaker's lecture,

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.870
where they want to practice clinical
skills. One of the things that we

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.250
emphasize with the Academy students is
community service. The focus is really on

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.530
creating a way for the students to give
back so that when they do arrive and are

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.370
ready to start working they will have
lots of real life experiences that they

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.750
can integrate into that position. We
would like to present you with the money that

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:30.200
we earned at Open House. We sold gold pins in honor of Carson and to support Carson's two seniors.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.580
All I can say is that this is a brilliant group of students. They're absolutely amazing and

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.930
they're just so willing to learn and
everything you teach them whatever it is

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.770
whatever you ask them to do they rise to
the occasion and go beyond. We were able

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.380
to certify them for CPR so they are now
BLS CPR certified for healthcare

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.240
professionals. That's amazing at 15, 16 and 17 years of age. Here's an example of

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.560
students being really in college so not
only are they ready but they're actually

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.180
functioning as college students. When the students leave our program and exit at

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.610
grade 12 they will leave with one of
several workforce certifications and the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.870
advantage for that is it will give
students lots of options. Some students

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.430
may decide that they will remain as a
phlebotomist or EKG which is two tracks

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.320
that we have. Other students may use that as a foundation to move forward and go

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.830
to nursery school or medical school.
They'll be well trained and they're also

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.120
gonna have options about where they
want to go in healthcare. They're gonna

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.350
graduate out with an unbelievable
number of credit hours. They have a

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.160
wonderful futures ahead of them.
