00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.140
Hey everyone, it’s Jeff Salzenstein, and in today's video,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.420
we're going to talk about the forehand volley,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.740
specifically

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.320
what you need to be doing with your upper body when you see that it comes to your forehand side.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, there are a lot of misconceptions out there,
I've heard it over and over again

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.140
from various players and even coaches. They talk about

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.880
turning the shoulders on the volley when they see that the ball comes like this,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.860
extreme turn like this,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.160
and I've even heard this term, like, feel like you have handcuffs with your

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.260
your hands here.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.500
So, I'm here to tell you that that is the wrong way of doing things.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.160
So, if you've seen any videos, or you’ve worked with any coaches

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.140
that tell you to turn like this,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.820
you're doing it incorrectly.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.020
You can continue to do it that way, but you just
won't be volleying like guys like Roger Federer,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.240
Patrick Rafter,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.240
and all, basically all the great volleyers on tour that
play now and that played in the past.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.940
So, what you want to do,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.180
I'll give you a quick shadow stroke version.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.340
What you want to do is you want to focus on keeping your hips and your shoulders

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.080
facing the net more.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.600
So, when you get ready to hit the volley

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.580
or when you see the ball is coming,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.580
feel like this off-hand comes out in this direction more, and your shoulders are going to face

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.640
the net more.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.840
So, you don't want to get a turn like this,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.080
you do want to

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.180
make this move right here. The arm will come across a little bit,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.780
but you just want to feel like

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.060
your shoulders are facing the net more.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.520
If it goes any more than a 45-degree angle, you're in big trouble.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.620
So, I've got a student with us today. Jordan, come on in.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.180
Jordan's going to work with us today. How you doing today?

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.980
(Jordan): Thanks Jeff.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.720
Yeah, it's a pleasure to have you here.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.420
I know you're a 4-5 player, you play a couple times a week, you’re an avid player.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.660
Would you agree that you’ve been taught to

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.180
turn your shoulders, if you’ve heard it before?
(Jordan): Definitely. Definitely have.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.320
Okay, so,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.380
we're going to try to change that up a little bit today.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.920
We're going to feed you some balls, alright?
(Jordan): Excellent.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.140
Alright Jordan, we’re dispelling myths right here.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.600
I want you to go ahead and do it the wrong way.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.500
I want you to exaggerate the shoulder turn
when you make the first move.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.760
Good. So, I see that a lot.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.940
Just do it again, turn the shoulders. Yes, good.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.540
And keep your hands a little more in front, but still stay sideways. Good.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.020
Turn your shoulders again.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.740
Excellent.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.260
Okay,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.200
So, that's the wrong way of doing it,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.420
now we're going to do it the right way.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.720
I want you to focus on keeping your shoulders
facing the net as much as you can.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.640
Almost feel like you're open, you’re not turning at all.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.780
Good, even less than that.
See if you can make your off-hand go towards me.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.500
Good, even more.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.260
Exaggerate. Better.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.600
Okay, now I want you to exaggerate the extra turn again.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.720
so do it incorrectly, so we can see the difference.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.520
Good, there we go.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.800
Now, I want you to face the net more when you make your first move.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.000
Good, excellent.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.780
Good.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.940
That's awesome.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.120
So, as you just saw in the last demonstration,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.140
we had Jordan focusing on doing it the wrong way and the right way.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.340
So, Jordan, go ahead and get into this position where you're turning,

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.400
extra turn,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.000
this is what I see some coaches teaching,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.320
and this is what I see some players doing.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.300
You can take that off-hand off,
and then look forward, there.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.860
I see that on the volley,

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.600
and what we want to work on, go back to the ready position,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.420
is when you make the first move,
and come around here,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.600
you really want to feel like

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.800
you lead with the hand just like that,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.520
and this hand just can stay,

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.360
stay somewhere over here, like that, and then you can just

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.060
move to the ball. So, go ahead and step to the ball now.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.680
That's it.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.820
And so, you don't have to exaggerate

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.400
this extra turn. You can just keep this hand out like this.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.240
I really hope you received a ton of value from this lesson today,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.580
