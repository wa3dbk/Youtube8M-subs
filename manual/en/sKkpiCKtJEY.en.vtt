00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.580
Streams are really easy to install
when you used flexible liner.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.670
A stream

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.470
is formed in nature when water erodes
soil away so it always has a canyon shape

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.519
with side walls on it.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.760
The staircase shape will let you have the
waterfall so we have

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.480
dugout the side of the hill here

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.860
with a canyon shape and a staircase shape
at the same time.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.600
Then we put the rubber liner in

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.130
and we put the rocks in on top of the rubber
liner.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.370
We didn't use flat flagstone on round the
rocks because in nature you don't see

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.150
a flat flagstone sticking out of the hillside
with water falling off it.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.210
Water erodes soil away, gets down to the bedrock
and so the waterfalls are formed out of bigger, thicker

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.320
boulder types of stones. So in here you
can see the waterfall dropoffs are nice,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.650
big, thick stones not little, tiny, flagstones
sticking out over space.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.360
So we have the canyon shape

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.980
and the staircase shape to make this little stream.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.270
As we get down into the pond we've got some more
rocks for the water to go in different directions

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.340
as it spreads out into the pond.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.500
This basic water garden has several shelves. There 
is the deep area in the bottom for the fish to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.470
overwinter in

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.340
and then there's some staircase shaped shelves
that come up.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.890
The shelves are different widths and different
heights so we can have different types of plants.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.990
We've got some taller plants on the side and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.640
some wider, groundcover plants on this side.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.189
The water lilies here

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.560
are planted on a deep self that had a 
divot dug out

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.390
so it's a flower pot in the shape of the shelf

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.780
and the rubber liner

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.060
conforms to that, then we filled it with gravel

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.049
so that the water lilies planted down deep enough

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.689
that it will survive the winter 
without being frozen.

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.770
The roots of the water lily plant cannot have
ice around them to survive the winter.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.420
The top is going to die off,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.319
but the

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.979
roots need to stay in cold water not frozen.

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.500
As we come up to these higher shelves,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.630
we have Forget-me-nots here; these little blue
flowers in here

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.310
and they form a little groundcover. They're growing
out over the pond edge to hide the rubber

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.359
liner that's here

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:17.079
and we've got some Sedums here that are growing
the other direction over the liner to hide

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.310
the liner. So this nice,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.609
free-formed shape

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.019
is easy to hide with these plants

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.739
because they grow in both directions from
the dryland to the wetland and back and forth

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.429
and so they're very easy to hide the liner.
Instead of the normal way of installing

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:32.120
the pond that a lot of people use

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.529
of a rock edge to try and hold the liner
in place,

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:39.460
and that rock edge making a separation between the
dryland and the wetland 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.569
and making a visible

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.779
line that's very easy to see,

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:47.540
these plants are now growing across this border
and making it hidden.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.040
This is much prettier to look at than a rock,
pearl necklace kind of border.
