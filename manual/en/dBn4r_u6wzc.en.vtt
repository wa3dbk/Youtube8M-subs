Hi, my name is Michael Burton with michaelburtonfilms.org
locate in Salt Lake City, Utah. And we're

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.580
here talking about using Microsoft Windows.
Now what I want to talk to you about is how

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.280
you play a music CD on your computer. Let
me start off by saying that WindowsXp is a

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.570
registered trademark of Microsoft and I am
in no affiliated with Microsoft. When we place

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.900
a music CD in the computer it automatically
should bring up a menu that gives you a bunch

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.630
of options of what you can do with that CD
and what are the different types of players

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.460
that you can play that music in. As you can
see here, this is audio CD, these are our

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.859
options. We can play or save the music from
the audio CD, we can rip the music from the

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:47.230
CD, play the audio CD in the media center
or in Windows media player. We can also import

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.420
them in to Rap City, we can also play them
at iTunes. There are many different options.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.329
The other way you could do it is to just open
the folder to view the files that are on the

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.679
CD, the individual track, so you can play
the individual track on any one of those players

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.713
as well, instead of viewing the entire album.
What we're going to go ahead and do is we're

00:01:05.713 --> 00:01:11.541
going to go ahead and choose to play the audio
CD using the Windows media player. And we

00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:15.680
can also check right here to say, always do
the selected action so that automatically

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.650
when you put a music CD in, you'll automatically
play it in that player. But I like to leave

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.750
it unchecked just because then I have my options.
We're going to click o.k., this automaticaly

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.570
brings up the music in the music player. As
you can see here to the right, you've got

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.770
your track list of all the tracks that are
on the CD. And this of course is Windows media

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.250
player. You also have the option if you come
up here to the top, you have the option to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.890
rip the CD or to burn, burn is more for, like
I said for burning files to CDs where you

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.530
could actually burn eight meter CD, using
them for playback in your computer or somewhere

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.960
else. But ripping the music from the audio
CD has always helped me because I can listen

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.960
to my CDs or I can actually listen to them
now in the digital age, I can rip the music

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.070
from the CDs, keep them on my computer, I
can also network them to my XBox360 on my

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.010
network and play the music in my living room
or my computer, you know from my station.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.390
Then I could also you know, change the format,
make them an MP3s, put them on my iPod, things

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.140
like that. So that's a good way to, so you
don't have to always be putting your CDs in.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.120
But if you put your CDs in, again it will
give you that automatic menu to, it'll automatically

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.200
pop open that menu and give you some options
as to what to do. Another way to do this,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.870
if the menu doesn't pop up for some reason,
is you go over to your start menu, and then

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.069
you can go over to my computer. When you click
on my computer it'll bring up right here.

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.510
These are all your devices. And right now
it's saying that there's an audio CD in my

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:56.879
GDrive, that's my top DVD burning Drive on
my computer. The HDrive is my DVD Drive. But

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:03.719
my audio CD is in my DVD Drive. I can either
right click on this and click play, I can

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:10.349
also go ahead and open and view one of the
individual tracks, or I can just double click

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.640
on the icon and it does the same thing. It
opens it right up. I have my default set to

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.859
Windows media player. You can also change
your default to iTunes or Rap City or you

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.299
know, whatever you deem necessary for you
to use.
