00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.660
I'm Corinne Lapointe, Investigating Officer
with WorkSafeBC. Before you start a job, make

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.380
sure a hazard assessment and a job plan have
been done. That didn't happen at this well

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.820
site - instead the workers improvised. Things
went terribly wrong.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.920
A truck driver arrived with a load of concrete
barriers. He'd been told that there would

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.630
be a picker truck for offloading, but there
wasn't one.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.439
Instead, just before the truck arrived an
excavator operator on the site was directed

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.120
by his supervisor to offload using this excavator.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.219
With no proper lifting attachment on site,
the two workers improvised with what was on

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.420
hand. The truck driver had some tie-down chains
so he rigged them above the excavator bucket

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.780
and around the two grooves beneath a barrier.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.989
When the excavator lifted the barrier, one
chain slipped out of its groove. The truck

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.959
driver waved to the excavator operator to
stop and to lower the load so he could reposition

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:59.949
the chains.

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.829
The operator couldn't hear what the driver
was saying, so with the load suspended, he

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.150
engaged the safety lockout lever. This disabled
the operating controls, preventing the excavator

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.010
and boom from moving. He then exited his cab
and talked to the driver.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.000
As the operator climbed back into the excavator,
his pant leg snagged the safety lockout lever,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.520
releasing it. This enabled the controls. His
left pocket then snagged a joystick.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.340
The excavator's boom suddenly swung. The
barrier glanced off the driver's chest,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.560
dipped down and then struck his lower leg,
knocking him off the flat-deck.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.090
The barrier then slipped from the chains and
crashed onto the flat-deck. This accident

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.570
didn't have to happen.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.970
Safety activities must be coordinated on multiple-employer
worksites. Here, the work among the different

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.420
employers was not coordinated.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.909
The pre-job planning was inadequate. Employers
must perform a risk assessment, identify hazards,

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.100
and implement safe work procedures. Don't
start a job until the proper equipment and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.070
procedures are in place.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.150
The supervision was also inadequate. Supervisors
must inform workers of hazards and regularly

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.489
check that workers are doing their jobs safely.

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.680
Although an excavator can be used to lift
barriers, a picker truck or forklift provides

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.430
better control.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.379
With a picker truck or excavator, use an engineered
lifting device. Most precast concrete suppliers

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.239
have specialized barrier lifts available for
loan.

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.349
Never leave the controls of lifting equipment
while a load is suspended. And keep a safe

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.189
distance from the load.

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.819
The driver's leg was fractured so badly
that part of it had to be amputated. Don't

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.599
improvise. Plan ahead and stay safe.
