Hi, I'm Jamie Miller and today I'm making tabbouleh, a delicious and healthy summer

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.590
salad featuring

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.610
fresh parsley. Tabbouleh features a lot

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.820
parsley so you're chopping a big mound.
It really helps if you

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.040
gather it all together and just chop

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.550
away until it's nice and fine.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.680
Another main ingredient in tabbouleh salad is bulgur wheat.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.930
It's a terrific option for summer salads
because it doesn't even require cooking.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.960
All we need to do is pour enough
boiling water over the bulgur wheat

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.570
to cover and then let it set for about
15 minutes.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.129
So I'll just set my bulgur aside and
the next

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.289
step is to make refreshing little
vinaigrette with olive oil

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.859
and fresh lemon juice.

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.129
We've got about 2 Iemons worth of fresh juice

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.640
and you wanna use a good quality extra
virgin olive oil.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.100
And we just wisk

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.260
that together for a simple and fresh
tasting vinaigrette.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.700
OK.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.350
So I've drained my bulgur wheat and you
wanna make sure to press out as much

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.580
water as possible.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.670
Next we're gonna go ahead and whisk in
that vinaigrette.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.730
You want the grains to really soak up all
the flavor in that lemon juice and the

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.100
olive oil before we start adding
ingredients.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.310
So now I'm gonna stir in our

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.480
freshly chopped up fragrant parsley. I'm
also gonna

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.590
add to that lots of healthy vegetables. I've
got some crisp cucumbers.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.100
I have got some juicy ripe

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.390
summer tomatoes. A little bit of red

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.400
onion that's going to add a nice savoriness to our dish.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.370
And some chopped up

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.550
fresh mint. Just gonna stir all that
together.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.820
Add a little bit of salt and pepper to
taste and you've got a fantastic summer

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.460
salad.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.930
You can keep Bonnie herbs like parsley and mint

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.760
at your fingertips right outside your
kitchen by growing them in pots.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.979
Plant your Bonnie herbs in a container filled
with good quality potting soil

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.090
and where it gets good sun. To plant, remove
the label,

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.939
gently tear away the bottom of the pot, and
peel back the rim of the pot

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.650
so it's not sticking above the soil and
plant it.
