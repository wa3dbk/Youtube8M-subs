00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.400
do is we're gonna blanch the green beans

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.580
a lot of people go seems fancy but it's

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.990
not so you got your ice water bad yes so

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.670
that's ready and you got some green

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.250
beans you've got them already to the end

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.070
snapped off yeah we went ahead we washed

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.480
them drain them snapped off the ends and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.949
made him into some bite-sized pieces

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.160
they don't have to be perfect

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.040
okay so we're gonna pull em in another

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.379
lunch and you got a pot of salted

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.270
boiling water yeah just like a smidge of

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.399
salt all righty and then we're just

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.440
gonna put these in here okay and you can

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.960
set a timer if you're a bad guesstimate

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.180
err which I am with ingredient sizes but

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.920
you're only gonna leave them on for like

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.530
two minutes I'll write it for two

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.670
minutes yeah so they still got a real

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.590
pretty green color

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.780
they'll be tender you are to cook them

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.289
to death I don't like beans that are

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.149
cooked to death

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.199
so now you're draining them and then

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.770
you're gonna put them in your ice water

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.710
bath and what this does is it makes them

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.860
quit cooking so this pretty green color

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.990
you get to keep okay and you leave them

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.850
in your cold water bath for just a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.850
minute and then because you're gonna put

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:26.549
them in a wok with some oil we want to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:29.100
go ahead and drain them again okay so

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.290
now you've drained your ice tub beans

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.610
and now you're gonna take a walk and you

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.530
got on medium-high heat

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.909
I didn't yes sir and you're gonna throw

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.560
a little bit of butter in here

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.420
yeah tablespoon of butter and a

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.210
tablespoon off that'll definitely help

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.070
the green beans to taste better having

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.229
some butter in there butters all melted

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.409
up in there and because we're gonna

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.030
wanna use half of regular onion they

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.100
need to cook a little by themselves

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.329
assault ate your onehans up for a couple

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.119
of minutes we're gonna add some garlic

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.429
we're going to add

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.070
red pepper with the seeds and the

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:06.939
membranes remove and then also some

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.700
ginger okay we love us so maybe the

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.280
green beans will taste good I mean how

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.260
could they not taste good with these

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.879
flavors all right so we've had that

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.400
cooker for about two minutes so we're

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.660
going to throw in the green and how long

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.299
you gonna cook this about two minutes

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.450
yeah just a couple minutes boom green

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.970
bean he'll and maybe it won't be so

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.519
hellish though now we're going to Asian

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:36.610
it up right we're gonna add about two

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:40.060
tablespoons soy strong sauce and then

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.610
just just like half a teaspoon this is

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.410
just strong you don't wanna watch oh

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.269
okay okay

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.140
that was more like a quarter of a

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:53.410
teaspoon have you salted it up at all

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.269
soy sauce as salsa you can always add

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.610
more but I think we're gonna find that

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.489
it's just funny you know this sort of

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.540
looks like the green beans we've gotten

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.790
out at Asian

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.140
we doubt so you just stir them around

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.790
for a min with the oil soy sauce and

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.609
that's it huh

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.500
finito the last thing you're gonna do is

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.870
garnish him up with a little toasted

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.670
sesame seeds uh-huh and then you can add

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.439
those the table along with the soy sauce

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.209
just in case people want a little more

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.519
salty there you have it there's some

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:32.280
ginger garlic green beans with a little

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:32.280
bit of Asian Flair it worked
