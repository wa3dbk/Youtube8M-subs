Alright so today I'm going to show you how
to detangle curly hair.

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.200
Now Casey here has hair fresh out of the shower
and there are two different ways that I would

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.200
do this.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.150
I would either brush your hair in the shower
with conditioner in it so that you get the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.220
most slip through the hair so that the tangles
can very easily come out.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.369
Or I would recommend right after the shower
brushing your hair out.

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.530
I always like to use a wet brush.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.500
And what it is, is it's got plastic bristles
but they're just super, super flexible.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.500
What that does is when you're brushing through
the hair and it meets resistance it just brushes

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.500
right through.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.600
Instead of being so stiff and pulling the
tangle it'll just kind of bend until you can

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.600
get the tangle out.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.460
So this is my favorite kind of brush to use.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.489
I also really love detangling sprays and leave
in conditioner as a detangling aid.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.600
So if you weren't going to brush your hair
right in the shower.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.670
I would definitely recommend spritzing on
a leave in conditioner spray, all throughput.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.850
So Casey has soft fine hair, if you had a
bit courser hair I would definitely recommend

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.070
using a leave in conditioner in this part
too.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.140
I'm going to use a tiny bit.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.020
Leave in conditioners are great as opposed
to a traditional conditioner they're really

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.660
light weight.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.869
So they're almost like water in the hair.

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.130
So I'm just going to rake that through with
my fingers.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.710
Or if your hair is really tangly I would start
from kind of midway through the hair all the

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.810
way through the ends.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.000
Then as you brush through your hair you're
going to brush it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.689
The best way to detangle is to separate your
hair into sections.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.640
So I always start with the first section.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.710
Take a little section, take your wet brushing
and you always want to start with the tips.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.439
As soon as you get all the tangles out of
the tips you just keep moving right on up

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.969
the hair.

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.030
As opposed to taking it from the root and
dragging it down.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.640
Curly hair is fragile.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.260
We don't think that it's fragile because it
can be such a pain.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.450
But it really is fragile.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.090
It gets dry quick, it gets damaged quick.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.940
And I think for most of us the goal is to
keep our hair as frizz free as possible, so

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.830
we want to do everything we can to get that.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.260
So I'm just kind of moving along in quarters
though the hair here.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:26.139
Brushing through the product all the way through.

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:27.730
And that's how to detangle curly hair.
