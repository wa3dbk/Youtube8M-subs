00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.580
"Doesn't it "rot your socks" when
you own your pride and joy and after a little

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.680
while the paint begins to fade and chips and
scratches begin to appear in the paintwork

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.070
and if it's anything like this car you think
you are never going to get it back to showroom

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.119
condition or if you can, it's going to cost
a fortune. Well not anymore because now there's

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.430
Whatscratch? We are going to set Terry to
work on this car to see what he can do. Terry

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.960
Missen, by the way, is one of the qualified
mobile professionals from Whatscratch? Good

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.519
luck Terry".

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.930
If your car has faded paintwork, scratches,
chips and stains, Whatscratch? understands

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.070
your dilemma. You don't want the inconvenience
of taking to a panel shop to be spray painted,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.360
let alone the expense but you do want your
car to look it's best. The mobile Whatscratch?

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.739
technicians use an environment friendly and
patented spray-less scratch repair system

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.629
to repair all minor scratches to your vehicle,
most often, achieving perfect results.

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.129
"G'day Terry, how are you going. Good!
Well this car is 8 years old and in fact the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.079
paintwork is looking pretty shabby, in fact
it's horrible, how do you reckon you are

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:07.039
going to go?"
"No problem at all!"

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:10.529
"Well we'll put you to the test, you get
to work and I'll be back with you in a little

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:13.119
while -- good luck"

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.279
They don't use coloured polishers or gels
which wash or wear off after a few weeks.

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:23.639
They use a proven system that has been developed
over the past 18 years to give a repair with

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:27.619
a gleaming result. This can be especially
useful if you are thinking of selling your

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.189
car and want to bring it up to looking it's
best to achieve a better price. Or you may

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.999
just be proud of your car or caravan and want
to keep it looking its best.

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:41.359
"G'day mate -- so what are some of things
you do? Well, we love working on cars, trucks,

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:48.359
bikes, boats you name it. We repair chips,
scratches, faded paintwork, yellowed headlights,

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:53.119
swirl mark removal, all sorts of stuff "
"So what is the sprayless scratch repair

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.719
system?"
"It's a system where the paintmark imperfections

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:03.719
become virtually undetectable. We can repair
panels cheaper, quicker than taking the car

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:08.739
to a panel shop or be resprayed or touched
up by a mobile spray painter."

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.329
"So how does the process work?"
"Basically, there are 3 simple steps:

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:17.209
The scratches are first cleaned out, then
we apply the SSR base paint colour to the

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.409
scratch and then we buff the excess paint
colour around the scratch with the SSR patented

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.250
polish".
Whatscratch? has worked with some of the bigger

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.870
motor dealerships around Australia bringing
their for sale fleet up to scratch, forgive

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.640
the pun, and adding enormous value to their
bottom line. The Whatscratch? services are

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.000
in demand and they need new franchisees, passionate
about cars in NSW, Canberra, Victoria and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.299
WA.
"So it's time to check back in with Terry

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.599
and look at mate, how did you go?"
"It's like brand new, you can see for

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.390
yourself" .
"You are exactly right, it's amazing and

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.310
it is like brand new. Let's refresh ourselves,
it used to look like this (before) and now

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.609
it looks like this (after)".
