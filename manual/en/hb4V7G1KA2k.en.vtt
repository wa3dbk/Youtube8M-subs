00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.020
This is Matt again from Two Way Direct and I'm here with Jason and today we're gonna show you how to use the 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.929
cloning feature on the multi-unit
charger here with the RM Series radios

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:17.020
So Jason is going to see how this can
absolutely so it's a very simple process

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.279
after you've customized your radio you're gonna want to clone

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.869
so that the rest of the radios in your fleet match. If you didn't make changes to this radio

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.510
and customize it, then there would really be no reason to clone the radio cause they're all gonna

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.510
talk to one another out of the box on default frequencies

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.280
For the purpose of this test, I've programmed this radio to have something other than default frequencies.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.170
So I'm going to, with the radio turned off, 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.690
enter cloning mode, by holding down and this is gonna be the same on any of the RM Series radios

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.790
not specific to this RMU2080

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.500
I'm gonna hold down the Push to Talk button and the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.089
SB1 (side button one button) oh I'm sorry that's programming mode, 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.960
this is gonna get me to cloning mode. The push-to-talk button and the SB2. And I'm gonna

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.040
turn the radio on with those two buttons pressed down for about 3 seconds 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.880
and you'll hear that tone, I don't know if that was loud enough for you to hear

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.880
I'm gonna do it again real quick

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.890
and it'll say clone, so now you know you're in clone mode on what we call the source radio that

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.460
we've already programmed and customized. Now we're gonna have to use the six

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.700
unit multi-charger

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.270
or the cloning cable in this case I'm gonna show you how to do it on a 6 unit multi-charger 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.380
which obviously charges 6 units at once on an outlet

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.880
now notice that this is not plugged in. We don't need power in order to clone

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.100
because this just acts as a bridge
so we're gonna use these two pockets

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.600
or these two pockets to clone and it doesn't matter if it goes on the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.860
front or the back in terms of the source radio. It just needs to be in one or the other 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.590
so I'm gonna place it here, and this new radio, which is right out of the box,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.300
unprogrammed and actually

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.680
you can see it's an RMU2080 so it doesn't even need to be the same radio.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.240
I'm gonna make sure it's turned on and then I'l put it right next to that radio

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.790
again it can be in either pocket and then I'm gonna go right back over

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.640
to the source radio and I'm gonna press and hold 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.039
that SB1 button

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.740
and it's gonna clone this radio here. Now these 2 radios are cloned.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.350
So assuming we're on channel 1 with both radios, 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.620
 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.209
test 1 2 3 4. A little feedback because we're so close to one another, but we just cloned that radio.

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.750
And that was another video from Two Way Direct. We'll be back soon with another 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.730
video for you guys. Thank you very much!
