00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.280
Before you start rolling you want to dust
your work surface with some confectioners

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.120
sugar and you want to keep that surface dusted
throughout the rolling process so that we

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:20.929
can lift up our sheet of fondant after we
have it rolled. So make a piece like this

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:29.640
and we're going to roll it sort of wide and
flat. And you want to roll it until it's about

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.110
a quarter inch to an eighth inch and it'll
be a little wider on the top and thinner on

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.960
the bottom.
This is probably the most difficult part about

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.320
making the cake. But the fondant is actually
very forgiving. It stretches and it molds.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:03.330
So I'm going to keep going. Now you want to
check once in a while to make sure that it

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:10.040
is not sticking to the board and you can,
see it's stuck a little here, you can slide

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:19.350
more confectioners sugar underneath, and then
continue your rolling. You're going to need

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.750
to roll it out long enough to cover, wide
enough to cover the skirt of the cake here.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:02:01.390
That's about eight inches. And long enough
to go around the cake. Okay, you can continue

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.071
to dust the board or your work surface with
confectioner?s sugar. And don't worry if you

00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:20.310
get on the top, it'll dust right off. Okay,
and when it looks big enough, we'll apply

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.559
it to the cake.
