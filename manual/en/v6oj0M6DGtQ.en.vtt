Sports Parents Inspire Your Athletes

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.959
In this video, I'm going to talk directly
to parents of athletes and how to get your

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:21.140
kid to want to work out,train and practice.
I hear this complaint from parents quite often:

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.990
"He says he wants to get to the next level
but when I remind him he needs to run, lift

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.300
weights or do drills, he says he's tired
or has to do homework or some other excuse.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.300
Parents. Stop preaching and nagging your athlete.
Instead, start INSPIRING them.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.140
Think about this...when Wayne Gretzky was
a boy, nobody had to remind him to work on

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.030
his game. He did it out of sheer love, drive,
and desire for the game.He would practice

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.030
4-5 hours a day, every day as a kid! Parent's
this is what you want to foster in your child,

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:07.930
not an authoritarian punishment-based helicopter-parent
pushing.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.930
How do you do that? By being expressive and
positive about what your kid does well and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.530
asking for permission for how to best support
him. Instead of: Cindy, you need to make sure

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.530
you run 5 miles this week like the coach said.
You would say: Cindy, I just love it when

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.659
I see you running and
training to reach your dreams. You don't

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.540
know how good that makes me feel when you
tell me you are going to practice.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.049
Instead of: Mike, you've got to work harder
than everyone else if you want to get a D1

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.659
scholarship. Try this: Mike, it is going to
be so exciting for you when you are

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.619
playing at the D1 level. I can't wait to
see you there being cheered on by a huge crowd....

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:04.619
Get your kid to buy into the reality of their
dream to feel it like you can. Paint the picture

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.700
for them and inspire them to achieve it.If
your young athlete has told you about a goal

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.170
like that, then talk to them like it's a
done deal that they are going to achieve it.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:27.170
HELP them OWN it and become passionate about
it! That's how they will create their own

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.170
motivation to give 100% in training and practice.
Ultimately, it's got to come from within

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.650
and not from you.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.650
If you really think that your child responds
better to the "pushing" then ASK them

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.540
how and when it would be appropriate to support
them that way. If you're pushing them and

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.910
they don't want it, then it's YOUR goal,
not theirs. Balance out the "pushing with

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.440
more INSPIRATION" and see how much more
powerful your influence can be.
