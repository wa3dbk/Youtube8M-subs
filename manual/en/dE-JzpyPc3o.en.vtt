00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.380
A distant blinding reverie

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:13.720
Flashed before me in a see of scattering stardust

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.770
I never had a chance to touch you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.920
The void in my heart is your fault

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.340
I want to live like this forever

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.120
Tell me of this contrivance of love

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.340
I want to continue believing the awakening light of the stars

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.470
I want to tell you about the "yes" and "no"-s I told you

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:04.320
This is my love strategy, and I know that I'm thinking too much about it,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.370
But I can't wake up from this dream tonight

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.970
Whose dream is this illusion

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:53.170
Deep inside my heart? When I look at the little hypnotizing stars

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.070
Truth, lies and noise mix together in my eyes

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:07.820
I reach out for the light

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.870
It hurts so much how I want to be beside you forever

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.620
The contrivance of stars holds the words I've waited for

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.870
It is a one night romance, fueled by magic

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.920
This is the first time I'm feeling my head becoming this light

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.770
Being in an unreal world with no one else is so amazing I can do it now,

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:50.020
I want to meet you

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:58.360
Please, tell me, what are these painful thoughts

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.360
That I cannot express with words?

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:12.620
I want my dream to come true, I want to meet you, to hold you

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.290
I'll try reaching you one more time...

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.720
I want to continue believing the light of the stars

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.820
I want to tell you about the "yes" and "no"-s I told you

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:40.570
Being in an unreal world with no one else is so amazing I can do it now

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.720
I want to meet you
