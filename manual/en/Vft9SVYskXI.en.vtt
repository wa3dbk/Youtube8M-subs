00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.380
Happy Easter everyone.  Welcome to
Revelation Unraveled,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.429
I'm your host, William Tapley, also known
as the Third Eagle

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.070
of the Apocalypse and the Co-Prophet of these

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.880
End Times.  Today, we celebrate the
greatest

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.480
of all the feast days on the Christian
calendar

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.500
and that is when Jesus rose from the
dead.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.180
And he rose to give all of us hope of our
own eternal

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.779
salvation, however, in addition to this

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.829
good news today I also have some

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.300
not so good news.  And

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.520
that is because Pope Francis again

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.350
made the error this week of washing the
feet

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.710
of women during his Holy Thursday

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.440
penitential service.  That is totally

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.969
unbiblical.  Jesus never

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.440
washed the feet of women and this is
very

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.850
serious.  And

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.619
a week or so ago, the seer in Ireland

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.040
called Maria Divine Mercy predicted

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.680
that Pope Francis, and she considers him
the False Prophet,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.729
and let me tell you what she wrote.

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.799
She said, and she's quoting Jesus,

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.130
"You will know these traitors by their
symbolic gestures

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.560
which insult my divinity."

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.890
So that's an interesting way to express
it.  What

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.820
Pope Francis did by washing the feet of
women is to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.130
insult Jesus.  What he is saying is

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.759
"I am superior to my own Lord and Savior."

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.460
Jesus did not wash the feet of women
because he was constrained

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.090
by the culture of that time which did
not consider women

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.270
equal to men. But, we live in a superior
enlightened culture

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.830
where women are superior to men, and that is

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.180
a very grave mistake on his part.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.379
Here is what the Pope is doing.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.940
He is not only perverting what Jesus
did,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.069
he is contradicting the words of

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.450
Peter and Paul.  Here is what

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.200
Paul wrote in Ephesians:  "Wives,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.250
submit yourselves to your own husbands as
to the Lord

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.150
for the husband is the head of the wife,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.400
even as Christ is the head of the Church.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.870
Therefore as the Church is subject to
Christ,

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.129
so also let the wives be to their
husbands

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.340
in all things."  And Peter says

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.730
very much the same thing.  "In like manner
also

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.810
let wives be subject to their husbands."

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.920
And Pope Francis

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.310
is contradicting what Peter and Paul

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.600
are saying and he is contradicting them
in a very subtle manner.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.840
And I am here to warn you wives today:

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.709
do not listen to what Pope Francis is

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.069
saying.  You must still

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:31.230
be subject to your husbands.  In other
words, you do not have the authority now

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.409
to tell your husbands, now it's your
turn to wash my feet.

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.629
In other words, you can now be subject

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.790
to me and that is a very false

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.730
interpretation of the Gospel.  Let me read
to you

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.920
John's account of Jesus washing the
feet of his disciples

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.370
because as Jesus said, this is

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.409
an example but not an example

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.590
of men subjecting themselves to women.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.730
"After that he poured water into a basin,"

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.900
now this is John chapter 13, verse 5,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.300
and he's talking about Jesus at the Last
Supper, "and began to

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.900
wash his disciples' feet

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.509
and to wipe them with the towel with
which he was girded.

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:21.479
Then comes he to Simon Peter and Peter
said to him, 'Lord

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.220
do you wash my feet?'  Jesus answered and
said to him,

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.380
'What I do you know not now

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.440
but you shall know hereafter.'  Peter said
to him,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.460
'You shall never wash my feet.'

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.530
Jesus answered him, 'If I wash you not

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.440
you have no part with me.'"  And then Jesus
goes on to explain his actions,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.639
"Then after he had washed their feet and taken
his garments being set down again

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.630
he said to them, 'Know you what I have
done for you.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.580
You call me master and Lord and you say
well for so I am.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.740
If then I being your Lord and Master

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.100
have washed your feet you also

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.720
ought to wash one another's feet

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.770
for I have given you an example.'"

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.919
Now, note this example.  The example is not

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.840
that men should now be subject to their
wives,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.830
"'That as I have done to you so you do also.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.600
Amen,  Amen, I say to you, the servant

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.530
is not greater than his Lord neither is
the apostle

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.900
greater than he that sent him.'"

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.300
And so in conclusion, maybe my message
today on Easter is not

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.720
that negative.  I am simply upholding

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.350
the Gospel, the words and actions of our
Lord.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.600
And let us all pray that Pope Francis sees the error of his ways.

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.470
Maybe next year he will act in
accordance

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.060
with the Gospel.  And,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.259
please do not forget to visit my new
thirdeaglemedia.com website

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:16.750
where I have unsealed all six of the great
vision chapters

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.819
of that Old Testament prophet of the End
Times

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:22.900
and that would be the great Prophet Daniel.
