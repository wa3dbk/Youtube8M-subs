00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:11.275
Hi dear Youtube, today I am
going to show you my Petromax lantern.

00:00:12.655 --> 00:00:18.721
Which I got recently and talk about my
experience with the fuel I use.

00:00:21.308 --> 00:00:26.432
I got it in this cardboard.

00:00:32.786 --> 00:00:37.088
Secured with a piece of cardboard.

00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:42.217
And.... a manual.

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:53.579
The manual is in German, French and English.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.426
I apologize, I got a cold (every Christmas)
so my voice is making it difficult.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.309
This lantern looks very nice,
it is made of corrosive material.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:18.954
It is coated with a non - corrosive material.

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:26.067
I read about some experiences on a forum,

00:01:26.068 --> 00:01:36.552
if you let the lantern outside, exposed
to rain and wind it will start to rust on the connections

00:01:40.994 --> 00:01:47.141
This lantern is smaller than the classical
german FEUERHAND lantern.

00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:53.101
That is the reason why I got this,
because it is smaller.

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:03.118
When like this, it is 21cm x 13cm

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.119
Almost 14cm..

00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:13.784
10cm

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:24.095
As I already said, it looks very good,
makes a solid impression.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.898
It's made like every petrol lantern.

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:39.420
Glass, protection against strikes,

00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:43.517
An opener to light it up.

00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:50.525
A spring locked top so
it can be opened.

00:02:56.508 --> 00:03:02.572
A filler pipe and a flame regulator.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:16.494
It got this handle to hold and this small one to
attach a chain or similar.

00:03:20.707 --> 00:03:23.594
Here, a closeup.

00:03:44.406 --> 00:03:50.888
The lantern cost me about 12 Euros.

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:59.855
But the cheapness can be seen.

00:04:01.983 --> 00:04:06.403
These openings are unsymmetrical.

00:04:06.404 --> 00:04:10.803
Looks like the are cut out by hand...

00:04:10.804 --> 00:04:14.561
This piece doesnt fit right in.

00:04:16.141 --> 00:04:19.519
Crooked somehow.

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:30.015
But hey for this money it is great!

00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:39.331
To warn you, always use real petroleum!

00:04:41.757 --> 00:04:47.483
I have used this lamp oil,
and it burns really crappy.

00:04:47.518 --> 00:04:59.212
The flame is really weak. I dont know for what
this should be used. Maybe for small oil-lamps.

00:04:59.213 --> 00:05:07.057
This does not work for the petroleum lantern.
So i bought this one in the hardware store.

00:05:07.092 --> 00:05:09.245
The flame is really good with it.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.943
Lets try it out.

00:05:28.741 --> 00:05:32.384
After lighting up, it takes
2 minutes for the flame to develop.

00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:47.752
The flame can be increased until it
starts to emmit soot.

00:05:54.627 --> 00:05:57.068
The flame is still wobbling.

00:06:00.864 --> 00:06:03.196
I would use it like this.

00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:05.921
What should I say?

00:06:06.893 --> 00:06:09.869
It burns pretty well.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.949
You can read without problems.

00:06:17.405 --> 00:06:19.327
The ambient is great.

00:06:21.597 --> 00:06:24.795
It creates a warm atmosphere.

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:33.392
I will prefer this when making outdoor
trips or go to the forest til night time

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.833
I am kind of sick of the LED lights
and flashlights

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:48.799
Okay, a headlight is a must have.
But for the camp this is great!

00:06:48.834 --> 00:06:52.862
It makes a nice ambient.

00:06:52.863 --> 00:06:57.939
It is enough to see at night.

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:28.469
You can even warm yourself.
Up here it's pretty warm.

00:07:30.834 --> 00:07:34.434
Get a chain, a connector and hang it
up on a tree.

00:07:34.435 --> 00:07:35.435
No sweat!

00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:45.604
And easily turn it off like this.

00:07:45.605 --> 00:07:51.065
Thanks for watching!
