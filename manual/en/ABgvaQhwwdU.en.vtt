CASEY CORMIER: All right. As you've probably
realized just from when I was discussing the

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:10.879
similarities between a sharp 11 and a flat
5 chord, that we can alter the chords--the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:18.250
intervals within one octave. So let's look
at flat 5 chords, and we've already seen they're

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.810
half-diminished. Remember how I said that
this is the same thing as half-diminished.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.260
A minor flat 5 chord is a half-diminished
chord. We brought our first finger cross the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.000
C here, across the A string starting on C
3rd fret. We have our 3rd finger placed here.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.240
You can play here too if you want. Make sure
you're only strumming A, D, G and B, no E,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:57.280
unless you're willing to--let's see--manipulate
your hand to get that as you probably can.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:09.650
So the important thing is we can also have
flat 5 dominant chords. So this is one way

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:19.330
on bass on B with A in our bass. Let's look
at it with E. So we know we want-ideally,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:29.200
we want our C, E and B flat as our 1, 3. Five
is good, but it's optional when we're thinking

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:40.890
about--because I could do a flat 5. Okay?
Here we go. This is kind of a--this will get

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:49.880
it done for us. So now we have the 3rd on
top here. So we have a 1, flat 5, flat 7,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:02:00.100
and then a regular 3rd an octave up. The 3rd
is okay and it can be any octave it wants.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:11.480
That's how it looks over here. So get used
to playing dominant. If you ever see something

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:19.730
written as a dominant, it's just basically
saying--E7 flat 5 for example, finding E bass

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:28.290
in creating the movable shape for the dominant
flat 5.
