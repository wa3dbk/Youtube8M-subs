00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.200
I really love watching stars

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.000
When I was younger, when I see them twinkling

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.000
it's like they're telling telling me secrets

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.700
Mom, stop crying.  You're going to make us cry too. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.500
Pa, can you not leave us yet?  At least wait for my sister

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You're so stubborn.  What are you, a boy or a girl?

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.000
A boy

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.000
Are you a boy or a girl???

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.990
Boy

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.200
Brod, my son...

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Sir, pay up

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.000
What?  Huh?  Why, can you chase me?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Here...

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.100
Women like you shouldn't be harmed

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.400
If I only knew your mother will die young, I would just had her abort you

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Better alone than stuck with a failure

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.000
You guys promise to help me with Marie Antoinette

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
What are friends for?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Our daddy loves me right?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I thought this bitch is a model...

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.500
They're starting with the bone marrow extraction, where are you?

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.950
They're starting?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.500
You said you'll be here even when they're still prepping?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Sister!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You wanna get us killed?

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.000
No, no, no 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.300
Hop on!
