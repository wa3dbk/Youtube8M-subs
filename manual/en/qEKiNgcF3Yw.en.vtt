Hey everybody. My name is Tasha and welcome to Heart of Tarts.

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:07.107
Today on the show we will be making a Mickey Mouse Tart.

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:12.012
Now, I am not that skilled, so I saw this 
 design that was just the ears and the shorts.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:18.185
You will get the picture. Here is a picture. I will put 
 one right here. So let's get started on this tart.

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:23.223
We are going to start by preheating our oven to 350 degrees F or

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:26.693
if your oven s still broken like mine is, you 
 are going to set you broiler to high.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:29.429
Hopefully we will not burn it this time.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.502
Next to the food processor we are going to add in 
 1/2 cup old fashion oats along with four pitted dates

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:37.404
to give it a little bit of sweetness.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:44.768
Process that all together until the dates are little chunks of 
 dates and the oats are little oatmeal flour stuffs.

00:00:44.768 --> 00:00:52.853
Next to the food processor we are going to 
 add in 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:55.289
(Ha ha, I switched it up today)

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.227
and 3 tablespoons Earth Balance or whatever dairy or non-dairy butter you prefer.

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:06.266
Next, we are going to add in a whole 
 cup old fashion oats and 1/4 cup water.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.685
Just to bind it all together.

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:14.864
Pulse that until it is well stuck together and sticky. 
 Press that around your 9 inch tart pan.

00:01:14.864 --> 00:01:19.201
Make sure it has good coverage on the bottom and up the sides.

00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:24.316
Bake it for 15 minutes or 11-12 minutes if 
 you are using the broiler like I am.

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:28.453
Such a sad situation. Hopefully we will get it fixed soon.

00:01:28.453 --> 00:01:32.457
While your tart crust is baking and cooling, 
 we are going to create our filling.

00:01:32.457 --> 00:01:39.264
I have the meat of one mango. I peeled it and I 
 sliced it and I added it to the food processor.

00:01:39.264 --> 00:01:46.470
Then we are going to add in the meat of one avocado and 
 1/4 teaspoon salt, just to give that sweetness a little kick.

00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:49.810
Blend that all together until it is very very smooth.

00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:54.010
Now we are going to add that filling to 
 our tart crust and spread it around.

00:01:54.008 --> 00:01:57.530
Now I am going to decorate it like Mickey Mouse.

00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:04.720
Starts by using some grapes, I cut them in half 
 then laid them flat to create the ears

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.490
and the top hat part of a Mickey Mouse hat.

00:02:06.487 --> 00:02:10.720
Aw, I am just now seeing my hair. I 
 love my hair like big like this.

00:02:10.725 --> 00:02:12.730
You all probably hate it, but whatever.

00:02:12.727 --> 00:02:20.610
I am going to use strawberries to create his red shorts. I cut 
 them and filled up as much as I could with the whole

00:02:20.614 --> 00:02:28.460
strawberry halves, and I went back and filled in all of my little 
 space with all of that green with little slice of strawberry

00:02:28.462 --> 00:02:34.420
Now to finish it off, I am going to slice up some banana 
 to cover up the rest of the green around the ears

00:02:34.415 --> 00:02:36.180
where we shaped out the ears.

00:02:36.183 --> 00:02:41.220
Now is the time to really perfect it. Lastly, I am 
 going to use two whole banana slices to create

00:02:41.224 --> 00:02:44.070
his white buttons on his red shorts.

00:02:44.068 --> 00:02:51.500
TA DA! Here is the overview and I just took the time 
 to go out and really shape out those ears and

00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:57.340
I would like it to be more detailed, but I would have to 
 make it bigger use more fruit, to make it more round.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.480
I will get better at this as time goes 
 on, because I love making these things.

00:03:01.477 --> 00:03:07.180
Hopefully, you will too. You can make this for birthday parties 
 or whenever else you would serve a Mickey Mouse

00:03:07.183 --> 00:03:11.290
decorated dessert, cupcakes, cookies, cakes, and you can have a tart.

00:03:11.287 --> 00:03:17.490
