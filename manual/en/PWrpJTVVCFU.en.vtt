Hello and welcome to another 5 Stupid Things,

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.500
And today, we talk about 5 stupid things about the Iphone.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.960
Now hold up, before all you Android users

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.000
start high-fiving and starting a comment war down below,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.900
Just know, your time is coming.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.920
And in the interest of full disclosure, i have and use an Iphone 6+.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.460
It is my phone of choice, however, even the best products have their flaws.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.700
Number 1

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.700
Siri. Yup, you heard me right.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.820
Too bad she didn't.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.540
It's actually kind of funny in how incredibly limited Siri is.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.380
There's so potential behind it, but all you actually ever get is

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.620
Siri: I'm really sorry about this, but I can't take any requests right now. Please try again in a little while.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.660
Siri is NOT a personal assistant.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.920
It's a toy! A gimmick you show your friends as they roll their eyes because

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.300
talking to your phone is SO 2012.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.540
If I had a personal assistant that refused and talked back to me as much

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.280
as Siri does, I would've fired them! Ages ago...

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.160
The sassy responses are cute and all Apple, but I'm bored of it.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.620
Show me some real functionality.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.180
You know I'm not too impressed with OK Google either.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.220
Just like when touch screens first started dropping, I don't to use Windows vista with my finger!

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.800
Innovate the interface or get out!

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.460
IIGO-for short

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.120
And THAT'S kinda stupid

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.220
Number 2- Animations are my aggravations!

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.860
Not something you'd expect, but animations on an iPhone are really what account

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.880
for it's sluggishness

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.360
One of my personal pet peeves about the iPhone

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.440
is how slow these animations are!

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.320
Animations exist so your brain can make sense of the constantly changing interface

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.160
For instance, instead of just turning on the screen, it fades in!

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.180
And instead of just opening up and showing the apps, they zoom out!

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.860
Sure that's nice and fancy and all,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.380
but that takes up time.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.640
Way more time than you're even consciously aware of!

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.420
Especially when we use our phones more and more everyday

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.140
I don't wanna turn in the ripple age of 96 before I'm allowed to start using my phone.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.320
Seriously, some of these animations take so long i start thinking of other things while I wait.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.680
Did I take out the laundry? Did I feed the dog? Do I HAVE a dog?

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.000
If you have an option to jail-break, kill the animations

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.120
and you will be truly amazed at how powerful the iPhone actually is

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.740
And THAT'S really stupid

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.500
Number 3-My wallet hurts.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.740
iPhones are notorious for how much they cost.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.880
Granted they are made to a higher standard and typically made with better materials

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.380
however, there is no excuse for a $30 cable.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.500
A lot of people don't realise this, but cables are some of the cheapest electronics

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.060
to make.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.180
Remember back in like 2011, when people were buying HDMI cables for a $100 a pop?

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.340
Best Buy employees were getting those same cables for $4.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.160
Not much has changed with the Apple lightning cable

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.360
but costs approximately $3.50 to make.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.540
Not even to mention the price discrepancy of cases

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.800
that cost as little as 75 cents to make and are selling for $45

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.400
I think there's a clichÃ© here I can use!

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.820
That's how they getcha!

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.300
Now THAT'S stupidly stupid!

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.640
Number 4-Why you no waterproof!?

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.400
This is one of the most frustrating things!

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.060
iPhones aren't waterproof! They aren't even water resistant!

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.720
Considering how much humans need water and how much they use their phone

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.840
you'd THINK it'd be a given.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.880
Because no matter how hard you try to keep your iPhone safe and dry,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.840
Life gets messy, and it's bound to get wet.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.880
I mean this tech has existed for years!

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.360
You can literally go to one of those centre booths in the mall,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.020
and for 60 bucks you can get your iPhone coated with some hydrophobic material

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.140
that will make it waterproof!

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.500
WHAT. Why is this not a thing out of the box?!

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.500
I wanna be able to drop my phone in the toilet with 0 ramifications!

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.900
What, not on purpose of course.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.020
Now THAT'S stupider-er-er-er

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.500
The final stupid thing! Number 5- We're locked out.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.020
The iPhone and iOS is a closed system.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.180
Meaning you can't install or modify anything on the phone unless you go straight through Apple.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.040
We're not really in an era where people want to modify the hardware of phones just yet

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.960
but we still want to modify the software!

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.720
You see a closed system like iOS is good for a couple of reasons.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.720
There's a sense of quality control and consistency that you get used to

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.560
and sometimes it prevents malware.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.660
However, when the government has planes emasculating  cell towers

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.860
to spy and collect on your data

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.740
Is malware even a concern anymore!?

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.340
Probably, bu-but still

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.220
A closed is system is where the apps can only function

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.440
in their little sandbox and prevents the developers from

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.020
giving the applications any real power or use.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.940
Like for instance, multi-tasking.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.380
Not only that, but you can't even customise the visual look of your iPhone.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.800
You know what? Sorry, I was wrong

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.740
You can actually customise the wallpaper.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.500
But get this! You can have a different lock screen wallpaper than your home screen.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.080
What!? The power is unparalleled!

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.980
Now THAT'S the stupidest

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.860
Thanks so much for watching guys. Make sure to leave your comments down below

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.760
telling me what YOU think is stupid about the iPhone, but not just that!

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.360
Tell me what you also think is smart about the iPhone

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.900
Lets have one of those good old fashioned iOS VS Android wars!

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.940
Just this once!

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.920
Also I just started a newsletter! So if you're not into the whole social network thing

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.460
but still wanna stay up to date, subscribe and you will get five monthly updates!

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:24.340
You can get exclusive downloads, sneak peeks and little secrets about my channel

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.340
that you don't already know.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.760
But don't worry, I will only send 2 emails a month.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.180
If- if that actually.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.520
So until next time, high five!
