00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.380
Hi there, folks! In the following video,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.910
I'm going to walk you through the steps

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.450
on how to restore data that was in your

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.330
trash folder. If you recently emptied out

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.919
your trash and there was some data on

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.379
there that you still needed or that you

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.110
just need to get back, it is possible to

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.440
restore that data. Although you can't

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.500
locate it anymore, it still does exist in

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.290
the lower levels of your hard drive but

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.700
you can't find it without data recovery software.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.320
So in order to get those files back and restore your trash folder,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.400
I recommend downloading data recovery software

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.060
and act as soon as possible

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.800
because that data can be overwritten at any time.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.530
So what we're going to do first is go to the website

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.400
www.recovering-deleted-files.net

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.800
or simply click the link in the description box below.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.500
And here is the website!

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.309
It's important that we're going

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.900
to scroll down and select Mac Data Recovery right here.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.450
For those of you who click the link in the description box,

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.800
that will bring you directly to this page,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.759
and then we're going to scroll down

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.869
and click "Download" and this is going to

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.200
download and next you're gonna install the software.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.170
I already have the software so I won't be doing this step

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.500
but simply follow the instructions.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.900
Here's the software.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.500
First, what we'll do is click Recover Data.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.400
And as you can see this,  there's a whole bunch of different options

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.700
for what type of  recovery you want to do.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.039
For restoring the trash folder,

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.000
I'd actually recommend first to do a Quick Recovery.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.500
This is by far the fastest.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.500
It's the least intensive so it might not be the most effective

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.200
but it does go the quickest

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.200
and you can see if it recovers anything,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.500
that way before you move to one of these other options.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.800
Next, I would say Deleted Recovery is probably your best bet.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.060
This scan does take a while

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.700
so if you wanna cut down on the amount of time it it takes,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.500
one thing you can do is click Preferences,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.420
select Deleted Recovery

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.220
and then select what type of files you

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.810
want to recover like, say if you just

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.940
wanted to recover photos, or certain

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.910
types of photos, you can select them here

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.060
or if you wanted to recover a video or

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.000
audio files, this will really cut down on the search time

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.600
if you just want to recover,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.900
restore certain files from your trash folder.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.200
So what we'll do is click Deleted Recovery and then

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.140
select the drive you'd like to recover from

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.200
and then click the next arrow here

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.300
and here are the results of our deleted file scan.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.880
I skipped ahead just because it does

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.840
take a while to complete the scan.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.880
What I like to do is organize them by clicking

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.049
File List and then you can select

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.970
the files that you want to recover.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.560
If you want to recover everything, you can just

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.700
select all up here and that will select everything for you.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.780
If you just want to recover a specific file, say, if you want

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.100
to just recover photos, you can click Photos.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.290
If you, say, you wanted to recover

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.300
just certain types of photos, you can go even further.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.570
Click in here and then just

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.200
select whatever photo you want to recover

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.400
and then click the "Recover" button here.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.200
Now one thing to keep in mind,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.000
you do need to recover the files to a drive

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.500
that is different from the one you just scanned.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.500
So you can either plug in an external device,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.910
or if you have another hard drive on your computer,

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.769
then recover the files to that drive

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.890
because it may not let you recover the files

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.930
to the same drive that you just scanned.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.609
So that's all there is to it!

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:04.500
If you need to restore the trash folder on your Mac computer,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.200
if you accidentally emptied all the contents

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.900
and you need to get them back,

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.700
just visit www.recovering-deleted-files.net

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.000
and then select Mac Data Recovery

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.781
or click the direct link in the description box

00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:21.000
to go directly to that page.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.800
And then once you download the software and run it,

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.100
you can select Quick Recovery.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.700
If you don't have a whole lot of time,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.300
if that option doesn't work,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.290
next select Deleted Recovery and

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.400
this should restore your trash folder.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.400
Once again that website is

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.000
www.recovering-deleted-files.net.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.600
Download the software,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.500
scan your computer,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.000
and see if it helps. Good luck!
