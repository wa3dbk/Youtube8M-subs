00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.290
Hello boys and girls! This is Aunt Frenita and I have a wonderful story for you.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.230
Called "The Naughty Son"

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.610
Today's memory verse is from Psalm 86:5

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.000
It says, "You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.070
The message for today's story is: God is always ready to forgive us.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.040
Have you ever disobeyed your parents?

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.230
How did you feel about what you had done?

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.760
Did you wonder if they would still love you?

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.240
Jesus told a story about a son who didn’t like his father’s rules.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.970
So he decided to leave home.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.910
He went to his father and asked for money.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.930
The father didn’t want him to go away, but the son was determined to go.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.050
So the father gave him money, and the son left home to live the way he wanted to live.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.380
At first the boy had lots of money, and he soon made a lot of friends.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.460
He paid for parties for all his friends.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.770
And when he had spent all his money,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.770
his friends left him.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.550
But without money or friends, the boy had no place to stay and no food to eat.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.000
Soon he was hungry, so he began to look for a job.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.560
But the only job he could find was on a pig farm.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.350
It was a horrible job!

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.750
[pigs snorting]

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.730
The pigs were filthy and smelly, and their food was even worse.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.000
The boy was so hungry, he even thought about eating the pigs’ food! Yuck!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.820
Then he started to think about his father and his home.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.390
No one at his father’s home lived like this.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.800
Even the servants who were paid to work for his father had plenty to eat.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.080
The son thought to himself, "I haven’t been a very good son."

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.610
"So I don’t deserve to have my father take me back."

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.320
"But maybe he’ll give me a job working for him"

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.370
"I’ll go back and ask my father to let me be one of his servants."

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.360
So the boy left the filthy pigs and their smelly food.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.810
And he began the long walk back to his father’s house.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.770
But while he was still a long way from the house,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.850
his father saw him and ran out to meet him.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.180
He was so happy to see his son!

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.460
The son tried to tell his father that he hadn’t been a very good son,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.910
"Dad, I don't deserve to be your son anymore."

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.180
"My son, I won't hear of it!" The father hugged and kissed his son.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.350
"Servant, bring the best clothes and shoes for my son!"

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.480
"And then fix the best food and prepare a party to welcome my son home!"

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.440
Does that sound like a father who was angry at his son for the bad things he had done?

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.400
Does that sound like a father who didn’t love his son anymore?

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.470
Just as that father loved his son and forgave him, Jesus loves you.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.770
Just as the father loved his song and forgave him, God loves you,

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.620
and will always forgive you when you are truly sorry for doing wrong.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.330
Just ask God to forgive you.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.660
He loves you so much!

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.200
He wants to keep you close to him.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.420
He will always be your friend

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.040
And someday He will welcome you to His home in heaven.
