00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.886
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.886 --> 00:00:06.390
You know, ceiling fans can add some
much needed airflow and style to a room.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.177
Hey, I'm Rob North, Master Craftsman.

00:00:08.177 --> 00:00:10.885
And today, I'm going to bring you
up to speed on how to hang one.

00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:13.110
Now, every ceiling fan is
a little bit different,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.030
so you want to make sure you
read the instructions carefully

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.550
before you jump into this thing.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.966
But in today's video, we're
going to make sure we give you

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.370
some tips to cover all the bases.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.970
Look at me.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.152
I'm a tall dude.

00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:26.790
So you want to make sure you get a
ceiling fan that works with your space.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.480
Not too big, not too small.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.240
Most importantly, not too low.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.287
All right now, if you're looking
for a fan with a light on it,

00:00:33.287 --> 00:00:36.120
you want to check to see if your
wiring is set up with two switches.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.400
If not, it's no big deal, because
you can still make it work.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.670
Just that one switch
will run the whole thing.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.360
But then you've got those chains
that hand down from the thing.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.189
That was driving me freaking nuts.

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:48.230
All right, now this next
step can save your life.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.050
Literally, can save your life.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.080
Kill the power to that switch.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.110
So go to your main breaker box, find
the breaker associated with that switch,

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.890
and kill it.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.689
You know, ceiling fans
are a lot like snowflakes.

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:02.355
They're all just a little bit different.

00:01:02.355 --> 00:01:05.250
So you want to make sure that you
go through this manual carefully,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.880
all right?

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.790
Don't skip around.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.590
Because if you do, all you're going
to do is end up with a headache.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.949
Now, your next step is
to identify the wires.

00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:14.740
You're going to go
ahead and pull them out.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.948
See what you're working with.

00:01:15.948 --> 00:01:18.470
 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.360
A black wire or a red wire are always
going to be your feeds, or your hots.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.980
They're going to provide power.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.220
White wire is a neutral.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.720
All right?

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.860
That's going to let the
cycle of electricity flow.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.970
And the green wire is a ground wire.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.915
Now, if you don't find a green
wire in the box, don't sweat that.

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:37.970
I'll show you how to deal
with that in a second.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.730
So now we're at the point where
you have to decide whether you're

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.950
going to use one power source or two.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.200
In our case, we have two.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.540
So we can connect both the fan and the
light to two different power sources

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.620
and control them with
two different switches.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.720
If you don't have that
setup, then all you

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.020
do is you connect the motor and
the light to that one power source.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.180
And again, the chains will
control what happens when.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.630
Now this bracket has to
be installed securely.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.843
That's what keeps the fan up.

00:02:07.843 --> 00:02:12.800
If you don't do that stuff, then the
fan could come down in your face.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.270
Ain't nothing relaxing about that.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.600
 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.100
All right.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.712
Now, here's a tip you probably
won't find in the manual.

00:02:21.712 --> 00:02:23.920
There's a small stud on the
back of this bracket that

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.817
lets you hang the
housing directly to it,

00:02:25.817 --> 00:02:27.650
so that you can do the
wiring up in the air.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.227
Now, you don't have to use that hook.

00:02:29.227 --> 00:02:31.310
You could just hold it up
yourself if you want to.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.351
But if you do, I guarantee
you're going to end up

00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:37.252
using some words you probably should
not be saying, if you know what I mean.

00:02:37.252 --> 00:02:38.960
Now, if you remember,
a few minutes ago I

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.751
told you that if you didn't have
a ground wire, it was no big deal.

00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:43.500
Well, here's why.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.090
The fan will come with a plate.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.290
And to that plate, there's a
ground wire already attached to it.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.740
With that plate mounted to the
box, the system is being grounded.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.125
Now, all you have to do is
connect the wire to the light

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:58.490
or to the fan to that wire, and
the whole thing is now safe.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.130
 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.810
All right.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.320
With the fan in the socket, go ahead
and put the hood over those wires.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.270
Slip the whole deal onto the bracket.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.930
 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.675
Crank it down.

00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:23.515
 

00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:25.410
And when it's time to
put the blades on, I

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.470
like to drop this light housing right
here, just so I can get to this notch

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.064
right here, because that
is where you have to be.

00:03:32.064 --> 00:03:34.980
Now, if you're wondering how come I
didn't do that in the first place,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.505
it's because making the
connection here is a lot easier

00:03:37.505 --> 00:03:38.720
to do when the fan is down.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.621
 

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:42.120
All right.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.995
Now, once you're all
set, go hit that breaker

00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:50.070
and go sip something cool under
your new fan, because you earned it.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.150
