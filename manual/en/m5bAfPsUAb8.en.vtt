00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.290
the reality is it's very hard to get outside
the courtroom kingdom

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.670
for some reason other a no-win union i decided
to try to make it through the month of november

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.730
without needing

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.310
any process corn products whatsoever

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.349
and %uh it's been an incredible challenge
so far

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.480
but hungry for about two weeks and %uh

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.180
where we're doing this thing that we call
the king corn challenge and %uh so

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.910
feed

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.179
the reality of that is that i've had to throw
out most of what was in my

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.839
refrigerator and in my covers and %uh even
like toothpaste contains sorbitol which is

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:39.190
a %uh corn-based sweetener

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.770
the good news is we're eating real food amin
i bought a carrot at their convenience store

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.080
last week for fifteen cents and that was my
afternoon snack instead of a bag of chips

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.299
and %uh where we're bind grass fed grass than
if beef and cooking that at home which

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.270
in last year's worth making conscious effort
to do it

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.170
you you won't ever tried

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.390
so there's a there's there's a opportunity
out there to test yourself and see if you

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.260
can make it through this month of not eating
corn

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.570
and %uh more than anything it turned out to
be an incredible educational experience about

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.450
just how pervasive corneas like that

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.329
this is my mom's %uh

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.660
martyr here where she keeps all the %uh

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.480
through to the family

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.280
and %uh

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.280
workgroups and very few thoughts with corn
syrup

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.010
cranberry sauce thanksgivings coming

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.920
or had produced corn syrup and corn syrup

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.570
and then on

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.590
i guess this is a good stuff this is all right
here

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.250
golden sweet kernel corn just corn water sugar
and salt

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.060
market with alan

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.790
cornflakes here

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.240
looks like your cornbread

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.549
%uh milt corn sugar multi flavoring

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.030
high fructose corn syrup and salt

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.109
this one a one is %uh

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:11.049
corn syrup

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:17.709
along with %uh caramel color which comes from
corn

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.389
title for the staff

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.719
isn't unbelievable talents that we have

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.969
now where

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:28.119
the most affordable food is the least healthy
food for us

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:33.819
and as a result in this day and age for the
first time in world history

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.279
obesity is associated with poverty

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:41.669
and the racist activities among lower-income
americans are are than among the wealthy americans

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:44.149
and such as

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:45.319
princes

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.149
are fat these days its

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:49.280
it's everyone and particular

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.059
its minorities and lower-income populations
and

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:55.499
that's largely a result of this flood of

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.300
process of all commodity crops and processed
food

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.349
indoor track

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.749
so to me the real challenges how do we find
solutions

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.289
don't just make

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:07.479
healthy food available to wealthy people

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:10.079
but to make healthy food available to everyone

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.299
in the schools in the hospitals

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:19.129
and on the street corners over but never heard
and the world

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.749
take that may lead to demagogues meal

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:26.339
you don't realize it when you have you read
in court

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:31.219
be has been corn fat

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.869
celia

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:35.349
is corn so i agreed to sponsor of the two
main ingredient

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.909
given the french fries which are you not have
to charge the french press come from the fact

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.299
that the friday and that that is liable to
be corn oil or so

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.579
and so when you're at that mcdonald's your
denial of food

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:48.900
everything

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.239
on your plate discord

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.569
are garfield system is in a tight spot right
now which is %uh we have gotten a really really

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.759
good at growing cheap food

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:05.010
but the cheap food we're good a growing is
fast food

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.059
and the challenge in the next generation is
how do we make

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:11.609
healthy food available to everyone

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.909
not just the sort of to food system culture
where wealthy people on because they're in

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.449
midwestern college towns have

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.270
organically locally grown food from family
farms

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.100
but a system in which the big farms in the
midwest get a chance to be sustainable and

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.009
farmers get a chance to take back some sense
of pride that growing real food

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.099
not growing high fructose corn syrup

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:39.870
the big middle of our dot the corn and soybeans
and wheat that make up the bulk of what we

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.509
actually are consuming

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.560
we need those to be calm

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.389
sustainable

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:45.860
healthy

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.129
in a new blood

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:49.130
do you see movement in that direction

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.840
i do i mean there there's %uh there's incredible

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.659
new ingenuity coming out of places like iowa
where there are wonderful group spectacle

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:02.179
farmers of iowa river leopold center at iowa
state

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:07.989
thinking all the time about how how can we
make a new kind of family farm agriculture

00:05:07.989 --> 00:05:10.159
really grows good food

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:14.530
well it does look like the farm bill isn't
gonna feature a lot of change although there

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.209
is movement in the right direction

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:21.639
are you going to continue your quest order
to educate people to where the food comes

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.799
from and what city do you mean is that become
passion very much so i mean changing the farm

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:32.189
bill is a very slow process %uh but it when
it changes they will be a bit incredibly powerful

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:35.460
thing and the reading up on the wall that
that will happen

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.300
whether it's this year or for five years from
now

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.509
it's going to happen

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.749
we have policies in place now that are

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:43.719
based on on

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.800
perceived scarcity that just doesn't exist

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.229
the new kind of policies

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.449
that will have in the next generation have
to reflect the realities of this time winter

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.660
an abuse of the epidemic rather than the great
depression

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.370
and %uh i do believe apple happen said and
i'm certainly going to do everything i can

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:07.370
to help that kind of change come into being

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.880
the thing is these don't contain unicorn whatsoever
so i can just

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.130
have a better term after their wives
