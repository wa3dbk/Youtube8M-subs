Welcome back to Makeup Monday!

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.796
Today I'm going to show you my fave Japanese drug store brand concealer!

00:00:11.796 --> 00:00:14.056
This one is really cheap and good for summer!

00:00:16.657 --> 00:00:18.556
It's this!

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:27.335
Canmake Tokyo's Cover and Stretch UV Concealer 01

00:00:28.392 --> 00:00:30.937
That's the lightest shade

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.749
I often pop this in my makeup bag during summer 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:40.346
and the main reason is because it has waterproof qualities

00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:44.507
which means it sticks around quite nicely even 
 during Japan's hot and humid summers. 

00:00:44.507 --> 00:00:47.522
But I particularly recommend it for concealing spots

00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:50.498
I personally don't use it under my eyes 

00:00:50.498 --> 00:01:00.621
But I have a lot of friends who love this product and DO 
 use it like that so it just depends on your skin type

00:01:01.303 --> 00:01:02.735
Looks like this

00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:17.639
As you can see I have redness and spots here and here

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.518
So let's see how it covers them 

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:50.080
How about that! 

00:01:50.082 --> 00:01:53.060
Pretty good for a cheap concealer!!!

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.560
That was Canmake's Cover &amp;amp; Stretch Concealer 

00:01:57.556 --> 00:01:59.560
If you liked the look of it, check it out!

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.980
Or let me know your experience with it in the comments

00:02:01.978 --> 00:02:07.010
And as usual, if you have any requests, leave them down below!

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:09.000
See you tomorrow!
