00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.820
Whether you're a professional or hobbyist,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.840
Swift Publisher has all you need to get great results. 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.140
Those looking for a quick fix will find a collection

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.440
of more than 100 predesigned templates

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.240
broken up into categories. 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.320
Templates for brochures,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.600
fliers,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.880
menus,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.640
newsletters, and more.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.580
In this gallery, we have a category called My Templates

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.340
for any projects we choose to save as templates.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.660
And, of course,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.100
should you choose to create a document from scratch,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.620
you can always click the New Blank button.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.300
Let's pick out a brochure we like…

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.200
And click Choose to get right to work.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.720
Welcome to Swift Publisher 3!

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.220
Let's take a look around. 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.380
The program interface is very straightforward.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.780
We'll essentially take a look at all of the aspects

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.780
during the course of our video tutorials,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.900
so for now I really want to draw attention

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.040
 to the two main parts of the interface.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.100
One of those is the Source Panel,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.520
where we can find our clipart collection…

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.760
Photos from iPhoto or Aperture…

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.680
And the library of Smart Shapes…

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.880
The other is the Inspector,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.980
which is where we can edit

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.120
our document setup and page type…

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.300
The size and position of objects…

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.640
Images and shapes…

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.240
As well as text.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.220
Either of these panels can be hidden and shown

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.080
using the two buttons above the Inspector.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.080
Now let's take a look

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.200
at the way Swift Publisher works… 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.060
Swift Publisher documents are made up of layers

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.460
with text and images

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.980
and can be composed of multiple pages.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.780
In fact, our brochure is a two page document.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.820
As of now we only see the first,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.800
but we can switch between pages

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.120
using the pages panel 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.240
brought up at the top of the canvas.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.740
Each page is composed of layers.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.080
Layers are meant to unclutter your work space

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.400
so that the design process is simpler.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.220
Here, we have Foreground and Background.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.840
The foreground layer is for text,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.800
and background is for image objects.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We can make layers invisible…

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.260
Choose whether or not to print a certain layer…

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.720
And add additional layers.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.780
Now, templates are 100% customizable.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.700
Changing text is as simple

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.880
as double clicking on a text box,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.880
deleting the default text,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.060
and typing in what we need. 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.860
Note that we can also jump over

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.520
to the Background layer

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.260
and change any of the pictures.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.060
To replace one simply click on it,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.720
jump over to the source panel,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
find a picture that you like,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.320
and drag and drop it right to the selected image.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.800
Let’s go ahead and go through,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.900
change our texts and our images

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.800
to get exactly  what we need.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.620
And in just a few minutes

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.780
we have a brochure ready for printing. 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.040
So let's click the print button

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.760
and get to printing our document! 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.060
Do note that this was basically

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.060
a general walkthrough of the program.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.420
The nitty gritty details of editing

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.420
and building documents in Swift Publisher

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.200
will be uncovered in the following video tutorials,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.200
so be sure to stick around!
