Hey everyone this is Tripp from trippadvice.com and today, I'm going to tell you

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.969
how to dress for a first date.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.349
You want to look awesome for your first date.
The attraction phase is not over and you need

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.159
to continue to impress her.

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:24.739
Having a good fashion sense and a sense
of style will dramatically help this. Let's

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:30.009
go over what to wear the bottom up.
Shoes are key ingredient to your outfit.

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.050
On a date, never wear sandals or gym shoes.
You're not a teenager and even if

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.750
you are that just isn't a good choice. 
You want a casual shoe or even something

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.850
on the nicer side. You can never wear
a pair of shoes that is too nice. Remember that.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.990
How about pants? Well jeans are your
best choice and the darker the better.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.870
Remember, you want to dress up a bit and
if you're wearing light blue jeans, you're

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.640
going to come off too casual.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.500
Don't wear baggy khakis or baggy
corduroys. Make sure they fit. Next

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.380
you want to have a nice belt.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.700
Here's a little tip:

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.490
Match your belt color to your shoe color.
Black goes with black,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.320
brown goes with brown.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.830
I know it's a lot to remember but okay,

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.390
I didn't make up the rules.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.090
As far as shirts go, a button down is a
good go-to

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.270
and for a button down to look good, it
has to fit your body type.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.530
If it doesn't and it's too baggy, you're going to
appear too casual and

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.780
you just won't look good in it.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.579
Now if you're going somewhere really
nice, it doesn't hurt to throw a dark sports

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.409
coat into the mix or cool jacket.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.420
And last, if you have the option between
glasses and contacts

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.320
go with contacts.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.630
Don't hide that cute face of yours. Now you
know how to dress for a first date. It's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.570
simple

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.940
and remember

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.250
don't be lazy when it comes to looking
sexy. It can make or break a situation

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.770
