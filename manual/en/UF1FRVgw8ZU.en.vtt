00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.980
Hello and welcome back to another episode
of my tasty talent series.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.810
In this episode I am going to be making a
really nice, really special, pearl barley

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.960
risotto with roasted butternut squash.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.200
[Music]

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:25.300
OK, so I already have a couple of garlic cloves
chopped up and ready to go.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.050
And I have my spring onions as well.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.349
So what I am going to do, I am going to heat
up this sauce pan.

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.410
I am going to add a couple tablespoons of
oil.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.340
And I am going to add my garlic and spring
onions, straight in.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.650
So I am just going to fry my spring onions,
and garlic for a little while.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.839
Just to soften them.

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:50.629
Get a little bit of color on the garlic, but
you do not want them to get to dark.

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.719
So I am going to go with my pearl barley now.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.199
For the full list on ingredients and the whole
recipe just click the description box.

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.210
I am going to add that, I am going to add
some fresh rosemary which I chopped up.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.720
If you need to at any point, go in with a
little extra oil.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.910
You want to coat the pearl barley in the oil,
before we add the stock.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.650
So you want to see a nice glisten on it.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.650
OK, so, I want to start adding my stock gradually.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.710
So I have added about 250 ml.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.440
And I do not want to add it all at once.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.340
Add a little bit more stock as we go.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.340
Add that for now.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.660
And I am also going to add a little squeeze
of lemon juice, keeps it fresh.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.350
OK so I have added most of my stock, I still
have 500 ml's to go.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.200
I am just going to add all of that now.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.210
So I am just going to bring it up to a boil,
then I am going to reduce it to very low.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.290
Then I am going to leave it to simmer.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.670
And I am going to check on it in a half an
hour.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.130
So my pearl barley is nearly ready.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.460
It is cooked down and fluffed up, and it smells
amazing.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.360
I actually love pearl barley.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.330
Right, so I have roasted some butternut squash
and I have small butternut squash here.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.640
I have cut it into little chunks.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.170
I have roasted it for about 20 mins at 180,
about 25 minutes, 20 minutes.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.000
Now that my pearl barley is ready, I am just
going to assemble.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.480
So I am going to add the butternut squash
with the fresh hazelnuts.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.660
I am going to reserve a few for the garnish.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:34.160
I am just going to add the dates.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.640

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.750
Already, all I need to do id garnish with
fresh parsley.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.930
I am going to season with a little salt and
pepper.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.210
I am going to serve.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.690
So I have a bowl here.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.880
Finish with a little more parsley.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.220
And finally, the best bit, Parmesan.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.980
Just grate a little Parmesan cheese on top.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.980
So there you have it.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.950
My pearl barley risotto with roasted butternut
squash.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.610
