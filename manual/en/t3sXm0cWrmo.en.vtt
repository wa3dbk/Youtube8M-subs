00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:12.288
Today's my day.

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.737
I think I fell in love.

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.761
Unfortunately she doesn't know me yet

00:00:20.796 --> 00:00:25.193
But that will change soon.

00:00:25.194 --> 00:00:26.840
I've looked at her pics

00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:33.442
I've looked at her pics a thousand times already.

00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:37.087
She doesn't look as if she's smart.

00:00:37.088 --> 00:00:39.602
I'll write her now.

00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:41.734
"Hello I write you, LOL"

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:43.577
Who would have thought?

00:00:43.578 --> 00:00:44.889
She writes back!

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.002
She says she is dead keen on me.

00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:49.105
I punch myself in my face with happiness. 

00:00:49.106 --> 00:00:51.348
Actually, that is totally unnecessary.

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:54.981
Girl, do you know what?

00:00:54.982 --> 00:00:59.202
For you I give up everything.

00:00:59.203 --> 00:01:03.650
Even the rubber doll.

00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:07.862
I'll be happy with you.

00:01:07.863 --> 00:01:11.598
Thank you, Facebook.

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:16.401
I know her from Facebook.

00:01:16.402 --> 00:01:19.345
Nothing can separate us

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:23.948
Except if she finds a rich guy.

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:27.770
Thank you, Facebook.

00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:31.623
I know her from Facebook.

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:33.593
I get all dressed up.

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:35.849
(and still I am ugly)

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.919
We'll see each other in town today.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.678
What do I have with me?

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.907
Only 20$.

00:01:43.908 --> 00:01:45.774
Hopefully she'll say:

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:49.129
"OH, 20$? Yes yes yes yes yes yes!"

00:01:49.372 --> 00:01:51.713
And suddenly something big comes up to me.

00:01:51.714 --> 00:01:53.900
It looks like a whale without water.

00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:55.054
I am scared and ask:

00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:55.824
"Who are you?"

00:01:55.825 --> 00:01:56.441
She says:

00:01:56.442 --> 00:01:58.191
"I am your date, you retard!"

00:01:58.192 --> 00:01:59.418
OH!

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.513
OMFG!

00:02:01.514 --> 00:02:03.741
Pranked by the FAKE

00:02:03.742 --> 00:02:06.222
Unfortunately she is

00:02:06.223 --> 00:02:10.011
Ugly as a mud fence.

00:02:10.012 --> 00:02:14.636
Looks like a fat man.

00:02:14.637 --> 00:02:18.237
Thank you, Facebook!

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:23.055
You are an a**hole, Facebook!

00:02:23.056 --> 00:02:26.653
I run away from her

00:02:26.654 --> 00:02:31.443
And feel the earth shaking.

00:02:31.444 --> 00:02:34.812
Thank you, Facebook!

00:02:34.813 --> 00:02:39.775
I'll delete my Facebook account!

00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:42.455
You're an a**hole, Facebook!

00:02:42.456 --> 00:02:46.337
Screw you, screw your inventor!

00:02:46.338 --> 00:02:48.147
I'll find something better.

00:02:48.148 --> 00:02:51.475
No, I'll create something better myself!

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.178
Facebook... that's nothing special!

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:56.672
No genius invention.

00:02:56.673 --> 00:02:58.124
And Justin Bieber...

00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:00.411
Keep your hands off of Selena Gomez!

00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:01.291
She's mine.

00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:02.451
Well, now, from now on...

00:03:02.452 --> 00:03:03.901
Don't ever call her again!

00:03:03.902 --> 00:03:05.353
I'll call her, okay?

00:03:05.354 --> 00:03:07.094
Alright, that's sorted out.

00:03:07.095 --> 00:03:09.086
I'll go now.

00:03:09.087 --> 00:03:11.328
No, I'm serious, I'll go now.

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.433
Everything's cool.

00:03:13.434 --> 00:03:15.606
Sh*t happens.

00:03:15.607 --> 00:03:17.935
I know.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.003
Btw, why do rappers always talk that much sh*t at the end of songs?

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:23.288
No clue.

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:25.499
But I'm just as cool as they are.

00:03:32.055 --> 00:03:34.639
This is slowly starting to get embarrasing...
