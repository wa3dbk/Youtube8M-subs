00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.780
I'm going to show you now how to prepare the
fabric and how to dye it using the squeeze

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.800
bottles.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.800
So first you want to prepare what we call
the activator solution.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.910
And that will just be a solution with washing
soda or soda ash.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.500
Normally you would mix 9 teaspoons per gallon
of water , since I have a little bit less

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.170
than a gallon of water I'm going to adapt
my recipe and that's what you should do.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.480
Again I'm going to dissolve my washing soda
into hot water because it doesn't like to

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.780
be dissolved in cold water.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.300
So I'm going to add 3 teaspoons because I
think I have a third of a gallon.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.260
And I'm going to make sure it's fully dissolved
before adding my fabric to it.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.850
I'm just like whisking it to make sure it's
fully dissolved.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.570
Soda ash or washing soda can be a little tricky
and you don't want to enter your fabric before

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.289
it's fully dissolved.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.420
I think now it's good actually.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.020
So I pre-wetted my fabric which is also like
bundled for tie dying already.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.670
So make sure that you wet it and then you
want to put it in the dye activator solution

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.570
and let it sit from 5-10 minutes.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.990
So I'm just going to make sure it's fully
immersed and then I'm going to wait 5 minutes

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.100
before I take it out.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.790
After 5 minutes your fabric's soaked all of
the activator solution that it needed so you

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.110
can remove it from the activator solution
and just wring the excess out.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.430
I'm wringing it out and I'm going to move
my dye activator solution aside so I have

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.000
a nice clean surface to dye.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.680
So then I prepared 3 colors in the squeeze
bottles and I'm going to show you how then

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.680
look.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.800
So I have the yellow that is pretty light.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.700
And I have a berry color that is actually
pretty concentrated so I think will go well

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.600
with the yellow.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.619
And there's also some green.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.250
I really like using the paper towels to test
the colors.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.700
This is actually really useful too to see
how the two colors will blend because just

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.920
because the two colors look pretty next to
each other doesn't mean the mix of both when

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.680
you're putting in the fabric will look pretty
so make sure you test your colors before putting

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.610
them in the fabric side by side or you might
end up with really ugly results that you don't

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.610
want.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.920
This technique is really cool because it allows
you to apply as many colors as you want, at

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.500
once, in the fabric so you can get really
beautiful results.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.510
So I tied my fabric into sections and my plan
is to dye each section in one color and have

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.720
them in the middle just mix with each other.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.800
Maybe in the middle section I'll just also
mix with them.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.040
So with the squeeze bottles you pretty much
just apply the dye directly into the fabric

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.909
and you can have the control of how much you
want to add.

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:11.550
So for instance if you like some of the white
to appear you can also do that.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.659
Otherwise, if you want all the parts that
you're dying to be pretty saturated make sure

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:23.060
that you add a lot of dye but also you can
work the dye into the fabric with your hands.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:30.900
So my first yellow section is dyed and I think
next to the yellow I'm going to put the green.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.760
And maybe in this section I'm actually going
to mix the green and the yellow at the same

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.739
time so you can see that you can apply them
both and kind of get this marbled effect.

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:47.110
And I'm going to flip it and do the same thing
on the other side.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.209
So this is my green and yellow marbled.

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:58.390
And maybe next to it I'm going to do just
green and I think I'll end up with the berry

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.590
color.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:16.180
Again, working the dye into the fabric to
make sure that all of the layers got dyed.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:23.550
And I guess the last one I'll do yellow too.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.440
So at this point you applied all the dye and
your fabric will need to rest to fix the dye

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.890
into the fabric.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:38.450
This process we call the curing process and
we normally recommend from 4-24 hours just

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.620
resting and curing.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.640
For the curing process you want your fabric
to remain wet so it's a good idea to just

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.420
wrap it in a plastic bag or saran wrap and
just let it sit.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.260
After the curing process, 4 hours, you can
just rinse your fabric and the dye should

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.260
be fixed.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.600
And it's all ready to go.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.130
So this is how you tie dye using squeeze bottles.
