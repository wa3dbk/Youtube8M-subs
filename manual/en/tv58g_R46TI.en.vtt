00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.340
Hello, everybody!

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.040
We're going to play a game of poker today,

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.200
and I'm going to use my

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.280
mental powers of persuasion

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.680
to make you pick the losing hand.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.620
So what I've got here are ten cards,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.340
which is just enough for two hands of poker.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.420
We can give them a shuffle if you want.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.780
I've got no fancy shuffles, so something like that.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.840
And what I'm going to do is

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.760
I'm going to deal out

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.560
two cards at a time.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.980
And you're going to have a free choice to pick

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.280
your own hand.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.440
So let me deal out the first two cards.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.340
There's one,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.840
and there's two.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.840
Now I'm going to ask you to pick a card.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.120
I'm going to have to play this part for you,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.460
so let's say you pick this card.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.980
OK, so you've got the queen,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.620
and I'll take the remaining card.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.040
OK, let's deal out two more cards.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.460
Again, you've got a completely free choice.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.460
You can pick

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.540
any card you want to.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.720
Any card you want.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.960
Let's say you pick this card.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.200
OK, you've got a seven.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.860
I'll take the remaining card.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.080
Let's deal out two more cards again.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.720
You can pick any card you want to--

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.620
the card on the left, the card on the right--

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.120
whichever card you want.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.680
Let's say you pick this card.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.680
OK, that's another seven for you.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.800
I'll take the remaining card.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.420
OK, to make it easier for you,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.580
this time, I'm going to deal out the two cards

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.560
face up.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.000
So there we go--two cards, face up.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.540
You can pick any card you want to.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.640
Well, let's say you pick the seven.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.260
There you go!

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.860
You've got three sevens now.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.840
Now, to make it really easy for you,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.160
I'm going to deal out the remaining cards one at a time.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.280
Let's see.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.020
Do you want that card, or don't you?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700
Maybe you want to take that card away from me.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.220
I do have a king over here.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.980
So let's say you take that card,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.460
and I'll take the remaining card.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.760
So there we go.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.120
I've dealt out the ten cards.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.560
You had free choice to pick your own poker hand,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.640
and you ended up with three sevens.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.280
Let's have a look at what I had.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.000
I ended up with

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.880
a full house.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.740
Now,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.180
the way to win this game is

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.900
whoever has the queen

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.640
has the losing hand,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.580
and I forced the queen on you,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.560
and I wasn't particularly subtle when I did it.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.660
So I forced the queen on you,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.780
and you will lose.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.080
You see, if you notice, in these ten cards,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.540
we have three aces,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.520
three kings,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.600
three sevens,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.100
and the lonely queen.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.640
Now, the best you can do with the queen

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.740
is to have three of a kind,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.440
in which case, I will have a full house.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.340
On the other hand, if you had something else, like

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.680
like two pairs,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.540
I'm going to have three of a kind,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.440
and I'm going to win again.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.300
If you had, say,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.940
one pair,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.880
I'm going to have

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.100
two pairs.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.760
and again, I'm going to win.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.980
So whoever has the queen

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.620
has the losing hand.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.060
If you find some way to force the queen

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.320
on your opponent,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.680
you're going to win,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.620
and you can give them a completely free choice

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.200
after that point.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.660
And that's how you do it!

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.580
So,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.340
if you have been,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.720
thanks for watching.
