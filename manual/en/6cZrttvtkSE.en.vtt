00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
I put out a video before about my general
experiences teaching in Germany. But now,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.940
as promised, here’s a video more aimed at
people who are planning or are thinking about

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.110
becoming a teacher. Here’s some more detailed
information 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.590
for you about teaching English in Germany.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.520
Hey everyone! I’m Dana and you’re watching
Wanted an Adventure Living Abroad.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:38.060
Let’s start with the question I get asked most
often: should you get a TEFL certification?

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.280
Now if you don’t know, TEFL stands for teaching
English as a foreign language, and the TEFL

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.300
certification is just one option; there’s
also the TESL certificate, so T-E-S-L, and

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.140
then the TESOL, T-E-S-O-L, as well,
and probably others.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.360
Which one you choose is up to you, and you
can do your own research on that. But I would

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.460
definitely advise you to get one of them.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.620
I got my TEFL certification in Prague, and
I’ll put a link down below to the school that

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.460
I went to, but basically getting a certificate
is good because it not only teaches you how

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.990
to teach, but it also teaches you about English
from a grammar perspective that as a native

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.720
speaker you might have forgotten or maybe
never learned.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.980
And it makes employers happy. Looks good to
have on your resume.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.440
So, you’ve got your teaching certification,
and now it's time to apply for jobs. But where?

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.800
There are several options, of course. Do you
like kids? Then how about a bilingual kindergarten.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.880
The plus side of working at a kindergarten
is that you’ll have steady hours, you get

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.700
health insurance, and you’re usually employed
full-time.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.660
Also, the TEFL certification isn’t as important
here, but some kindergartens might require

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.890
other certifications, and that could depend
on whether it’s a private or a public kindergarten.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.910
So public kindergartens are bound to whatever
certification rules the government stipulates,

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.100
whereas private kindergartens can sort of
make up their own rules to an extent.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.480
Along this same line, you could also look
for a job at a private bilingual grade school,

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.720
because, again, they don’t have to adhere
to the same mandatory qualifications as public schools.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.330
And I did not work in a kindergarten or
a grade school, but a friend of mine told me

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.150
that they’re often pretty helpful with getting
your visa. So apparently there’s a chance

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.970
someone will help you fill out the German
forms and and maybe even go with you to the office,

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.960
 and stuff like that, which I did not have. Well, Mr. German Man helped me of course,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.830
but not someone from my work.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.140
So what I did is I went the adult education
route.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.240
To do this I applied at several schools around
Munich, such as inlingua, Berlitz, 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.500
PET Sprachschule is another one.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.980
Now, sometimes it is possible to get
hired at one of these schools on a contract

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.240
basis. And then you’d be paid the same every
month, guaranteed classes to teach, and if

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.680
you’re sick you get paid, you get vacation
days, and you get health insurance.  Basically all the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.000
same benefits as working full-time at the
kindergarten or the grade school.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.020
A con of this, though, is that you have to
take classes whenever they’re assigned to you.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.400
And that could mean teaching really early in the 
morning, late at night, and on Saturdays.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.580
But anyway, most of the time, teachers are
employed at these schools on a freelance basis.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.380
And what that means is, you get to pick and
choose your classes. Okay, that sounds better

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.570
than it is. Basically the school calls
and offers you a class. You can turn it down

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.810
if I want to, but then you don’t make any
money.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.990
So a pro of teaching freelance is that you can
set your own hours. And I did. I never worked

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.100
a single Saturday, and that was my option
as a freelancer. But being a freelancer also

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:48.100
meant that if I was sick, no money. Vacation?
No money. Health insurance? I had to cover

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.860
it all on my own. Not fun.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.260
If you do end up going the freelance route,
I think teaching for one of the schools that  I

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.380
mentioned is a really good idea because without them,
at least for me anyway, it would have been

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.580
really hard to find students. I mean, I didn’t know
anyone when I first moved here.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.600
Yes, you could make more money per hour working
without a school, because with a school, the

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.020
students pay the school and then the school
pays you a cut. But the school does all the

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.240
work finding the clients. And with the school
you have access to resources, copy machines,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.320
books, exercises. All things that I really enjoyed having
access to.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.280
Just a few more quick points before I go.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.360
Pay varies from school to school, so I can’t
really give you much information there. Public

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.880
kindergartens, I believe, might pay less than
private ones, but again, it’s all on a case-by-case basis. 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.680
And when teaching adults freelance
with a school you’ll generally make somewhere

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.180
around 20 euros an hour. And you don't want to know what the school makes.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.760
Speaking of wage per hour, when you teach
adults, the “hour” is actually 45 minutes,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.520
and a lesson is usually at least two 45-minute
segments. They assume that you’ll spend 15

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.260
minutes per 45-minute segment preparing for
the class.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.940
And again, it’s always on a school-by-school
basis, but sometimes even as a freelancer,

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.280
if the school you teach for offers other language
classes, you could get a reduced price on

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.129
those. So ask about that.

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.680
And lastly, if you’re applying at an adult
language school, make sure to ask if they

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.820
cover travel expenses. Teaching adults, it’s
common to have to travel to their office to

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.540
teach them, so definitely ask if travel expenses
are covered.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.340
Okay, so I think that’s enough for now,
but if you have any other questions, please just 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.949
let me know in the comments and then maybe in the future

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.569
I’ll put together another video with all my answers.

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:42.849
So my question for you is, why do you want to
teach in Germany? 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.700
