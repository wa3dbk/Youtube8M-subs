Star Wars in 3D, Opera House speakers, and
an update on the FlipIT USB Charger! I’m

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.670
Cali Lewis. Welcome to GeekBeat.TV

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:34.930
This episode of GeekBeat.TV is brought to
you by GoDaddy.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.360
Star Wars fans listen up! Your favorite film
of all time is going 3D. Lucasfilm and FOX

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.470
are hard at work with the conversion and it’ll
be in theaters February 12th. Of next year.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.210
Sorry, a little early on the news!

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.470
You’ve all seen the Opera House in Sydney
Australia, right? It’s beautiful and definitely

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.989
makes a statement. Krator decided that statement
is exactly the statement they wanted to make

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.990
with their gear and so we have the Neso O4
Opera House, the Neso O4 Drop and the Neso

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:11.390
O4 Surrealism, and plainly put...the Neso
2. I’ve never tried any of Krator’s speakers,

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.552
but they pride themselves on very high quality
audio. If you’re into that kind of thing

00:01:15.552 --> 00:01:20.770
 - high quality audio, and you like to show
off interestingly designed things in your

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.370
house, we have a link in the shownotes.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.530
This next story isn’t usually Geek Beat
material, but I have to mention it because

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.650
it’s rare you see a company do this. You
know how much we love the Samsung Galaxy Tab

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.630
here at the Livid Lobster Studios. And if
you watch our weekly live show on Fridays,

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.140
you know they’re coming out with a 10”
version. Well, after Apple’s iPad 2 announcement,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.450
Samsung’s Vice President, Lee Don-Joo, came
right out and said they are rethinking the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.110
pricing on the 10” because they need to
improve the parts that are inadequate. In

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:00.490
order to compete, they may even take no profit
from the pricing on the 10 incher. And immediately

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.420
after reading this, I feel a bit of loyalty
coming on. Because they’re being honest.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.220
More companies should do that!

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.820
Nintendo’s 3DS is finally going to be available
later this month, and they have some perks

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.300
for you! Not only are you going to have the
ability to stream Netflix to it, they’re

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.240
teaming up with AT&amp;T to provide access to
10,000 WiFi hotspots so you can actually stream

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.660
Netflix while you’re out and about. That’ll
be ready in May.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.170
Let’s face it. Domain names are an addiction.
I understand that, and I’m here to help

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.440
you. Or at least help you save money on the
addiction. GoDaddy.com is secure and reliable.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.310
They not only offer domains, but also hosting.
And they have free iPhone Android and Blackberry

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.800
apps for you to manage and buy domains on
the go. Here’s how you save: Discount Code

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:52.550

gets you a dot com for only $7.99 and there’s

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.819
more! geekbeat.tv/deals to see all the discounts!

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.590
I talked about the FlipIt! USB charger on
a previous show and promised a follow up.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:04:08.050
One of our bloggers, Rick Yaeger, has been
testing it and here’s what he thinks:

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:47.240
As

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.919
you know, all of our extra reviews are on
our Youtube channel at youtube.com/geekbeattv

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.620
Make sure you’re subscribed so you can find
out about even more gadgets that I talk about

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:06.430
on this show or Geek Beat LIVE. Pelpina from
webBeat.TV, John P and I are heading to SXSW

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.589
after next Friday’s live show, and I’ll
be on TWiT Sunday evening. And yes, we’re

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:16.539
having a viewer meetup. You can find all the
details about where we’ll be at geekbeat.tv/sxsw

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:37.669
I’m Cali Lewis. See you guys soon!
