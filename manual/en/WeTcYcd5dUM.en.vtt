00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.458
In 1942 the US Army Corp of Engineers started building

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:08.083
what is the greatest model ever made

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:17.291
So in 1927 America suffered what Herbert Hoover called

00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:20.792
“the greatest peacetime calamity in the countries history"

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:22.250
the Great Mississippi Flood

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.250
it flooded seven states, half a million people were displaced

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.000
and it cost the country 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.375
 a third of their entire federal budget at the time

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:31.792
but mainly it was just terrible

00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:34.375
and so the US Army Corp of Engineers did what they do

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:36.375
up and down the Mississippi they built levees

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:38.000
and everyone was like “Cool!"

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.542
no more flooding, we tamed nature,

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:43.458
and then in 1937 it flooded again

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:45.959
because every time they built a levee somewhere

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:48.792
that area wouldn’t flood but a town just a few miles down

00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:50.750
would be destroyed

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.375
they didn’t understand how the river really worked

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:57.583
Corporal Eugene Reybold, this guy had a genius idea

00:00:57.583 --> 00:01:00.208
he was like “Why don’t we model it?"

00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:02.291
And what this meant was literally

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:05.792
why don’t we build a gigantic model of it?

00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:11.041
So the notion was, let’s make a scale model

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:13.542
a tiny version of the entire Mississippi river basin

00:01:13.542 --> 00:01:15.375
the scale of this model is amazing

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:19.458
it meant building a model of 40% of the entire US

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:21.375
eight miles of tiny streams

00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:26.166
It’s so big you can’t see it except from a plane or helicopter

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.166
because it’s spread out over 200 acres

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.458
the whole thing was a hydraulic model

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:34.959
so they could just pull a lever and run through an entire flood

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:36.875
and it let them put up little levees

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:38.667
and figure out “OK, if we put up a levee here, 

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:41.458
 what happens down the river?"

00:01:41.458 --> 00:01:43.500
They used it to stop a flood in Omaha 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.208
 and save sixty five million dollars

00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:48.291
At the time it was also a wonder

00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:51.000
people came to visit it

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.041
they came to stride like giants across the landscape

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:56.542
the Army Corp of Engineers went to the trouble 

00:01:56.542 --> 00:01:58.166
 of building little buildings

00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:00.208
and making sure all the towns had names

00:02:00.208 --> 00:02:03.750
and so it was this kind of incredible experience

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.208
and families would come to stride across the land

00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:09.458
you could walk from the south to the midwest in five minutes

00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:12.291
six years after they finished it, they were done

00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:16.375
the last test using the Mississippi River model was run

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:17.583
they didn’t need it anymore

00:02:17.583 --> 00:02:20.375
they left it, they just walked away basically

00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:22.667
and then they gave it to the city of Jackson, Mississippi

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:24.458
and they didn't know what to do with it

00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:25.166
they didn’t have any money

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:29.166
so they have literally just left it rotting

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:31.417
in the middle of the park

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.792
where it is today

00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:36.792
the Army Corp of Engineers set out to build this model

00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:39.083
but they also made this kind of beautiful sculpture

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:42.083
so today the tiny little banks of the Mississippi

00:02:42.083 --> 00:02:46.458
are slowly being overgrown with actual foliage

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:52.542

and it’s just, it’s awesome

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:58.667
it’s so cool. it’s like an engineers disneyland

00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:01.792
if you are ever in Jackson, it’s the thing to do

00:03:01.792 --> 00:03:04.583
people have their little RC car competitions there

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:08.959
and it’s great, I will link to one of those RC car videos  at the end of this video

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.792
here, look at the, i dunno… look at this RC car video
