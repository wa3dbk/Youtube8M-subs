00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.720
Hey guys!

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.800
So I'm gonna start doing some Q&amp;A videos

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.840
So we can all

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.400
LEARN

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.680
about who I am

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.440
and we can all be connected

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.380
and friends and stuff

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.240
anyway *laughs*

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.580
Ok so the first question is

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.180
How old are you and what made you do animations?

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.700
So I've gotten so many questions

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.760
Are you in college? Are you in high school? How old are you?

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.120
I'm seventeen and I'm in my last year of high school

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.120
so i'm going into collage  next year....

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.500
but yeah

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.240
As for animation wise, I really have no idea how I got into animation

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.620
I've always been drawing ever since I was little

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.300
And I just all of the sudden wanted to do animations

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.800
So I Iooked it up I didn't take any classes

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.480
and I taught myself! and I'm not a professional at all

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.480
I'm pretty sure I'm doing everything wrong. So...

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.200
I don't think you guys want to learn from me.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.000
You should probably learn from a professional. Like I didn't do.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.120
When did you start animating?

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.920
Now this is a funny story

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.400
I'm sure you've all seen that terrible mother animation that I made for Cupquake right?

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.820
Yup that was my first animation that I've ever made in my entire life. *laughs*

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.940
Like I said I'm not a professional at all

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.460
I just jumped straight into it, I did my best, I had no idea

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.780
what I was doing but it turned out pretty well.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.040
And I'm so glad that so many of you had such

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.320
positive feedback and you loved it and you want more

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.740
and that's what really helps me grow as an animator,

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.740
so thank you! :D

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.740
Next question: "Do you have anything big planned

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.580
like a long video or something?"

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.760
For this channel no, but as you guys know,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.300
I work for Cupquake.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.360
and the animation that we are working on right now is AMAZING.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.180
It's turning out so well

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.420
and I think you guys are gonna love it,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.900
maybe even more than 'Terrible Mother' and 'Dino Killer',

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.900
the other ones that we have out

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.900
It's different, it's a lot different

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.900
from the Minecraft shorts,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.900
but it's my favorite

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.900
out of all of them so far.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.900
It's probably not gonna be out for a couple

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.900
months because, it's

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.900
it's different. I'm trying not to give

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.900
you guys any hints, but

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.900
you're gonna be wanting to watch it five

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.900
days a week. Trust me.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.320
QUICKLY! IT'S LIFE OR DEATH!

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.320
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE!

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.460
PICK BETWEEN

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.400
HAVING HANDS FOR FEET OR FEET FOR HANDS

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.400
DO ITTATAT

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.500
Uh... *Laughs*

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.120
Considering that I need

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.280
my hands to be

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.740
doing animation and drawing

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.080
I'll probably have...

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.260
Feet for hands!

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.180
No, I'm just kidding

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.900
Definitely hands for feet

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.080
No questions asked

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.500
But seriously,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.560
I've tried drawing with my feet before

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.440
and it is HARD!

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.300
Props to people with no hands

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.560
and they have to draw with their feet

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.480
Next up:

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.440
Are you ever going to vlog on your Youtube channel?

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.640
Now I'm taking this as:

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.160
What do you look like?

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.160
And... I knew I was going to get this question eventually,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.260
but right now I'm only focusing on getting animations out

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.600
because that's what I think is really important.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.020
I guess I can tell you a little bit on what I look like:

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.500
Um... my dad is white or caucasian

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.140
and my mom is Japanese

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.540
and they both grew up in Canada

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.080
so I'm, like, White, Japanese, Canadian...

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.160
but I also live in the U.S, sooo

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.680
That's a little bit on my background

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.000
but who knows, maybe in the future I'll show you guys what I look like

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
but... for now, no.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.420
'Why do you make videos for Cupquake?'

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.560
Okay, this is something that a lot of you guys probably are wondering

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.100
I used to be just a fan of Cupquake

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.840
I just watched their videos, I was just a subscriber

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.920
That was it.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.020
But one day I decided to send in a fanart

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.140
and they posted it on their channel and I saw it

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.700
and I was like "Oh my gosh, they liked my art!

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.020
I should send more!"

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.100
And they started kinda talking a little about it

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.980
And they also mentioned the fact that they were looking into animating

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.280
some moments in their videos

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.380
And I was like 'Oh my gosh. I don't know how to animate

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.820
but I was thinking about learning how to animate."

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.060
So I sent them a message, I said

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.140
"Hey! I kind of know the basics of animation."

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.560
and they kinda already knew me by  my art

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.480
So they were like 'Okay, what's your email, what's your Skype,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.360
let's get in contact, let's make this happen!"

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.380
And one thing led to another and... out came 'Terrible Mother'!

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.040
and you guys loved it so much

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.520
we just HAD to make more

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.040
and that's how this whole animation thing started.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.460
So that's I'm telling you guys;

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.420
You have to get yourself out there because

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.640
my whole career, basically, just started by

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.500
sending in a fanart,

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.760
which is a prime example why you don't know

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.260
what possibilities are out there!

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.100
You just need to pop your bubble and form the path

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.520
that you want to take.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.760
'What inspires you to draw or animate?'

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.080
And this is a really quick answer;

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.300
It's you guys!

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.520
All the support and allll the love

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.880
and comments you guys leave for me

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.620
is the most inspiration that I could ever have

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.680
and... you guys don't know this but

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.820
I really doubt myself when I make animations.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.980
On all my videos so far, I've always been working on it,

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.400
in the middle of working, and I just think to myself

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.140
"I don't even know if this is funny,"

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.700
I don't even think that you guys are gonna like this

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.680
and I think about, just, starting over and doing something else

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.600
But I just post it, and all the comments

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.460
are SO nice... there's a little bit of criticism

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.280
but it's like really good criticism

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.240
and it's like "Maybe you should do this"

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.360
and it's really nice, and you're all so polite

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.620
and that's really what inspires me!

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.160
So as long as you guys help support this channel and me

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.380
then you guys are definitely gonna be getting more animations

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.080
So thank you guys, I wanna also thank you guys

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.140

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.100

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.660
I don't... I have no words

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.740
That's... beautiful *laughs*

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.800
Thank you guys so much!

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.880
