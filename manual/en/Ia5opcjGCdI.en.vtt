00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.169
total about money management I will be
there so much involved we thought this

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.360
week we would

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.470
give you a couple reasons why people
just overs

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.660
people money people min mistakes people
make with their money

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.750
mistake number one you buy the extended
warranty

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.980
who's guilty put your hand up

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.840
and and every time for retailers a Best
Buy Now has been weren't even like

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.560
everything units unwanted gift card at
Best Buy

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.710
because they understand you're never
gonna use it right

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.450
so they look how do what he said the
warranty and you pay for the warranty

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.770
at on that you never use when the
warranty or to come to the product like

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.399
you're gonna year manufacturer
antibodies then won t

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.620
gives you extended nest on the warranty
and you don't abusing it abour

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.800
so don't bother to buy it the number two

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.250
having too much insurance now the law
requires you to maintain a certain level

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.500
of insurance

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.789
but insurance ages like a lot but on and
I'm guilty of having too much car turned

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.670
they have everything like my car
insurance policy would you call it the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.870
Cadillac policy

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.229
and I guess in some in my mind I say to
myself well you know

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.229
anything happen to have all that money
in my current it would really

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.720
I'm losing money by just make that the
security as I get some guilty about one

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.990
arm but you know the cell Colin Jones
you pay every month for $3.99

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.290
for cell phone insurance how often do
you use that how many years have you had

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.110
a cell phone

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.030
I'm not even replaced has a I had the
cost outweighed the benefit

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.740
course as or the fact you pay for free
services

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.939
people you know monitor their credit
score many kids get the free credit

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.170
report every year

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.720
or you often upgrade to often

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.820
those up for you iPhone 5 people who got
an eyeful perhaps because of an iPhone 5

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.149
even though two weeks later

you ignore hidden fees banks are
notorious

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.750
for hidden fees when you go every time
you need him to use a non

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.360
bank ATP additional four five or six
dollars for using it

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.150
that money adds up over time and I'm
guilty doing that too are

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.580

and we paid five dollars meaning roughly

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.489
about what a dollar 75 a person

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.250
