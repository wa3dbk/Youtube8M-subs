00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.980
One stock I want to
look at is

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.250
Yamana Gold ( NYSE:AUY ),
actually it's the only stock
I want to look at.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.550
A lot of analysts

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.140
are picking gold,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.640
like you've got to be long gold.
I've said before and I'll say it again,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.059
I don't think so. There's nothing
that tells me that

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.239
this is going to be the magical bottom level

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.180
when this was not. So far the
trend is down,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.260
you can go ahead and buy
this now at 121.00 and then sell it

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.110
123.00 and claim yourself to be an excellent
market timer, and that was a heck of a trade.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.600
The bottom line is, I don't think
that's trading,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.570
I think that's a waste of
time.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.729
But you look at

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.939
Yamana Gold ( NYSE:AUY )
and this is a little bit different.

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.990
The stock broke out today at
2.5 percent over 2.5 percent,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.530
volume is pretty decent,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.490
the stocks at $9.35.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.150
I could see the stock going up a buck,
maybe even up a little bit higher;

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.299
but on something like this, with the
stock showing

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.740
a little bit more of a bottom
here it's looking a little bit like a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.640
ski jump.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.630
I would say this is a
safer stock to buy, but frankly,

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.130
really only for a trade.
Take this stock for

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.320
10 or 15 percent;
something like that,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.250
and then let it go. The
bottom line is,

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.000
most of the gold stocks are not working
at all,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.849
I'm not pounding the table on this one,
but I am saying that if you're

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.290
inclined to buy gold

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.450
stay away from the GLD ( NYSE:GLD )
and look at a stock like
Yamana Gold ( NYSE:AUY )
because I think it's

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.930
going to work better for you.
