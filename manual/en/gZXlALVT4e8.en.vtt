00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.320
Somehow hello, it's OMINE.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.300
It's sudden, but does everyone have a compact digital camera?

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.640
A digital single-lens reflex camera is used, but I'm wanting a digital camera of a sub and am searching now exactly.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.560
A compact digital camera is judged very subjectively this time.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.220
A camera by which it can be said "I buy this camera." will be checked.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.600
It becomes a little long this time, so it's shared with 2 or 3 times and it's delivered.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.000
I could think a low price range compact digital camera at less than 30,000 yen seemed fine for this in this time which becomes part-time 1.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.880
"Canon  IXY630"

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.220
"Sony  Cyber-shot DSC-WX350"

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.940
"Nikon  COOLPIX S9700"

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.820
"Casio  HIGH SPEED EXILIM EX-ZR850"

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.900
 "Fuji film  FinePix S1" 5 models will be seen.

00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:06.308
First as the case and the point which should be emphasized most from which I buy a camera, first, "image quality".

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.840
Next there is "the animation performance".

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.540
There were other some, but I put emphasis on these 2 and checked each model this time.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.880
Further, after Revue in kakaku.com and a contribution picture are being consulted besides the manufacturer site for comparison this time.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.520
The carried price will refuse to become the most cheapness in kakaku.com as of the edit.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.120
Now, then first "Canon  IXY630" will be seen.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.520
The most cheapness is IXY630 which becomes the cheapest model in 10,779 yen and the model introduced this time.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.120
That there isn't much photography number at all and that the lens are dark compared with the other models.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.040
Even if there is also animation performance, when even impossibility is a sub-camera, it's possible to deal with prose and the one used mainly somehow, such as, it's the performance.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.480
I think it's the only feature that only start-up time enters the fast class compared with the other models.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.120
Recent Canon don't often put a sample picture on a page of goods also, and please be.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.320
It couldn't be checked about the "image quality" which is an important gauge.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.240
As far as a contributed picture is judged by 3.92, the degree of satisfaction in kakaku.com seems to be regrettable image quality.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.760
Next, "Sony  Cyber-shot DSC-WX350"

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.100
The most cheap rule is very cheap at 18,300 yen, but the stylish outward appearance appropriate for Sony is II very much.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.500
The number of pixels is also highest by whole model compared this time.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.160
A lot of things, the weight and the size are said to be the world minimum and ultralightness, and the photography number is the sharp product which seems to be Sony.

00:02:25.374 --> 00:02:31.174
When I think 60 P can be filmed by full HD by a digital camera of this price range even if the animation performance is seen, it may be unusual.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.760
As far as some sample pictures are seen formally, image quality is also the condition such as the ordinariness which isn't also bad in particular well.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.760
It's low sensitivity and what happens by practical use only by the one of which I took a picture or I'm going to be interested.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.520
"Nikon  COOLPIX S9700" will be seen next.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.520
It has no characteristic such as this in particular compared with other ones on the specification and is S9700 by which a official site has no sample pictures.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.260
That the degree of satisfaction in kakaku.com judges the picture contributed there by 4.14, in 5 models, when I think there is a picture by which it seems most high-definition here and there.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.360
It seems since making it this price range, quite high-definition.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.660
Coming out is also natural and I can think moderately, a person may also be able to go on sharpness at Maine, not a sub.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.040
Now, how about next "Casio HIGH SPEED EXILIM EX-ZR800"?

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.320
When seeing a specification first, I thought the "speed" was what for the feature of this camera.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.000
I'm quick to start, am also quick at being in focus and take a picture of an animation by at most 1000 FPS, and a super slow animation can also be made.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.940
I thought a so-called firearms-like camera.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.920
But surprisingly, being a manual mode and as well as can take a picture when a official site is being checked carefully.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.280
The photography in RAW was also possible and this was really astonishing.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.960
There was a fixed concept that photography is good and possible finally from the luxury Conde place in RAW.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.060
It seems to be a dream that RAW photography is made of a camera of this price really.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:56.600
By the way, a rich Venus report is included compared with general jpeg, so RAW is the most suitable file format in the way such as would like to edit to which I'd like to change the color taste from later.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.540
A point is also high the lens' being light.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.700
But when the sample picture I don't have is seen, only 1 is special beautifulness, so it may be slightly subtle....

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.100
But 4.69 which has very high degree of satisfaction in kakaku.com.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.580
A review also tells the performance of this camera only by something very affirmative.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.420
It's last, ", Fuji film  FinePix S1 will be seen.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.360
The lens which are the size and the weight which seem to mistake whether it's different from other ones and is a single-lens reflex camera and are light with a zoom lens 50 times.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.300
Full HD 60P photography is possible by an animation, and moreover it's filled with protection against dust and the function corresponding to the prevention drop and the size.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.760
Manual photography and photography in RAW also become possible by this, and if, they're these cameras without complaints in the function and the performance-like.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.480
Essential image quality isn't that good.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.520
Of a sample picture, everything can confirm the noise various.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:49.560
Noise even seems to take daytime indoor of which I took a picture in ISO100, and there is no meaning of special RAW. It's the very regrettable model by such meaning..., yes.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.600
How was it?

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.820
The various models were checked for this featuring this time, even if the present camera is inexpensive, the zoom lens function and the hand Bret correction function.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.000
Such as moreover WiFi is be equipped with.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.740
I find the II model to have increased compared with the past.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.860
But if anyway I buy it during taking up this time.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.260
"HIGH SPEED EXILIM EX-ZR850" of Casio is chosen.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.660
Well, I was going to have included the beginning by ordinary number matching.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.420
As it is being checked, it's Kandy where was being dragged into its good, isn't it?

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.180
By the runner-up, "Nikon  COOLPIX S9700"

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.000
 "Sony  Cyber-shot DSC-WX350"

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.380
"Fuji film  FinePix S1"

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.220
It becomes last in the order of "Canon  IXY630".

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.900
That's it.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.240
Then I'd like to see about a compact digital camera of the medium price range next time, so please also see that by all means.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.000
Good-bye.
