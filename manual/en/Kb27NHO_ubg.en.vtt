00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:07.140
Hello, my name is Maria, and I'm here to tell you about ASMR.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.620
Autonomous

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.420
Sensory

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.620
Meridian response

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.240
It's a pleasant tingling feeling that you experience when you hear unique soft voices

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.280
or hear certain soothing sounds

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.380
such as tapping

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Or... Both

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.120
Like sounds of me whispering and brushing your hair

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.920
Or giving you a scalp massage.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.760
*blowing*

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.600
I can use this brush to trace along your face.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.140
One cheek...

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.120
And your ear.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.300
over the other cheek

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.880
and the other ear

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.080
This tingly sensation is Euphoric

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.260
It starts in the back of your head

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.369
Travels down through your spine and to your limbs

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.978
Relaxing you giving you a feeling of well-being

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.220
We believe that everyone has the ability to experience it

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.869
It's simply a matter of finding the trigger that speaks to you

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.869
Thankfully in the Smr. World the choices are endless
