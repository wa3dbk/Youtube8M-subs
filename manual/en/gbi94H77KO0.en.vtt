00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.966
Ok, so our first pose for today is the 'slim
and streamlined' pose.

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.899
What happens is, if you stand face-on to the
camera,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.133
the camera's going to show your complete width.

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.366
What we actually want to do, is always turn
side-on.

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:21.032
That tricks the camera, and it tricks the
viewer

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:24.199
into thinking our frame is slighter than what
it actually is;

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.433
and it highlights curves really beautifully
as well.

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:31.433
And, you always make sure you have your arms
bent,

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:34.833
as this creates a nicer shape for the photograph.

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:36.266
You don't want it pressed at your side,

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.199
because then you start to create quite a flabby
arm;

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.733
and what we do want to do, is put the weight
on one foot,

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.766
and then, you make the other foot more of
a decoration,

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:49.132
so you delicately place your front foot towards
the camera,

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.466
but your weight is on the back foot.

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:55.399
So, finally, stand to the side, move your
arm away from the body,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.366
put the weight on one foot, and smile and
relax your face and enjoy your photo.

00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:08.266
So, Pose Two is the 'Frame-It' pose:

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:13.066
what we actually want to do, is use our hands,
as a showcase to our best asset.

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:17.099
A lot of people use their hands to cover 
themselves;

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.933
where they're insecure, they might put a hand
across a tummy,

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.499
or covering their mouth.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.533
What we actually want to do, is frame our
best asset,

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:27.799
so that peoples' eyes go there as well, when
they're viewing the photograph.

00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:38.266
Okay, so the next pose is what I like to call
'Your Nose Is A Magnet'.

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.799
Many people, when they sit for one of my photos,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.400
they tend to move their head up in a fashion
look;

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.333
and that really just shows their nostrils,

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:47.399
or one might move the head to the side,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.633
but that brings out all the neck wrinkles.

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:54.799
What I would like for people to do; is imagine
that your nose is a magnet,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.600
and it just loves to draw itself towards the
camera lens.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.766
So, what we essentially do, is bring our face
towards the photographer,

00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:07.766
and it draws towards the lens, and all our
features just pop into place,

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:10.833
and that's the perfect way to get a good photo.

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:15.466
The fourth pose for today is called 'Stitching'.

00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:17.999
So, let's say you like my 'Frame-It' pose,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.666
or my 'Slim and Streamlined' pose,

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:23.832
what we do is you hold one pose with one slight
variation;

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:25.833
it might be a different change of the hip,

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:26.633
shift of the weight,

00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:29.633
it might be a different way that you play
with your hair;

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:31.799
and I like to get two different emotions;

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.900
so the first pose might be hand on one hip
with a smile;

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.733
the next pose might be hand on another hip
with a more serious, quite cold look.

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:42.733
And what happens is, you reset your face;

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:45.299
because if you hold a pose for too long, you
start looking fake.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.866
And then you just go between the two poses,
really slowly,

00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:51.299
and capture a lot of different looks.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.933
And the last pose for today is posing with
others.

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:03.199
The first rule is: close the gaps.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.733
What might look like a nice picnic rug gathering

00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:11.233
will create large gaps in the finished photo,
so you have to squish in.

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:13.733
If you are close to one another, link arms,

00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:15.766
and place a hand on each others' shoulders.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.466
The second rule is: eradicate the blinks.

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:23.532
When you have a group shot the main reason
some of them get deleted

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:25.566
is because someone's blinking.

00:03:25.566 --> 00:03:27.899
Once you've captured that really cute group
shot,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.233
have a laugh with each other, or your family,
have a joke,

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:33.633
take some candid photos of them interacting,

00:03:33.633 --> 00:03:35.733
because they would be nice as well.
