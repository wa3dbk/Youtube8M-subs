00:00:21.232 --> 00:00:23.077
Number 5 point

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:27.509
when you are training, when you play

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:36.762
you, must have reason why you can beat the opponent

00:00:37.878 --> 00:00:41.327
what reason you can beat your opponent

00:00:41.327 --> 00:00:41.912
for example

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:50.120
if I play, I am let's say I have 10 years experience

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.800
I play against player who have 3 years experience

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.161
then every body or even me expects to beat him

00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:02.454
because I have more experience

00:01:02.454 --> 00:01:06.441
that's the reason, he play to win, that person play to loose

00:01:07.213 --> 00:01:12.565
now, you want to be advanced player, you want to be champion

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.097
you want to be number 1 in that club

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:19.387
you have to have a reason why?

00:01:21.732 --> 00:01:22.232
for me

00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:26.069
I had reason when I was younger

00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:30.706
when I was 13, 14, 15 years old

00:01:32.455 --> 00:01:40.044
I told myself, I cannot pronounce the words

00:01:40.044 --> 00:01:47.545
whats the word hypnotezing it,  the word is hypnotize myself

00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:52.295
I say to myself, my parents

00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:58.875
are the worlds best parents, there are no other parents

00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:03.085
better than my parents, I am the son of my parents

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:08.568
there fore I should be better than any other sons

00:02:08.568 --> 00:02:14.214
I told my self, why I can't be number 1

00:02:15.445 --> 00:02:24.515
when I trained in personal volume, I told myself

00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:29.194
Lee you are a robot, robots never get tired 

00:02:29.194 --> 00:02:31.376
as long as there is fuel

00:02:31.376 --> 00:02:34.759
I am the robot Lee, so you will never get tired

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:42.093
when I practised smash, I tell myself I will

00:02:42.093 --> 00:02:45.077
be the person who has the strongest smash in the world

00:02:45.995 --> 00:02:51.930
I imagine, I smash in a match excellently my smash

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.929
hit my opponent, because my smash is too strong

00:02:55.929 --> 00:03:00.682
my opponent fell off and become unconcious

00:03:00.682 --> 00:03:01.813
never that will happen

00:03:01.813 --> 00:03:03.130
but I imagine

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:09.007
I want to make that happen, not liberately hit my opponent

00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:14.004
if my smash hit opponent he will fall off

00:03:14.004 --> 00:03:16.630
because my smash is impossibly strong

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.089
so, when I smash I imagine that picture and then I smash

00:03:23.928 --> 00:03:27.353
so my smash practice is completely different 

00:03:27.353 --> 00:03:31.208
to my friends next door, who just practice smash

00:03:32.906 --> 00:03:37.382
so, if you don't have a reason why you are better

00:03:37.382 --> 00:03:40.437
why you are going to be better then

00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:49.882
our opponents, you cannot drive yourself to the impossible level

00:03:49.882 --> 00:03:55.100
you cannot take the training, the training

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.329
not many humans can take

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.974
you cannot take those kind of training

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:03.806
if you don't have a reason why?

00:04:04.698 --> 00:04:10.791
do not just do training, you must have a reason why?

00:04:12.715 --> 00:04:17.341
I don't know what that is, but ask yourself

00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:22.003
why can I be number 1 in my club

00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:24.702
why can I be number 1 in my county

00:04:24.702 --> 00:04:28.349
because, you have to have answer to because

00:04:30.486 --> 00:04:35.442
if you don't have answer, don't play badminton competitively

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:41.503
play badminton in the recreational leisure centre for leisure

00:04:41.503 --> 00:04:43.229
for hobby

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.822
if you don't have that answer, you will never be

00:04:46.822 --> 00:04:52.784
the competitor, you will never be called competitor in badminton
