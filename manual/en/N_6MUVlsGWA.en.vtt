00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.890
I'm going to a place called Home Boy
Industries, it's a project after my own heart

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.890
because like fifteen, it's founded on the belief that food can break the cycle of crime.
You alright man? Jamie. Damian.

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:31.929
Nice to meet you bruv. I'm Carlos and I'm Dan.

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.469
Damian is a drug counselor at Home Boy  but
just five years ago he was a crystal

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:37.550
meth addict

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.890
who carried an AK47.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.490
A father of four, he's now trying to rebuild
his relationship with his children.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.799
I'm having this baptism

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:50.130
and it's a family tradition of baptism. I'm baptising my little daughter who is ten months.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.600
Her name is Mia

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.260
and i was wondering if maybe you have
time to stop by? 
Ah man, Thank you

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.170
That's really kind you, I'd love to do that.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.090
This baptism

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.750
isn't just about his daughter it's about
all of his children and i'd like to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.740
contribute to this family occasion so
I've offered to cook for the party.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.820
I've come up with a chocolate tart

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.600
to rival Home Boy Bakery, and it's all about the molet inspired dusting.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.330
The chocolate molet

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.650
is kind of, I'm going to finish it actually, it's a cocoa dusting

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.760
that I'm going to put on the top so you get that little bit of spice.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.660
For the tart filling, melt two hundred gramms of
good chocolate with a hundred and fifty

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.729
grams of butter and a pinch of salt.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.530
I'm going to give that short crust pastry tart a nice gooey

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.590
caramel base.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.950
There's something about hazlenuts and caramel

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.130
it's just such a great combination.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.650
Whizz up three eggs and fifty grams of sugar until frothy.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.060
Boil to a syrup a hundred fifty grams of sugar

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.770
with seventy five grams of water and then add
to the frothy eggs with the chocolate.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.640
And then as soon as you've got that nicely mixed, it

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.500
goes on like this.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.560
They're ready for cooking

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.550
so I can get going with the dusting. I really love that brave blend of sweet and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.200
savoury spices.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.560
I'm going to put a little bit of cinammon,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.099
a couple of cloves,

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.769
a tiny bit of

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.829
coriander seeds. A little bit of dried
chilli. I just want to bash these up

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.530
Orange zest, sugar and salt and that's ready to dust the tart when I get

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.249
there

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.049
When got it around that beautiful thing,

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.689
it's gonna rock-and-roll. I'm going to serve that with some sour cream, it's a big Mexican

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.109
thing as well. It will be fantastic!

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.199
She was so good in the church!

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:35.469
You were so good in the church, weren't you huh?

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.109
So we've got this nice molet

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.919
seasoning. Look at that!

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:42.539
See like the chocolate, you got the crisp top,

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:45.059
caramel and hazelnuts in the bottom.

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:49.269
That's a definite winner

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.219
Have you been licking in there already?

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:54.340
Have you got a little bit of chocolate cake around your face?
