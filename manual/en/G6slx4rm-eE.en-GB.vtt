00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.720
 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.940
My first impressions were brilliant

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.240
like I thought it was a really nice environment. Each night there was 
something different on so we all 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.950
got involved I got to know loads of people It's lovely its just outside of the city 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.699
so its quite a quiet campus as a whole but its still got 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.140
the really good social aspects I think the Hollies 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.140
offers a more peaceful environment we've all got our own working space so 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.280
when  when people wanted to work we went and worked in our rooms

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.200
I lived with some people off my course so it was great to be able to study with them 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.410
I chose to come and live at Glenside mainly because it was really close to where all my lectures were held

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.230
Facilities wise they've obviously got like the library and also the study areas and group areas and things like that are 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.570
nice to sort of get away from the flat a little bit 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.769
and sort of  just have your own study time

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.670
You can

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.729
walk from the Hollies to Frenchay easily enough even though we're from Glenside 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.000
campus we still

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.259
socialise at Frenchay campus sometimes and it's so easy to get there

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.229
and so easy to get back like buses run like really late and things like that 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.830
its easy access to Bristol itself there's two
bus stops outside 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.220
 so I can get to the bus stop in five minutes
and in 10 minutes I'll be 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.740
in the city centre 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.240
we've got 24 hour security we've also got wardens 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.560
here so if there's any problems in  the 
flat or in the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.750
house at all we can just call the wardens and they'll be straight here to 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.640
assist us with whatever we need so within the flat so you've got everything you sort of

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.030
need so the bathrooms modern the kitchen is modern and really spacious 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.850
as well I'd recommend The Hollies mainly
because it is 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.439
such a community feel it's a brilliant atmosphere 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.910
 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.960
 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.620
