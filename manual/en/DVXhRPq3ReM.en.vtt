00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.930
Doctor Hess: So, birds are really social creatures.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.420
They live out in the wild with thousands of
other birds and they need things to do.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.620
When they're in our homes, they're often bored.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.630
And we really need to give them things to
chew on.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.730
To tear apart.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.730
To rip apart.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.150
Remember, they're building nests outside,
and we're not giving them that opportunity

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.150
to do that inside.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.089
So we need to give them things to build with.

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.439
We can use soft woods.

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.609
We can use leather.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.509
We can use paper to shred up.

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.470
These are all things that are safe for birds.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.210
We have to be careful about using some of
the heavier plastics.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.810
Because, although those are safe for little
birds with little beaks, for birds that are

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.350
larger they can actually rip those pieces
of plastic apart and they may ingest them.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.060
We have to be careful with toys that hang
on chains.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.450
We want to make sure that the links in the
chain are not the size that would catch a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.260
little bird's toe or leg in them and get caught.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.700
And we just have to make sure that all the
parts of the toy are safe.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.400
That they can't rip them apart and pull off
things to ingest.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.210
Now, there is a big buzzword out there in
bird land.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.330
It's called foraging.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.150
Sarah, do you want to tell us what foraging
is?

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.150
Sarah: Sure.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.330
Foraging is not only a good way to come up
with new toys for your bird but it's also

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.670
extremely good for their mental health.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.640
In the wild birds are constantly looking for
food.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.300
Doing what we call foraging for food.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.540
They're digging through leaves.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.710
They're ripping trees apart.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.180
They're looking for good fruits and nuts.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.180
And when we bring them into our home we put
some food in a bowl and we expect them to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.510
be happy with that.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.010
And, unfortunately, they're so smart, they
get bored.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.700
So, a good way to do some foraging with your
bird is you can even use stuff from home.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.550
You can use paper bags and hide their favorite
food in it.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.670
You can tear some little holes just to get
them started.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.050
They love to rip it up.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.170
Paper towel rolls.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.909
Anything paper-based, cardboard is safe.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.979
You do want to be careful with plastics and
metals and other things like that.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.369
We don't want them to ingest anything toxic.

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.540
But they also even sell specially made foraging
bird toys that are a little more complicated

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.170
and involve a little more brain power on the
bird's part.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.210
And it's good for birds that start to get
a little past the cardboard box phase and

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.750
even get bored with that.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.830
Doctor Hess: Right.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.430
Again, birds in the wild have jobs.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.280
They hunt and they gather and they look for
mates and nest sites and food.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.700
And they have something to do all day.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.700
In captivity, they're very bored, and that's
when we see behavioral problems.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.209
So if we can, think ahead.

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.370
Plan for our birds.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.510
Make our own foraging toys.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.230
They don't have to be expensive, as Sarah
mentioned.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.849
You can use household items.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.010
Really, you can make a bird's quality of life
much better.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.480
They'll bond to you better and they'll have
a lot more fun.
