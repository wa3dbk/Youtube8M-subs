00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.210
Hey guys

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.500
Due to the recent

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.700
Meteor crash in Russia

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.509
I came up with a funny prank idea

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.699
As we all know, Matt loves loud explosion nosies

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:16.779
So the recent meteor crash

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.689
Seems like the perfect opportunity to play a prank on Matt

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.060
So for this prank, I am going to take concepts from two prior pranks

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.990
That I've played on Matt

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.520
The first prank being

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.740
The prank that got the entire prank war going

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:41.740
That  being the computer scare prank

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.130
And a more recent prank

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.920
The remote desktop prank

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.950
Alright so

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.560
Over here is our

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.600
Command center at home

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.150
We have two computers, one for

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.340
making videos

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.830
and every day tasks

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.770
the other one houses files from old videos

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.230
and Matt's adult film collection

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.909
Matt's off from work tomorrow

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.630
Every morning after he wakes up

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.940
he goes online, goes on pinterest

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.740
checks sales on forever 21

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.270
So my idea is to use remote desktopping on both computers

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.250
We have a pretty intense sound system 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.750
We have surround sound speakers

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.740
On this computer

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.369
I'm going to keep an eye out on when he hops on

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.790
And on this computer, I have the icon all set to go

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.570
All I have to do is double click on it

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.400
from work

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.560
And I will be able to play the prank sound on him

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.510
Im about to head off for work now

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.849
There is plenty of tape in the camera to last a couple hours

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.439
Matt should be awake in an hour so

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.290
That sould give me plenty of time to get to work and log in

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.289
Im going to turn off the screen now, and head out

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:29.289
Alright

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.410
Im at work now

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.150
All set to go here, just hanging out until I see some action

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.150
And we will go forward

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.979
Matt's on NHL.com now

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.939
Checking the standings

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.730
Im going to press play

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.730
[funny prank sound plays]

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.929
[funny prank sound plays again]
