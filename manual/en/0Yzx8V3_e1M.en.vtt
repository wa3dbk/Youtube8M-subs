Hi, I'm Dave Campbell, I've been competing
in endurance sports for thirty years and triathlon

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.850
for ten of those years and we are going to
talk today about the off-road triathlon, how

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.190
to do one, how to participate, how to train.
The most basic thing to remember is you are

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.070
an endurance athlete, you are a triathlete
and so you need to train like a swimmer, like

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.140
a cyclist, and like a runner but not at the
same volume. You can't compare yourself to

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.520
the local guy from the running club who is
training for the marathon, mileage-wise he

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.410
is going to be doing a lot more miles then
you are. So make what you do count. Make it

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.950
quality training, where ever you can make
it specific to the demands of an off-road

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.750
triathlon do so. Run as much as you can on
trails. The soft surfaces will be more forgiving

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.010
to your joints and additionally you'll get
those additional challenges, like additional

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.610
climbing and descending demands and the stabilizing
that your core needs to do and all those different

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.140
things that a trail runs require that road
running does not. Same with a mountain bike,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:11.579
do as many mountain-specific workouts as you
can. But most triathletes are full time employees,

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.299
they have families so you are not going to
be doing the volume that cyclist and runners

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.319
and single sport athletes do. But you can
take bits of those activities and incorporate

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:26.259
them in. Don't think of yourself as just a
triathlete but try to take the best parts

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.450
of the training aspects of each of the three
sports and apply them to what you do. And

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.939
use your local resources. If you can do local
mountain bike races, do them. You are going

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.759
to develop better handling skills, you are
going to be challenged from those riders,

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.709
and if you can do an open water swim in your
area or trail runs all those things will help

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:48.340
you. And sometimes you can use those as fitness
tests, you can use them as speed work, and

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.859
you can make them specific to what you are
doing. Bring your running shoes to that mountain

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.590
bike race and once the race is over, go to
your car, change into the shoes and do a quick

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.549
twenty, thirty minute run right after the
race. And make it a Brick workout. So use

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.409
what's available to you but make what you
do count and emphasis quality over quantity.

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.600
Now we'll talk a little bit more about structuring
your year round training program for the off-road

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.779
triathlon.
