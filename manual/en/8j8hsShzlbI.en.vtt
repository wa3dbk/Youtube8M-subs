While some good old, black markers will be
enough for you to do a lot of your cartoon

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.340
expressions. After all, some of the great
Sunday, comic strips were never ever in color.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.900
Sometimes, you can use color to heighten the
expressions in your cartoons. And I'm going

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.230
to show you actually, by taking you through
several expressions, you've already drawn.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.450
And showing you ways, in which you can leverage
a little bit of color. To emphasize your effect.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.640
First, let's take our sad expression. Now
for this, we're going to color him, in using

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.160
gray. Now, you're like. What do you mean,
gray? It's not the color of skin. How many

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.260
gray people do you know? Well, in terms of
people who are healthy, not many? But I will

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.540
say that a cartoon coloring should not be
looked as real world. There are several comic

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.090
strips, over the years. Who do not, perfectly
represent skin color? In fact, some of them

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.970
intentionally try to get us out of. What we
term in, in terms of like, different colors

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.240
of skin. Which is, that's fine? So in this
case, this guy is down. What color do you

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.989
think of, when you're down? You think of gray.
You think of gray clouds. You think, even

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.070
in this case of gray people. People who are
down. The other color you think of when people

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:15.880
are down is blue. Blue, blue, blue. Blue rain
falling on my windshields. Blue circles, gray

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.850
circles underneath your eyes. Blue mouth.
So you can see, just how a couple of very

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:32.840
easy basic coloring in here. Now ask yourself.
Do these colors make this drawing more sad?

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.460
I would way sure, that they do. This is like
an, in this case a very simple. Very basic

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.159
application of color. Just two colors. We
don't even draw anything on the drawing. The

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.090
hair is still left empty. But you can see,
you've already increased and made it almost,

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.220
like more watery. And this is like, this person's
almost going to slide off the page. Because

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.530
they're so sad. Now for angry expression,
I've already used a couple colors here. To

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.450
put on the skin color. In this case, I'm using
flesh color. This, you know, this guy's Caucasian.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.030
Has medium brown hair. But we're going to
add in a couple colors. Turning up for the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.479
burgundy. Start showing a flashed, angry expression
on these cheeks. I'm going up and over the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.099
black to show that some blood is sitting here.
This guy's blood is up. If anything, you can

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.409
also use this. Doubt line some of the angrier
lines. See how this is already starting to

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:25.189
heighten the effect. Something else, you can
do is add in some red. Red eyes. This guy's

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:32.719
seeing red. And go above here. And put in
some red. Over an angry dark cloud, hanging

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:38.430
over. A very, very angry, angry guy. Also
the gum lines down here, you can do in red,

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:46.239
as well. Now for our scared person, I'm going
to use again, a very similar flesh color.

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.980
But I'm going to make it a little more faint
than the last one. Now these are just basic

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.010
suggestions of coloring. you can use on your
cartoon expressions. Experiment, do different

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.680
things. I mean, the sky is really the limit
for what you can do with color. But one of

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.760
things is, is if you, the higher grade markers
you have. The less smearing and drier, you're

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.280
going to get. See this guy is just dry. Actually,
here let me do an extreme example. Look at

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.939
his color over the eyebrows. Oh, my goodness!
What's going to happen now? That's going to

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.499
be smearing all brown. Everything is going
to be all monkey. Going to be all gunky, when

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:24.269
I go above, over it. If you have good markers,
no problem at all. None. See there's no smearing

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:31.180
there at all. I can very easily put several
colors in here. Now for the markers, but like,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.040
say hair standing on anywhere. You're trying
to get tips. I like pressing down harder.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.749
And then flailing upwards. As I go. See how
actually, it gives you this nice tip effect,

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:47.699
up here. That's something very easy and obvious,
you can do. Now something with somebody's

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.709
who's scared, is their tongue's going to be
showing. So let's show off that tongue back

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.120
here. Don't be shy. It's going to be bright
and red and obvious. It's also going to be

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.790
doubly obvious. So they have their mouth open
in some horrible scream. Because they're freaked

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.181
out by something they saw. You can also put
them blue eyes. It's a nice touch. And you

00:04:03.181 --> 00:04:06.989
can also add in some blue to some of these
tears and sweat marks going off. Blue traditionally,

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.459
represents sweat, tear, anxiety, etc.
