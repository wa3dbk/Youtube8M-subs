I'm Jodi Fisher with Jodi's Ski School in
Orlando, Florida, and I'd just like to show

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.220
you some of the basic skis that you might
come across when going to ski school. First

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:24.320
of all we would have a pair of combo skis.
We would start off in a pair of skis and then

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.380
bounce onto a single ski, which would have
a toe loop at the back to put your spare leg

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:40.600
in. The more advanced version of that ski
is what we call the slalom ski. This is a

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.530
ski that is going to take you to be able to
generate more speed, fast turns, and a lot

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:56.210
of acceleration across the waves. Moving onto
trick skiing. This is a single board, no fins

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.390
on the bottom, very slippy, and is very much
like ice skating, where you could do many

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.360
spins, somersaults, flips, things like that.
It is done in a slightly slower speed, but

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.939
very exciting to watch, nevertheless. Then
we go onto jump skis. These are very long

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.399
skis, flat surface on the bottom, two skis
and this is where you see the guys doing the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.240
long distance jumping off ramps with a world
record now of 240 feet in distance. Very,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:41.289
very exciting. Then we have the leg board;
it is a very fast growing area of our sport.

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:53.179
It is a combination between surfing, skateboarding,
snowboarding, it is a bigger surface area.

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.639
Two boot bindings that are set apart very
much like you would stand on a skateboard,

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:04.000
and they attach the rope to a higher pylon
on the boat which pulls you up onto the air

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.340
and gives you more more air time. Lots of
fun. It is a very very quick learning curve

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.540
on that; a lot of people are getting into
it, it is a lot of fun.
