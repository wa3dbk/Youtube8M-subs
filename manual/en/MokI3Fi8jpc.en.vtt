00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.430
Show 109% by shading.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.760
So just as a bit of review, 109%
if we were to write it

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.910
out, would literally be 109
percent, which is the same

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:25.330
thing as 109 per-- and I could
write cent again, but that's

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.270
getting old.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.540
Cent means 100, so it literally

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.850
means 109 per hundred.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.400
If you had 100 per 100, you're
dealing with the whole, but

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.040
now we have more than a whole.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.850
We have 109 per 100.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.460
We can actually write this as
a ratio, or as a fraction.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.730
This is the same thing
as 109 per 100.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.220
It's the the same thing
as 109/100.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.260
So let's shade that in.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.720
So we have a whole here,
so we could consider

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.300
this square a whole.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.150
In the last video, we counted.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.830
This is a 10 by 10 square.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.460
It is cut up into 100 pieces.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.510
So if we want 109 of those
100 pieces, what

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.660
are we talking about?

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.130
That means we're going to
shade in all of the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.350
100 right over here.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.950
Let me do that in a new color.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.090
So we'll shade in all of this.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.740
If you just shaded that in,
that would be 100%.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.410
That would be 100/100, or
100 per 100, or 100%.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.540
I think you're getting the
meaning of all of this.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.940
I don't just want you just
memorize this stuff.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.970
This really just means 100
out of 100, or a whole.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.540
And you can see that this
is the whole square.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.010
That's 100 out of
100 right there.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.200
The question is saying show
us 109% by shading.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.610
We already did 100 per 100, but
we need to do another 9,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.170
so let's shade in another 9.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.380
So now we have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.030
eight, nine.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.350
So this piece right here, you
could almost view that is--

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.090
well, that is!

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.320
That is 9% of an
entire square.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.700
This is 100% of an
entire square.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.620
If you considered this whole
thing plus this blue area

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:16.920
right over here, you are talking
about 109% of one

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.690
whole square.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.430
Hopefully, that made sense.
