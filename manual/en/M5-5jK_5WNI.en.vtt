Hi evereybody, it's iKilleasy007

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
let's begin with a new video :

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
A tutoriel to know how

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.140
to partition a HDD in order to

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.980
make it work on a Xbox 360 and a PC .

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.720
You should know that if you plug your HDD on your Xbox 360

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.200
your Xbox is going to format it in format Fat32

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.200
which is not recognized by all PCs

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.460
So your PC will sometimes have to format it again in a readable format

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.840
So if you want to have datas on your Xbox 360 and your PC at the same time

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.840
try the following tutorial ;)

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.060
To partition it, go in "Computer".

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:51.600
And format your HDD in the NTFS format, with an allocation of 64Ko

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600
Then click on "start"

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.220
I've already done it, so I'm not going to do it again

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.860
In order to partition your HDD, go on your "Control Panel"

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.160
Then clic on "administration tools"

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.640
and finally  "Computer management"

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.980
Go in "Storage" and "Disk Management"

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.020
You shoulf find your HDD

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:41.140
Now we are going to partion your HDD

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.260
Right clic on it and chose "reduce volume"

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.420
Write "16000"

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.640
That is 16Go

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:10.560
Because your Xbox can recognize an HDD, only if it contain less than 16Go

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.120
You should now see a "non allocated" HDD besides the original one

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.880
The right clic on it and chose "new volume", say "next".

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.040
Here you can chose the letter of your new partition

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:45.160
Then make sure that it is in "Fat32", with an allocation size of "64Ko" and chose a name for your partition.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.480
then clic on "finish" and here is your new partition.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:10.420
Now you should see your new HDD that you have just created.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:22.220
So if you plus your HDD on your Xbox, it will use the 16Go Fat32 partition.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:30.720
And if you plus your HDD to your PC, your main NTFS partition will be used.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:43.680
If you want to come back to your original HDD

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:59.220
Get back to the "Disk Management" window

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:12.620
clic on your Fat32 partition and chose "delete volume"

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.580
It will become "non allocated"

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.320
Chose the main Partition, right clic and chose "extend volume"

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.060
Clic on "next" when possible, then "finish"

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:39.160
That's it, your HDD is like new !

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:46.340
Thanks for watching !
