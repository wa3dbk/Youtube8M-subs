00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.210
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.370
In sorry, I could not travel both and be one
traveler.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.370
Long I stood and looked down one as far as I
could

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.900
to where it bent in the undergrowth.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.630
Then took the other, as just as fair,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.810
and having perhaps the better claim.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.080
Because it was grassy and wanted wear,
Though as for that the passing there.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.260
Had worn them really about the same,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.350
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.280
Oh, I kept the first for another day!

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.850
Yet knowing how way leads on to way
I doubted if I should ever come back.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.580
I shall be telling this with a sigh

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.190
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.820
I took the one less traveled by,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.900
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.900
I took the one less traveled by,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:09.900
And that has made all the difference.
