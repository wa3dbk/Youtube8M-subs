00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
NASA's most ambitious Martian rover ever is on its way to the red planet.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.310
This is your SpacePod for November 28th, 2011.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.150
Announcer: T-15 seconds

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.390
T-10

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.390

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.390

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.390

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.390

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.390
1...

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.600
Main engine start.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.140
0 and liftoff of the Atlas V with Curiosity,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.510
seeking clues to the planetary puzzle about life on Mars.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:59.190
Ben: NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission lifted off the launch pad atop an Atlas V rocket on November 26th, 2011 at 15:02 UTC.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.629
Now this isn't just another rocket launch or rover being sent to the red planet.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.240
I could tell you how this is the largest lander we have ever sent to Mars and is nearly the size of a mini cooper.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.310
I could tell you that this is the heaviest rover that we have sent to our fourth planet coming in at over 2000 pounds.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.250
But instead I think William Pomerantz described this mission best at his LA Space Salon talk.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.920
William Pomerantz: For anyone that doesn't recognize it, this is Mars Science Lab

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.860
also known as Curiosity. This launch is two weeks from Friday ... no, one week from Friday. The day after Thanksgiving.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.360
Ah, my wife works on this mission. I'm going to go see it launch. I think it's amazing.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:45.910
I think whoever designed that, the sky-crane landing system, which really briefly is instead of landing on the surface,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.310
this thing is going to hover under rocket power a few dozen meters off the surface or less than that.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.580
And it's going to lower the rover down on a cable while these 8 rocket engines are firing in perfect precision until

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.290
the rover's wheels touch down on the surface of Mars. And then it has to blow an explosive bolt and that rocket stage 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.330
has to fly somewhere else so that it doesn't land on top. That is a crazy idea!

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.470
Whoever suggested that, I hope had had a couple drinks before walking into that meeting!

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.200
Never say NASA doesn't take risks!

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.580
Ben: Needless to say the MSL mission with the Curiosity Rover will be a nail biter as the vehicle enters,

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.510
descends and then lands on the Martian Surface.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.690
To make things even more dramatic, Mars is far enough away that radio signals will take around 10 minutes to reach Earth.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.060
In fact, it is so far that by the time we start to get the radio signals

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.460
telling us that the craft is about to begin its entry into the Martian atmosphere, the vehicle will

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.130
actually already be on the ground, hopefully in one piece!

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:51.740
If everything goes according to plan, then on August 5th, 2012 the Curiosity rover will begin roaming the Gale crater on Mars.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.940
Now, we're not just sending Curiosity to Mars for fun.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:02.780
This giant rover has several missions it will attempt to accomplish in one martian year which is nearly 2 years here on Earth.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.650
The goals are to determine if life could have ever been there,

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:13.130
characterize the climate and geology of this alien world, and finally, help prepare for human exploration of the red planet.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.800
NASA is known for its awesome Twitter accounts and the Curiosity Rover is no exception.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.630
If you would like to follow real-time updates via the tweety bird,

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.340
hit up the official account @MarsCuriosity or visit the web site via the far more

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.280
complicated URL which is mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl...

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.850
Or just go to the bit.ly link at the bottom of your screen.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.220
And if you missed the Launch that's OK!

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.020
There are plenty of additional rocket launches coming up, and here's a quick list of everything you can watch or tweet about.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.630
