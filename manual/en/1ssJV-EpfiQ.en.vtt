00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:14.400
Let's learn about the digestive system.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.740
The digestive system consists of a long tube
called the alimentary canal.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.990
The canal extends from the mouth to the anus
and is about 30 feet long.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.430
The tube consists of 4 layers.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.260
There is an inner mucous secreting mucosal
layer, a submucosa that contains blood and

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:43.840
lymphatic vessels, a muscular layer that contains
2 layers of smooth muscle a layer that runs

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.600
along the length of the tube as well as a
layer that encircles the tube.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.600
The outer serosa or serous layer secretes
a slimy serous fluid.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.059
The alimentary canal begins in the mouth.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:09.540
Teeth break down food into smaller pieces
in a process called chewing or mastication.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.369
Types of teeth include molars, premolars,
canines and incisors.

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:24.640
Children have 20 deciduous or temporary teeth
while adults have 32 teeth.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.499
The uvula which is part of the soft palate
rises when swallowing.

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:36.340
We can also see the palatine tonsils.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.390
The salivary glands secrete mucous and salivary
amylase which breaks down carbohydrates.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.709
There are 3 pair of salivary glands.

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:53.969
The parotids, sublinguals and submandibular
glands.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.759
The tonsils are masses of lymphoid tissue
that contain white blood cells that help to

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.119
fight off pathogens.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:09.209
There are the phyaryngeals or adenoids, the
palatines and the lingual tonsils.

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.510
The pharynx consists of 3 parts.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.069
The upper part is called the nasopharynx,
the middle section is called the oropharynx

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.930
and the lower section is the laryngopharynx.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.770
The pharynx contains constrictor muscles that
function in swallowing.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.110
The esophagus is a muscular tube containing
smooth muscle.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.150
The lower esophageal sphincter is at the bottom
of the esophagus.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.760
The sphincter opens during swallowing to let
food into the stomach.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.870
An peristaltic wave progagates through the
espophagus during swallowing.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.829
The stomach consists of various parts.

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:58.110
The first portion is called the cardiac region,
here is the fundus, the large body, and the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.000
pylorus.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.030
The inside of the stomach consists of folds
or rugae.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.519
The rugae help to mix the food.

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:18.890
The stomach also contains 2 curves here is
the greater curvature.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.200
Here is the lesser curvature.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.540
The inner lining of the stomach, the Gastric
mucosa contains gastric pits or tubelike openings.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.890
Gastric glands secrete substances into gastric
pits.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.390
The cells of the stomach include Parietal
cells which secrete hydrochloric acid

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.510
Chief cells which secrete pepsinogen and gastric
lipase,

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.200
Mucous secreting cells that secrete an alkaline
mucous and Endocrine cells secrete intrinsic

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:01.200
factor
Pepsinogen combines with hydrochloric acid

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.519
to produce pepsin which digests proteins.

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.709
Food mixes with the secretions of the stomach
(called gastric juice) to form a pasty substance

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.360
called chime.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.450
The pyloric sphincter relaxes to let chime
out of the stomach and into the first portion

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.470
of the small intestine called the duodenum.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.580
The small intestine is built for absorption
with a large surface area.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.910
Some special structures include plicae circulares
which are circular folds that increase the

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:44.130
surface area and vili which are tiny fingerlike
projections containing blood vessels and lacteals

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.680
which are part of the lymphatic system.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.950
The pancreas also secretes substances into
the duodenum via the pancreatic duct.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:02.810
These include a pancreatic amylase for carbohydrate
digestion, a pancreatic lipase for fat digestion,

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.030
trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypepsidase
for protein digestion.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.860
Bicarbonate ions are also secreted by the
pancreas to neutralize the acidic chime from

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.910
the stomach.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:22.750
The digestive enzymes work better under more
alkaline conditions.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.600
Bile is secreted into the duodenum via the
common bile duct.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:34.130
The common bile duct ends in a small sphincter
called the hepatopancreatic sphincter.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.370
Bile is made by the liver and stored in the
gallbladder.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:46.160
Fatty chyme entering duodenum triggers the
release of cholecystokinin (CCK) which promotes

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.630
the secretion of bile.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:56.620
Bile works to emulsify fats.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.090
Chyme then moves to the jejunum and ileum
parts of the small intestine.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.500
Here most of digestion and absorption is finished.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.680
Some intestinal enzymes include Intestinal
lipase

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:17.880
Sucrase,
Nucleases, and Maltase

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.280
The large intestine begins at the cecum.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.930
There is a valve between the ileum and cecum
called the ileocecal valve.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.810
The Ileocecal valve keeps the contents from
large intestine from moving back into small

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.630
intestine
The cecum contains the appendix.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:43.480
Appendix--may have no digestive function but
functions in immunity and may act as a reservoir

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:49.140
for bacteria
The large intestine has a different structure

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.940
than the small intestine.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:57.590
It contains large pouches called haustra and
a long band of smooth muscle called the taenea

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.990
coli.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:07.060
The major parts of the large intestine include
the ascending colon, transverse colon, descending

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.780
colon, sigmoid colon, rectum and anus.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:18.180
The function of the Large intestine included
absorbing water and vitamins (from bacterial

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.300
flora).

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:29.120
Feces exits the large intestine when it reaches
the rectum and triggers the defecation reflex.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.870
The greater omentum is a large peritoneal
membrane in the abdominal region.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.190
It attaches to the greater curvature of the
stomach.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:43.870
The greater omentum is a site of fat storage,
immunity, and helps to fight off infections

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:50.340
We hope you have learned something about the
digestive system and..see you next time.
