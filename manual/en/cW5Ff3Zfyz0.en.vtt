Let's start this tutorial! I've already crimped my hair. 

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:35.238
First, I'm going to put my hair in a high ponytail. 

00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:49.493
I'm going to use some bobby pins to secure loose hair.

00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:16.699
Secure loose hair with some bobby pins.

00:01:17.972 --> 00:01:23.879
And another item you are going to need is this hair band

00:01:24.723 --> 00:01:42.400
I use this hairband whenever I wear a ponytail. It hides these wayward hair.

00:01:46.024 --> 00:01:51.680
Put your head through the hairband first, and pull it 
 up to where you want it to be.

00:02:18.193 --> 00:02:19.640
It's done!

00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:31.210
You can jazz up your usual ponytail by adding a hairband! 

00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:40.990
This hairstyle is called American Sporty Kidz Hair

00:02:41.934 --> 00:02:44.030
It's great for sports day!
