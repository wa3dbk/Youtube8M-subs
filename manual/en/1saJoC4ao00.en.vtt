00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.180
Did you ever get annoyed as a kid when your parents would try and "bond" with you?

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.920
Like, my dad would wake me up early in the morning. He'd be so excited, he'd be like,

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.620
"Son, we're going fishing!"

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.500
Like dad, it's 4:30 in the freaking morning. Pretty sure the fish are still asleep.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.240
I'm gonna close my eyes now. Do not wake me up again, okay? Unless you bought me a Playstation.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.980
See the thing was, I was an I.K. I was an indoor kid.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.540
I played video games, and I watched action movies.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.120
You're gonna wake me up that early, damn well better be to do something fun that I want to do.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.420
How cool would it be if your dad woke you up like this?

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.500
"Son, it's time you became a man. Now put on this ski mask, we're going to rob a Dairy Queen."

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.380
AWESOME!

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.680
But no, my dad wanted to go fishing. Here's the deal about that:

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.270
It's so boring! You put a worm on a string, you throw it into the water. Then you sit and do nothing.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.520
Ten minutes goes by, you're still doing nothing, alright? 
It's not fun. It's fishing.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.440
So one day I'm sitting on my computer, probably macking it to some girl in an AOL chat room. My dad comes into the room.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.180
"Son, I bought you something."

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.680
Now, this was a big deal 'cause my dad never bought anybody anything, okay?

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.020
So I'm all excited, I'm like, is it a Playstation? Is it a new computer? Did he get me a new bike?

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.820
It was a fishing pole.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.900
"Uh... gee thanks, Dad."

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.980
He thought since the pole was Star Wars themed that I was going to be all excited.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.140
Like, the fish were gonna leap out of the water and lightsaber battle me. Hyah!

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.940
*battle noises*

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.660
That would have been awesome!

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.120
But no, it's still just a fishing pole.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.129
So I'm sitting at my computer and my dad's like, "It's time to get a move on, son."

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.330
I didn't really want to because things were getting really 
hot in that chat room...

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.620
But it was a Sunday, and my mom had just woken up. She was giving me that look like,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.260
"You know what would be really fun, Al? If we went to garage sales together!" (NOPE.)

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.930
Get in the car, dad. Let's go right now.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.600
So we're down by the river, my dad is super pumped. I'm there trying to put my pole together like,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.460
"Dad, am I doing this right?"

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.120
"It looks great, son."

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.660
And looking back my dad must have been so thrilled he finally got me out fishing.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:31.740
"Oh son, you know what would make me so proud is if we cast out our first line...together."

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.740
"Uh... sure."

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.340
So we walk up to the edge of the river. Already, this is a huge deal.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.100
We cast our poles back behind us and shoot 'em out over into the river.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.720
20 feet out, you see my dad's bobber land perfectly in the water.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.300
Another 40 feet past that, you see the whole end of my fishing pole land in the river.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.880
Still had the handle in my hands, but the whole rest of it is in the river.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.940
Never saw it again. Never had to go fishing again, either. (HOORAY!)

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.700
But at least we got that great story out of it, right?

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.100
Just go have fun with your dad. You know, you never know what'll happen.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.760
Do something awesome, like rob a Dairy Queen. (ooh ice cream yum)

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.840
*laughs*

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.500
Okay, I'm itsAlexClark.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.960
Byeeee!
