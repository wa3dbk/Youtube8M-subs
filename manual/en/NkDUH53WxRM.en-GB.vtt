00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.099
LG G Pad 8.3

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.679
Expected Q4 2013.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:22.340
LG's first and only tablet to date has been
the 2011 LG Optimus Pad, a device that singularly

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.350
failed to sell in any

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.640
volume but it did at least have the novel
feature of a 3D camera. LG have steered clear

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.860
of the tablet market until

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:37.260
now with the launch of the new LG G Pad 8.3.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.989
The unique selling proposition with the LG
G Pad 8.3 is that it is the full first HD

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.280
tablet in the 8-inch class. It

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.340
also sports a speedy 1.7GHz quad-core processor
with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard flash

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.179
memory. On the back is a 5

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:01.301
megapixel camera with a 1.3 megapixel front-facing
one. Inside is a 4600 mAh battery and the

00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:02.469
whole thing weighs 338

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.860
grams. We don't know if this is going to be
a WiFi-only tablet or if it will support 3G

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.991
or 4G data as well. Our

00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:16.390
guess is that LG will play safe and start
with a WiFi-only version.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.070
This is an Android 4.2.2 device and it comes
with some unique LG enhancements, including

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.190
"Slide Aside" and "QSlide"

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.070
multitasking and "KnockON" which allows the
device to be turned on and off with a double-tap.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.159
There are some other

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.200
LG interface enhancements too, including QPair
which can synchronise messages and calls from

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.380
a compatible Android

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.590
smartphone.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.010
LG say that the G Pad 8.3 should be available
during Q4 2013 in black or white colours.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.490
No guidance was given on

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.130
price, our guess is that it will retail for
something in the region of â‚¬350 or more

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.700
when it hits the market.
