00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:00.737
The objective that was finally set for the Altiplano 43 mm

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.641
was to break two records at the same time:

00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:09.846
the world’s thinnest automatic watch

00:01:10.113 --> 00:01:14.083
and the world’s thinnest automatic movement.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.719
And we achieved both:

00:01:16.953 --> 00:01:21.124
the watch has a thickness of 5.25 mm

00:01:21.124 --> 00:01:24.260
and the movement has a thickness of 2.35 mm.

00:01:25.528 --> 00:01:28.364
When you announce a double record, you have to be sure that it really is one.

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:31.300
So we had to ask ourselves:

00:01:31.634 --> 00:01:33.569
how are we going to build the watch

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.572
so that it meets this objective we’ve been given?

00:01:36.672 --> 00:01:39.008
Obviously, it meant we had to work

00:01:39.675 --> 00:01:42.545
in an extremely small volume

00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:45.948
and the result is that, today, many elements in the movement

00:01:46.382 --> 00:01:49.018
are thinner than a human hair.

00:01:50.987 --> 00:01:55.525
To produce the world’s thinnest watch

00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:58.561
we had to improve all the interfaces 

00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:00.630
between the movement and the external parts.

00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:04.367
This is what makes you realize that, in a way,

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:07.804
technical requirements are part of design.

00:02:07.937 --> 00:02:11.541
Elegance is the essence of this product

00:02:11.574 --> 00:02:12.909
because of its thinness.

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.877
And the watch is very thin

00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:16.245
because the movement itself is very thin.

00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:21.884
Always trying to reduce thickness is one of the basic elements in Piaget’s DNA.

00:02:22.185 --> 00:02:25.721
Today, it’s really all about synergy

00:02:25.822 --> 00:02:28.291
between the case and the watch movement.

00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:32.295
In this project we have benefited

00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:35.631
from the knowledge and experience

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:40.436
of ultra-thinness in Piaget’s DNA.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.207
It’s all the history and expertise

00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:45.575
that have made this watch possible.
