00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.799
What's up YouTube!
You guys have been rocking the socks off my

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.080
original Walmart Family Mobile video, so I'm
doin' a follow-up!

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.090
I'm here to answer your questions because
there have been some excellent questions left

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.330
in the comments and I figured if you have
them, other people have them, but they just

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.829
aren't taking the time to leave a comment
and ask.

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:28.429
So this is me helping out the world, one video
at a time.

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.250
Right?
Or just being weird. I'm not quite sure.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.090
But anyways, I'm letting you in on a secret.
I bought my mom a phone. 
I'm trying to get

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.090
her into technology and smartphones, and away
from dumbphones.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:53.100
So I picked up this Samsung Galaxy Exhibit.
And it was under 100 bucks. I mean, you can't

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.960
really complain at that price point, right?
I was there picking up some new vlogging toys

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.039
so that you can see this face more!
The worst case scenario is that she downgrades

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:11.840
the plan to the unlimited talk and text, which
that's what she has right now, and she pays

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.679
$29.88.
And the best case scenario is that she pays

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:26.000
$39.88 and joins the world, the darkside of
smartphones and technology and having internet

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.109
and everything like that.
Hello. That's fabulous!

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:33.770
Which brings me to to your first question.
Question 1.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.770
What do they mean by unlimited data? 
What do they mean? 
You can't have unlimited data

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.729
on any other plan.
Well, they mean you get 2.5 GB of 3G speeds

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.399
and then you get 2G for the rest of the month.
Question 2.

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.399
What do I need to buy to get started?
Well, funny you should ask because when you're

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:07.689
at the store you can also pick up this starter
kit. This handy dandy starter kit is $25 and

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.290
it comes with a big SIM card or a mini SIM
card. Whichever your phone takes, it has both

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.000
and it's compatible with the iPhone 4 and 5.
Hey, look at that. Everybody seems to have an iPhone

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000
but we're not allowed Apple products in this
household unless I cry A LOT and get my way.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.220
Which happens more than he cares to admit.
Question number 3.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.220
What is a starter kit?
Well, for 25 smackeroos you get this and it

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.260
has your activation card and the SIM card
in it and you just use the numbers that I

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.620
crossed out because I already activated mine
and ya get online and connect it to your phone.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.900
Easy. Right?
Question 4.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.610
You guys had 4 questions! 
Can I port a phone number?

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.629
Yes. Yes, you can.
Which brings me to question 5.

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:13.340
What do I do with all the extra money? 
What do I do with the rest of my tax return?

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.300
The easy answer is, you can purchase accessories
like I did. Or you can just send it to me.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:28.000
I accept all sorts of donations all the time.
I'm really good at shopping. Ask my husband.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Did I answer all your burning questions? I
mean, did I. Are all the wonders of the world

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
solved now?
No? Really? I tried.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.400
Gotta give me credit for that. 
If you any questions, leave it in the comments below.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.800
I'm not going to do an entirely new video
but I will try my hardest, pinky promise,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.540
blood seal to get you the answer. 
Cool? Alright. 
Leave a comment. 
Check ya later.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.550
See ya next week, guys!
