Howdy folks, sorry that was a little bit over
excited welcome to my virgin kitchen i've

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:14.830
been asked to show you how to make caramels
so this is how you make caramels in the microwave.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.680
They look amazing right and the cool thing
about this recipe is it's really easy, but

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.060
on the flip side it's a little dangerous,
it gets a bit dangerous during one step, you'll

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.060
see in a bit.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.680
If you wanna have a go at making this hit
pause on the video now and write the ingredients

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.449
all down, scribble them down like that and
this is how you do it.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.460
Grab yourself a microwave safe bowl and add
in your white caster sugar, brown sugar, condensed

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.720
milk, golden syrup, melted butter &amp; a little
pinch of salt.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.300
Give it a good old mix together with a whisk,
wooden spoon, spatula, your utensil of choice

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.300
basically.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.920
We're gonna use a microwave ok for eight minutes
on two minute blasts so that's 4 times, my

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.130
microwave is 800 watt so if you've got a slightly
weaker microwave than that it's gonna take

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.970
you around about ten minutes but similarly
if you've got a 1000 watt microwave take it

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.480
to about 5 or 6 minutes then taking it out
and whisking it together.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.240
When you're mixing it together be careful
because it's hot and this was the dangerous

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.510
step that I was talking about towards the
end as you take it out check this out it's

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.830
like a bubbling, roaring inferno and you don't
want that on your arms so be brave like a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.000
soldier of caramel a warrior of caramel the
almighty Jesus of caramel?!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.040
Sorry about that I was getting a bit excited
there must be all the sugar i've add but anyhow

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.210
with your caramel all done you want to pour
it into a silicone tray ideally because it's

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.690
going to be nice and flexible and easier to
get out later on if you haven't got a silicone

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.680
one just use a tin and line it with some baking
parchment that's fine and what you want to

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.530
do is just leave it to cool down naturally
for a good Hour on it's own just let it sit

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.530
there.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.340
Once that has cooled down you want to plonk
that in the fridge for a good 5 Hours ideally

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.130
overnight to be honest and then once it's
ready you wanna rip back that silicone cover

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.670
on it cut into chunks with a knife then whack
it on a plate just like we're seeing here

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.840
that is looking good they're so good so yummy
so chewy.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.030
This is just a very basic version you could
do, but what you could do is before you add

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.920
that to the tray you could put some crushed
nuts on the bottom, get the caramel on top,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.090
then sit the melted chocolate on there oh
my goodness that'd be good, or just give it

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.940
a darn good extra sprinkling of salt for some
salted caramel!

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.569
