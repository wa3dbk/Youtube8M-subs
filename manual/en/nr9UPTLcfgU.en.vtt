[Music]

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:05.830
Steve: Hi.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:06.830
I’m Steve with Screenflex.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.830
Tina: Hi.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.830
I’m Tina with Screenflex.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.160
Steve: We’d like to show you a difference
between our freestanding room dividers.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.360
Tina: And our heavy duty freestanding room
dividers.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.401
Steve: Our freestanding room divider is a
sturdy, well built, dependable room divider

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:18.660
meant for everyday use.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.010
Tina: And the heavy duty freestanding room
dividers are built for a more rigorous environment

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.710
such as the hospitality industry.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.590
Steve: The first difference is in our support
legs.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.210
Our freestanding model has a self-leveling
caster system for support.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.430
Our heavy duty model has a dual wheel, extra
heavy duty self-leveling caster support system

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.970
and a reinforced extra wide support leg as
well.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.739
The other difference on our support legs is
the channel.

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.010
The heavy duty model has a deeper channel
which wraps the panel and provides additional

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.010
support.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.619
Tina: We use a full length panel hinge on
both freestanding and heavy duty room dividers,

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:07.190
but on the heavy duty room dividers we use
a panel hinge that is extra thick and extra

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.190
strong.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.820
Steve: A multi-unit connector is available
as an option for our freestanding room divider.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.330
On our heavy duty model it comes standard
and enables units to be connected together

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.490
end-to-end for continuous lengths.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.880
Tina: This heavy duty model has oversized,
extra strong corner casters.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.820
Steve: We’ve also added an additional frame
support which gives it more stability and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.110
allows us to mount our screen lock up higher
near the handle where it’s easier to reach

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.500
than it is down below on a freestanding model.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.729
In addition, there’s a gusset plate at the
bottom of the frame to give even more support.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.860
Lastly, our heavy duty model has added gusset
plates at the top corners for extra support.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.880
Thank you very much.
