00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.170
Today I wanted to talk to you guys about is
graduate school hard, and , um, yeah, just

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.960
basically is graduate school hard?

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.519
So, my personal experience and I've been in
occupational therapy school now for just a

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.150
month, um, so keep that in mind when I answer
this question, I'll try to do an update later

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.270
on, um, further into the semester about if
the difficulty has changed, um, as like time

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.430
has progressed.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.630
But at this point, I wouldn't say that any
of the concepts have been particularly difficult,

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.480
um, in terms of what I have been learning
in occupational therapy school.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.360
Now, I think part of that might just be because
of the way that my program is structured and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.960
that we're not really getting into a lot of
the interventions or in depth.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.750
We're not taking like, anatomy, physiology,
again until next semester.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.170
Um, this semester is mostly just, um, the
basic of occupational therapy, theory, history,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.940
that sort of thing, um, so part of the reason
is not- I don't feel like it's difficult content

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.410
wise is probably just because of what we are
learning.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.850
And then also, it might be, um, just because
of having the experience observing occupational

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.330
therapist out in the field.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.179
That it might be a little bit easier just
because I've witnessed that and seen that,

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:14.399
so have all my classmates because we had to
have that going into school.

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.340
So, that might be part of why occupational
therapy school, at least in terms of content

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.409
doesn't seem that difficult at this point.

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.700
The one thing that has been really frustrating,
um, or not frustrating, but just I guess a

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.829
difficult aspect of occupational therapy school
has just been the amount of time that it takes

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.719
to complete each assignment.

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:36.590
ON average, I would say at this point, we
are having 2-3 assignments due each week that

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.349
we have to turn in, um, and that will go towards
our grade.

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:44.729
And those are just, for some reason, they
take so long!!

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.090
Each assignment just takes an insane amount
of time!

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.419
UM, I would say, the easier ones take about,
like 2 hours, and they can take up to, like,

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:59.130
4, sometimes I've even spent as many as like
6 hours on a single assignment.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.229
Um, and it's not, we're not talking about
like a big project that's due, we're just

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.509
talking about a weekly assignment.

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.150
Um, now, keep in mind, I definitely work at
a slower pace than some people, um, and I

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.510
double check what I do multiple times, and
so that definitely slows me down, and then

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.799
sometimes, um, some of those assignments are
group assignments and that does seem to like

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.720
slow down the process, because everybody has
to be on board with everything, um, but it

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.799
just seems like a really really long time
for really simple assignments.

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.900
And I'm not 100% sure why that is, and I'm
curious if other people who are in different

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.519
occupational therapy programs are finding
that they're having the same experience, or

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.459
if any of you guys that are in occupational
therapy school are you having a different

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.940
experience, I would love to hear about it,
because I'm just curious if this is something

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.870
that's specific to my program or if this is
something that's consistent across occupational

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.870
therapy programs.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.239
Um, I hope you're having a great day!

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:54.430
Bye!
