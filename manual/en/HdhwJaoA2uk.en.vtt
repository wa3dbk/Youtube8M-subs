00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.509
My name Daniel McGhee; I’m from Denver,
CO.

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:26.310
I just completed the 2x2x2 class; 2 days of
interior repair, 2 days of auto detailing,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.800
and 2 days of wheel repair.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:38.640
It was a very grueling 6 days but it was very
informational and I’ll be able to take back

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.829
all kinds of knowledge that when I came out
here I didn’t know.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:51.300
I’ve done auto detailing before and pretty
much I just wanted to give it a shot to learn

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.059
more about the industry.

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.560
My trainer was Ruben Valenzuela; he’s a
very, very good trainer.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.640
He knows a lot about the industry and he’s
very fun to work with.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.229
Detailing a car from start to finish was fun.

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:15.400
There was a lot of stuff to remember.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.050
We went through different kinds of stuff,
every single type of chemical we needed to

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:31.820
use and before I came here I never used a
buffer before so here it was very hands-on.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:40.940
Wheel repair was kind of scary at first but
once you get practice with that grinder machine,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.940
it was fairly simple and easy.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:51.420
Interior repair, at first it was kind of hard
to learn all the steps but after a while once

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.860
you get use doing it, it comes fairly easy.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.140
Being trained in 3 different areas of auto
appearance means a lot to me; I can go home

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:17.700
and I can put everything I learned here at
Rightlook into action and run a successful

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.200
business.
