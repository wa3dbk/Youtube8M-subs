Hi, this is Yolanda from Vanveenbulbs dot
com. In this segment, I'm going to talk about

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:11.840
how to grow day lilies in Oregon. Now, I grew
up in a Cicada in near mount hood. So I'm

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.270
very familiar with growing flowers in Oregon.
And we live in a very mild climate. And we're

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.870
exactly halfway between the equator and the
north pole. So right at that fifty or forty

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:30.910
five latitude. Which is wonderful for plants,
because we have perfect seasons. Exactly three

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.809
months of summer, three months of winter,
and three months of fall and spring. So, we

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.620
are so lucky we can plant pretty much anything
in our garden and it will do well. Especially

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.640
daylilies. So the trick with daylilies is
planting any time of the year in Oregon, because

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.829
they can survive the winter. So it doesn't
matter if you plant them in the middle of

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.719
winter. They'll still come up and do really
well. But they're mostly sold in the spring,

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.340
either in a container growing or by the bare
root. And at that time, in the spring, plant

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.760
them in a sunny spot in your yard. So daylilies
are just a root. And they're not a true bulb,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.690
because they come as a root, and they've got
lots of greeneries. And then the blooms come

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.420
up and bloom all summer long. They're not
used as a cut flower too much because they

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.880
don't last as a cup flower. So as long as
their root is covered and the green is exposed,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.381
it'll grow. So just make sure that the root
is covered, and I like to actually kind of

00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:31.840
clump up my roots because they need to be
crowded to bloom, so it's almost better instead

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.290
of just planting one, I should just have four
together, clumped, because that will get more

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.090
blooms right away next summer. Because one
by itself probably won't get a lot of blooms

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.430
the first year. But they do multiply quickly,
and over the years you'll get so many more.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.530
Make sure and keep them in a sunny spot, and
raise beds or somewhere where they're going

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.050
to get good drainage. They don't want to sit
in muck all winter long. And make sure that

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.640
you use good composted soil, and you don't
really need a lot of fertilizer. I've never

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.870
fertilized mine, and they've come back for
years and years. Divide them out when they

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.620
get crowded, any time they're not blooming,
especially in the fall or the winter, and

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.059
plant them right back again, and they'll do
so well for you.
