Hi, this is Ginny with Simply Beautiful Crafts
on behalf of Expert Village and we're going

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:13.139
to make party hats. AARGH and welcome to Pirate's
Cove maties. We are going to make a very simple

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.109
pirate hat out of a newspaper. You're going
to want three sheets of newspaper, you can

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.080
use two but three sheets gives you more sturdy
hat, that's all two sided all the way, no

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.619
half sheets. Lay it out in front of you sideways
with your fold at the front and you're going

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:41.910
to find the middle and then fold it down to
the middle. Not quite centered up and down

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.660
again leaving a little bit of space at the
top so that it's even and then you're simply

00:00:48.660 --> 00:01:01.530
going to take the first three sheets, one,
two, and three, and fold them up

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:15.600
and crease it. Turn it over. Fold up the next
three sheets and then fasten it. I put mine

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.930
on my head and then stapled it right at the
sides of my head so that it would stay on

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:31.520
my head and fit. You can do that with your
hat too. Now you have your base for your pirate

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:41.990
hat. What I did with mine was to use black
construction paper to cover the front of it

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.030
but you could also use black tempera paint
and I stuck it down in the hat band. And then

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.920
I make a skull and cross bones and glued it
on. If you're going to make a skull and cross

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:04.840
bones, basically you're want to make kind
of light bulb shape. You put the two circles

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:13.260
for the eyes. You're going to have your teeth,
come down again kind of to a point and have

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:25.950
teeth and your nose. Make them black, make
your bones.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:37.370
Cut them out, glue them on and viola, you
have a pirateâ€™s hat. Pretty simple, huh??
