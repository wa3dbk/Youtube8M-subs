00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.790
Hi, I'm Glenn May with BassResource.com.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.390
With me today is Edwin Evers.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.029
Edwin, it's great to have you with us.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.029
Edwin Evers: Thank you for having me.

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.000
Glenn: Edwin, when you start preparing for
a tournament, how far in advance do you start

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.510
doing that, and what are some of the things
you're looking for?

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.700
Edwin: I want to just familiarize myself with
it as much as possible.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.960
So, I'm going to spend some time on the computer,
basically looking at aerial photos, seeing

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.950
how big a body of water it is.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.480
Just having my tackle on my boat, just the
general things you do for every tournament.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.829
It depends on what tournament it is.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.930
If it's a body of water that I'm very comfortable
with, Rayburn, Toledo Bend, something like

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:38.930
that, not so much.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.360
You go to a body of water that I've never
been to before, like say the St. John's River,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.030
or something like here at the Classic that's
so big and vast, you do quite a bit more preparation

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.030
for it.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.700
Glenn: And what are some of the things you
do to prep for a tournament?

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.129
Edwin: Like I said, just try to learn what
I can off that computer--aerial photos, like

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.129
here at the Classic.

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.220
I flew over this body of water in a small
airplane to just and see as much of it as

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.560
I could from the air, the water colors, those
kinds of things.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.450
Glenn: And once you're on that body of water
what are some of the first things you do?

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.501
Do you motor around a lot, just looking at
your graph, or do you just start fishing the

00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:17.890
areas to see what's there?

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.470
What are some of the things you do to start
taking apart that body of water?

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.490
Edwin: I usually try to pick three distinct
areas, spend three days fishing in those different

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.030
areas and try to dissect them.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.560
Glenn: And are you more comfortable fishing
deep, or shallow?

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.890
Edwin: I've always kind of just really prided
myself on being very versatile, you know,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.110
winning a tournament on area drop shot in
42 feet of water, and then going and winning

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.840
a tournament down here at Atchafalaya Basin
a year and a half ago flipping two foot of

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.840
water.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.860
So, I'm comfortable.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.900
I just like to catch them.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.700
I don't care if it's on 6-pound test or 65-pound
braid.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.880
I like to catch them.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.970
Glenn: Okay.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.510
In all these years you've been working to
become a much better angler, have you learned

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.280
any lessons that you've been able to apply
to your life outside of fishing?

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.130
Edwin: Yeah, that's a good question.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.220
Just being open minded.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.400
Early on in my career you had so many people
just trying to, "Hey, you need to fish here,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.400
fish there."

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:22.799
I've become more reliant on myself and trusting
my own instincts and God-given abilities versus

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.379
getting all that extra help out there.

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.620
Glenn: So, it's more about just going with
your gut?

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.989
Edwin: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:30.989
Glenn: Okay.

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.180
And when you first became a pro, what was
one of the most surprising things to you that

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.090
maybe you weren't expecting?

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.610
Edwin: Just the travel--how much you're actually
gone, being away from home.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.610
It's pretty grueling.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.870
Glenn: You're out like 10, 11 months of the
year, right?

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.199
Edwin: It seems like it--not quite.

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:50.949
But is seems like it.

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:55.200
Glenn: And how does that work for friends
and family back home.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.849
How do you stay in touch with them?

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.799
Edwin: We don't go more than two weeks without
seeing my wife and my children.

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.249
They'll fly in, or I'll fly home; one way
or the other.

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:07.959
A lot of times that means they're flying into
a venue or tournament, but we just stay in

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.620
touch over the phone, face time on the new
cell phones, and make the most of the time

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.639
when we're together.

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.370
Glenn: And what's the best part of being a
professional angler?

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.159
Edwin: I just love seeing that sunrise every
morning.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.569
It's one of the coolest things ever.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.829
The things that you see out there, wherever
it may be, just being out there seeing nature

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.220
and all the different things, you know.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.709
You wish you could capture a lot of those
sights in some sort of book of pictures.

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.239
It would be worth a million.

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.859
Glenn: Now, for somebody who's just starting
out and wants to become a pro angler, what

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.209
kind of advice would you give him as he seeks
to pursue that career?

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.169
Edwin: Right off the bat, get your college
education.

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:49.650
One, you've got to have one.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.239
The sponsors are looking for that on a resume,
and it's something to fall back on.

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.860
It's just very important.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.869
Get that college degree, whatever it may be.

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:03.019
Two, do it on your own.

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.799
You're not going to become a better angler
doing something somebody else tells you to

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:08.799
do.

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:09.799
Go out there and learn it on your own.

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.909
Go out there and spend time on the water.

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.540
I just can't stress that enough.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.579
The more time on the water, the better you're
going to be.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:24.530
And another is, if you can go and become a
co-angler, like in the Bass Opens or become

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.650
a marshal in the Elites, the amount of information
you can learn sitting behind Kevin VanDam,

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.900
or Rick Clunn, or one of those guys in an
8-hour day is just tremendous.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.820
Don't go out there with that attitude that
I got to beat them that day.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.990
Just go out there with the attitude of I'm
going to learn everything I can from that

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.020
particular angler that you've drawn out with.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.930
And your learning curve is just much more
steep.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.569
Glenn: It's so competitive right now.

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.419
A lot of guys really want to make it pro,
and there are so many tournaments out there.

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.800
It's actually kind of hard to win one nowadays.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.850
How would someone know at what point they're
ready to move up to the next level?

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.490
Edwin: That's a great thing about BASS.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.580
You've got the weekend series, then you've
got the Opens, then you've got the Elites.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.190
If you're successful in one, there's another
right there above it that you can go try it

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.190
in.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.419
I've always said, some of the best anglers
are the ones that you fish against locally,

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.599
on whatever given body of water it may be--Rayburn,
Toledo Bend, Texoma.

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:23.460
If you can beat those guys every day, day
in and day out, you can take it to the next

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.460
step.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.250
Glenn: So, it's not necessarily how many tournaments
you've won?

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.430
Edwin: No, no set number on it at all.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.099
Glenn: It's more or less how confident you
are to move up to the next level?

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.099
Edwin: Exactly.

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.520
Glenn: You've been a pro for a long time now.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.139
When you first started off you may have done
things a little bit differently than how you

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.139
do today.

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:43.139
How have you changed?

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.580
Have you changed professionally or personally?

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.620
Edwin: One, I've just become more versatile.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.509
Early on in my career I was just very one
dimensional--a shallow water fisherman.

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.639
I didn't like being around a lot of crowds,
you know.

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:04.970
It's one of those things you've got to become
more comfortable being around people.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:11.220
Glenn: One of the things I want to do right
now is called the Shameless Plug Moment.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.530
And that is, you can talk about your sponsors,
anyway you want to, or if you want to say

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.860
something to your family or friends, or to
your fans out there.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.419
What would you like to say?

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:24.169
Edwin: I'm just very blessed and thankful
to have the sponsors, the family, all those

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:25.169
people behind me.

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.189
Because without any one of them I couldn't
be where I am today.

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:31.159
I'm just thankful from top to bottom.

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:32.159
Glenn: Fantastic.

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:34.780
Well, there you have it ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Edwin Evers.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.759
I'm Glenn May with BassResource.com.
