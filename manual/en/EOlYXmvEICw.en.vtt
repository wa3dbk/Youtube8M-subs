00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.820
Now Dan has his gloves on, he's got his boots on...
My favorite part of going to schools

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.009
I'd have to say would be

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.730
seeing the kids faces light up.
I'm a firefighter, my name is Mark

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.500
I'm with Central Pierce Fire and Rescue...
It's very important, I think, for the school

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.059
districts and the fire department to work together.

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.949
Getting them when their first learning
about these things and first starting

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.119
school, I think is great.
They turn on the siren...

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.519
and if anybody's sick, if they're really really sick
they have some medicine and they'll take them to the hospital...

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.650
And they put out fires...and that's all they do.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.989
If your clothes catch on fire, if you run

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.420
the fire's going to get bigger, so are we
gonna run? No!

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.730
No. What are we gonna do? We're going to...
Stop drop and roll

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.000
Stop, drop and roll.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If you have some fire on your clothes you can just do that.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.170
First you stop, then drop, then roll around the floor.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.949
OK, fire's out, good job!

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.000
He put his suit on...
It can be scary for kids if we're

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.019
coming into their house in all this gear

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.110
and all kinds of stuff and loud noises

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.909
and sounds especially if it's at nighttime.
Can everybody hear that?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.630
So we want them to understand that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.960
it's just us, Johnny Joe
firefighter coming in

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.600
and not some big scary monster in
the middle of the night.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.799
I would describe him as, like it's Halloween

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.000
but he's dressed up as a firefighter.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.590
This is a chainsaw. We' ll use a chainsaw maybe for, cutting into a wall

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.619
I'm thankful that you know we're able to
do this for our schools

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.700
and our schools actually invite us in

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.820
and give these presentations.It's one of
those things, it's nice to have that kind of

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.259
relationship with your schools.

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.509
So what number do we call in case of emergencies? 911!

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.979
And that was the very coolest thing I ever did.
