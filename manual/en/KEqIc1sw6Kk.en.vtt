00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.279
Hey everybody, yesterday I posted a video
where George Pig and Peppa Pig found the biggest

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.990
Shopkin they ever seen, It was so big it broke
the conveyor belt at the checkout stand.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.270
So today I am going to show you how to make
that Shopkin,and we are using everybody's

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.720
favorite molding compound Pay-Doh.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.600
The Shopkins that we used is called Licorice.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.270
It's from the sweet treats team.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.710
To make this Shopkin we are going to need
black Play-Doh, green Play-Doh, Pink Play-Doh

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.580
and Yellow Play-Doh Plus.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.030
And to make the top yellow part of the Shopkins
we are going to use the frosting decorator.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.780
And don't forget to use your safe pink plastic
Play-Doh knife and a rolling pin.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.100
We're going to make three different layers
of Play-Doh.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.940
The first layer is green, take some green
Play-Doh, put it in a ball then mash it down.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:01:04.350
Then mold the side and form a square shape.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.290
And by the end you should have a nice flat
square, like this.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.460
Now lets make the feet take a small ball of
green Play-Doh now flatten it down and lengthen

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.170
it.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:28.130
Then cute between one end to form the feet.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:38.220
Now attach it to the bottom of the green square.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.170
We're now going to make the black layer, to
do this we use sparkly black Play-Doh.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:53.320
Form the black layer into a square just like
we formed the green square.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.240
Place the black square on top of the green
square and then mold the sides to have them

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:06.649
match each other.

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.569
Now we are ready for the pink Play-Doh.

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.439
The pink Play-Doh will be formed in the same
way as the black and the green Play-Doh to

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.019
make the square.

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:30.670
This time we are going to use a rolling pin
to show you how to flatten it.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.620
Place the pink square on top of the black
and green squares.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.400
now it looks a little bit taller so we are
not only going to have to mash it down but

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:54.909
also mash the sides.

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:00.120
Alright we are almost there we just have to
add the eyes the mouth and the tongue.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.760
To form the eyes take a very small piece of
black Play-Doh and then roll it out into a

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.560
small line.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.050
Cut this into several pieces which we will
use for the eyes the eyelashes and the mouth.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.219
This licorice Shopkin is sleeping so I am
adding the eyes to put them in a U shape.

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:26.930
Which make them look like their eyes are closed.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.049
This may take a while but just use very small
pieces of black Play-Doh to make the eyelashes

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.370
the eyes and then the mouth, and then use
a very small piece of pink Play-Doh for the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.370
tongue.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.669
Now we are going to use Play-Doh Plus which
is the softest sweetest smelling Play-Doh.

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:52.299
Insert the Play-Doh into the frosting decorator.

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.849
Now a little on the top but not to much.

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:01.760
Makes for a nice bloop of frosting.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.479
And we're done.

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:09.829
The Shopkins looks so realistic that I almost
confused it with the real one.

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.239
