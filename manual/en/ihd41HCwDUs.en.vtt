catcher) found perfect time to took the dog.
This is an aggressive dog? Why did they took

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.380

have too much money).

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:10.100
They (ASPA) should call you to give him back. No way. Does he has microchip? No, I didn't know (it is not yet a legal obligation
 to have a microchip)

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:29.340

was a hybrid dog (adopted). I reacted against them of course.
