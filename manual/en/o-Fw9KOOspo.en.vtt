-Banana-nana-nana-nana-nana-nana-nana-nanas!

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:05.881
Bananas! [laughs]

00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:08.243
[both scoff] -Oh, my God. -Oh, my God.

00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:09.868
-Bananas!

00:00:09.868 --> 00:00:11.470
-What is it now, Orange?

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.471
-Hey, have you guys seen my new pet?

00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:14.680
-You've got a pet?

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.913
-His name is Spot. I think he's lost.

00:00:16.913 --> 00:00:18.460
-This isn't some sort of joke, is it,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.062
'cause we're not fallin' for it.

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:22.778
-No, for real. I'm not "monkeying" around.

00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:24.868
[laughs, bananas groan]

00:00:24.868 --> 00:00:27.277
[buzzing sound] -Hey, what's that noise?

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.187
-Yay, there he is!

00:00:29.187 --> 00:00:30.823
Hey Spot, how's it goin'?

00:00:30.823 --> 00:00:32.857
[both scream]

00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:36.994
-Crikes! -Ah! Get it away!

00:00:36.994 --> 00:00:38.204
-It's buzzing me! -OMG!

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.622
-Go away, stupid fruit fly! -No!

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:42.191
-[laughs] Come on, guys. He's just playing.

00:00:42.191 --> 00:00:44.064
-No, dude! It's on you! -It's biting me!

00:00:44.064 --> 00:00:44.795
-Whoa!

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:46.509
-(both) Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:48.491
-[laughs] Stupid bananas.

00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:49.807
They think Spot's a shoe.

00:00:49.807 --> 00:00:51.804
-Uh, Orange?

00:00:51.804 --> 00:00:53.985
It's great that you made a new friend and all, but...

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:55.222
-Are you totally nuts?

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:57.979
-[laughs] I'm not nuts, I'm an orange.

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.601
And Spot's not just a friend, he's my new best friend.

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:03.814
-Wha-- Orange, he's a fruit fly, for crying out loud.

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:05.816
What would you say if Midget Apple had a--

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:08.382
I don't know-- a fruit spider?

00:01:08.382 --> 00:01:09.915
-I didn't know you had a fruit spider.

00:01:09.915 --> 00:01:11.358
He and Spot should have a play date.

00:01:11.358 --> 00:01:12.676
Let's schedule something for after dinner.

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:14.420
-There's no such thing as a fruit spider!

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.992
[banana groans in pain]

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:18.341
-Ah! Make him stop! Oh, please!

00:01:18.341 --> 00:01:20.812
-Wow, they sure do grow up fast, don't they?

00:01:20.812 --> 00:01:22.790
-Dude, he's eating our friends!

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.914
-Nah, you're just jealous I have a new "wing" man. [laughs]

00:01:25.914 --> 00:01:27.212
-Orange! Do something!

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:29.953
-Fine. Hey, hey Spot! Let's show 'em a trick.

00:01:29.953 --> 00:01:30.632
-Huh?

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.216
-Roll over, boy! Roll over!

00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:33.900
Come on, boy. Roll over!

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.433
-He's not going to roll over, Orange.

00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:36.920
-Roll... over!

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.219
Roll over now!

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:39.535
Roll over, boy!

00:01:39.535 --> 00:01:40.989
[banana screams]

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:42.028
-Ugh!

00:01:42.028 --> 00:01:44.210
-Do you see now? Do you get it, Orange?

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.114
-Ooh, I know! This one always works.

00:01:46.114 --> 00:01:47.090
Hey, hey Spot!

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.879
-Huh?

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:49.900
-Motorboat! [fluttering lips]

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.105
[Spot joins in]

00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:54.489
-Orange, stop! Stop, don't encourage him!

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.254
[both fluttering lips]

00:01:56.254 --> 00:01:57.700
-Oh no! Head's up!

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.721
-Ah! No! Get it away!

00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:02.694
[Pear and Midget Apple yelling]

00:02:02.694 --> 00:02:04.504
-[laughs] Come on, guys.

00:02:04.504 --> 00:02:06.268
You know you catch more flies with honey.

00:02:06.268 --> 00:02:08.294
-[sultry voice]: Oh, yeah.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.820
Honey Bear knows what you like.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.662
Mm-mm-mm! Works every time.

00:02:14.662 --> 00:02:17.431
[yelling]

00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:18.901
-Aw, look at Spot.

00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:20.991
Isn't that "sweet"? [laughs]

00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:24.103
-Orange, you can't keep him! He's a wild insect!

00:02:24.103 --> 00:02:25.867
-And he eats fruit!

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:28.691
-Nah, he just needs a "little" discipline. [laughs]

00:02:28.691 --> 00:02:29.692
-[yells]

00:02:29.692 --> 00:02:31.318
-Ow! -Whoa!

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:32.183
-Get him off me!

00:02:32.183 --> 00:02:33.205
-Get away!

00:02:33.205 --> 00:02:34.180
-Ah, don't worry, Pear.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.502
His bug is worse than his bite. [laughs]

00:02:36.502 --> 00:02:39.732
-Get him off me! [both yelling] Ow! Ow!

00:02:39.732 --> 00:02:42.260
-Hey! Hey, Pear! Hey, Pear, hey!

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.467
-Get him off me!

00:02:43.467 --> 00:02:45.046
-Pear! Hey, Pear!

00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:46.765
-What?! What is it?

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:47.987
-Fruit spider!

00:02:47.987 --> 00:02:50.550
[Pear and Midget Apple screaming]

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.010
Whoa!

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.932
-Wah! Whoa!

00:02:54.932 --> 00:02:56.926
-[disappointed groan] Stupid fruit spider.

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:58.344
What a buzz kill.

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:00.660
-Whoa, Pear, are you okay?

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.723
-Yeah, I think so.

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:03.933
That spider just came out of nowhere.

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:06.618
-Yeah, maybe his owner should've had him on a leash.

00:03:06.618 --> 00:03:09.147
Geez, some people just shouldn't have pets.

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:10.149
-[growls in frustration]

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:12.516
-[groans] You might be right, Orange, but either way,

00:03:12.516 --> 00:03:14.527
I'm sorry things didn't work out with Fruit Fly.

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.000
-Yeah, me too.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.507
But then again, Spot always was the runt of the litter.

00:03:18.507 --> 00:03:20.950
-Uhh... did you just say "litter"?

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.616
-[screaming, flies buzzing]

00:03:23.616 --> 00:03:27.842
