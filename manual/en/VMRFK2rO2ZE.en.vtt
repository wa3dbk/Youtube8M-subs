00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.080
Bernie Sanders all the sudden

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.460
thinking of entering the race in 2016 now you're thinking come on man

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.900
really if you're asking why I'm asking
why not

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.359
like what are we supposed to just sit down it's predestined

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.660
it's predetermined Hillary Clinton who is
about as right-wing as you can get

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.070
in the democratic party well we
have to accept her

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.330
she's out right now making millions of
dollars

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.279
from the top Wall Street banks for
speaking appearances

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.130
okay here's a person who stands an excellent chance at becoming president the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.980
United States

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.969
and they just happen to be giving her
millions of dollars right now when she

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:39.719
can accept it

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.190
and put into our personal account but
we're supposed to accept that

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.559
we're not supposed to do a progressive 
challenge to Hillary Clinton and they

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:48.239
tell us

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.239
cause you can't mount a progressive
challenge Hillary Clinton

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.110
and win hmmm how can they say that with a straight face

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.090
the degree to which they lie is
immeasurable it's as if we didn't live

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.020
through 2007 and 2008

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.710
we already had a progressive challenge to Hillary Clinton, now turns out the guy was lying

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.900
and he wasn't a progressive

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.000
but it's clearly showed that if you

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.270
mount a progressive challenge to Hillary Clinton you can win

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.159
so Bernie Sanders is basically saying
well look no one else is going to do it

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.110
and right now no one else has said
anything about it well that I'm gonna

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.030
step up

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.270
he says look some guys have wanted to
be president since they were 12

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.619
I have no such desire and I don't he's
like this is it's a major pain in the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.540
ass I know every politician says that

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.970
but with Bernie who lives up in Vermont
and you just try to get some sanity back

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.640
in our government

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.710
I actually believe it right but he says if
nobody else gonna do then

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.399
hell yeah I'm gonna do it, here you let
me give you specific quote that he told

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.170
the Free Press

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.280
or the Free Press reports Sanders 
says he's one to consider making a run

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.670
if no one else with progressive views
similar to his

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.790
end up taking the plunge okay now look

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.770
if you ask me here are the guys who should run okay I think Bernie Sanders should

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.290
run

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.880
I think Alan Grayson should run I think
Elizabeth Warren should run

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.129
I think they should all run they're all the
Democratic party

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.590
there's no reason why they shouldn't run
there's no reason why they should just

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.349
give it to Hillary Clinton

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.040
she's not royalty that's not how it
works here you actually have to go through

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.790
elections

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.910
and if people howl and say oh my god Bernie Sanders is too Liberal

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.970
he calls himself a Socialist wouldn't 
it be great if someone

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.060
who's called Socialist was

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.620
actually Socialist instead of a guy
pretending to bring you change

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.019
who's actually a right-winger so look if
it turns out by Bernie Sanders and Alan

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:38.709
Grayson's

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.950
who by the way Alan Grayson has an 
excellent record of accomplishment

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.190
in congress he's actually gotten things
through he's in fact gotten bipartisan

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.480
bills passed more than

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.090
anyone else why he goes and finds places
that he can work with right-wingers on

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.120
that actually holds our government
accountable

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.720
the progressives love the bills real
conservatives love the bills

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.730
the establishment hates the bills you were run populist campaign

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.959
any of those three and you'd make a real 
run at Hillary Clinton

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.250
and certainly a couple them could beat
her so

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.980
why not give it a shot now to give you a
sense what Bernie Sanders is going for

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.360
well what would be the things that he
cares but he says he would go after Wall

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.879
Street

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.569
focus on poverty in the collapse in the
middle class address global warming

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.670
and oppose cuts to Social Security and
Medicare you may look at that list and

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.159
say are you know poverty

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.459
I don't know if that's going to work in American first of all whose the last person who

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.909
ran for president who actually

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.930
said anything about poverty you don't
know cuz nobodies even tried

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.230
Mitt Romney can you imagine Mitt Romney talking about poverty

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.390
and what did President Obama say about
poverty in 2012

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.060
nothing nothing so maybe we ought to try to see how it turns out

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.129
and even if you say oh that's too
liberal the rest the list

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.500
is exactly what people want

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.879
there's nothing more popular in the polling then

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.470
preserving Social Security and Medicare
without any cuts literally the number

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.680
one most popular poll

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.080
okay results going after Wall Street

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.200
people who love that you run a real
populist

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.900
a real progressive campaign and I
guarantee you could beat Hillary Clinton

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.639
I don't know if it's Bernie Sanders I don't
know it it's one of the other two or if it's someone we

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.040
haven't put on a list yet but can Hillary Clinton be beat

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.380
absolutely is somebody gonna
beat her from the right

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.990
in the Democratic primaries of course
not is somebody coming

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.250
gonna come in without lukewarm moderate positions and beat her

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.190
of course not but for real progressive
runs can they beat her

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.759
definitely so run Bernie run
