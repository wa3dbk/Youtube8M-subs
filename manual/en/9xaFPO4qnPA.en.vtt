00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.140
Burning of magnesium in air

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:24.140
It is important to understand the difference
between physical and chemical changes. A physical

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.369
change does not produce a new substance and
it can mean a change in the size, shape or

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.840
in the state of matter of a substance. A chemical
change produces a new substance and it can

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.840
mean a change in colour or odour, the appearance
of bubbles, and release of energy or formation

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.730
of a precipitate.
Some examples of Chemical changes are the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.730
burning of wood, dissolving salt in water,
mixing acids and bases and digesting food

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.649
.
Examples of Physical Changes are crumpling

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:10.649
a sheet of paper, melting an ice cube, casting
silver in a mould and breaking a bottle.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.310
Our aim here is to carry out the reaction
of ‘Burning Magnesium in air’ and classifying

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.450
it as a physical or chemical change.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.549
Materials Required:

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:35.549
Magnesium ribbon, Red Litmus Paper, a pair
of tongs, Bunsen burner.

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.170
Procedure:

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.020
Cut a piece of Magnesium ribbon and hold it
using a pair of tongs.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.189
Flame this ribbon in the Bunsen burner, collect
the burnt ash in a watch glass and label it

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.409
as magnesium oxide.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.700
This is a chemical reaction as oxygen and
magnesium come together to form magnesium

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.759
oxide.
i.e., 2 Mg(s ) + O2(g ) --&gt; 2 MgO(s )

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.849
Now take red litmus paper and moisten it with
distilled water.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:17.849
Place the moist red litmus paper over the
watch glass so that it is in contact with

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.040
magnesium oxide.
You can see that the red litmus turns blue.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.959
From this, we can infer that magnesium oxide
is basic in nature.

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.959
This reaction shows a chemical change as the
reactants, oxygen and magnesium combine together

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:44.319
to form a new substance i.e. magnesium oxide.
The formed magnesium oxide has different chemical

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.599
composition which is different from both magnesium
and oxygen.

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.150
Precautions:

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:02.150
Make sure you hold the magnesium ribbon securely
with a pair of tongs while burning it.

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:11.109
It is better to use sunglasses to protect
eyes from the bright white light produced

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:18.090
by burning magnesium because it contains ultraviolet
light that can permanently damage the retina

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.090
of the eyes.
