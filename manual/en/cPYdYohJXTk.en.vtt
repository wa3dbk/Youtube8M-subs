Hi this is Aaron Hale at Fitness for Life
here in Wilmington, North Carolina here to

00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:10.990
talk to you a little bit about how to lose
weight using an exercise bike. Well it is

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:18.320
very very simple really. Most exercise bikes
you can find them in just about any gym. There

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.460
are some really really great exercise bikes
out there and you have several different little

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.770
displays. Some of the really good ones have
a lot of preset programs in which they have

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:41.329
them listed from beginner to intermediate
to advanced levels. Know your fitness level

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.969
and choose a preprogram in that fitness level
that you fall into. Try not to push yourself

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.019
too hard but at the same time challenge yourself
occasionally as well. If you just want to

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:01.920
do some endurance training, you can set a
work resistance level and also just try to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.250
keep an eye on your RPM's. It is probably
the best indicator, your RPM and your speed,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.840
are probably the best indicators of how much
work you are really putting out on a consistent

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.759
basis. If you are working in a work resistance
of let's just say five and you feel like you

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.110
are a fairly healthy individual, try to keep
your RPM's at 70 and just try to maintain

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:35.030
that little distance, try to go plus or minus
5 in that range and just try to keep that

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.800
over a long period of time if you are just
doing some endurance stuff. But if you are

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.329
just trying to lose some weight and you want
to maintain a nice schedule or you are consistent

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.000
and you are working four to five days a week,
maybe even six if we can, a minimum of 45

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.900
minutes a day, we'd love to get 60 minutes
a day riding the bike. The beautiful thing

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:03.780
about the bike is that your head is staying
very stationary so if you like to read or

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.479
something like that and you would like to
be able to keep up with your reading or whatever

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.540
it is, you just want to read a magazine or
watch the ball game you can do that and it

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.319
not be too nauseating. Sometimes trying to
do it on a treadmill, number 1 is dangerous

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.030
and number 2 it is just extraordinarily difficult
so that is the one advantage to riding the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.310
stationary bike is that you can find ways
especially if you don't like to do cardiovascular

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.780
work it is away to help keep your mind off
the work that you are doing and on to other

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.230
things that have your interest a little bit
more. It is also a great way to lose weight.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.940
Consistency is the major player here. If we
are only doing two or three days a week and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.150
you are only getting in 30 minute sessions
you are probably not going to see too many

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.680
changes. If you can do about five or six days
a week 45 minutes, love to get in 60 minutes

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.610
a day you can keep that sort of schedule and
guarantee you'll lose the weight. That's the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.500
word from me here at Fitness for Life, Aaron
Hale. Thank you for joining us.
