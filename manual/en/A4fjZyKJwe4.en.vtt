00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:07.559
Hi! I'm Rachel for Expert Village. Now after
half an hour, you are going to see that the

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:14.990
dough rose but we are not ready to put our
filling in yet. We need to work with it a

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:23.840
little bit more. As you can see, I am going
to put my finger in so we can see how nice

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:49.879
it rose. So what we are going to do is roll
it; all these bubbles coming out and

00:00:49.879 --> 00:01:15.130
after we use the rolling pin, we are going
to fold it up into three; the middle, stuck

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:29.170
a little bit but that's okay and now we are
going to take this side and fold it to the

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:46.490
middle and now we are going to take this side
and fold it to the middle and take last side

00:01:46.490 --> 00:02:01.210
and fold it on top. After we did this, we
need to let it rise again for half an hour.
