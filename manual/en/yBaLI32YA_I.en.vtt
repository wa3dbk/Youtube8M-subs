&gt;&gt;Kimber Liebhauser: Welcome to Lake Havasu
Field Office. Come enjoy America's great outdoors

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.740

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.740
&gt;&gt;Jayson Barangan: So Havasu is a total beach
town in the middle of the desert, which presents

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.869
a great variety of unique recreation opportunities.
So if you are into kayaking, or stand-up paddle

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.850
board, or if you are a boating enthusiast,
this is the perfect playground for that.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.000
To further enhance the recreation experience
for the public, BLM manages and maintains

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
87 campsites along the Havasu shoreline, which
are only accessible by boat.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.850
Downriver, we also manage a handful of day use areas and a couple more campgrounds.

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:07.429
In addition, we provide oversight for a dozen concession resort properties.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.530
Recreation is the name of the game for the Lake Havasu Field Office!

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.890

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.890
&gt;&gt;Jen House: Not only is Lake Havasu known
for its aquatic recreation, but it's also

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.780
known for a variety of land-based recreation.
Currently, the Lake Havasu Field Office is

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.190
finalizing the Havasu Travel Management Plan
which surrounds Lake Havasu City. This plan

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.420
will designate more than 800 miles of trails,
routes, and primitive roads for both motorized

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.510
and non-motorized activities. This will include
trails for hiking, mountain biking, ATVs,

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.510
4-wheel drive, and rock crawling activities.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.750
The Havasu Travel Management Plan can be viewedas a success because of the extensive community input.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.650
By working with our partners and community groups, we are managing to ensure a wide variety of recreational experiences.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.650

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.320
&gt;&gt;Amanda Deeds: The Lake Havasu Field Office
processes and permits between 20 and 25 Special Recreation Permits each year.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.970
Our largest event is the Parker 425. This is a high octane speed event that draws tens of thousands of people to the Parker, Arizona area each year.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.970
The event boosts the local economy and marks
the beginning of the desert racing season.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.180
The goal of Lake Havasu's Special Recreation
Program is to provide the best customer service

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.310
possible while ensuring permit compliance,
resource protection, and diversity of recreational opportunities.

enjoy on your public lands!
