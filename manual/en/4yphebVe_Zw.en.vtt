00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:06.200
Hello pilots!

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.533
An enemy starts a head-on attack.

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:12.133
Tensions are building, but an enemy aircraft blasts past.

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:14.600
Time to turn as quickly as possible!

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.700
What is the best way to do it?

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.300
To change your course as quickly as possible, use a Combat Turn.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.100
This aerial manoeuvre combines a 180 degree turn with a gain in altitude.

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:41.600
It’s quite simple.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.533
Roll your aircraft 45 to 50 degrees, using the ailerons and rudder.

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:47.933
Then, pitch up!

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.433
With some experience, you will feel the right angle for every particular situation.

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:59.267
In aircraft with high climb rates, the Combat Turn is quicker and requires a larger bank angle.

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:02.400
Such aircraft have no problems gaining altitude.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.700
Highly manoeuvrable aircraft will find this more difficult,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.367
so use a smaller bank angle.

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:12.800
Move your mouse in the direction you wish to turn, pitching up a bit.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.933
After completing the manoeuvre you’ll lose some speed, gaining height instead.

00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:20.067
Returning to your initial speed will take time.

00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:25.033
When performing a Combat Turn, you can use extend flaps and boost.

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:30.100
Extending flaps makes you turn quicker, but they slow your aircraft down significantly.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.767
Using boost lets you stay within its optimal speed.

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:39.600
The Combat Turn is frequently used to catch up with an enemy, or to attack ground targets.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.333
This is all.

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:44.067
Try it, learn and win!

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.600
See you in the next episode of the Flight School.
