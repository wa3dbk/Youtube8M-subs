Hello and welcome to down to earth.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.170
You'll see our guest horticulturalist Oggie
is back with us today.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.060
Our question this week is from Gail, who has
a fruit tree, a peach tree but she would like

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.140
to know if she can prune right now.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.119
Normally you would not prune any fruit trees
right now, or any other tree really very much

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.590
as well, but fruit trees especially because
you are pruning out some of the buds for next

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.690
year but more importantly you pruning out
some of the growth if you prune it up improperly

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.420
your encouraging it to grow, so you don't
want to do that.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.489
This particular tree has very heavy limbs
and it does need a lot of correcting.

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.039
You'll notice that it is growing a lot on
one side, has a bunch of branches down on

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.110
the ground.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.640
So gale does need to go out and balance the
tree, kind of bring it back into balance.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.609
So what you need to do if you are going to
prune this time of year is remove all of those

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.130
limbs that are a hazard, the ones that are
on the ground are a tripping hazard so you

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.980
do need to prune those all the way back to
the source, all the way back to the branch

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.990
that they came from or the main trunk.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.230
When you do that you don't encourage the tree
to branch any further, breaking buds if you

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.510
cut all the way back to the source so that's
the proper way to prune this time of year.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.510
Our plant this week is Cedar Sage, Salvia
roemeriana.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.640
This is a perennial salvia, its native to
the Edwards plateau, under Ashe Juniper trees.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.060
So it does grow very well for us in the shade.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.700
It gets 1 to 2 feet tall and then would have
a 1 foot flower stock.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.240
It does great in the shade as I said and it
does need very well drained soil since its

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.380
native to that rocky plateau.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.170
You don't want to overwater this plant especially
if you have it in a little bit of a heavy

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.880
soil, it has beautiful heart shaped hairy
leaves unlike some of our salvias that have

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.940
smaller leaves.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.080
It has gorgeous tubular crimson flowers and
it does flower all summer long from early

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.170
spring through late summer.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.570
As I said it's a perennial so it dies to the
ground in the winter, and its hearty to zero

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.820
degrees.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.150
Some of these last winter we may have lost
because we got down so much colder than that.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.920
It does establish very quickly, filling in
beds by reseeding prolifically.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.890
As I said its native under Ashe Juniper trees,
which is where it gets its name Cedar Sage

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.870
because we commonly call junipers "cedar"
around here.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.690
TO do in your garden this week its still time
to plant some cool season vegetables ad herbs,

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.200
such as carrots and radishes and lettuces
and spinach even lemon balm, cilantro and

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.260
chamomile, those are some great herbs for
us to grown now that its cool season.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.670
We'd love to hear from you!

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.060
