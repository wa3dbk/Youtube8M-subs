this s_l_ transported by square space

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.280
crazy market out recently did a stand-up
on died june third

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.480
and it turns out that one of the people
who watched and was attended by the name

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.750
of kevin rogers

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.090
and kevin rogers avraham based scheming
face book note about tracy morgan's

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.220
performance because apparently

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.349
tracy morgan went on this homophobic
grant

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.819
now in this interesting story because
out we don't have video on a cocaine all

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:35.030
we have is what uh... kevin rogers is
saying about the stand-up

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.049
and al so what what uh... trees more as
a technology

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:43.389
him right here tonight and he is
acknowledging it out tracy morgan has

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:44.760
apologized for his rent

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.609
at before we get to that let me tell you
what the rat was

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.279
so i'm actually in a region which kevin
rogers wrote in his blog and you'll get

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:54.850
an idea of what the stand-up included

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.600
so he wrote

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.160
i think they did some point the gauge of
the flyer that while prepared for a good

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.490
reading of straight gauge humor

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.470
i have very thick skin when it comes to
humor i condition and i can take

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.409
what i can't take is when mister morgan
to get up upon himself to mention about

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.160
how he feels all tuesday shit

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.070
was crazy and that women are gift from
god and that born this way is bullshit

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.530
and he's referring to the lady gaga son
anti-gay is a choice and the reason he

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.520
knows this is exactly because god don't
make no mistakes referring to god not

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.860
making someone gay cuz that would be a
mistake perhaps most strikingly rogers

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.800
wrote that morgan said

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.830
he said if his son

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.180
he said if his son that was

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.710
gay uh...

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.170
i'm sorry the patterson was getting a
better come home and talk to my command

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.040
he better comes in and talk to my
command and then he made me mimic the

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.840
gay person with a high-pitched voice

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.790
or he would pull out at night and
stabbed that little and he said that and

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.309
word

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:57.040
add to that

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.170
well you know

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.760
and i'm really

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.710
little to criticize

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.440
comedians generally for them that's
people go in there to hear comedy and

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.240
have given comedians are always gave in
their own whether it was right on the

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.969
people that they get their humor

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:15.430
uh... this seems like it when needed
still ok for i mean it to me mean that

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.409
the it seems like it's informed with a
little bit more hate than just at the

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.709
meeting coming up there and making fun
which is what comedians do it you know

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.680
it's all making fun of it i mean if
you're putting on a gay voice that five

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.779
and i know rogers is saying that you
know you go in the gay straight humorous

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:33.919
kind of funny uh... i think you're is
kinda funny if you if you're into it but

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:37.439
when he goes through anna it seems like
it's it just went too far and felt

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.419
really really hateful i think that you
know there's always that line even when

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.620
it comes to making movies when it comes
to comedy

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.200
of course you have that

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.200
huge range of freedom ok to express
yourself to you know participated

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.740
whatever art form here working in and do
whatever it is that you want without

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.920
worrying about being censored right but
with everything there's always that line

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.710
and i think tracy morgan cross that line
now that was bad enough right except he

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.630
continues his rent with this

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.010
uh... he said that he didn't he didn't
have been care if you can stop some gays

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.450
because if they can't if they can take
uh... fucking dick up their acts that

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.769
they can take a fucking jerk

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.979
so

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:24.889
that to me is the only i mean that that
is something

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.809
of a hat at really uncomfortable trying
to censor comedians and i don't know i

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:31.999
don't know if you get when you know i
think that's unusual is actually not

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:35.629
that of the worst thing he said i mean
that's kind of it's a funny turnover is

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:36.689
it not

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.889
uproariously funny with them

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:43.219
uh... but the stuff about the hateful
stuff about the choice and what he he

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:47.449
would say it was some when the sun came
home gay and i thought that he was that

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:51.049
his son and ahead it's not funny tristen
morgan's funny i mean if you hear

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.709
treason or howard stern

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.819
you want to run the isn't the real right
right you watching thirty rock trees

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.169
finalist trouble at response

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.619
i'd just this isn't funny i've
personally

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:06.209
lab tracy markets comedy i find him
really funny we've had several

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.310
discussions about in the past and i'm in
favor of tracy morgan

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.510
not in favor of the stand up and it
turns out that back in two thousand nine

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.730
he was also performing at carnegie hall
and he al went off saying similar things

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.829
about the individual saying that they're
gay because uh... it was their choice

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.530
not because they were born that way and

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.639
it's at it seems like an ongoing don't
think you have a right to make a jokes

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.139
when it was tracy

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.960
and

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.330
uh... but

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.619
i think that it seems pretty grateful
and seems pretty unfriendly

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:43.329
aso tracy morgan did apologize for that
i think it's only fair to show that part

00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:44.090
of the story

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.440
he says i want to apologize to my fans
in the gay and lesbian community for my

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.060
choice of words of my recent stand up in
nashville and not a foreperson and don't

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.830
condone any act of violence against
others lyman equal opportunity jokester

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.389
and my friends know what is in my heart
even in a comedy club is clearly went

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.050
too far and was not funny in any context

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.750
and the uh... for the scenes of human
rights campaign situation more in taxes

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.540
as extremely poor judgment

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.270
the rape so

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.310
