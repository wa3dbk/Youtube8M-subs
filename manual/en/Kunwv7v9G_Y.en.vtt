00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:05.240
My name is Abby Jones and I'm talking about
the process of moving into an apartment, a

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:13.790
new apartment and setting up your spaces and
tips and ways to make your spaces efficient

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:20.400
and functional an aesthetically pleasing.
So one of the things right now we're in the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.130
kitchen and I want to talk a little bit about
specifically your trashcan and places that

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:37.710
you can place your trashcan. So things that
will inform where you put your trashcan, one

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.690
just, obviously the spaces that you have where
that might work in your kitchen, and also

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:52.949
the size of your trashcan. So and if you have
a nice big metal one or a cheap plastic one,

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.699
which are lovely and I have one too. So here
it is right here underneath my sink. So this

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:06.620
the first place that you might think about
putting your trashcan. One if it's small enough

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.810
and there's room underneath your sink. And
then right next to it I'm keeping my trash

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:20.900
bags just because that's where I use my trash
bags. So that's one place to think about putting

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.890
your trashcan. Another place to think about
putting your trashcan is in your pantry if

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.000
you have space in your pantry. If you have
a small part of the wall that's not being

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.390
utilized that's a great place for a trashcan
or if you have shelves and if you can fit

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.870
your trashcan underneath the bottom shelves
that's a great place for a trashcan. And then

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:52.690
also, when I'm thinking about where to put
a trashcan I like to think about looking for

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:02.210
just small bits of wall so really any like
small piece of wall that you kind find. In

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.390
my kitchen I have a wall that's about a foot
long between my pantry and my sliding glass

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.060
door. And that might be a fine place for a
trashcan, although I've chosen to put something

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.710
else there. But that's something that you
just might want to think about when you are

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.750
thinking about where to put your trashcan.
