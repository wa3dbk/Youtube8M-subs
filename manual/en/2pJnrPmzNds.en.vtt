00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:04.637
- SO SENSORY RECEPTORS COME IN
MANY DIFFERENT FLAVORS

00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:07.773
AND THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS THAT
WE CAN ACTUALLY CLASSIFY THEM.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.144
I LIKE THIS IMAGE
BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU A VISUAL

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.581
FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT FORMS
OF RECEPTORS

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:20.919
AND WE KNOW MY FAVORITE PART
ABOUT THIS VISUAL IS THAT

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:25.291
YOU HAVE NOT ONLY NERVES,

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.894
LIKE THIS IS AN ACTUAL NEURON
WITH ITS CELL BODY.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.430
IN THESE YOU CAN CONSIDER THEM
LIKE LITTLE DENDRITES.

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:34.867
THOSE ARE LITTLE ENDS THAT ARE
SENSITIVE, AND THAT, YOU KNOW,

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.703
YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT
THAT'S THE CASE.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.939
BUT WE CAN ALSO WRAP THEM
IN CONNECTIVE TISSUE

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:41.808
AND END UP WITH THAT
AWESOME THING.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.876
THAT'S A PRESSURE RECEPTOR.

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:50.149
YOU CAN ALSO CONNECT THESE
AFFERENT NEURONS TO A SENSORY,

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.418
LIKE A CELL.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:56.889
THE CELL IS MODIFIED TO PICK UP
SENSORY STIMULI

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:59.092
AND YOU CAN JUST HAVE,
THIS IS THE SAME THING,

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.762
JUST LITTLE PIECES COMING OFF
OF YOUR NEURON.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.997
SO THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT
WAYS

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:10.102
THAT YOU CAN CREATE
AN OPPORTUNITY

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:15.475
TO TRANSLATE STIMULUS
INTO AN ACTION POTENTIAL.

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:20.079
NOW, WE CAN ALSO CATEGORIZE
OUR RECEPTORS

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:23.782
BY THE KIND OF STIMULUS
THAT THEY PICK UP.

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:25.051
SO LET'S MAKE A LIST

00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:28.754
OF ALL THE POSSIBLE TYPES
OF SENSORY RECEPTORS

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:30.423
THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH,

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:32.124
AND THEN WHAT I'M GOING
TO TELL YOU IS THAT

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:34.760
WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH
A BUNCH OF THEM

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:37.563
AND LOOK AT HOW THEY
SPECIFICALLY FUNCTION.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:45.371
SO WE CAN HAVE MECHANORECEPTORS.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.875
AND MECHANORECEPTORS ARE GOING
TO RESPOND TO MECHANICAL

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:51.244
OR PHYSICAL STIMULUS.

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:57.216
AN EXAMPLE OF MECHANORECEPTORS,
TOUCH, PRESSURE, TICKLE,

00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:02.755
HEARING, HEARING IS ACTUALLY
WAVES OF HEARING SOUND WAVES

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:07.326
THAT WHACK UP AGAINST YOUR
TYMPANIC MEMBRANE,

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:08.627
YOUR EAR DRUM.

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:17.970
AND THAT BANGING IS INTERPRETED
BY THE BRAIN AS SOUND.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:21.274
PRESSURE, LIKE BLOOD PRESSURE,
THAT'S A MECHANORECEPTOR.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.812
SO THAT'S ONE TYPE OF,
ONE FLAVOR OF SENSORY RECEPTOR

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.414
THAT WE CAN HAVE.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.087
WE CAN ALSO HAVE
THERMO RECEPTORS,

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:37.656
THERMO RECEPTORS PICK UP
TEMPERATURE CHANGES.

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:42.962
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE MORE COLD
TEMPERATURE RECEPTORS

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:44.831
THAN YOU DO HOT TEMPERATURE
RECEPTORS,

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:47.800
I THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING.

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:53.540
NOCICEPTORS, NOCICEPTORS
ARE IN THEIR OWN CATEGORY

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:58.278
BECAUSE THEY RESPOND TO PAIN,
NOT PAINS,

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:01.347
BUT THEY CAN RESPOND TO THAT,
TOO, PAIN.

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:05.951
HOWEVER, EVERY SINGLE STIMULUS
IF BIG ENOUGH,

00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:08.220
CAN BE PERCEIVED AS PAIN.

00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:10.356
SO BRIGHT ENOUGH LIGHTS
CAN BE PAINFUL.

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:12.524
A LOUD ENOUGH SOUND
CAN BE PAINFUL.

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:15.261
A BIG ENOUGH PRESSURE
CAN BE PAINFUL.

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:18.597
AND THOSE NOCICEPTORS
THAT ARE PICKING THAT UP.

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:24.370
FOUR, WE HAVE PHOTO RECEPTORS.

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:28.808
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY RESPOND
TO? LIGHT.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.409
PHOTO RECEPTORS RESPOND TO LIGHT

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:33.279
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE
THAT WE HAVE THEM.

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.147
THAT WOULD BE YOUR EYEBALL.

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:42.354
AND OUR LAST ONE
ARE CHEMO RECEPTORS.

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:45.891
CHEMO RECEPTORS RESPOND
TO CHEMICALS.

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.662
SMELL IS A CHEMICAL,

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.531
YOU'RE RESPONDING TO CHEMICALS
IN THE AIR.

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:54.600
TASTE, THAT'S A SET
OF CHEMO RECEPTORS.

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:58.171
SO THE FIRST GROUP OF RECEPTORS
THAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

00:03:58.237 --> 00:03:59.906
ARE MECHANO RECEPTORS.

00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:02.742
THEY'RE GENERAL SENSORY
STRUCTURES

00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:06.912
THAT RESPOND TO TOUCH
AND PRESSURE IN THE PERIPHERY.

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.448
OKAY, LET'S GO AHEAD, WOOPS
THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:12.648
LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET READY
TO TALK ABOUT THAT.
