00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.650
Good morning. I'm Stacey Krim
and I'd like to welcome you back

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:11.600 position:70%
to the UNCG Green Library Group video series.
As part of our wildcrafting series,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.970 position:63%
today I'm going to talk to you
about the basics of plant identification

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.710
and poisonous plants.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.880 position:67%
The first thing you need to do
when you begin working with wildcrafting is

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.360 position:66%
you check out field guides, and that's
one place the library comes in very handy.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.820 position:66%
The first field guide you should check out
for this area would be

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.470 position:72%
<u>The</u> <u>Peterson's</u> <u>Field</u> <u>Guide</u> <u>to</u> <u>Eastern</u> <u>Forests</u>.
I like this because it covers the plant life,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.230 position:66%
the flora, the habitats, and the waterways
you would find within the forest.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.910 position:66%
This isn't the book you would necessarily
use specifically for plant identification;

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.600
it's what you use to get yourself
acclimated to that environment,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.480 position:64%
and what you can anticipate finding. And
this book is available at UNCG Libraries,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.580 position:73%
and I will be turning it in in about 5 minutes.
The next book, specifically if you're going

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.930 position:61%
to identify medicinal plants and herbs,
is the <u>Peterson's</u> <u>Field</u> <u>Guide</u> <u>to</u>

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.040 position:64%
<u>Medicinal</u> <u>Plants</u> <u>and</u> <u>Herbs</u>. And this is
a wonderful book, it is the standard book

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.160 position:66%
for identifying plants in nature. It has
colored pictures, which is very important.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.840 position:63%
It talks about the family, the taxonomy,
of the plant, when it's in bloom,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.730
and the dangers associated
with that plant.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.410
And it's a 'must have' if you're
going to be wildcrafting.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.840 position:70%
but, when you wildcraft and you use books
as field guides for identifying those plants,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.220 position:63%
you should never depend on one book;
you should always be looking at multiple

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.410
pictures of those plants because
there's so much variation within

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.230 position:61%
a single plant species, that within its
spectrum of growth from spring to fall,

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.710 position:63%
let's say, there are so many variations,
what may be in this book

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.700
may not be what you find in nature,
so you always want to look at

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.620 position:56%
at least three credible sources -
field guides for identifying plants.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.420 position:58%
So, if you're not a botanist, and
you want to begin identifying plants,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.250 position:58%
and understanding them. the best book
in my opinion is <u>Botany</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>Day</u>.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.990
And this is a book about botany
for people who really don't want

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.600 position:56%
to know much about botany, they just
want to get down to the practical

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.540 position:63%
aspects of it. It has excellent diagrams
on plants; there's no colored pictures

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.640 position:61%
or photographs, but it tells you how to
examine a plant to notice the variation

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.580
so it makes plant identification a
bit easier without going into all

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.030 position:59%
of the scientific lingo. So, for plant
identification, usually when you're

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.410 position:77%
beginning wildcrafting, and you're an amateur,
you want to make certain that you're wildcrafting

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.950
when the plant is in full bloom.
It's easiest when the plant is

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.040
a flowering plant, because flowers
tend to look very distinguishable

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.110 position:64%
from plant to plant. So, you want to look
at the shape of the leaves,

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.890 position:67%
the time it's blooming, the size of the
plant; are the leaves oval?, are the leaves

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.290 position:61%
pointed at the end?, are they thorned?,
do they have little hairs on them?,

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.690 position:58%
what do the little ribs on the leaves
look like? And that's really the

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.890 position:61%
first step and the easiest way to begin
looking at plants and examining them

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.970 position:70%
to figure out what they are. The flowers
are very important and this means when you're

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.400 position:63%
working - when you're learning -
wildcrafting, it's something that you're

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.850 position:59%
going to be learning through multiple
seasons, because when that plant first

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.540 position:58%
starts blooming in spring, it doesn't
necessarily have all of the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.160 position:63%
characteristics you need, as an amateur,
to identify it.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.040 position:72%
So, you look at a plant, you go out in spring,
you look and see what's blooming, and

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.030 position:58%
then you go back continuously to try
to identify it. And you get to see it

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.630
through all of its stages, and
that's the safest way to identify

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.630
that plant if you're going to
actually try to eat it.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.970 position:58%
Now, in nature, there are always some
plants that look alike, and

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.730 position:58%
it's a misconception that every plant
has a plant that looks just like it

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.250 position:59%
that is poisonous; that's probably the
biggest fear I run into with people

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.660 position:69%
learning to wildcraft. There are some plants
that look very much alike, where one is

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.120 position:56%
edible and one is poisonous, but not
really that many, and once you pay

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.420 position:56%
attention to the differences between
those two plants, you can usually

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.970 position:58%
easily tell the difference. What I do
recommend, if you're beginning plant

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.910 position:63%
identification and wildcrafting, is that
you do not harvest the plant until

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.270 position:63%
you see it in full bloom, because that's
going to be the easiest time to

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.840 position:61%
identify it. If you're going to harvest
a plant for its root, go and stick a

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.020 position:58%
little sign there to distinguish that
that is where the plant is located,

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.220 position:58%
because a lot of mistakes are made by
wildcrafters when the plant has died

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.130 position:59%
away on the top, and they go to dig up
the root, but it's actually a root

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.200 position:66%
next to it that is from a dangerous plant.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.520 position:64%
So, the first thing as a wildcrafter you
need to learn are not the helpful plants,

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.850 position:63%
the edible plants, you need to learn
the poisonous plants. And in the Eastern

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.650
US and the Piedmont, our typical
poisonous plants are going to be

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.120 position:59%
poison ivy, maybe poison oak.
And what constitutes 'poisonous plant'

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:39.670 position:59%
is variable. For some herbs, the
characteristics that people would call

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.660 position:63%
a 'poisonous plant' are actually the
characteristics in it we want to use for

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.280 position:59%
specific illness, so really you're
just learning about any plant that may

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.970 position:58%
be a potential danger when you
harvest it or ingest it. NC State has

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.220 position:56%
a really good web site on local
poisonous plants in this region, but

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.040 position:66%
this is one really good book that I got
out of the University Libraries book sale,

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.970 position:61%
that's Poisonous Plants: A Field Guide.
We do have it in our collection, and

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.360 position:64%
it has really great pictures of a variety
of plants you would probably know that

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.700 position:61%
are poisonous, like poison oak and
poison ivy, but also things you may not

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.070 position:64%
realize are poisonous like a potato
when it turns green, or St. John's Wort,,

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.570 position:63%
because by field guide standards, there
are certain health conditions from which

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:34.210 position:67%
you need to be very aware that those plants
can cause harm if they're used incorrectly.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.650 position:66%
So, when I begin wildcrafting, the first
thing I want to do in a new environment is

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:45.200 position:58%
identify every single poisonous plant
in that area.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.200 position:66%
So, once you've figured out what plants
are the poisonous plants in your area, and

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.290 position:70%
hopefully later in the series we'll find
some examples that are not in bloom just yet,

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.800 position:70%
we move on to what are some of the edible
plants in those areas, and in our next video,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.810 position:70%
we're going to discuss what edible plants are
basically in the library's front lawn, how

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:10.690 position:67%
you would go about identifying them safely,
and how you would go about harvesting them,

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.680
and when you would harvest them.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.980 position:64%
Keep your questions coming in, and I look
forward to seeing you in the next video.
