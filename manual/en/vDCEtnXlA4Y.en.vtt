00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.220
In the early 20th century the war to end
all wars didn't end war at all,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.220
it stoked the fires of change.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.880
A traumatized world was right for change,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.680
the world was ready for modernism.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.400
Modernists wanted to
forget history, or at least reinterpret it.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.880
More than just a style, modernism applied
to virtually all forms of creative expression.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.560
Innovative artists like Picasso,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.260
Escher Dali, they all started looking at
their world differently.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.560
Other artists tried painting light itself.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.000
These were the Impressionists.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.700
Surrealists went a bit further.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.980
We had entered the age of the 'ism' - cubism, symbolism, futurism, constructivism,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.380
all these new modern ways
of looking at the world blew people away.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.480
When it came to architecture, modernists
were intrigued by emerging technology.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.500
Concrete, glass and steel featured
heavily in their buildings.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.720
Modernists believed that they could design a better
society.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.360
Ornamental indulgence was considered a
frivolous waste of effort.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.560
They thought function should always
dictate form

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.760
and that mankind's intelligence, creativity and capability
for radical thinking should be celebrated.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.360
Take the Russian inventor
Georgii Krutikov,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.600
he suggested an idea for a city held aloft by electrical
currents.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.880
This at a time when there was

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.000
barely enough wattage to keep the lights
on!

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.280
Not everything they designed was a resounding success,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.700
but you could argue modernism was the single most influential movement of the 20th century.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.840
From house music to housewares, tables and chairs to graphic design,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.600
all have been created by the aesthetics and ideas of modernism.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.960
Do you buy into modernism?

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.040
