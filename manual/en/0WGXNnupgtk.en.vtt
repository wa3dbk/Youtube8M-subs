00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:08.260
It's a tropical storm right now, but it soon could become Hurricane Isaac 
 and threaten south Florida or the entire state of Florida. 

00:00:09.938 --> 00:00:17.938
Right now tropical storm Isaac is forecast to hit the most southern tip of 
 Florida as a category 1 hurricane sometime early Monday morning August 27, 2012.

00:00:41.123 --> 00:00:47.123
As far as Hurricane Isaac threatening to cancel or wreak 
 havoc at the Republican National Convention in Tampa,

00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:57.602
the storm is forecast to be in south Florida by Monday morning so that means 
 it is likely it would be near the Tampa Bay Time Forum by Tuesday.

00:01:33.175 --> 00:01:43.180
There will be some 50,000 visitors to the Republican convention in Tampa along with some 
 expected 15,000 protesters trying to possibly wreak their own havoc on the big show.

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:15.230
Unfortunately that is he side that usually gets the worst weather and highest and most destructive 
 winds. So, we are making plans to have the necessary hurricane preparedness supplies on hand.

00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:27.310
Some people buy portable generators for hurricanes for when the power goes out 
 and some people just stock up on food and water. 

00:02:31.472 --> 00:02:43.470
Our neighbors have a portable generator and one of the last hurricanes we had several years ago we had generators on 
 either side of us going at night that made it hard to sleep. But you do have to have power.

00:02:44.035 --> 00:02:59.040
Oh, and one little tip about portable generators, make sure you get the ones with the wheels, because these 
 puppies are heavy and you don't want to have to drag it to where you need it.

00:03:14.657 --> 00:03:23.660
For those of us that live in Florida and especially those going to the 
 RNC Convention in Tampa, next week is certainly going to be interesting.
