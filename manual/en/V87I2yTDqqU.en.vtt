00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.229
Hey guys!

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:02.840
Welcome back to Knifehog.com.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.790
Addison here and today I'll be reviewing one
of Benchmade's newest and most impressive

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:15.269
tactical folders: the 477 Emissary.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.179
Boasting a Warren Osborne design, this new
addition to the Emissary series includes a

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.869
few of the same features of its predecessors,
but with a tweeks.

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.529
This knife measures 8" in length and weighs
only 3.59 ounces, which makes it a perfect

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.699
EDC.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:40.600
This knife's blade is 3.45" long and is constructed
of S30V premium stainless steel, which makes

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.269
it incredibly tough and able to handle things
like cutting thick rope and hard plastic tubing.

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:52.449
The handle of this knife is made of CNC aluminum
and features a deep and shallow finger groove

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.370
for your fingers to wrap around it comfortably.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.600
Just like it's predecessor the Emissary 470-1,
this knife features an Axis-Assist system

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.720
that deploys the blade very quickly and locks
the blade up very tightly.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.020
To open the blade using the assist system,
just give the ambidextrous thumb studs on

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.830
either side of the blade a slight push and
the perfectly centered blade will deploy.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.940
When the blade is opened or closed , you can
slide the safety mechanism into the locked

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.650
position securing the blade in its current
position.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.600
This knife features a reversible pocket clip
for easy storage on your jeans or camping

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.780
bag.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.610
Overall, the Benchmade 477 Emissary is definitely
a fantastic addition to the Emissary series.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.500
It's extremely tough and durable blade fused
with the ergonomic handle make it a very discreet

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.060
yet powerful knife that you would want to
carry with you at all times.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.810
The Axis-Assist opening system on this knife
guarantees consistent and safe deployment

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.810
as well.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.281
There is not one bad thing I have to say about
this knife and highly recommend it those who

00:02:00.281 --> 00:02:04.710
are looking for a powerful yet lightweight
EDC.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.939

score of 5 out of 5 stars.
