00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.610
Oh hey
so I thought it would be a cute idea to make

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.860
a video outside but
like what are you—

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.220
like is that an industrial sized vacuum like
what is

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.590
is everyone?

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.419
how is everyone doing this?
so anyway today I wanted to talk about something

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:22.349
that has been bothering me for 5000 years
approximately

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.409
and maybe you would know that if The History
Channel showed history shows

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:32.360
You know how like there are channels and they’re
like supposed to have shows that are based

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:41.280
on their name like
THE VACUUM CHANNEL

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.539
I’m sure they wouldn’t even play that
Let’s see what’s on The History Channel

Okay so you’re traveling from a body to

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.590

Where do you get the idea—

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.170

Where do you get them though

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.230
those ideas though
Like where do you—where do you get them

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.700
That’s like having something called The
Dinosaur Channel and showing prunes or so—in

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.739
a bowl.

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.450
Prunes in a bowl.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.770
Nobody even likes prunes.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.030
That’s a lie, I like prunes.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.342
