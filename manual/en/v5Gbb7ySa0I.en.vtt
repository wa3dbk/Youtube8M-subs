00:00:00.193 --> 00:00:01.625
(girlish voice) How come 
there aren't any emojis

00:00:01.625 --> 00:00:03.532
of hot emo boys making out?

00:00:03.532 --> 00:00:04.676
(Ian) SHUT UP!!!

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:10.558
In 1998, Shigetaka Kurita 
used the first emoji.

00:00:10.898 --> 00:00:13.042
(gong booms)

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:15.672
Ten years later, Apple held
a top secret meeting

00:00:15.672 --> 00:00:17.888
to develop emojis for their products.

00:00:18.278 --> 00:00:19.984
The following is 
a completely accurate

00:00:19.984 --> 00:00:22.266
historical reenactment 
of what took place.

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.584
(Steve Jobs) Thank you all 
for attending my secret meeting

00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:26.357
on such short notice.

00:00:26.447 --> 00:00:30.562
Before we begin, let us all pray
to the Great Apple in the Sky.

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:34.686
(all mutter incoherently)

00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:35.953
Okay, shut up.
That's enough.

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:37.284
Here's the deal, folks.

00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:39.936
Whenever I send a text message 
to my lovely mother,

00:00:40.376 --> 00:00:42.886
auto-correct always f*cks it up!

00:00:43.256 --> 00:00:46.533
So I was thinking we need
a universal language

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:50.163
that cannot be misinterpreted,
and that's where I came up

00:00:50.163 --> 00:00:53.050
with these weird little picture thingies.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.097
I call them Apple iPics.

00:00:57.097 --> 00:01:00.051
Those already exist 
and they're called emojis.

00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:03.693
You know, I was just thinking
that maybe instead

00:01:03.693 --> 00:01:07.003
I should call them emojis!

00:01:07.143 --> 00:01:08.189
I just said that.

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.831
Anybody have any ideas
for some more emojis?

00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:17.180
Yes, annoying guy in the front
with all the logic?

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.386
Well, I think it would be nice
to have all ethnicities

00:01:20.386 --> 00:01:22.091
represented with their own emoji.

00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:25.101
Oh my god, that is 
the most boring thing I've ever heard.

00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:26.106
Uh, next?

00:01:26.106 --> 00:01:29.112
Four pages of smiley faces,
so I can show how I'm feeling

00:01:29.232 --> 00:01:31.756
because I'm a normal guy
and I can't express emotion.

00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:33.691
(laughs) I can't either!
That's great.

00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:34.303
Next?

00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:37.253
Seven different kissy faces
because I'm a girl

00:01:37.253 --> 00:01:40.196
and I wanna confuse the sh*t outta guys.

00:01:40.356 --> 00:01:41.882
#MixedSignals.

00:01:41.882 --> 00:01:43.022
I love that.

00:01:43.022 --> 00:01:45.736
You know, I'm designing 
something called the iCloud,

00:01:45.736 --> 00:01:48.154
just to confuse 
the sh*t out of people too.

00:01:48.154 --> 00:01:48.838
Next?

00:01:48.838 --> 00:01:50.239
How 'bout a ram!

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:51.274
Great! Next?

00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:53.356
How 'bout we re-create 
a bunch of the smiley faces,

00:01:53.356 --> 00:01:54.363
but as cats.

00:01:54.363 --> 00:01:55.357
Of-fricking-course!

00:01:55.357 --> 00:01:58.465
And maybe we can do 
smileys with dogs too.

00:01:58.465 --> 00:02:00.092
No! F*ck dogs!

00:02:00.092 --> 00:02:01.591
How 'bout another ram?

00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:03.438
Okay, what is it with you and rams?

00:02:03.438 --> 00:02:06.511
My friend just really likes them, okay?

00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:08.825
Reggie, just throw it in there,
the ram for the man.

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:11.198
Throw in another ram for the man.

00:02:11.288 --> 00:02:15.298
Okay, seriously, there are two races 
outside of white people

00:02:15.298 --> 00:02:17.802
represented, but they 
all pretty much look white!

00:02:18.082 --> 00:02:20.456
I mean, is this dude with the turban
supposed to represent

00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:22.265
all people other than white people?

00:02:22.415 --> 00:02:24.313
What about a ghost?
A ghost can be any race.

00:02:24.313 --> 00:02:25.861
Oh my god.

00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:28.388
Uh, excuse me, but this 
top secret lair is booked

00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:30.830
for my Train Appreciation Club at 12:30.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.329
That's my bad.
I'm sorry.

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.328
Hey, by the way, we can't 
really think of any more emojis

00:02:35.328 --> 00:02:38.000
because these people 
aren't geniuses like you and I.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.431
Do you have any ideas?

00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:41.162
13 different trains!

00:02:41.162 --> 00:02:44.080
Now why the f*ck would we 
need that many trains?

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.028
Oh, looks like we got 
a train racist over here, huh?

00:02:47.028 --> 00:02:50.024
You just think all trains
look the same, don't you?

00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:53.064
Well, see, you're gonna need
a steam powered train,

00:02:53.064 --> 00:02:56.114
a bullet train, a slightly speedier 
looking bullet train,

00:02:56.114 --> 00:02:58.869
one with the flat front,
a monorail train,

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:01.523
a trolley train, 
a trolley trail with the...

00:03:01.523 --> 00:03:04.844
slight thingie...whatever this is.
It's a little bit different on top.

00:03:05.034 --> 00:03:06.550
And then we got a front facing train.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.315
That same front facing train 
going next to a sign,

00:03:09.315 --> 00:03:11.508
and a train going through a tunnel
for when I need to make

00:03:11.508 --> 00:03:13.133
a sexual reference to my wife.

00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:13.969
Eh? Eh?

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:15.921
I mean, I could go on for days.

00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:17.580
- Sold!
- Come on!

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.959
Guys, we got about 
a minute left, so...

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:21.888
Lightning round!

00:03:21.888 --> 00:03:22.927
A purple devil.

00:03:22.927 --> 00:03:24.340
A huge building with a BK on it.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.622
A bloody syringe.

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:27.381
A padlock with the tip of an ink pen!

00:03:27.381 --> 00:03:30.351
A moon that looks he 
wants to molest youuu!

00:03:30.351 --> 00:03:31.350
Fruit that looks like a butt.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.526
A flag for all ten countries of the world.

00:03:33.526 --> 00:03:34.571
Listen!

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:35.964
I don't really know what it is.

00:03:35.964 --> 00:03:36.933
A VHS tape.

00:03:36.933 --> 00:03:37.695
A pager.

00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:39.170
Maybe another--

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.400
NO!

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.820
Focus, people.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.004
We only need one more emoji,
so let's make it good.

00:03:45.004 --> 00:03:46.130
Come on, guys!

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.553
We finally have a chance
to represent every ethnicity

00:03:49.553 --> 00:03:51.669
equally with a universal language.

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:55.538
This will bring everybody together
and could change the world.

00:03:56.088 --> 00:03:59.188
This could be the first step
to world peace.

00:04:00.858 --> 00:04:02.182
You know what? 
He's right.

00:04:02.182 --> 00:04:04.823
Wouldn't you represent
every race, color, and creed

00:04:04.823 --> 00:04:06.714
with these emojis?
So what better way

00:04:06.714 --> 00:04:10.106
to do that then to include
the most underrepresented race

00:04:10.106 --> 00:04:11.318
of all time!

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:14.603
Santa Claus!

00:04:14.603 --> 00:04:17.147
F-ck you, you smiling piles of sh-t!

00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:20.768
Wait, no!
That's just it.

00:04:21.538 --> 00:04:22.640
You're a genius, man.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.436
Our final emoji...

00:04:26.326 --> 00:04:28.534
will be a smiling pile of sh*t.

00:04:28.814 --> 00:04:30.775
(scary music)

00:04:31.425 --> 00:04:32.647
(Anthony) Hey, guys, 
thanks so much for watching

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.367
and make sure to hit 
that big ass yellow button

00:04:34.367 --> 00:04:36.378
if you aren't already subscribed.
It will totally make you feel

00:04:36.378 --> 00:04:39.012
like that cool emoji with the sunglasses.
You know, the one...

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.892
the...you...yeah.

00:04:40.892 --> 00:04:42.839
(Ian) If you guys wanna see 
bloopers from this video

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:45.829
and a deleted scene,
click the video on the left.

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:48.725
I tried to send my mom 
a simple text message

00:04:48.725 --> 00:04:51.030
and auto-correct always f*cked it up.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.058
Look at this.

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:54.033
This is the message 
I sent my mom last week.

00:04:54.173 --> 00:04:57.335
(Ian) And if you wanna see more of me 
being a really bad Steve Jobs,

00:04:57.335 --> 00:05:00.319
click the video on the right
to watch our iPhone 6 commercial.

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.730
We've made the greatest 
enhancements to iOS

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.268
since the beginning.
All Samsung Galaxy phones

00:05:05.268 --> 00:05:07.983
within a 50 foot radius 
will burst into flames.

00:05:08.363 --> 00:05:09.128
AAAH!

00:05:09.128 --> 00:05:10.198
(screaming)
