00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.890
 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.650
hello everyone David a Cox here with PCClassesOnline.com

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.660
And today I'm going to be
showing you two

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.830
different methods for how you can
permanently delete

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.710
old facebook messages now some of you
may know when someone sends you a

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.939
private message

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.350
on Facebook it is saved on Facebook so

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.700
let's say you and some person don't talk
for a couple of months

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.190
when they start talking to you again
your old conversation

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.430
comes back to life so what I'm gonna
show you how you can completely

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.820
wipe that out there are two different
ways to do it one way I'm gonna show you

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.079
is through the computer

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.160
the other is through something like an
iPhone or an iPad

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.559
so let's go over how to do it on the
computer the first thing yo uneed to know is that

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:57.579
when you're doing this

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.379
you have to do it by going through
messages up here

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.750
and then go to "see all." You need to be on this screen where you have

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.630
the people that you correspond with on
the left and your actual message

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.590
here on the right now go to the top of
the message where there's

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.870
a little gear icon and it says "actions"
click on it

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.330
and instead of hitting delete messages
click here where it says "delete conversation"

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.560
and you're going to have to click to confirm... and
it wipes

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.170
out the whole conversation now what I
want to do is switch over and show you

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.810
how to do this

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.280
on an iPhone let's go fullscreen here

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.060
go into Facebook and so here in the
middle of my screen you may see there's

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.250
a multiple conversation here between two
people

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.780
the way you can now do it this is a
recent update as a

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.390
today's date that is on where you can do
it the same way you would do it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.450
in the mail program on an iPhone

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.350
So take your finger and start here
on the right hand side....

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.080
I'm sorry on the left hand side
and slide it to the right

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.390
and when you do that

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.730
You can see here we have
archive and delete

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.850
delete is the same thing as delete
conversation

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.970
once again it does make you click to
confirm

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.370
and again and it's gone

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.760
that's it everyone hope you learned
something today
