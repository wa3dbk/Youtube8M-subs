00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.089
Hey youtube, it's been awhile!

00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:02.990
I haven't made a video in 2 or 3 months.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.370
I thought I would make a video of my new bike!

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:21.350
Here it is, Its a 2009, so it's not brand
new, it's a couple years old, used 2009 YZ250F.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.730
Let's take a walk-around with it.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.730
It's a really cool bike.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.180
It's got excel wheels front and back.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.940
And it's got the nice brake calipers on it.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.750
The tires are in way good shape.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.829
It's got the pro taper tall bars on it as
well.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.290
It's go nice blue accents on the bike, throughout,
with the renthal sprocket.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.920
It's got the nice chain upgrade, here is a
nice shot of the engine.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.440
Sorry the lighting outside is kind of bad.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.600
It's a little bright.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.020
The back wheel is really nice.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.070
The back tire is nice.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.060
This is also an excel wheel.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.030
The brakes are in good shape.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.320
And then you have this side of the bike.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.880
It's got a full FMF exhaust.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.700
Titanium 4.1 It's really nice.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.479
It's a really sweet bike.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:24.479
It's fast!

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.479
Runs well.

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.490
Full mega-bomb or whatever this thing is called,
I forget.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.090
But it's real clean.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:40.789
Check it out, it's got the racing seat, custom,
full proaction suspension, it's got the metal

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.999
radiator guards, which help a lot as well.

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.869
It's a great bike!

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.420
Check it out, I will start if up for you!

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.719
This bike is really easy to start, I might
try to start it with my hand.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:02:00.990
I just wheeled it out here, it has been sitting
for about 3 days or so, let's see if I can

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.619
get it to start.

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:24.760
Gas is on.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.760
The choke?

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.760
That's a sweeeet bike!

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.060
I will have you listen to the sound.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.829
Motorcycle exhaust noise.

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.670

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:48.000
