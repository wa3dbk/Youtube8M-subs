00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:20.520
No, no, no, no, no!

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.949
No more godd*mn minigames.

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.390
This is...you see all the snow on the screens?

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.110
That’s like inside my brain when I hear
the word “minigames.”

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.980
I’ve been done with this crap since 2010.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.260
No more miniga—wait...wait, is this WarioWare?

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.430
Well, these aren’t minigames.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.720
These are microgames!

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.329
It’s Lights Camera Party! for the PlayStation
3.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.390
Well, that’s more like it.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.620
Just released to the PlayStation Network,
Lights Camera Party! is the kind of clone

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.629
I’d be happy to see more often.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.960
There are plenty of games that rip off Mario
Party and the standard minigame compilation,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.270
but there are way fewer that go the WarioWare
route.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.790
And that’s what this game does.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.090
Lights Camera Party! is pretty much WarioWare
for PlayStation owners.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.360
That’s a pretty cool thing to be.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.770
The story is there’s a game show, they launch
this rocket, it destroys some family’s house,

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.360
they put them on the game show to make up
for it.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.390
The game plays out like a classic gameshow,
complete with a very retro TV flair.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.740
And as the rounds play out, a new house is
slowly put together.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:52.670
The gameshow’s rounds group the microgames
together the same way WarioWare does, and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.759
the games themselves are also very similar.

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.540
You’re given brief instructions, sometimes
longer than the microgame itself, and then

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.540
you play.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.890
If there’s a difference between Lights Camera
Party! and WarioWare, it’s that these games

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.849
actually explain themselves...unlike WarioWare,
which you have to figure out on your own.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.910
In terms of the games, well...they’re really
hit and miss.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.599
Some of them feel great, like this lock-picking
game that uses the pressure-sensitive button

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.650
on the back of controller.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.889
I also really liked this xylophone game, which
has you playing the notes that match the changing

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.180
colors of the controller’s sphere.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.540
Even the shooting games, as standard as they
may be, at least play really well.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.739
But that’s the problem.

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:42.489
A lot of this stuff is really standard and
2010-ish.

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:51.969
Still, Lights Camera Party! is a really solid
party game.

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:56.889
It supports up to eight players, you pass
a controller around WarioWare-style...and

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.849
if you’re never played WarioWare, this is
a great way to get acquainted.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.319
If you’re looking for a Move game to play
with friends, go with Lights Camera Party!

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.870
Besides, the minigame is dead.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:19.730
Long live 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.579
the microgame.
