00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.130
Hey guys.

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.460
John, here with RealTruck.com.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.960
Today we're going to show you how
to install the TonnoPro Hard-Fold Tonneau

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:15.400
Cover onto a 2013 GMC Sierra
Denali.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.980
As you can see, this is a nice hard-fold tunnel
cover; comes with

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.259
everything you see here: The cover, it comes
with your cleaner, pair of

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:30.859
nonslip work gloves, your tailgate seal, and
a really handy LED light with

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.610
the stick-on stuff so that you can stick it
on up underneath your tonneau

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.860
cover, that way you can see to get in there
and get stuff out in the dark.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.760
The next thing to do is let's get this on
the truck.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.650
We're all ready to put
our tunnel cover on our truck.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.580
The first order of business is to get this
up in the truck.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.550
Let's get it up there and get started.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.240
Once we've got it up on here, then we want
to go ahead and take our clamps

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.610
and bring our clamps down.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.039
Get those adjusted, so that way their close
for

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:06.969
where they're going to be.

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:10.729
We'll do that on both sides.

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.170
We've got that
adjusted where we want it; not over-tight,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.149
just tight enough that the cover
don't fall of while we do our adjustments.

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.710
Next thing we're going to do is
roll this out all the way, adjust the rear

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.990
ones and get those set where we
want them, and make sure everything fits right.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.820
Just so you guys know; this comes with these
clips.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.869
Go ahead and unclip
these before you roll it out so you can get

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.030
it to roll out right.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.549
These are
our rear ones; they just pull down and they

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.359
have a slide.

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.950
When you're not
using it, they just lock up into place.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.530
We're just going to slide our clamp
over, make sure that it's where we want it

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:04.509
to be.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.359
We're going to have to
tighten this one up just a little bit.

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:11.510
Just pull it back and give it a few
turns.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.730
Slide it back underneath, lock her down.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.220
We'll do the same thing on
the other side.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.020
Now that we have it all snug down on the truck,
we're going to go ahead and

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:30.310
get it lined up, and get it set where it's
going to be.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.530
That looks pretty
good right there.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.110
We'll go ahead and unlatch it, roll it back,
and tighten

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:53.980
everything down.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.510
What I'm doing here, I'm just ... those clamps
that we

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.860
have in the front, just going to go ahead
and tighten those down in place.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.090
Don't over-tighten these guys because it doesn't
need to be that tight.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.080
They are plastic they, they can break if you
really wrench on them, so just

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.410
got to be tight enough to hold on.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:37.400
We'll go ahead and roll this back out
and lock our rear ones down in place.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.960
You've seen how easy it is to install this.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.320
Some of the great features
about it is, obviously, the no-tool installation.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.960
It also has a nice vinyl
look because it's a vinyl-covered aluminum

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.950
panel which keep it a hard style
cover and it'll hold up to 350 pounds of weight.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.430
If you live in a winter
climate, get a lot of snow, perfect for that

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.400
because it's not going to cave
in on you.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.230
The only thing left to do is to take this
thing out and show it

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.840
off around town.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.819
Until next time, happy motoring.
