2-Step Truck Washing with Hydro-Chem Systems, Inc.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.160
With our Pro-Station Receiver,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.030
What I can do here is I can actually turn on the machine,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.200
Switch it from our #1 soap to our #2 soap

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.080
and back to rinse,

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.020
without having to go back to the machine

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.020
making the job more efficient.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.000
I will now  switch the machine back to rinse,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.060
wait for a moment, then back to #2,

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.090
so that I can tell where the #2 starts in the line

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.040
Now I will switch  the machine back to rinse.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.080
That's the power of 2-Step.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.020
Now, for those of you who think that high pressure

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.100
would just take off dirt and road film, let's see.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.280
Well that proves it.  You can take off most of the dirt,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.060
but you will not remove the road film

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.020
without HCS 2-step detergents, first.
