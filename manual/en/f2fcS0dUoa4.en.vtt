00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.860
- Why are there always
people outside my window?

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.608
Why are there always
people outside my window?

00:00:06.608 --> 00:00:08.254
There's always people outside my window

00:00:08.254 --> 00:00:09.878
and it's like how can I even talk?

00:00:09.878 --> 00:00:10.955
How can I even make a video?

00:00:10.955 --> 00:00:12.846
And I've been trying to make a video.

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.024
Are they gone?

00:00:14.024 --> 00:00:15.323
They're gone.

00:00:15.323 --> 00:00:17.142
(sighs) Well hello, everybody.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:18.198
My name is Tyler Oakley

00:00:18.198 --> 00:00:19.622
and my voice is a little hoarse right now

00:00:19.622 --> 00:00:20.982
because yesterday I went out.

00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:21.795
I didn't mean to go out,

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:22.546
but then I went out.

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:25.005
I went out at noon because
it was Sunday fun day.

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:26.814
And people do that.

00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:27.891
I guess adults do that.

00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:29.111
So I went out, and I
was like you know what,

00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:31.099
I'mma just order a soda

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.212
with a little lime and so
if people come up to me

00:00:33.212 --> 00:00:34.187
they're like, "Why aren't you drinking?"

00:00:34.187 --> 00:00:35.044
I'll be like, "I'm drinking."

00:00:35.044 --> 00:00:36.283
But I was actually not drinking,

00:00:36.283 --> 00:00:37.543
but then somebody offered me a shot.

00:00:37.543 --> 00:00:38.884
And then I started drinking

00:00:38.884 --> 00:00:40.611
because I was like you know what,

00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:42.419
drinking responsibly is fine.

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:44.370
But then I was out until two,

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.392
from noon 'til two,

00:00:45.392 --> 00:00:48.156
and by two I mean not 2pm, I mean 2am.

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:51.245
So it was like a fourteen
hour day of shenanigans.

00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:52.728
So I've kinda lost my voice.

00:00:52.728 --> 00:00:54.089
But I wanted to make a video anyway

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.405
because it's time for another Q and slay.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:57.218
Let's do it.

00:00:57.218 --> 00:00:58.173
Do you watch anime?

00:00:58.173 --> 00:00:59.473
Sometimes I do.

00:00:59.473 --> 00:01:01.728
I'm not a fanime, if you will,

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.593
but I do like "The Spirited
Away" type of movies.

00:01:04.593 --> 00:01:06.828
But I've never gotten into a show.

00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:09.509
So if there's a show I
should get into, let me know.

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:10.993
Does your poop float or sink?

00:01:10.993 --> 00:01:12.780
Honestly, I think it depends on the day.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.056
(laughs) I was gonna say,

00:01:15.056 --> 00:01:17.514
I could go in there and come back out

00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:19.261
and let you know.

00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:21.415
Am I gonna do that?

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:22.898
Be right back.

00:01:22.898 --> 00:01:25.885
(smooth jazz music)

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:28.711
OK, so I think, you
know when you do a study

00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:30.824
and there's a whole bunch of results,

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:32.814
but then there's one outlier,

00:01:32.814 --> 00:01:34.175
I think today was the outlier

00:01:34.175 --> 00:01:36.249
because I have been drinking coffee.

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:37.934
And you know what coffee does.

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:40.556
Makes you shit, so it's
not looking pretty,

00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:42.506
what I just did, I just did a bad thing.

00:01:42.506 --> 00:01:46.021
What I did in that
bathroom was not Christian.

00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:47.300
To answer the question,

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.207
just like life, my poop sometimes floats

00:01:50.207 --> 00:01:51.811
and sometimes sinks.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.660
There are ups and there are downs,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.281
and sometimes you can't
make it above water,

00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:57.378
but you know what,

00:01:57.378 --> 00:01:58.496
at the end of the day,

00:01:58.496 --> 00:02:00.181
you just have to consider that we all

00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:03.291
get flushed down the toilet that is life.

00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:05.282
Hashtag shitspiration.

00:02:05.282 --> 00:02:06.561
Why do you love making YouTube videos?

00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:08.004
Because I get to hang out with you guys.

00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:10.097
I feel like this is my
opportunity to connect

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:12.371
with you guys and tell you
about really cool things

00:02:12.371 --> 00:02:13.857
that are helping change the world,

00:02:13.857 --> 00:02:15.014
or do things for the better.

00:02:15.014 --> 00:02:17.472
Like sometimes I do my
fundraiser with you.

00:02:17.472 --> 00:02:20.154
You guys have donated hundreds
of thousands of dollars

00:02:20.154 --> 00:02:22.185
for a charity that I love and support.

00:02:22.185 --> 00:02:24.094
We are at $370,000.

00:02:24.094 --> 00:02:26.635
We are so close to reaching $500,000,

00:02:26.635 --> 00:02:27.772
so if you haven't donated yet,

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:29.133
it's the perfect birthday gift,

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:30.739
and I would love you forever if you did.

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:31.816
Let me know when you donate

00:02:31.816 --> 00:02:33.157
and I will give you some love.

00:02:33.157 --> 00:02:34.498
Do you smell like beef?

00:02:34.498 --> 00:02:36.282
I don't think so.

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:38.355
No, today I don't smell like beef,

00:02:38.355 --> 00:02:40.265
but I will say like a decade ago

00:02:40.265 --> 00:02:42.256
when I worked at McDonald's,
I stank like beef.

00:02:42.256 --> 00:02:43.394
I would come home from work,

00:02:43.394 --> 00:02:46.299
and I would be like eww,
I reek like a big ol'

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.518
plate of beef.

00:02:47.518 --> 00:02:49.977
I did not like that I
would always reek of beef.

00:02:49.977 --> 00:02:51.704
What is your favorite song
to listen to in the shower?

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.166
It changes every single day.

00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:55.300
If you wanna know what
songs I am currently loving,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.944
I have two links.

00:02:56.944 --> 00:02:59.688
This is not how normal humans say two.

00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:01.070
I have two links. One, two.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.860
One link that is going to be below

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.770
for my jams playlist on Spotify.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.354
One link that is gonna be below for my

00:03:06.354 --> 00:03:07.817
chill playlist on Spotify.

00:03:07.817 --> 00:03:09.117
So if you're looking to get pumped up

00:03:09.117 --> 00:03:10.804
or if you're looking to
have a quiet night in

00:03:10.804 --> 00:03:12.084
doing studying stuff,

00:03:12.084 --> 00:03:13.689
you can get both of those below.

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.253
The links to those are completely free.

00:03:15.253 --> 00:03:16.432
Follow me on Spotify

00:03:16.432 --> 00:03:17.914
and you can always know
when my favorite songs

00:03:17.914 --> 00:03:19.498
are added to my playlists.

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:20.901
What is the biggest unreasonable goal

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:22.018
that you have for 2015?

00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:24.538
I don't like saying
things are unreasonable.

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:27.586
I want things, all things to
be achievable for anybody.

00:03:27.586 --> 00:03:30.308
And it may not be achievable by 2015,

00:03:30.308 --> 00:03:31.485
maybe that's the thing,

00:03:31.485 --> 00:03:34.659
but I do believe all of my
goals and my dreams are doable.

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.092
If I work hard enough,
nothing is unreasonable.

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:38.798
Except this itch, good Lord.

00:03:38.798 --> 00:03:40.403
Do you keep the outtakes of your videos?

00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:42.191
No, because they're boring.

00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:44.771
Here, this is an example
of an outtake of my video.

00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:46.173
I don't do outtakes, OK.

00:03:46.173 --> 00:03:48.510
This is what it is between cuts.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.034
Here, enjoy this.

00:03:50.034 --> 00:03:55.031
(whistling)

00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:55.980
Whistle.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.933
Yes, I have the pizza place in my phone.

00:04:04.335 --> 00:04:06.590
Do you want a whole video of that?

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.845
If you do, push the thumbs up button,

00:04:08.845 --> 00:04:11.264
maybe I'll upload an entire video

00:04:11.264 --> 00:04:12.600
of me just like.

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:15.792
Did your mother eat the
placenta when she birthed you?

00:04:15.792 --> 00:04:17.233
I don't think so.

00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:18.535
If anybody was gonna eat that shit,

00:04:18.535 --> 00:04:20.323
Lord knows it would have been me.

00:04:20.323 --> 00:04:22.740
I am always starvation
station rhythm nation.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.650
And I'm like, you gonna finish that?

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.133
That's literally me at my birth.

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:27.779
I'm like, did you drop that?

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:28.571
Five second rule?

00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:29.912
Fine, I'll eat that placenta.

00:04:29.912 --> 00:04:31.334
And honestly, if she did,

00:04:31.334 --> 00:04:32.837
that should be her Twitter bio.

00:04:32.837 --> 00:04:34.829
Make a cooking with Tyler
Oakley 10 second bit.

00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:36.071
OK, hold up.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.183
Siri, where can I get some orange chicken?

00:04:39.183 --> 00:04:40.606
- [Siri] I didn't find any restaurants

00:04:40.606 --> 00:04:42.658
who's reviews mention orange chicken.

00:04:42.658 --> 00:04:44.101
- Siri, fuck you.

00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:45.726
- [Siri] Now, now.

00:04:45.726 --> 00:04:47.331
- (laughs)

00:04:47.331 --> 00:04:48.814
OK, so I think that's all
I have for you guys today.

00:04:48.814 --> 00:04:49.771
If you wanna see my latest video,

00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:50.562

00:04:50.562 --> 00:04:51.618
If you wanna hear the latest pod cast,

00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:53.975
If you want to get some merch

00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:54.869
and become my person of the week,

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:55.681
click right there.

00:04:55.681 --> 00:04:56.982
But yeah, I love you.

00:04:56.982 --> 00:04:58.241
Push the thumbs up button

00:04:58.241 --> 00:04:59.623
and I will love you even more.

00:04:59.623 --> 00:05:01.552
And I will send you some orange chicken

00:05:01.552 --> 00:05:02.549
because Siri's not gonna.

00:05:02.549 --> 00:05:04.276
But I will talk to you guys later.

00:05:04.276 --> 00:05:05.793
OK, bye!

00:05:08.598 --> 00:05:10.610
Siri, where can I get some orange chicken?

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.104
- [Siri] I didn't find any recipes--

00:05:13.617 --> 00:05:16.220
- Somebody outside my window
just screamed, "Google it."

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.056
Honestly, I have never been
so disrespected like this.

00:05:20.056 --> 00:05:21.378
I came here to have a good time

00:05:21.378 --> 00:05:22.902
and to get some orange chicken.

00:05:22.902 --> 00:05:24.225
Please don't cuss me out.
