Hello YouTube.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.850
This is Praveen for TechEmpty.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.710
In this Video we are going to show you the
easy way to download APK files from Google

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.250
Play Store to PC using APK Downloader.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.550
As we all know that, all the android apps
are bundled as APK files.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.230
It is a hectic task to always download android
apps from the store especially in case of

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.039
using 2G data or think if the particular app
is showing incompatible message although it

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.190
works fine on your smartphone or to install
it on Amazon Kindle where you won't have Google

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.000
Play Store.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.019
What if we have a backup of all Android Apps
in the form of APK files?

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.899
You can install any apps when you need with
a single touch.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.090
Let me show you how.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.309
Evozi, an Android app developer, offers a
one-click online APK downloader that lets

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.160
you download any Android app that is listed
on the Google Play store.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.670
The downloader app can be accessed at http://apps.evozi.com/apk-downloader/.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.390
The direct link was provided here in the show
notes below.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.909
To get started, open Google Play Store and
copy the link of the Android App that would

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.070
like to download as APK file.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.869
Now paste the same web URL at APK Downloader
and click the "Generate Download Link" button.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.020
The APK downloader app will fetch the APK
file from the Google Play store and will host

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.939
it on its own servers from where you download
the file.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.110
Since the APK files are directly fetched from
the Google Play Store, it's unlikely that

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.570
the Android App will be infected with any
malware.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.520
Also, to prevent app piracy, the APK downloader
only lets you download free apps and games

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.579
from the Google Play store, not the paid ones.

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:52.579
Thats it.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.740

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.799
