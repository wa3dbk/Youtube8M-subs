00:00:00.562 --> 00:00:02.249
- [Roxanna] Hi.
- It's Rainy Day Dreamers.

00:00:02.249 --> 00:00:03.489
- We're still in Mexico.

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:04.591
We're wearing the same clothes.

00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:06.925
This may be the same day as
the other video that you saw.

00:00:06.925 --> 00:00:09.967
Now, we had, we got a whole
bunch of these surprise eggs,

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:12.149
all different themes and
what was the last one we did?

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:13.224
Tinkerbell, right?
- [Girls] Yeah.

00:00:13.224 --> 00:00:16.120
- Now we noticed it didn't
say Kinder Surprise Egg on it.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.964
These that we're trying today,
look like the real thing.

00:00:18.964 --> 00:00:20.497
Let's see how they are.

00:00:20.497 --> 00:00:24.303
♫ Rainy Day Dreamers

00:00:24.303 --> 00:00:27.323
♫ Rainy Day Dreamers ♫

00:00:27.323 --> 00:00:29.122
These are the real deal.

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:30.644
Kinder Surprise Eggs.

00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:33.801
They have a set for boys
and a set for girls.

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:36.239
So first we're gonna
try out this girl set.

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.781
Not sure exactly what
toys you may get inside,

00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:41.323
but we're hoping the
chocolate will taste good.

00:00:41.323 --> 00:00:44.460
So, let's open up these Kinder
Surprise Eggs, the real deal,

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.759
and see what's they're like.

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:47.442
Go ahead and tear through those boxes.

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:49.439
Now, you get two eggs in each box.

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:50.762
I think they're about two

00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:52.921
to two and a half
dollars, U.S. price each.

00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:55.030
We paid in pesos here.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.609
How are they looking?

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:58.421
Any clues on the outside?
- [Roxanna] Very nice.

00:00:58.421 --> 00:00:59.768
(rattling)

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.045
- [Parris] Do these look authentic?

00:01:01.045 --> 00:01:02.565
We think they look pretty authentic.

00:01:02.565 --> 00:01:03.924
We're gonna taste 'em now and see

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:05.328
how the chocolate compares to those

00:01:05.328 --> 00:01:08.184
possibly less authentic eggs
that we tried last time.

00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:10.123
Let's open 'em up and see.

00:01:10.123 --> 00:01:14.605
These are not broken, so it
seems a shame to damage them.

00:01:14.605 --> 00:01:16.243
- [Roxanna] Yeah.
- Ugh, I don't know

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:17.251
how to open these.

00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:18.145
- There we go.
- [Roxanna] These are packed

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:19.005
really well.

00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:20.282
- Oh, one piece.

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:22.409
- [Ximena] Oh there.
- Now this is different,

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.312
look on the inside, it's white.

00:01:24.312 --> 00:01:26.692
Like is it white chocolate or a,

00:01:27.262 --> 00:01:28.879
some kind of a milky thing?

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:30.569
I'm gonna eat it and see.

00:01:34.858 --> 00:01:36.107
Tastes a lot different
than that other egg.

00:01:36.107 --> 00:01:37.128
- Oh, mine cracked.

00:01:37.128 --> 00:01:39.163
- Here is what you find inside.

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:41.107
Let me show you the inside of the egg too.

00:01:41.107 --> 00:01:43.846
It's white, so I'm still not sure.

00:01:43.846 --> 00:01:45.287
I'm thinking that's kind
of a white chocolate.

00:01:45.287 --> 00:01:47.469
I like this better than
the last chocolate,

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:48.468
so go ahead and try that

00:01:48.468 --> 00:01:49.652
and see what you think.

00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:52.972
Here's the capsule that
comes inside with your toy.

00:01:52.972 --> 00:01:54.725
How do you like the chocolate?

00:01:54.725 --> 00:01:57.314
- It tastes as if it's
more professionally made.

00:01:57.314 --> 00:01:59.132
- Higher quality chocolate, okay.

00:01:59.132 --> 00:02:02.070
Now these don't have
theme, it's just for girls.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.096
So I'm curious what
they think is for girls.

00:02:05.096 --> 00:02:09.048
Okay, some assembly is
required, it looks like.

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:11.560
Oh, a lot of assembly is required.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.940
Oh my gosh, look at this thing.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.219
It's lots of pieces.

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.273
- Oh, mine came out assembled, sorta.

00:02:16.273 --> 00:02:18.096
Well mostly, just the crown.
- [Parris] Oh, okay.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:19.720
Well, let's show you what we got.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.683
In my egg I found this sheet of,

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:24.562
I think it's one or two sentence warning

00:02:24.562 --> 00:02:26.141
in so many different languages.

00:02:26.141 --> 00:02:29.055
And I think it says "Don't eat the toy."

00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:29.821
But I'm not entirely sure,

00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:32.352
cause I couldn't find
English amongst all these.

00:02:34.648 --> 00:02:37.066
And this is what the finished
product should look like.

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.519
A little instruction on how to assemble it

00:02:39.907 --> 00:02:41.264
and how you can play with it.

00:02:41.264 --> 00:02:42.344
Looks good.

00:02:42.344 --> 00:02:43.982
Here's what the first toy ended up being,

00:02:43.982 --> 00:02:46.745
it's a ring, I guess for nina fingers,

00:02:46.745 --> 00:02:48.451
cause it doesn't fit on mine.

00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:50.390
And it's a flower.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.470
Looks kinda pretty.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.490
Now Roxanna's toy has frustrated us

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.721
and turned our fingers blue.

00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:56.612
In theory this is a cool toy.

00:02:56.612 --> 00:03:00.344
It's a little pen and when
you assemble the whole thing,

00:03:02.334 --> 00:03:04.493
and when you assemble all the pieces,

00:03:04.493 --> 00:03:08.576
it's a top that you can spin
and it will draw on your paper.

00:03:08.576 --> 00:03:10.840
But we can't get the
thing to stay together.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.756
So in theory this might be a cool toy.

00:03:12.756 --> 00:03:14.485
In practice, isn't quite working out.

00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:15.600
And Ximena, what did you get?

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.174
And Ximena got this,
is it a regular horse,

00:03:20.174 --> 00:03:21.834
a flying horse?
- [Ximena] A pony.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.343
- [Parris] It's a what?
- [Ximena] Pony.

00:03:23.343 --> 00:03:24.201
- [Parris] It's a pony.

00:03:24.201 --> 00:03:25.898
- [Ximena] Or a horse, one of those.

00:03:25.898 --> 00:03:27.082
Something normal.

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:28.661
- [Parris] Yeah, it's
something cute and normal,

00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:31.283
And doesn't seem to fall
apart, so we like that.

00:03:31.283 --> 00:03:33.884
- [Ximena] And then,
we opened the last egg,

00:03:33.884 --> 00:03:34.721
- [Parris] Oh yes.
- [Ximena] and we got,

00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:35.823
- [Parris] We got hungry (laughing)

00:03:35.823 --> 00:03:39.654
We figured out the secret of these things.

00:03:39.654 --> 00:03:41.675
They give you the
chocolate so you can deal

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:44.623
with the frustration of
assembling the tiny little toys.

00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:45.657
So we needed some more chocolate,

00:03:45.657 --> 00:03:48.092
so we opened the fourth egg,
and let's see what that was.

00:03:48.092 --> 00:03:49.229
- [Ximena] It sort of came apart.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.169
- [Parris] Oh, Okay.
- [Ximena] It's super

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.190
very delicate.
- [Parris] Hold it up here

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.850
as much as you can.

00:03:54.493 --> 00:03:56.698
Towards the lens, ahhh!

00:03:56.698 --> 00:03:59.195
It's a puzzle, as you can see.
(laughing)

00:03:59.195 --> 00:04:00.217
All right.

00:04:00.217 --> 00:04:01.656
So, that's our experience

00:04:01.656 --> 00:04:04.059
with the real Kinder Surprise Eggs.

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:06.672
Chocolate was good, we both
really liked the chocolate,

00:04:06.672 --> 00:04:07.877
Ximena said she liked the taste

00:04:07.877 --> 00:04:09.551
of the other chocolate better.

00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:10.236
- Yep.

00:04:10.236 --> 00:04:12.286
- Everyone has their own
tastes, but I definitely think

00:04:12.286 --> 00:04:14.143
this chocolate was more expensive.

00:04:14.143 --> 00:04:16.837
The toys, were okay.

00:04:16.837 --> 00:04:19.055
I'm actually liking
those theme toys better.

00:04:19.055 --> 00:04:20.715
- Yeah.
- [Roxanna] Yeah.

00:04:20.715 --> 00:04:22.096
- Like we've tried back in the U.S.,

00:04:22.096 --> 00:04:23.884
the Spiderman toy egg series

00:04:23.884 --> 00:04:26.182
and then the Yowie eggs,
those were so nice,

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:27.855
- [Roxanna] Those were amazing
- the toys that came in those.

00:04:27.855 --> 00:04:29.085
- Those were my favorite eggs so far.

00:04:29.085 --> 00:04:29.921
- Yes, yes.

00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:31.860
- So we've got more of
these to get through.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.694
Hopefully more good chocolate than bad.

00:04:33.694 --> 00:04:36.225
We'll be back tomorrow
with another one of these,

00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:38.199
internet here permitting.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.418
Okay, so what did you guys think

00:04:39.418 --> 00:04:42.842
of the real Kinder Surprise Egg for girls?

00:04:42.842 --> 00:04:47.115
- Well, I think that the
chocolate was really delicious,

00:04:47.962 --> 00:04:50.819
but the prizes inside and everything,

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.674
it more seems like they
don't quite know exactly,

00:04:53.674 --> 00:04:55.682
what, like to put in.
- [Parris] Okay.

00:04:55.682 --> 00:04:57.423
- As with the themed
ones it's more of like

00:04:57.423 --> 00:04:59.235
this is exactly what they would want.

00:04:59.235 --> 00:05:01.126
- Okay, what did you think?

00:05:01.126 --> 00:05:04.061
- [Ximena] Honestly, I liked
the themed ones better.

00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:07.126
Like, I don't really
like the white chocolate.

00:05:07.126 --> 00:05:08.535
- [Parris] Oh, that was inside
- It's not my favorite.

00:05:08.535 --> 00:05:09.451
- right, um hmm.

00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:11.786
- Like, I sorta like
it, but not my favorite.

00:05:11.786 --> 00:05:13.968
So I like the other chocolate better,

00:05:13.968 --> 00:05:16.673
plus I like the theme things, cause,

00:05:16.673 --> 00:05:19.866
you sorta knew what to
expect and plus you knew

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:21.329
stuff that you liked and you knew

00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:22.628
you would get that sort of stuff.

00:05:22.628 --> 00:05:23.964
- That's true, you had a pretty good idea

00:05:23.964 --> 00:05:24.707
of what you were gonna get.

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:25.984
And you can make a whole collection.

00:05:25.984 --> 00:05:28.248
I don't know about collecting these toys.

00:05:28.248 --> 00:05:30.384
Okay, well we gave them a try.

00:05:30.384 --> 00:05:33.925
We still have official Kinder
Eggs for boys to give a try to.

00:05:33.925 --> 00:05:36.096
And then we have a whole
bunch more themed eggs.

00:05:36.096 --> 00:05:39.451
Also, we will be doing
maybe two a day videos,

00:05:39.451 --> 00:05:40.891
it depends on how the internet goes.

00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:43.096
We've got some vlog stuff
to do about our travels

00:05:43.096 --> 00:05:45.338
here in Mexico, including out at the coast

00:05:45.338 --> 00:05:46.812
and in Mexico City.

00:05:46.812 --> 00:05:48.692
We're planning to do a couple challenges.

00:05:48.692 --> 00:05:50.713
So be sure and stay tuned for that.
