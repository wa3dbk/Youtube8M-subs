- OH, YES, IT'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO MAKE

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.600

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.600
JUST BECAUSE I AM BLACK,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.133
WE KNOW I'M BLACK,

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.533
AND I'M FROM THE WORLD
OF HIP-HOP,

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:28.100
THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT I'M NOT
GONNA PLAY ALL TYPES OF MUSIC

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.833
AND MY MIND IS NOT DIVERSE.

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:32.833

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:36.133
AND ALSO JUST--EVERYBODY, WE ALL
LISTEN TO ALL TYPES OF MUSIC.

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.333
IT'S NOT STEREOTYPED.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.200
