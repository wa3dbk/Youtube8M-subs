Many of you drink tea to warm up in the autumn or winter, but what about the summer?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In the summer tea refreshes even better, when it's brewed cold with a special method called 'cold brew'.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Today I will show you how to make your own ice tea in an easy and healthy way, with no effort.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.990
Czajnikowy.pl for the summer!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.990
For cold brew you can use any type of tea that you like. My personal favourites are green tea or yerba mate.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.990
But we tried on other types, too: for example Rooibos, black tea, 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
actually any tea will 'brew' in this way... well, it's not literally brewing, as it is just called 'cold brew'. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.990
We don't use boiling water for it but it's possible too. Ok, I messed it all up a bit, let's clear it up.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Look, you just need water, some tea, and a container, as well as a fridge. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.990
Just put tea into the mug, pour it over with water, and put it into the fridge for around 2 hours, or even better - overnight.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.990
The next morning you have delicious, icy freezing ice tea.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
What about the boiling water? Well, you can brew it with it at first, drink it hot or throw away,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and then brew those leaves with cold water. Thanks to it the leaves are more open and you can get more of the taste.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Bear in mind that this kind of tea is less rich in all those substances, as the leaves stay in the brew all night,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and it theoretically should overbrew but it doesn't as it is not brewing in fact.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.990
You will still get all those substances but in smaller amount - tannin which gives it a bitter taste. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And now, why tea overbrews? It stays in the leaves mostly. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.990
However, what's a negative aspect of cold brew is that the caffeine and antioxidants 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
get into tea in around half a smaller amount than in case of standard brew.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.990
Hence, it won't boost you but it'll refresh you for sure. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.990
The biggest benefit of this tea is that there is no work with it actually. Just look.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Here we have various kinds of tea: green, flavoured, we have Roiboos, yerba, gunpowder and Chinese sencha. 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I'll show you on this one. Here is a Chinese sencha that was brewing cold all night. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.990
What proportions should we apply here? 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
To be honest, I like to put in more but optimally, it's best to use 2 tablespoons of dried leaves per 1-1,5 l water.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.990
You can easily take mineral water, you can buy the whole bottle and cool it at once, and then pour.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.990
I like more as the flavour is more intense but it depends what you like. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
You should try and taste it. The tea is poured into the jug, now pour it over with cold water.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
You can use some filter or brewer for it or just do it my way and after it brews, just strain it through a sift into another jug.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
As you can see, nothing happens here yet. It takes at least 2 hours but optimally, just do it at night and into the fridge

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.990
and on a sunny morning you can enjoy it.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.990
The final result will be like this:

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.990
Well, you have to admit it even looks a bit different than typically brewed green tea. 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It has more refreshing, icy colour. It should be less green, more yellow if we brewed it with warm water as usual.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.990
And thanks to this, we have a nice effect to it. 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.990
For cold brew you can use all types of tea - any kind of tea that you like.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.990
It can be pure green tea, black, or with additives, flavours, flowers, etc.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.990
It can also be fruit tea, even Rooibos, yerba mate, - anything you like.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.990
No matter which you choose, it will work great and tasty with cold brew method.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.990
It's really easy. Instead of buying, just pour it and put into the fridge overnight. 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.990
Next morning just sift it and add whatever you like - sugar, lemon, or nothing at all.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.990
Personally, I prefer pure iced tea like this.  Perfect flavour of tea. 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.990
But as I said - you can add something to it, make your own ice tea, just have fun with it.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
If anything comes to your mind - pour it over cold brew and let it stay cold overnight. 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
By the way, remember that we save energy in this way as we don't need to boil water. 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.990
Traditionally, ice tea is brewed with hot water and cooled down. Why come so many things when you can just brew it cold.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.990
I encourage you to try it. That's all about ice tea. 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.990
Write to us about what you managed to make and which way you like the iced tea.
