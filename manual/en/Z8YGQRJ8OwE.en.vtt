00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.460
in

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.709
we've recently upgraded the door hinges
and door catches on our fruit cages

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.769
and i'm going to little bit of a
demonstration now about fit them in and how

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.079
they work

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:15.269
first of all

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.300
normally when you put a fruit cage
together

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.929
the hard work is over

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.000
slice

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.720
but if you have updated your fruit cage

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.830
or if you forget to put this door hinge and door catch on during assembly

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.839
there's another way

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.290
this is the other way I've found

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.670
just warm up the hinge

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.670
warm enough to then prise apart  the pieces

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.620
slide on the upright of the fruit cage

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.100
americorp site

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.180
much of the hinge

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.500
side is in the right originations how
you want to mount or in this case adobe

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.780
engine this way

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.450
and and then simply

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.850
slide the bolts for it

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.040
and these are not

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.449
providers

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.160
and again using yelling keywords
provided in the kit

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:15.160
simply tighten up

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.960
sodas net that up

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.530
when you're ready to put the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.909
some apart

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.500
onto the door frame

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.320
through the next

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.820
now the legally opposing hinge book
