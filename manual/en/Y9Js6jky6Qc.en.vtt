00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.610
Towards this beauty lit up by the light
of the swaying moon

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.030
It seems like the shadows of people’s grief
and gloom are piling up once again

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.830
As I’ve forgotten, I act clueless,
even if I’m forgiven for coming to life

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.970
My ticking heartbeat will not forget
the dazzling life that’s passed by

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.050
Spilling and falling over
(to the shadows shaken by the resounding rhythm)

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.990
The two sounds come to stack together
(as the answer still can not be seen)

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.590
That it’s been so long I’ve turned to ashes
and became trash, isn’t that fine?

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.850
That I was turning back and forth and
got lost again, isn’t that fine?

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.450
So I want to make this beat resonate in your heart

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.130
be together “bEAT GATHER”

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.810
I wanted to send something off, so it went high,
whatever it became, isn’t that fine?

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.170
Whatever I like or found important or
ended up losing, isn’t it fine?

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.690
So I want to engrave this beat with my own hands

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.750
be together “bEAT GATHER”

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.850
Pulling in the strings of
the sinking moon’s light, a crack developed

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.290
It seems like the darkness sunk in the passion of
people is entwined here once again

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.190
Melting away right here
(to the shadows shaken by the resounding rhythm)

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.530
The two sounds are unclear
(as the end still can not be seen)

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.770
That I wished upon stars and looked back on myself
and forgave my heart, isn’t that fine?

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.010
That everything was a dream and I cried alone
and opened my eyes, isn’t that fine?

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.650
So I want to make this beat resonate
throughout the world

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.390
be together “bEAT GATHER”

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.050
I want to destroy, and so it all went up high
and became hurt, isn’t that fine?

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.330
Everyone’s doing as they please,
they’re up to trouble, so who cares, isn’t it fine?

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.890
So I want this beat to be pierced in
your heart though it hurts

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.270
be together “bEAT GATHER”

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:05.270
I can’t even overtake this sorrow,
nor can I even keep up with what is right

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:12.130
Far through the world,
throughout the future, if it’ll reach, if it’ll be heard

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.110
no matter how many times it’ll take,
I’ll say be together be together…

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.730
That it’s been so long I’ve turned to ashes
and became trash, isn’t that fine?

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.070
That I was turning back and forth and
got lost again, isn’t that fine?

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.590
So I want to make this beat resonate in your heart

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.250
be together “bEAT GATHER”

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.990
I wanted to send something off,
so it went high, whatever it became, isn’t that fine?

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.350
Whatever I like or found important or
ended up losing, isn’t it fine?

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.890
So I want to engrave this beat with my own hands

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.170
be together “bEAT GATHER”
