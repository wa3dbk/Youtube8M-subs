00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.860
So DC recently ish announced their film lineup.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.830
And there are some exciting titles to be seen
here.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.930
Justice League, Flash, Wonder Woman.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.330
I was a little that there is no Wonder Twins
movie in the works but that’s why I’m

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.330
here.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.250
Today I’m going through the 5 DC movies
that have not been announced that I personally

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.250
would love to see.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.520
I won’t be including a solo Batman movie
or a sequel to Man of Steel here because those

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.640
are already in the works.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.910
Alright, the intro’s done.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.910
Let’s start.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.750
Starting off at number 5 is Booster Gold.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.720
Booster Gold, or Michael Jon Carter, is an
arrogant superhero from the future who went

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.450
back in time to seek glory and fame and all
that jazz.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.060
He used his future tech and his knowledge
of past events to stage heroic rescues that

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.060
really weren’t that heroic.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.420
However, after some personal loss and lessons
and such things, Booster Gold becomes a true

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.530
hero more or less.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.110
This would be a visually stunning movie to
see.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.110
Booster Gold, as you may have gathered, is
very gold oriented.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.470
With the help of future gadgets he can fly,
shoot power blasts, punch people, everything.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.420
He also has a pretty cool little robot called
Skeets that flies around with him everywhere.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.090
Also, there was a Booster Gold easter egg
in Man of Steel.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.479
The Blaze Comics logo in the background hints
at, well, Blaze Comics, a fictional comic

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.470
distributor that publish Booster Gold comics
in the DC Universe.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.670
So that might be a nod to the fact that DC
is already making this.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.670
Hopefully.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.759
Number 4 is Black Canary.

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.299
This is a pretty interesting character.

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.909
She’s a martial arts expert and knows how
to use lots of weapons.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.070
But what she’s most known for is her screech,
or the canary cry.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.549
The sonic scream can shatter glass and pretty
much immobilize most enemies.

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.319
She’s also most frequently seen with Green
Arrow, who she’s romantically involved with

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.299
and who she eventually marries in the comics.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.510
It would also be good to see more superheroine
movies, because while it’s great that Marvel

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.209
and DC are both branching out to non male
centric movies, keep in mind that between

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:41.350
the two of them, there are only two female
superhero movies coming out over the next

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.350
five years.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.130
At number 3 is Martian Manhunter.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.950
This would be an amazing movie but only if
it’s done the right way.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.020
Martian Manhunter, or J’ohnn is ridiculously
overpowered.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.610
To name all of his powers would take a whole
other video, but just to round them up: he

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.960
can fly, he’s as strong as Superman, he
can read minds, he can shape shift, he can

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.299
become intangible, he can shoot lasers from
his eyes.

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.540
He is all around the superhero that you’d
like to be.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.679
And he only really has one weakness: fire.

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.079
Well, he has a few others, but those don’t
really matter.

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.170
This is what I mean by doing the movie the
right way.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.660
There needs to be a villain that actually
can be a match to this walking set of powers.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.600
Perhaps those aliens that appeared in the
first episode of the Justice League cartoon.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.480
Anyway, if you got a good lead for J’ohnn
and a good director, then this would be an

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.700
amazing film.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.280
Coming in at number 2 is Nightwing.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.830
Some people might be a little surprised that
Nightwing isn’t number 1, but oh well.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.830
Can’t please everyone.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.070
If you don’t know who Nightwing is, he’s
normally speaking Dick Grayson, the previous

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.920
Robin who went on to greater things.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.730
Some other heroes have also taken on the mantle.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.050
Nightwing was trained by Batman but isn’t
a Batman ripoff, he uses those electro stick

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.110
things to beat up criminals, and he’s all
around a really cool character.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.970
He also doesn’t have to be in Gotham but
rather Bludhaven, his own little crime infested

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:48.970
city.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.110
Now before I get to number 1, here are a few
characters that I still want to see get movies

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.310
but they just couldn’t make it.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:16.340
Since there are 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.240
only 5 slots.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:32.740
Green Lantern (John Stewart)
Deathstroke

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.050
Zatanna

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.780
And my number 1 is of course Bouncing Boy.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.670
Seriously, I can’t wait to see him just
bounce all over some bad guys.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.420
What a cinematic masterpiece that’ll be.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.450
No, my actual number 1 is The Question.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.190
Now I realize that quite a few people may
not know who the Question is, which is a shame

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.960
considering what a cool character he is.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.890
Like I’ve said before, he’s like Batman
but with no face and also without that one

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:55.890
rule.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.890
He will kill if he has to.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.060
In the Justice League cartoon, he tries to
kill Lex Luthor to save the free world.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.680
However, it turns out Lex Luthor was a tentacle
robot, so you know, there’s that.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.590
He’s super smart, super sneaky, super interesting,
and is not one to play by the rules that other

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.590
heroes play by.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.210
Slender-Man meets Sherlock Holmes.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.210
Boom.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.340
So, those are the DC movies that I’d love
to see.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.140
What movie that isn’t on the slate do you
want?

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.410
