00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:02.726
(Classical music)

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:09.535
- This is not my natural hair color.

00:00:09.535 --> 00:00:12.170
There are three basic
chemical formulations of

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.040
hair dye.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.815
Temporary, semi-permanent, and permanent.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:17.673
Before we look at what
each of them do, let's

00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:20.018
look at the physical structure of hair.

00:00:20.018 --> 00:00:21.678
Hair is deadstuff.

00:00:21.678 --> 00:00:24.511
Three layers of slightly
different dead stuff.

00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:27.414
The core, called the
medulla, is not pertinent to

00:00:27.414 --> 00:00:28.679
our interest today at all.

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.618
But it's surrounded by a
thick layer of cells called

00:00:30.618 --> 00:00:34.077
the cortex, no relation
to your brain's cortex.

00:00:34.077 --> 00:00:36.656
It's where you find the
pigmented melanin proteins

00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:38.420
that give hair its color.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.835
Protecting the cortex is
hair's outermost layer,

00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:41.972
the cuticle.

00:00:41.972 --> 00:00:45.177
As hair's armor, it's made
up of overlapping scales.

00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:47.778
Temporary dye just sticks to the cuticle.

00:00:47.778 --> 00:00:50.437
It's more like paint really,
and it'll usually circle

00:00:50.437 --> 00:00:52.654
the drain with your next shampoo.

00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:54.999
- Semi-permanent dye
contains molecules of pigment

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.053
so tiny, that they can slip
between the scales of the

00:00:58.053 --> 00:01:00.154
cuticle and stick to the cortex.

00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:01.954
But it's still more paint-like.

00:01:01.954 --> 00:01:05.298
It doesn't chemically react
with anything in the hair.

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:09.639
So, a semi-permanent dye
lasts about 12 shampoos max.

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:13.017
Permanent dye, as the name
suggests, is designed to

00:01:13.017 --> 00:01:17.150
stay with your hair until
the hair grows or falls out.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.716
In general, permanent dye
consists of two solutions.

00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:24.012
First, an alkaline chemical
plus two types of particles

00:01:24.012 --> 00:01:26.358
that will come together
to form the new color,

00:01:26.358 --> 00:01:28.678
dye precursors and dye couplers.

00:01:28.678 --> 00:01:29.979
Second, the developer.

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.172
An oxidizer, usually a weak
solution of hydrogen peroxide.

00:01:34.172 --> 00:01:37.120
You, or your salon
professional, mix the two

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.872
together right before
applying them to your hair.

00:01:39.872 --> 00:01:42.612
The alkaline chemical,
either ammonia or a more

00:01:42.612 --> 00:01:46.176
gentle substitute, goes to
work opening up the cuticle.

00:01:46.176 --> 00:01:48.475
For dye to be most
effective, it needs to access

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:49.519
hair's cortex.

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:52.537
Alkaline stuff temporary
softens and relaxes the

00:01:52.537 --> 00:01:53.920
cuticle's scales.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.217
The next hurdle in achieving
a new hair color is

00:01:56.217 --> 00:01:59.676
getting rid of some of the
existing color, the melanin in

00:01:59.676 --> 00:02:00.813
the hair's cortex.

00:02:00.813 --> 00:02:02.218
Enter the developer.

00:02:02.218 --> 00:02:05.480
It oxidizes the melanin
molecules, breaking melanin's

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.359
double carbon carbon
electron bonds and giving

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:11.692
up one of it's own oxygen
atoms to fill in the space.

00:02:11.692 --> 00:02:12.540
The result?

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.359
The melanin turns colorless
and releases sulfur atoms.

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.554
That's right, part of
permanent dye's characteristic

00:02:18.554 --> 00:02:21.259
stink isn't actually the
dye at all, but an element

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.522
of your hair passing into the air.

00:02:23.522 --> 00:02:25.914
But that's not the developer's only job.

00:02:25.914 --> 00:02:28.456
It also kicks off the
reaction that brings together

00:02:28.456 --> 00:02:32.834
the new color molecules by
oxidizing the dye precursors.

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:35.318
These are usually colorless
chemicals that develop

00:02:35.318 --> 00:02:37.372
color when oxidized.

00:02:37.372 --> 00:02:40.438
The resulting pigmented
particles, called intermediates,

00:02:40.438 --> 00:02:43.120
are monomers that, left
to their own devices,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.720
would slip through the cuticle scales like

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.079
semi-permanent dye.

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.272
But, the dye couplers react
with the intermediates to

00:02:50.272 --> 00:02:53.092
form polymers of pigment
that are too big to

00:02:53.092 --> 00:02:54.276
just slip back out.

00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:56.437
That's how permanent color
resists fading through

00:02:56.437 --> 00:02:57.551
multiple washes.

00:02:57.551 --> 00:02:59.339
It's trapped beneath the cuticle.

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:01.811
So, that answers today's
question, but I've got

00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:03.019
one for you.

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.053
What hair color do you most want to try?

00:03:05.053 --> 00:03:06.863
I am thinking about going to purple, but

00:03:06.863 --> 00:03:09.278
aside from that, I think
I would look very fetching

00:03:09.278 --> 00:03:11.476
with some eyebrow
tinting as a honey blonde

00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:12.617
and a perm.
