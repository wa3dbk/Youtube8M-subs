00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.520
What's happening food tube, I'm going to make
a banana and guava ketchup. DJ BBQ has done

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.670
a chunky banana ketchup, beautiful. I'm going
to do my own ketchup using guava, which is

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.040
quite native to Jamaica.
Got a pot, got a banana, let's chop this up

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:25.990
just to help it break down. I want to go two
bananas. These are the guavas. Let's give

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.210
it a little peel. It's like mixture really,
of a pear and an apple.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.180
You don't have to take any of the seeds out
like you do in a pear, just put the whole

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.510
lot in. Two of these, that's all I need. Boom,
in it goes. Banana and guava.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.940
When it comes to putting in your vinegar and
sugar it's all about balancing. So the sugar

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.760
for the sweetness and the vinegar for the
sharpness.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.790
Caster sugar, two heaped tablespoons I reckon
in there so far. Right I've got white wine

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.229
vinegar here. I'm going to put about 50mls
in. All this is doing is really loosening

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:04.260
it up and adding that acidity to it. Let's
pop the heat on.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.480
Lovely. Keep an eye on it because it will
take literally minutes. Little bit of water

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.980
in there. Now I'm just going to mash it up
a little bit. I just want to see the consistency

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.810
and if I need to add any more vinegar or water.
Let's have a little look.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.130
Sweet, acidic, the banana hasn't had enough
of a chance yet, it's not quite ripe but once

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.610
I blitz it up. Boom, we'll be there! Wonderful.
I'm going to let it tick away, when it starts

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.250
boiling, give it a minute.
Can you see there? It's just enough liquid

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.800
just to keep it all together.
Spot on, the guava's coming through, little

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.840
bit of banana now and that acidity from the
vinegar is not as harsh as it was before.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.070
So that's ready.
if you haven't got one of these blenders,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.550
don't panic you can have it quite chunky if
you like. If you've got a potato masher or

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.910
something like that or a ricer. Put it through
that.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:11.660
Good. I want it really smooth, so I'm going
to put it through a little sieve first you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.230
know what I mean. Oh yeah!
Now I'm going to let that cool down and it

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.140
will be ready to go beautiful.
That's my banana and guava ketchup complete.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.590
Wonderful west Indian fried chicken, wow.
Ketchup we made, banana and guava. Little

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.990
bit of that on top.
Mmmm, that ketchup's banging. If you can get

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.700
your hands on some guava go for it guys, it
really is worth it.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.760
Mate, I'm off.
