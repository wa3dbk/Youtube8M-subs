00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.360
Hello, this is Scott and this is the Hyper
Report.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.640
Here are quotes for various items.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.699
First...

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.760
Euro Falls over Greece?

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.280
According to the Bank for International Settlements,
26.45 trillion dollars in currency derivatives

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.700
are directly tied to the value

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.700
of the euro.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.540
If Greece does leave the Eurozone, the euro
is likely to fall off the cliff.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.270
What's more, Alan Greenspan is betting

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.780
that Greece will leave the Eurozone and this
could force other southern European countries,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.379
like Italy, out.

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:37.379
Next...

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:38.379
Inside Scoop

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.890
We are being told that Obama had very specific
intelligence about where the ISIS hostages

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.660
were being held; but, he did not act.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.660
Of

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.660
course he didn't act.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.510
That is because ISIS is a CIA controlled operation
and Obama will not act against ISIS now that

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.510
he has finally

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.720
acknowledged that ISIS is linked to Islam.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.030
With Obama, like every other politician, watch
what they do and not what they say.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.090
Next...

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.090
Global Crisis To Get Worse

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.760
According to Richard Russel, with the news
out of Greece, the global crisis will get

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.600
even worse as the debt load has actually been

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.000
accelerating to the upside.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.650
To that end, he recommends dumping common
stocks and buying gold and silver.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.730
In addition, with the U.S.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.020
budget deficit running 6.2% higher than last
year, U.S. Treasuries are definitely something

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.209
to be avoided.

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:18.209
Next...

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:19.509
Censorship of Websites

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.270
Certain members of the FCC are excited about
reversing the 2006 decision to keep their

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.079
hands off the internet as they are open to

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.200
new ideas like censorship for bloggers and
new taxes.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.889
They're doing this under the guise of blocking
unregulated political

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:34.779
donations; however, it is important to remember
that control is the name of the game folks.

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:36.829
Who knows, perhaps within Obama's secret

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.560
plan to take over the internet, crypto-currencies,
like Bitcoin, may become illegal.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.560
Next...

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.560
Disappeared on Unemployment?

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.250
Gallup CEO Jim Clifton told CNBC that he might
“suddenly disappear” for telling the truth

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.680
about real the unemployment rate that has

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.299
never recovered and is still above 10%.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.049
Like the bankers, it is more likely he will
be suicided.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.139
(Sound of Woman Scream)

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:57.139
Next...

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:58.139
Fiddling with Data

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:02.729
Future generations will look upon the global-warming
scare of the past 30 years with absolute disgust.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.759
They will know, as many are

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.520
finding out now, how data was purposely manipulated,
by money hungry scientists to drum up research

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.020
dollars, for a scam that caused

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.070
politicians to prostitute themselves for.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.670
There have been over 1,350 peer-reviewed publications
supporting this global warming scam;

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.220
thus, this illustrates a massive case of group-think
where people, desiring harmony or conformity,

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.700
made irrational or dysfunctional

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.379
conclusions.

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.980
Finally, please prepare now for the escalating
economic and social unrest.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.700
Good Day!
