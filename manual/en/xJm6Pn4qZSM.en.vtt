00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.330
With video in mind, Olympus introduces the
E-M5 Mark II

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.690
The new OM-D E-M5 Mark II gets 40 megapixels
from its 16-megapixels sensorâ€¦ but how?

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.679
The original OM-D E-M5 has had a great run
since being announced roughly two years ago,

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.809
but it's time for an upgrade.

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:20.630
Accordingly, Olympus is taking the wraps off
of the E-M5 Mark II, a Micro Four Thirds camera

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.220
that aims to go head to head with the likes
of Sony's recently released A7 II and other

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.589
similar mirrorless shooters.

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:34.140
Olympus says that the second-generation E-M5
isn't here to replace its flagship OM-D camera,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.120
the E-M1 though it very well could, at least
on paper.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.250
And even though it is very similar in looks
to its predecessor, the E-M5 Mark II brings

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.100
enough internal changes to make it a worthy
successor.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.780
For starters, it packs a redesigned 16-megapixel
Live MOS sensor, coupled with a TruePic VII

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.179
image processor, an upgraded 81-point autofocus
system, a 40-megapixel high-res shot mode,

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.720
a 3-inch (articulating) touchscreen and WiFi.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.360
Where the E-M5 shines, however, and how it
differentiates itself from the first model,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.550
is with the video-focused specs it features.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:26.690
This time around, Olympus has added support
for 1080p shooting at 24/25/30/50/60 fps;

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.780
it can handle up to 77 Mbps bit rate at 30
fps, which is great news for those of you

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.580
who are into that sort of thing.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.380
Naturally, the company betting big on its
in-body five-axis image stabilization system

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.430
to help with video -- this is similar to what's
found on the Sony A7 II, with Olympus emphasizing

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.000
that it was the one to pioneer such technology.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.090
What's more, photography-wise, the E-M5 Mark
II, which is dustproof and splashproof, has

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:05.740
a max ISO of 25,600, a 9 fps sequential-shooting
mode (with focus locked) and a battery rating

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.740
of 470 shots.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:16.120
The OM-D E-M5 Mark II will be available, in
black and silver, later this month for $1,100

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.690
(body-only).

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.280
Meanwhile, if you already own the top-of-the-line
E-M1, you should expect to get a firmware

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.269
update over the next few days, which Olympus
says is due to enhance the camera's overall

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.799
performance and bump its sequential shooting
support from 6.5 to 9 fps.
