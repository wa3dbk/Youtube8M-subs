00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.559
Mike Adams: I've done extensive research on
what's called a “metals capturing capacity”

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.930
of different types of foods. I call it the MCC, where I

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.150
test using a synthetic gastric-acid-digestion
simulator that I built in the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.820
lab. I test foods versus contaminants. I find out how much of the contaminant gets bound

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.510
to the food, and thereby carried out of your digestive tract

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.760
as insoluble fiber, rather than being absorbed
through your intestinal

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.670
walls and going into your blood. This is a
key concept to understand to answer your question.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.129
Processed foods
have very low capturing capacity because

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.469
the fibers are typically processed out of
them. They're also

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.629
structurally compromised through processing.
They're denatured in other words.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.500
Ty Bollinger: Right. Which makes them into un-food.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.850
Mike Adams: Un-food. So, if you eat, let's

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.560
say a processed-food meal or a beverage that
is

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.330
contaminated with let's say 10 parts-per-million mercury, you are likely to absorb the vast majority

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.490
of that mercury through
your intestinal walls that goes into your

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.780
blood. Or it could be radioactive cesium-137.
Mercury, cesium, lead,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:27.490
cadmium, you name it. Ty Bollinger: Whatever it might be. Mike Adams: Right, but if you are
eating a diet of unprocessed fresh foods.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.040
This is a whole plant-based diet.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.460
It doesn't have to be 100% plants.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.470
What we have found is
that natural plants, fresh produce such as

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.340
strawberries, have very
high natural metals-capturing capacity. They're

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.970
able to bind with the metals, mostly through
physical

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:57.079
processes of absorption and adsorption as
well. Some foods have selective ionic affinity

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.530
to specific metals
such as lead.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.020
Ty: Okay, which means that they?
Mike Adams: That they have a chemical reaction

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.130
that binds up the metal. It's chemistry taking
place in

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:15.400
the acidic environment of your stomach technically
with your own gastric acid. So, strawberries

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.700
for example,
this was something that I researched. I'm

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.510
still working on the scientific paper to put
this out there, but

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:28.040
strawberries will bind with over 90% of your
dietary mercury - strawberries. The reason

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.530
that this is the case is
because strawberries are the only common fruit

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.560
that has seeds on the outside of the fruit.
The seeds being

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.170
on the outside, how are they grown and how
are they produced by the strawberry? Well,

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.400
there are strands,
fibers that send nutrients to the seeds from

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.560
the center of the strawberry. The center is
where it gets its

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.060
nutrition and distributes it through the fibers
to the seeds. These fibers, which are transparent

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.180
practically under
a microscope, happen to be very, very tough fibers.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.280
They will not be digested by nitric acid in
the laboratory. I can

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:14.310
take strawberries. I can mix nitric acid.
We're talking like 70% nitric acid, a very

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.200
strong oxidizer that would burn
the skin right off of your hand. It will not

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.129
digest the fibers in the strawberry. The fibers
survive human digestion,

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:30.599
which is far weaker than nitric acid digestion;
I mean orders of magnitude weaker. The strawberries

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.819
then will
bind to the dietary mercury with these fibers.

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.670
That gets pushed out of your system through
bowel movements.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.390
The mercury is gone, it's out. It never gets
pulled into your bloodstream through intestinal

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.799
walls. So, many
different types of fruits and vegetables have

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.040
very interesting affinities to heavy metals.
This is what our

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.610
research has really uncovered. The only thing
that we've found better than strawberries,

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.549
by the way, is
chlorella, which is about 98% to 99% efficacy,

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.379
but chlorella doesn't work for other things
such as uranium.

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:10.500
Chlorella doesn't absorb much uranium; spirulina does, but not strawberries. So, one of

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.909
the things that I've
done in the lab is whether it's radioactive

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:19.030
elements such as cesium-137 or customary heavy
metals like

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.220
mercury arsenic and things that cause cancer,
arsenic is linked to cancer, right? Oh, and by the

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.979
way, you know what
tends to absorb arsenic? Fruit seeds.

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.150
Ty Bollinger: Fruit seeds, okay.
Mike Adams: Fruit seeds, which is why some

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.540
fruit seeds contain arsenic naturally. There's
arsenic in apple juice.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.790
Remember that scare? Apple plants
and apple trees tend to take up arsenic in

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.750
the soil, which
came from the lead arsenate pesticides about

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.800
which we already talked. They tend to concentrate
it in the

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.270
seeds because the seeds have a natural affinity
to arsenic. But, if you can get apple seeds,

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.470
grape seeds,
raspberry seeds, blueberry seeds, believe

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.180
it or not. We've tested all of these things.
If you can get your hands

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.940
on these seeds, which by the way are removed
from almost all of the foods that are sold

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.550
in the grocery store.
If you buy grape jam, you don't want seeds

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.729
in it. If you buy blueberry jelly, you don't
want blueberry seeds in it.

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.039
Ty Bollinger: And that's where all the good stuff is.
Mike Adams: It's the seeds that bind with

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.130
the dietary arsenic and transport it out of
your body.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.800
I haven't released that information yet. You're
the first person to have this conversation.
