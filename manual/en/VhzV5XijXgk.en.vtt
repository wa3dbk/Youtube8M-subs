00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.680
As a major airline, your current card
management processes probably give

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.940
new meaning to the term logjam,
especially if that's the number of card

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.240
sales are generated

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.580
then thats how much you've got to
account for

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.750
Well you know how crazy it gets, you
receiving card sales across channels

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.880
leading to all this back and forth
causing serious revenue leakage

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.330
while you go mad trying to process this
stuff manually

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.169
making cash flow forecasting a nightmare.
On top of what's your current systems

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.610
don't understand each other, so to make
them talk

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.399
you gotta do all the running around and
which means two things:

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.469
more errors and more tremors. Of course

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.710
in the midst of which, you surely haven't
managed to reconcile

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.930
each transaction and you can't forget
about those burning customer claims for

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.640
chargebacks, they are impossible to keep up
with and make you wonder if your

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.190
business

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.449
it is indeed a charity. You see the
more card sales you got to deal with

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.320
the more mayhem you're facing and the
more you seem to be bleeding money

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.820
at this rate you can forget about
scaling up your business

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.159
