What’s up everyone my name is chad and in
this video i’ll be unboxing and doing a

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.529
full overview of the 13 inch mid 2014 macbook
pro. Just in case you want to check out the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.110
thirteen inch model, I also have a video on
that along with a comparison between the thirteen

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.870
and fifteen. You can find those links in the
description.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.239
Aesthetically speaking this 2014 macbook pro
is exactly the same as the previous gen. The

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.309
real difference lies within the internals.
But before we get into the specs let’s do

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:43.539
this unboxing.

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:50.020
First we’ll go ahead and set aside the macbook
pro, and next we’ll find the designed by

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.649
apple in california box which holds a quick
start guide, the macbook pro important info

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.170
guide, some apple stickers, and a nice little
cleaning cloth.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.960
Here we’ll find ourselves the power cord
and power brick for charging up the computer,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.930
and that’s it.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.430
This specific macbook pro i’ve unboxed is
the base configutation thirteen inch model.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.200
Now in years past the base model just wouldn’t
be powerful enough to handle any intense editing

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.900
or real work. But this year Apple has bumped
the specs of the MacBook pros across the board.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.810
As far as internal storage goes the base comes
with 128gbs, the mid with 256gbs, and the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.979
high end includes 512gbs of pcie based flash
storage.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.040
The base model goes up from 2.4GHz to 2.6GHz
and the higher end model moves up to 2.8Hz

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.990
from 2.6GHz. And both of these feature a dual
core i5 processor but you can order a custom

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.990
model with an i7 haswell processor.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.229
Another major change is with the ram. Previously
the base 13 inch retina macbook pro just wouldn’t

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.820
be powerful enough with only 4GBs of ram,
but now 8GBs is the standard on all three

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.159
variants of the macbook pro.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.380
The final thing we’re going to do here is
take a tour around the MacBook Pro. On the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.380
left side we have the MagSafe 2 power port,
Two Thunderbolt 2 ports , a USB 3.0 port,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.050
a hedaphone jack, and dual mics.
Towards the right you’ll find the second

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.580
of two usb ports, an hdmi port, and an sd
card slot.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.770
When it comes to the weight and thickness
of the 13 inch pro it’s practically identical

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.770
to the 15 inch model measuring in 1.8 cms
thick and weighing one less pound at 3.6.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.900
So far I’ve been really impressed, it’s
lightning fast and super speedy. If there’s

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.840
