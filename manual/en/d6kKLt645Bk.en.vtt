00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.700
Hey this is Dave DuBose the PA coach.
And today I want to do a little special video for you.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.610
I promise you in a video that I shot
early that I would take you behind

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.210
the scenes and let you know what it's
like at a PA school interview.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.770
I'm not gonna physically take you
there today but in a video in

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.340
the future probably will try to sneak a
camera to the room and give you some

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.340
insider tips. But today we're going to
talk about what goes on behind the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.960
scenes of a PA school interview process.
Now, let me paint the picture for you.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.659
So, we're all in a room sitting on a
table with applications stacked waiting

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:42.900
for our big day of interview, we know
who's coming in first session,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.569
second session, how you guys are going to be split.

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:48.269
What order are we going to bring you in, 
what groups are coming in. All this

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:49.679
information we know.

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.309
So when you walk in, and we're sitting
around a table waiting for you,

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.760
we're already prepared we've gone through your application, we've looked at your

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.139
narrative again and made notes. We've
looked over your GPA, GRE scores.

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:04.890
We got your transcript, cited strengths,
weaknesses, and get to those of

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.000
recommendation, highlighted, underlines
and things that may trigger some

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.259
questions for us.

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.400
So when you walk in we're kind of
prepared and ready for you.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.189
Now, there's a lot of things that happen
sporadically during an interview process, too.

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.600
So when you're sitting there, you may say
something that sparks another question

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.689
from us and we may jot down some
of these and say, "I'm going to go back later

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.119
and ask him this or ask him that.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.020
But for the most part things are pretty
organized and orchestrated. There are

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.500
some questions that you're going to get
that pretty much everybody's going to get.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.000
And then there's a lot of pointed questions that
are going to be strictly for you

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.640
based on the information that we have on you
in front of us.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.439
Makes sense? So when you turn the application in, just know you're giving us the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.560
ammunition. It was to turn around and
lift you up with or potentially break

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.799
it down just a little bit just try to
get in your head and see where you are.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.759
So you walk into the room, you interview. You may do it in a group,

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.000
you may do it individually, you may do with
PAs from the community,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.930
PAs that work at the school on a faculty,
and PA students.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.930
Now, once you leave the room,

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.060
well I take that back, while you're there,
we're secretly making notes about you.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.470
We're jotting it down what we think about
you as an applicant, and we're writing

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.950
you with a red card that we have in
front of us, and it says something like

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.380
accept immediately,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.530
accept, wait list,

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.720
do not accept. Those so many categories
that you will see at most PA programs.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.600
What you want is for everybody around
that table to be checking "accept immediately"

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.900
that means you've blown that interview
out the water or you did blow it out the water.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.950
Now once you leave the room, we sit
around and briefly, because we don't have a

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.940
lot of time because people are coming in.
We briefly discuss you. Yeah we talk about you

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:52.900
behind your back

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.110
and say, "Wow Michael was impressive."

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.230
"Sarah was absolutely phenomenal."

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.050
"Jennifer, I don't know. She seemed a
little nervous, too scared, not really sure.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.310
Her voice was cracking a little too much. All the answers she gave on this,

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.489
I don't know about that." You know so
that's not what kind of break it down

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.800
and we quickly jot down our notes and we
jot down our initial score:

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.630
accept immediately, accept, do not accept, wait list.
You get the drill.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.260
So your goal as a PA applicant when
you walk out of the room after you've

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.300
given your interview, you give it your
best shot.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.840
You want everybody's pin to check their
first box: accept immediately, which means

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.880
we have to have you, we want you, we want you in our program, you have a seat

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.000
expected you to take it or tell us
you want to go to another program.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.500
And that's how it typically goes, alright? So once again this is Dave, the PA coach

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.190
giving you the insider tips that nobody
else is going to give you: taking you

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.280
inside what goes on in a PA interview

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.620
Nobody is going to give you this, guys. Stay tuned I got so much more.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.100
You know who I am. Dave, the PA coach.
I talk to you soon.
