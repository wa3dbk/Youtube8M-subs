00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.670
Leond from League of noobs here I was
looking for a champion spotlight for

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.540
the Xerath rework but I was unable to
find any that were in English. So I

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.609
decide to make my own. This video will be
my first in the champion spotlight style

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:23.250
Xerath the Magus Ascendant. Xerath is a
long-range, area-of-effect, mage, assassin.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.150
His long range allows him to excel at
picking off targets that are either

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.030
unaware of him or running away. Xarath's
passive is mana surge. Mana surge makes

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.879
Xarath's basic attacks restore manna
every 12 seconds this effect will not be

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.260
applied to towers but will be applied to
both minions and champions and will have

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.910
double the effect when used on a
champion Xarath's Q is Arcanopulse this

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.190
is a charged area of effect linear skill
shot. Xerath is able to move while

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.210
charging his attack what a slower will
doing so similar to Varus' piercing

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:08.460
arrow. Xarath's W is Eye of Destruction this
is a ground targeted area of effect

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.680
spell that slows his enemies when hit.
The strength of the slow depends on how

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:22.170
far from the center they are. Xarath's E is
shocking orb this is a linear collision

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.330
skill shot that will stun and do damage
the first target it hits. The stun last

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.170
longer the further it travels so an
opponent at max range will be stunned

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.170
for longer than opponent at point-blank
Xarath's ultimate is Right of Arcane and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.210
Arcane Barrage. Casting Right of Arcane
anchors Xerath in place. While anchored

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.439
Xerath is immune to displacement effects
and he's able to cast arcane barrage up

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.700
to three times. Arcane Barrage is an
extremely long range and high damage

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.070
ground targeted area of effect spell.
This skill allows Xerath to pick off

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.880
enemies from a long range or participate
in place he otherwise wouldn't be able

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.219
to because it feeds you far away its
range increases with bubble making it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.709
extremely dangerous later in the game I
hope you enjoyed watching this as I

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.680
enjoyed making it for more videos like
this make

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.280
subscribe and check out the League of
news blog I put a link in the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.890
description below the UI mod I museum
was made by temporal cortex I've left a

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.150
link to the tutorial for setting up in
