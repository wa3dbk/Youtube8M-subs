00:00:03.247 --> 00:00:04.686
- Beijing.

00:00:04.686 --> 00:00:07.680
Over 20 million people call this home.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.910
When you arrive, you're
bombarded with smells

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.736
and overwhelmed by the density.

00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:15.917
I came here for one reason, to eat.

00:00:15.917 --> 00:00:19.890
With at least eight major
cuisines, this is no easy task.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.138
This time around, my third trip,

00:00:22.138 --> 00:00:24.817
I'm gonna get a little
deeper, see a little more,

00:00:24.817 --> 00:00:27.958
and more importantly, eat the food.

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.719
It would take a lifetime to
see China in its entirety.

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:32.868
So all I can do is just enjoy the ride,

00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:35.961
taste the flavors, and see what happens.

00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:38.951
Today, I'm meeting with a
friend and local food lover,

00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:40.894
who takes me for a culinary tour

00:00:40.894 --> 00:00:45.256
of the morning markets
and hutongs of Beijing.

00:00:45.256 --> 00:00:49.423
(woman speaking in foreign language)

00:01:36.783 --> 00:01:39.884
the jianbing is a popular
morning snack for Beijingers.

00:01:39.884 --> 00:01:42.313
This traditional snack
is made from a batter

00:01:42.313 --> 00:01:45.169
of wheat and grain flour,
topped with an egg,

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:49.675
a bit of cilantro, some crispy
fried cracker, scallions,

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:54.153
a few sauces, and of course,
don't forget the spice.

00:01:54.153 --> 00:01:57.367
Fold it a few times,
serve it steaming hot,

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.206
mmh, and it's ready.

00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:01.495
It's totally worth a try.

00:02:01.495 --> 00:02:04.974
To be honest, I'm more of a
dumples kind of guy myself,

00:02:04.974 --> 00:02:08.333
but this hit the spot on route
to the morning dumple stop.

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:10.724
This jianbing combined
with some steamed beef buns

00:02:10.724 --> 00:02:12.755
was a great warm up for the dumplings

00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:16.667
and incredibly spicy tofu
soup known as do foon young

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:17.750
mmh, so good.

00:03:30.798 --> 00:03:32.880
oh, look at that.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.713
Oh man.

00:03:36.002 --> 00:03:38.181
Some good dumplings, it's all I need.

00:03:38.181 --> 00:03:39.514
I'm a happy man.

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:44.688
Oh, look at that, look at that tofu.

00:03:50.387 --> 00:03:51.804
Mmh, that is hot.

00:03:55.731 --> 00:03:58.150
(Trevor coughs)

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.001
that's really hot.

00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:03.083
After cooling down from that
incredibly spicy tofu soup,

00:04:03.083 --> 00:04:05.925
I was taken for an afternoon
stroll through the hutongs

00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:10.092
of Beijing, en route to a
popular Beijing style restaurant.

00:05:54.956 --> 00:05:57.516
That flavor, a little sweet.

00:05:57.516 --> 00:05:58.349
Real nice.

00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:05.565
Oh yeah, this one right here, this pork,

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:07.293
with a little bit of skin on it,

00:06:07.293 --> 00:06:08.276
is really good.

00:06:08.276 --> 00:06:09.473
It's a little fatty,

00:06:09.473 --> 00:06:11.561
but it's sweet I love that flavor.

00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:15.819
We got some fish here,
and some bamboo shoots

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:17.958
although I gotta say this fish right here,

00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.639
It's cold, and bony, not my favorite,

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.061
but, the pork balls right here,

00:06:24.061 --> 00:06:26.153
really good, kinda deep fried,

00:06:26.153 --> 00:06:29.037
you've got this five spice
blend here you dip it in.

00:06:29.037 --> 00:06:31.139
Really nice, really delicious.

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.355
It's not too spicy it's just a
really nice addition to this.

00:06:34.355 --> 00:06:36.886
And then this over here,
this is the killer.

00:06:36.886 --> 00:06:39.928
This is, what they say ma la tang.

00:06:39.928 --> 00:06:44.606
Like ma la, so it's got that
Sichuan sorta spice to it.

00:06:44.606 --> 00:06:47.089
Really, really nice not overwhelming.

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:49.203
It does make your mouth a bit numb though.

00:06:49.203 --> 00:06:50.767
I think this pork is the best

00:06:50.767 --> 00:06:52.684
because it's just, mmh.

00:06:54.646 --> 00:06:57.396
That flavor, so sweet, real nice.
