00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.967
Spring.

00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:04.570
Flowers.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.650
Color.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.146
Joy.

00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:09.374
And... Jackie.

00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:14.911
I am bringing you a tutorial on my makeup and hair look, for Spring!

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:17.658
With that trick, Jackie.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:25.676
The first thing I'm gonna do is moisturize my 
 face, and I am using Pure and Simple.

00:00:25.676 --> 00:00:33.487
Next, I'm going to be priming my face with Tarte line and, you don't 
 need to prime, but this keeps the makeup on all day long.

00:00:33.487 --> 00:00:39.134
And then I'm using a light concealer to 
 go over the dark areas, like so.

00:00:39.134 --> 00:00:45.835
And then I'm using my Cover FX full coverage 
 to get rid of all the imperfections.

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:50.771
I'm just adding some highlights and dimension to my face with concealer.

00:00:50.771 --> 00:00:53.181
Blend it out with your fingers.

00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:58.890
And then I'm using the same foundation brush to buff it all out.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.760
Next, set your makeup with some translucent powder.

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:06.356
Make sure you read the description box for all the info.

00:01:06.725 --> 00:01:10.405
And yeah, my skin is super greasy, so I have to do this.

00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:12.767
Of course, we must bronze. 

00:01:13.082 --> 00:01:14.906
What?! I missed a spot.

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:16.911
Dab, dab, dab.

00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:19.040
Bronze some more.

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:26.419
And contouring. Your BFF! Contour and chisel your face out.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:28.960
Next, you're gonna prime your eyes.

00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:35.243
For the blush, I used coral. I thought it would 
 be a nice complimentary color to the purple.

00:01:35.243 --> 00:01:39.630
And I'm just filling in my eyebrows with some brown powder.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.790
And then for the eyelid, I'm using a purple. And 
 you just wanna get this in the crease.

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:49.200
And then you're gonna add some pink, there we go, on your lid.

00:01:49.204 --> 00:01:52.310
And I'm using like, a frosted light pink.

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:59.530
And then a light color on your brow bone. Like so.

00:01:59.623 --> 00:02:04.690
Fix those eyebrows... 'cause they're super long. My eyebrows are very long.

00:02:04.693 --> 00:02:09.130
And I'm using this awesome teal that I got from my homegirl Mila.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.090
Blue Lagoon. My makeup store, I love this.

00:02:13.468 --> 00:02:15.710
This is so Spring right here.

00:02:15.706 --> 00:02:17.460
Just line the bottom lids.

00:02:17.457 --> 00:02:21.100
Lids? Line the bottom of your eye, okay?

00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:27.060
And then add the same highlighter that you used on your 
 brow bone in the corner of your tear duct.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.280
Now, for some falsies! You don't have to do this step. It is optional.

00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:36.180
If you don't do this, just use mascara.

00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:37.880
Either or.

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:40.980
You just wanna intensify those eyes.

00:02:41.237 --> 00:02:51.260
Now for the liner, I'm using a grey shadow. You know, I don't wanna go too heavy because it is Spring, and I wanna give it a very airy vibe.

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:53.170
Now, for the lips.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.310
Just put some chapstick on first, I use Burts Bees.

00:02:56.267 --> 00:03:04.400
And then, I again was looking for a coral lipstick I couldn't find in 
 my house, so I'm mixing these 2 colors to get coral-esque color.

00:03:06.584 --> 00:03:10.920
Coral-esque color, coral-esque color. That's a tongue twister.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.150
All done! Now for the hair.

00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:15.590
That is not cute.

00:03:15.965 --> 00:03:19.640
So you can leave it like this, but 
 I don't wanna do a bush-whacker look.

00:03:19.643 --> 00:03:26.670
I wanna give you a hairstyle that you guys requested 
 because... these lovely locks are gonna be gone.

00:03:27.987 --> 00:03:32.300
Okay, moisturize your hair with some leave in conditioner and water. Get the ends.

00:03:32.698 --> 00:03:35.870
And then...

00:03:35.866 --> 00:03:37.740
get to twisting!

00:03:37.936 --> 00:03:41.890
Get to twisting. Twisting is like, super simple and easy.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.150
So work your way around your head.

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:52.160
And I'm just gonna use a clip to hold this piece, because 
 I'm gonna start twisting the other side of my head.

00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:56.740
So we twist, twist, twist it up.

00:04:00.976 --> 00:04:07.240
So I twist the front part, and then I 
 will be left with a middle section.

00:04:07.242 --> 00:04:09.030
So I have 3 sections.

00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:14.840
Middle section, make sure you go under. Not over, under.

00:04:16.035 --> 00:04:18.820
This is very complicated, this step right here.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.000
But anyways...

00:04:21.002 --> 00:04:26.690
Under and then start braiding. If you go over it 
 looks like you have a bump on your head.

00:04:26.692 --> 00:04:32.770
So this under technique just creates a nice 
 flow from the twist into the braid.

00:04:32.635 --> 00:04:36.570
And you just keep braiding it up. Braid it up.

00:04:40.696 --> 00:04:45.820
Tie the bottom.

00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:50.170
All done! Oh, showcase, turn around! Twerk!

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.990
Add a flower, because it's Spring.

00:04:52.994 --> 00:04:58.840
And this beautiful sunflower was given to me by Flowers by Fatima.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.520
Again, all the info is in the description box. And isn't it super cute?

00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:05.420
It's very Spring.

00:05:08.782 --> 00:05:13.730
I just wanna frolic in a field of flowers. That's all I wanna do.

00:05:13.731 --> 00:05:19.030
So that's what I'm going to do. Frolic. It's Spring.

00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:21.890
It's Spring in New York City.

00:05:21.892 --> 00:05:23.410
Spring.

00:05:23.407 --> 00:05:28.600
I'ma geek. Okay, thank you guys for watching. Again, 
 all the info is in the description box.

00:05:28.642 --> 00:05:32.530
