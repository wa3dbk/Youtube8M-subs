00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:16.047
I’m a professor of English as a second language 

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:17.557
at Holyoke Community College.

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:19.751
I had a Fulbright Senior Scholar Grant 

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:23.822
at Irkutsk State Linguistic University 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.359
in Siberia, Russia.

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:28.293
While I was in Siberia, 

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.863
I received an email 

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.798
asking if I would be interested to work 

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:36.401
with English Language Teachers in Central Asia. 

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:41.306
So last year, in 2009, 

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:41.306
So last year, in 2009, 

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:43.575
I wound up going to 

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:44.576
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Russia.

00:00:47.554 --> 00:00:49.554
I gave workshops and presentations. 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.449
We focused a lot on materials development,

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.019
on the use of literature and primary sources 

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.358
and developing learner-centered classrooms 

00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:04.963
instead of teacher-centered classrooms. 

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:05.163
instead of teacher-centered classrooms. 

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.701
When I presented 

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.069
I used learner-centered classroom techniques. 

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:16.541
The very first presentation that I gave 

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:19.344
was what they called a chai chat.

00:01:19.552 --> 00:01:21.552
But, it was about 150 people 

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.082
from the city of Tashkent 

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.082
from the city of Tashkent 

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:25.717
who come on a weekly basis 

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:28.587
to practice their English.

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.188
I had this enthusiastic crowd. 

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.757
I had them singing songs and I had them jumping 
 up and down with rhythm of English. 

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:32.791
I had them singing songs and 

00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:35.227
I had them jumping up and down with rhythm of English. 

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.100
But then there were also cultural enrichment aspects. 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.980
When I got to Tajikistan, almost immediately they flew me 
 in a helicopter into the high Pamirs. 

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.110
It was so powerful for me to go up into those mountains 

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:58.280
and look across the Panj River at Afghanistan 

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:03.690
and stand at the bridge when the Afghan merchants 

00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:09.260
came across on Saturday for the Afghan market.

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:15.270
Then, in Russia, the embassy sent me to an area 
 of Russia that is very unusual, it’s called Kalmykia.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.810
It’s in the southern part of Russia 

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:25.940
the people there are Mongolian, 

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:28.510
of Mongolian heritage and 

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.620
they arrived there 400 years ago 

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.880
and so it was like arriving in a 
 Tibetan Buddhist place in European Russia. 

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.260
It was a wonderful combination of cultural enrichment and professional networking 

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.260
It was a wonderful combination of cultural enrichment and professional networking 

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:50.240
and I think that the more experience I have with different cultures 

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:54.810
the more I understand the immigrant experience 

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.740
that my students have. 

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:02.550
And I love teaching 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.350
and I love the active classroom

00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:08.150
and I love to engage.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:10.120
I also feel that it’s an exchange. 

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:13.390
The students are not just learning from me, 

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:16.130
but I’m also learning from them. 

00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:20.830
And having different points of view is a wonderful thing in the classroom.

00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:23.800
It creates enthusiasm 

00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:25.600
it creates deeper thinking. 

00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:29.730
Communicating this allows people to think 

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.210
of diversity as a positive 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:37.750
and maybe in the long run,

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:40.080
that helps create a more peaceful world.
