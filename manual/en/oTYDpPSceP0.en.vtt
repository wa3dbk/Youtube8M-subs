00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:32.101
- What should I do to him?

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:35.189
- Play with the squirrel!

00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:38.343
- Play with a squirrel, you say?

00:00:38.343 --> 00:00:40.618
- I would flatter it, do you know.

00:00:40.618 --> 00:00:42.432
how good she is on flattering,

00:00:42.432 --> 00:00:44.752
especially with lvl 4 crit

00:00:44.752 --> 00:00:47.202
that would be a real massage

00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:51.741
But overall it's nice and cute

00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:53.488
If you played a pub match

00:00:53.488 --> 00:00:55.204
and it were 2-3 times smaller

00:00:55.204 --> 00:00:58.186
you would not tell any difference

00:00:58.186 --> 00:01:01.444
between it and squirrel critters.

00:01:01.444 --> 00:01:04.114
It jumps cool. And its tail goes

00:01:04.114 --> 00:01:06.358
up and down so funny.

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:09.186
Up and down, up and down.

00:01:09.186 --> 00:01:11.351
- What about flying courier?

00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:13.865
- Im gonna check it now,

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:15.578
I've never seen it before.

00:01:15.578 --> 00:01:19.041
Ooohh, a caterpillar turned into a butterfly.

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:21.025
- Looks rather decent, looks like a bullfinch

00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:23.115
or something like that.

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:33.783
- This is raven.

00:01:33.783 --> 00:01:34.376
- Raven? Blue one?

00:01:34.376 --> 00:01:39.165
- Parrot-style colored raven.

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:40.275
- Well, yeah.

00:01:40.275 --> 00:01:48.078
Does it have any emotions to perform?

00:01:48.078 --> 00:01:49.463
Like letting him to dance, etc

00:01:49.463 --> 00:01:51.178
No, there is no such commands

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:53.896
otherwise I would play with it.

00:01:53.896 --> 00:01:56.330
So if you see this enemy bird

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.773
you come closer and one shot it.

00:02:11.473 --> 00:02:13.159
One of the main features is a backpack

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:18.479
with NaVi logo. So you can remember us

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:23.084
every time you are using this courier.

00:02:23.084 --> 00:02:26.262
And a cute animial of course,

00:02:26.262 --> 00:02:28.497
that draws your attention.

00:02:28.497 --> 00:02:31.116
Because it has blue color,

00:02:31.116 --> 00:02:35.263
it is more distinguishing and it draws

00:02:35.263 --> 00:02:37.153
attention of enemy's eye

00:02:37.153 --> 00:02:39.384
when they are looking to kill an opposing courier.

00:02:41.737 --> 00:02:44.610
Speaking about squirrel... What I can say

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.576
It is blends with the forest a lot

00:02:47.576 --> 00:02:50.739
making it easy to disguise.

00:02:52.817 --> 00:02:55.248
Everything is just like that.
