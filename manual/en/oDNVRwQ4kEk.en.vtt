00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:18.560
So this is the part 1 of updating the samsung
galaxy tab 10.1 3G or Wi-Fi model from Honeycomb

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.340
to ice cream sandwich.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.319
So the following files are required as you
can see in the screen right now,link to files

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.419
in the description below.

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.829
Make sure you download the correct files for
your correction version of galaxy tab and

everything will be in the description below.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.290
Now what you need to do is make sure you backup
every single data from the tab and make sure

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.430
that your tab is rooted.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.649

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:58.359
Things which work are most of the things and
camera and voice search doestn't work.
