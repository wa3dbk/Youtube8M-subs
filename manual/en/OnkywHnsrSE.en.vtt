Okay, you know that you have a wealth of information
to share with your audience plus you that

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.730
the best delivery method is video but you
have this fear, this fear, this fear of being

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.770
in front of the camera, what do you do?

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.770
Hey!

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.069
Vitoria Castro here, the founder of "Dominate
Video Marketing" and today we are gonna talk

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:27.739
about how to do videos without being front
of the camera.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.449
Well, I have a few alternative solutions for
you.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:32.720
Do not worry.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.180
You are not alone.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.350
Let's get to it.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.260
Alternatives to not be on camera: one option
is to do reality style videos.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.760
Those that we are really used to see on TV.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.370
Here are some examples for you.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.230
Let's call it "Holiday Video" those are very
fun especially for whoever works with travelling

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.320
business.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.100
You can show the places you visit while you
are giving the details of the place from behind

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.100
the camera.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.939
Plus, after recording, you have the option
to add a voice over.

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.030
Another example -- business event.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.190
You can create a video talking about highlights
from XYZ event, record film videos in the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.700
event and then check the best clips to make
a video.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.960
Demonstration video -- well, you can show
how to do something without showing your face

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.149
on the camera, it can be making a recipe,
it depends which kind of business you have

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.939
or fixing something, anything related to your
business or your services.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:47.829
Remember, in these videos your acting as a
reporter so you don't need to be in front

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:48.829
of the camera.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.789
But you need to talk, you need to explain,
you need to show, you need to interact.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.869
The person is gonna know that there is somebody
behind the camera and this brings me to the

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.099
next option.

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:08.270
Screencast Videos -- here you are recording
your computer screen and guess what?

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.890
You're gonna have your voice over as well.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.580
For sure you're not gonna be behind the camera
speaking but you're gonna add your voice over.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.400
So the person's gonna feel that you're behind
the scenes.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.130
You're talking to he/she that is on the other
side of the computer.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.830
For a screencast, you will need to have a
screen capture software.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.170
One of the examples is Jing, ScreencastOMatic,
the one that I really recommend that is very

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.230
very cheap and do a really good job and the
best one that Camtasia.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.190
Those are just to name a few.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.420
And this time I am recording on Camtasia.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.280
Now, let's look at some examples.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:59.060
Online presentation -- you can prepare your
presentation PowerPoint for PC users or Keynote

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:06.710
for Mac users and record it using screen capture
software that I just mentioned.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.980
And now we have the How To Videos.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.780
Screen capture videos as excellent when you
want to show how to use software in web applications.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.620
Okay now I wanna hear from you.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.430
Would it be easier for you to start a video
without being on camera?

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.000
