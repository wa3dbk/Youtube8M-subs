00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:07.540
Let me guess you made a New Years resolution
to lose 10 lbs, tighten your thighs, get rid

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.420
of post baby weight..

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.669
Ammiright?

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:16.320
Take it from a girl who's made tons of weight
loss resolutions, some which were successful

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:25.410
and some not so much..

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:36.000
Just making the resolution is nothing, there
are X things you need to remember throughout

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:49.060
the year if you want to make your weight loss
resolution stick...

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.060
1.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.740
Replace all the phrases like "lost weight"
"tone up" etc with "get healthy".

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:00.800
There are tons of ways to lose weight in unhealthy
ways but If you get really healthy, losing

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.940
weight is just a happy side effect.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.170
2.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.000
Be reasonable and realistic.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.160
Start slowly.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.460
Don't throw yourself into it and burn out.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.650
Don't make your body feel bad.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.860
You have all year to complete your resolution.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.290
3.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.580
Set short term goals.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.300
This will keep you accountable and consistent.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.970
4.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.909
Don't set your goals around losing weight,
set your goals around habits.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.030
Don't make your goals to lose 2 lbs a week,
make your goals to work out for an hour 3

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.390
times a week and to eat healthy the entire
week.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.689
Once you do this for a few weeks, it'll become
a habit and it'll feel weird to not work out

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.189
or eat healthy.

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:56.189
5.

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.580
It's ok if you get out of it, just get back
into it.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.670
If you succumb to birthday cake or skip a
workout to get caught up on greys anatomy,

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.610
don't beat yourself up over it or consider
it a failure, just jump back in.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.710
6.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.680
Don't compare yourself to anyone else.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.570
There are women who have worked out for years,
have different body styles, different shapes,

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.340
don't worry about them, you're not there for
them.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.190
The only person you should compare yourself
to is who you were yesterday.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.190
7.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.160
Don't let others hold you back.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:50.710
People love to give you crap when you start
to do good things for yourself.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:58.569
Sometimes friends will get jealous when you
start to get in shape and say snide comments.

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:08.650
A boyfriend or husband night get insecure
that you're getting healthy and hot

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:24.190
8.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.940
Try different workouts.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.069
It doesn't have to be a pain for it to be
a great exercise.

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.599
There are free options like running or a park
workout, there are all sorts of workout studios

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.990
from Pilates to boxing to pole dancing.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.610
Try a bunch of stuff to see what you enjoy
and what feels best for your body.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.400
9.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.610
Stop making excuses.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:57.530
Everyone in the world could make an excuse
of why they can't work out or eat good.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.890
"I don't have time" "don't have the money"
" blah blah blah.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.420
Put the excuses away and figure it out.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.430
Right now I'm having a Vegas staycation with
my boyfriend and neither one of us feels like

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.849
leaving the hotel and driving across town
to my studio to do a bootcamp class but we

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:17.969
are going to.

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:20.959
Because our health is very important to us.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:21.959
10.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:22.959
Celebrate your milestones.

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:29.159
When you lose a pound, embrace that rather
than thinking about how baby more pounds you

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:30.559
want to lose.

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:33.139
Always Reward yourself for hitting your goals.

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:44.219
If you have any other weight loss resolution
tips, leave them in 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:45.219
the comments!

00:04:45.219 --> 00:05:07.749
Thanks for watching and IÃ•ll see you next
time.
