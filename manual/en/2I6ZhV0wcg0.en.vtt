00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:11.950
Hi, my name is Michelle from YouTube channel,
Beauty and the Blog, and today I'm here to

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.100
share with you, my evening skin routine.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.490
Now, my evening skin routine is a very basic,
I only have 5 steps.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.730
And though it's very basic, it's something
that has worked for me, and other things are

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.730
going to break me out.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.590
The first thing I do, is remove my makeup
and to do this I use my Vitamin E facial wipes

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.250
which are from Boots.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.170
I really like this range, I don't know why,
but it just seems to do wonders for my skin

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.120
and they're also pretty cheap.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.410
When I don't use these wipes, the only other
wipes I do use are the Johnson's nighttime

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.120
wipes which come in the purple packet because
I feel like those are really moisturizing

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.039
as well, and they remove all my makeup.

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.039
The second thing I do after removing all my
makeup with the wipes, is wash my face, just

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.160
to make sure everything is completely gone.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.320
To do so, I use my Dr. Nick Lowe Hydrating
Cleanser.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.560
Using this after I've used my facial wipes
makes my skin feel really, really clean.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.490
After cleansing, the next thing you would
naturally do would be to use a toner, but

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.740
I've been skipping that step out for quite
some time now.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.710
And instead I use these Clearasil Rapid Action
Wipes.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:26.190
It also helps against spots and it keeps my
oil levels on my skin, I think, more balanced.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.310
The fourth thing I'll do in my routine is
moisturizing my skin and making sure that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.870
it looks the best that it can for the morning.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.950
So, the fourth thing I use is the Beautiful
Skin Overnight Radiance Boost from Boots.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.630
I really like this for many reasons.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.670
It's for all skin types and it's hypoallergenic,
as well.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.259
It's a really good pick-me-up for your skin
overnight, and it's supposed to help skin

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.000
renewal whilst you sleep.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.909
So, it gives new meaning to beauty sleep,
that does.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.340
The last thing I do is obviously use my nighttime
moisturizer which is also from the Eucerin

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.340
Brighter range.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.260
But this one is just a really thick, luxurious
moisturizer.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.259
One thing I do love about this moisturizer,
is that although it's really thick, once it's

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.930
applied to your skin it doesn't leave you
feeling greasy or tacky.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.840
It just really soaks into your skin and leaves
your skin feeling silky, silky soft.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.280
So guys, that's my really simple, basic evening
skin care routine.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.480
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I'll
see you all next time.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.120
Bye!
