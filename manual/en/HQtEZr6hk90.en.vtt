00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.320
Today on our 2012 Ford E-250, we&amp;#39;re going
to be installing the WeatherTech Bug Shield,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.320
part number WT50187.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.880
Now to begin, we&amp;#39;ll need to open our hood.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.840
Pull the hood latch here, releasing the hood
where we can now open it up.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.930
Now that we have our hood open, we&amp;#39;ll
find the weather strip here at the edge and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:47.829
according to the instructions we&amp;#39;ll need
to locate the push pin fasteners where 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:01:00.399
our bug shied will attach.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:20.689
Here on 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:52.139
the passenger&amp;#39;s side, it 
will 

00:01:52.139 --> 00:02:03.600
be these two push pin fasteners.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:23.319
Here 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:03:06.959
on the driver&amp;#39;s side, we&amp;#39;ll use these
two fasteners here.
