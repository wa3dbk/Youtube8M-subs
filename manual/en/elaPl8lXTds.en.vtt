00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.270
Jesus spoke in ways some found difficult
to understand.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.810
And he use many devices when preaching
and teaching

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.400
for instance Jesus spoke of the cup.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.620
Remember the cup from a earlier episode,
we talked about that before, remember?

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.599
Oh, thank you.

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.570
Or perhaps he use the plate.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.730
Remember the plate? Oh.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.430
Thank you. The cup and the plate they kinda go together, right?

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.900
sure!

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.050
Yeah right, sure, or maybe he used the bowl.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.950
Or...

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.620
...two bowls.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.130
...or the "pair-a-bowls."

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.770
That what you're getting at? Well you
outta be ashamed of yourself.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.800
That's right folks we're talking about the parables

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.320
on this episode of Chuck Knows Church.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.520
Seriously, I do not need your help to
make terrible jokes, I can do that

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.980
on my own.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.600
[Intro music begins]

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.370
A parable is a concise didactic story

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.680
which exemplifies moral lessons or
principles. But that really only helps

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.470
you if you know what the word didactic
means.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.600
Uhhh, didactic; when something is both

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.780
diet and galactic, didactic!

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.460
[laughing off camera] That is not true

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.870
Alright, didactic is something that is intended to teach

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.950
or morally instruct. Now a parable is not an allegory

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.880
or fable, so what is it?

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.810
Alright, maybe I should just let HW Fowler
explain it from his work

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.179
Modern English Usage.
[clear the throat]

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.750
"The parable is to enlighten the hearer by
submitting to him (or her) a case in which he (or she)

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.709
has apparently no direct concern and upon
which therefore a disinterested

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.800
judgment may be elicited from him.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.800
[laughing behind camera again]

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.380
Think I'm maybe making things worse? 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.260
Can I get my bowls back? Is it too late for--?

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.370
Okay, let's just say this;

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.820
a parable is a simple story

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.870
illustrating a moral or religious lesson,
enough said.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.500
Having said that,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.150
let me say a few more things. Although
parables tend to be about simple

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.880
everyday things like a tree

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.760
or, you know, a seed or a smaller seed, we
often discover

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.390
deeper meaning for our lives each time
we read them. Now, Jesus frequently taught

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.880
his disciples using parables

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.140
although they seem to be simple stories
the disciples sometimes

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.220
scratch their collective heads
wondering, "What was just talking about?"

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.130
The parables also confused and
frustrated those who

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.420
were against Jesus but Jesus intentions

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.890
were to provide guidance for his followers
to better understand

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.320
the reign of God. Now, even for those who
know little about the Bible

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.299
the parables of Jesus will always be
among the best known stories in the

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:35.930
world. There ya go.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.480
To learn more be sure to ask your
pastor.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.240
Tell them Chuck sent you.
