00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:10.040
Good evening. This is the 37th time I have
spoken to you from this office, where so many

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:18.590
decisions have been made that shape the history
of this nation. Each time I have done so to

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.130
discuss with you some matter that I believe
affected the national interest. In all the

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.630
decisions I have made in my public life I
have always tried to do what was best for

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:37.250
the nation. Throughout the long and difficult
period of Watergate, I have felt it was my

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.530
duty to persevere -- to make every possible
effort to complete the term of office to which

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:52.170
you elected me. In the past few days, however,
it has become evident to me that I no longer

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.100
have a strong enough political base in the
Congress to justify continuing that effort.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.350
I would have preferred to carry through to
the finish whatever the personal agony it

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:16.450
would have involved, and my family unanimously
urged me to do so. But the interests of the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.860
nation must always come before any personal
considerations. From the discussions I have

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.150
had with Congressional and other leaders I
have concluded that because of the Watergate

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:35.350
matter I might not have the support of the
Congress that I would consider necessary to

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.740
back the very difficult decisions and carry
out the duties of this office in the way the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:50.810
interests of the nation will require. I have
never been a quitter. To leave office before

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:59.470
my term is completed is abhorrent to every
instinct in my body. But as President, I must

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:09.119
put the interests of America first. America
needs a full-time President and a full-time

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:18.549
Congress, particularly at this time with problems
we face at home and abroad. To continue to

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:25.209
fight through the months ahead for my personal
vindication would almost totally absorb the

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:32.810
time and attention of both the President and
the Congress in a period when our entire focus

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:41.090
should be on the great issues of peace abroad
and prosperity without inflation at home.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:50.180
Therefore, I shall resign the Presidency effective
at noon tomorrow. Vice President Ford will

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.290
be sworn in as President at that hour in this
office.
