00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.649
Yes, you read that headline right.

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.379
Hello Kitty is not – we repeat, not a cat.

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:12.130
After 40 years of collecting the cash of cat
lovers worldwide, the secret of Sanrio's star

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.510
character has been revealed, according to
the Los Angeles Times.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:23.050
The startling truth was uncovered by anthropologist
- Hello Kitty scholar Christine R. Yano, who

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.800
has studied the phenomenon surrounding the
minimalist meower for years.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.820
Yano was, of course, the ideal person to help
curate Los Angeles's upcoming Hello Kitty

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.670
retrospective at the Japanese American National
Museum.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.670
After Yano waded through all the Hello Kitty
toasters, coin purses and haute couture to

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.500
pick out the purrfect exhibit pieces, she
sent her notes to Sanrio for approval.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.489
The company was pleased with the Hello Kitty
connoisseur's work, except for one earth-shattering

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.489
detail.

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.719
"I was corrected – very firmly," Yano said.

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.140
"That's one correction Sanrio made for my
script for the show.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.119
Hello Kitty is not a cat.

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.210
She's a cartoon character.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.680
She is a little girl.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.680
She is a friend.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.760
But she is not a cat.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.229
She's never depicted on all fours.

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.130
She walks and sits like a two-legged creature.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.520
She does have a pet cat of her own, however,
and it's called Charmmy Kitty."

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.409
The mind-boggling information bombs don't
stop there.

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.490
Yano's deep dig revealed other little known
facts about this famous "feline."

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.180
Hello Kitty was created with a life story.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.159
Her full name is Kitty White and she is a
Scorpio who adores apple pie.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.900
But wait, there's more.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.770
"She has a twin sister," Yano shared.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.450
"She's a perpetual third-grader.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.170
She lives outside of London.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.540
I could go on.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.770
A lot of people don't know the story and a
lot don't care.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.890
But it's interesting because Hello Kitty emerged
in the 1970s, when the Japanese and Japanese

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.619
women were into Britain."

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.380
While Yano seems tickled by this Hello Kitty
surprise, the world is reacting in shock.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.630
We've been duped by a strange, dead-eyed child,
who has been a "kitty" only by name for four

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.630
decades.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.630
What's next?

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.950
Is Mickey Mouse a big-eared boy with a shirt
aversion?

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.629
Is Bugs Bunny just a retired comedian on a
strict vegetarian diet?

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.720
One thing is certain, cartoon characters can
no longer be trusted – no matter how many

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.800
lunch boxes they've graced.
