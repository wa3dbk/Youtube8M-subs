00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.320
The Awakening, a la Shmoop.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.760
I love being a wife and mother.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.760
Mostly.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.760
Kind of.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.760
A bit.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.539
It's great, really, but when you're wiping
noses and planning dinners and getting bossed

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.880
around by your husband, you kind of lose track
of your inner self.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.880
…

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.420
That's why I really enjoyed my trip to Grand
Isle.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.220
Lots of down time with my friend Adele, Madame
Reisz &lt;Rice&gt;, and that hunky Robert.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.710
I know, I'm married, but a girl can dream,
can't she?

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.870
Robert and I went for lots of long, platonic
walks on the beach.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.870
And long swims, too.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.097
I swam a little too far one night, it was
touch and go for a minute there…

00:00:40.097 --> 00:00:41.097
…but I made it back.

00:00:41.097 --> 00:00:42.097
Thank goodness.

00:00:42.097 --> 00:00:43.490
I was so wired that I defied my bossy husband
by staying up past bedtime.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:49.960
I think he was worried that this would send
me down a path of vice and crime.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.960
…

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.550
It didn't…at least, not the crime part.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.620
But I was changing into a new, improved version
of myself.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.219
Now I was “Take Charge Edna,” …

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.760
… a sassy gal who marched to the beat of
her own drummer.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.760
…

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.360
In another dramatic development, I was really
starting to crush on Robert.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.140
Unfortunately, I didn't realize this until
he decided to leave for Mexico.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.100
..
Even worse, vacation was over and I had to

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.100
go home.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.100
…

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.270
But once I got back, I wasn't really interested
in being the perfect wife anymore.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.110
So I stopped trying, and started… painting.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.280
My husband was a bit upset about my new life
direction.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.280
Rebellion was liberating, but something was
still missing.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.439
I decided that I had to get my own place,
with my own money.

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.680
So I got a little house where I could be independent
and artistic, and… maybe hook up every now

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.119
and then.

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.170
Mademoiselle Reisz really wanted me to become
“the hero of my own life,” as Dickens

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:56.240
would put it, and she showed me letters from
Robert, saying that he loved me.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.100
I was at a bit of a crossroads in my life,
but Take Charge Edna knew exactly which way

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.159
to go!

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.600
While I was expanding my mental horizons,
I had a fling with the local heartbreaker,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.850
Alcée Arobin &lt;All-SAY Air-oh-BAN&gt;.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.650
I didn't love him the way I loved Robert,
but in my defense… he was really cute.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.590
I was pretty sure that I should hate myself
for moving out and cheating on my husband...but

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.209
I had a hard time seeing all this happiness
as a bad thing.

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.120
Stuff got weird when I heard that Robert was
coming back from Mexico.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.640
Imagine my surprise when I ran into him at
Mademoiselle Reisz’ house.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.220
That deadbeat had been in town for almost
two days, and his fingers must have been broken,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.670
because I didn’t get a letter or a phone
call!

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.239
Also, he had a little pouch that he got from
some hussy in Mexico.

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.500
Not that I was jealous or anything.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.550
And if you think that situation was awkward,
Alcée then showed up, and Robert vamoosed.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.709
I sent Alcée away, too…I just wasn’t
in the mood for love anymore.

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.310
I’m so fickle.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.769
It was another few days before I ran into
Robert again, and things went a little better

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:09.769
this time.

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:16.200
I took him back to my new house for smoochies,
and we took the next relationship step!

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.200
The L-word!

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.030
Naturally, this was when I heard that my friend
Adele was in labor, and I had to go be her

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.050
birth coach.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.840
It was kind of well-timed, though, because
Robert was getting all moony-eyed about marriage.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.930
Just when I was starting to enjoy life as
an eligible bachelorette.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.370
I made Robert promise to stay right where
he was, but when I got back from Adele’s,

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.609
he was gone.

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.510
He only left a note, saying, “Goodbye, because
I love you.”

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.719
Come on, Rob, lighten up…not every woman
needs a ring on it!

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:41.059
I was in a pretty dark emotional place after
that.

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:42.059
…

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:45.540
I went back to our vacation spot at Grand
Isle, but that was even more depressing.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.629
I thought maybe a nice skinny dip would cheer
me up.

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.540
It was kind of a bust, though, because I ended
up drowning.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:19.049
Do yourself a favor…if you ever have a mid-life
crisis, just buy 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.639
a convertible!
