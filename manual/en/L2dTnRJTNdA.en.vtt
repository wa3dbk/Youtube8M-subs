00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.110
As the head of dermatology at Sunnybrook Health Sciences 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.160
Centre, Dr. Neil Shear gets asked one particular question

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.180
a lot: what's the best moisturizer? Moisturization

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.190
is important for almost every skin disease and

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.220
in many of the diseases it's either caused by an inability to hold moisture in the skin

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.240
or it's part of the disease and you're losing moisture

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.300
and we are trying to replace that. He says poor moisturization

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.370
can actually affect a host of skin problems, ranging from eczema,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.380
psoriasis, acne and itchiness. Luckily, Dr. Shear

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.420
says there is good news to report. 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.460
I tell patients now everyday: we had theory, we had science and now

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.520
we have products. This is like the best news ever. 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.530
One of the big findings is around a protein called filaggrin, something to watch for

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.540
in future products. Researchers have found when it's lacking, the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.550
skin loses moisture and problems can flare up. 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.640
The other big news is about ceramides. Turns out, they appear to be

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.650
the ingredient most people need in a moisturizer, and Dr. Shear

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.670
offers a few examples.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.680
The ones we think of, the ones with ceramides in them, are the biggest news right now, and it may change if adding

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.710
filaggrin helps in the future, but right now we have one called Cerave,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.720
there's one called Curel, and there's Cetaphil Restoraderm for people with eczema.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.760
This is a particularly important time of year to moisturize,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.770
as the winter season can be very drying. Other culprits

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.780
for dry skin include older age, and soaps with a high PH. 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.800
Opt for cleansing bars instead. For your overall

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.870
skin routine, Dr. Shear says, keep it simple. 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.910
By getting them off things that destroy the moisture in the skin,

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.960
like soaps and using every product on earth on their face

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.020
that's drying it out, and starting to replenish the ceramides,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.040
people often get much better before we even have to give them medication.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.050
When you find a product that works, try to use it consistently,

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.070
in places like the gym and when travelling. And while parabens

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.100
have received a lot of bad press, Dr. Shear says this preservative 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.110
is actually effective and safe. You need a preservative

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.120
in a cream because bacteria can grow in it and you have to 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.170
keep something there. Parabens are actually about the best. 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.290
And more good news: Dr. Shear says more expensive doesn't always equal better 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.340
quality. So your skin can look like a million bucks,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.440
without paying a fortune. With Sunnyview, I'm Monica Matys.
