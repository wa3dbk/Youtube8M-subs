00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.960
HTC Explorer.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.990
Expected Q4 2011.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.279
An entry-level Android device, the HTC Explorer
is another good reason not to settle for a

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.859
"dumb" feature phone and to go for a smartphone
instead.

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.510
Although this is a new device, in hardware
terms it is almost identical in specification

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.300
to the existing HTC Wildfire S, except for
a downgraded camera.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.180
Most of the differences are in software, the
HTC Sense environment has been significantly

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.370
updated with social networking tools and a
refreshed user interface.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.380
Even thought the Explorer and Wildfire S are
closely related, the indications are that

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.700
the Explorer will be much cheaper, competing
directly against the likes of the Samsung

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.380
Galaxy Mini which currently retails for about
â‚¬135 SIM-free.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:07.270
The HTC Explorer has a 3.2" 320 x 480 pixel
touchscreen display and a 3 megapixel camera

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.320
on the back.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.900
The 600 MHz processor isn't fast when compared
with high-end devices, but the 512MB of RAM

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.610
should be enough to run several applications
at once.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.320
Other features include an FM radio, multimedia
player, GPS with turn-by-turn navigation,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.909
WiFi, 3.5G support and Bluetooth plus all
the usual Android smartphone features and

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.490
access to thousands of applications in the
Android market.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.640
Despite the relatively basic feature set,
the HTC Explorer is still a very powerful

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.530
and capable device and makes an ideal first
smartphone.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.440
Inside is a 1230 mAh battery quoted as giving
up to 7.5 hours talktime and 18 days standby

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.130
time on 3G.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:02.549
The whole package measures 103 x 57 x 13mm
and weighs 108 grams.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.830
HTC say that the Explorer should be available
in Europe and Asia from Q4 2011 onwards in

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.170
"Metallic Black", "Active Black" and "Metallic
Purple" colours.
