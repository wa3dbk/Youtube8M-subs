00:00:05.135 --> 00:00:07.001
I would like to talk about...

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:12.855
the sad and despicable episode
that happened yesterday,

00:00:12.856 --> 00:00:14.120
during the match.

00:00:15.936 --> 00:00:22.966
Those who are close to me know
I'm not fond of appearing on TV,

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:26.346
and that I'm not interested
in promoting myself...

00:00:26.347 --> 00:00:29.281
over such a despicable happening.

00:00:30.342 --> 00:00:34.955
Due to the education
that was given to me,

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:42.344
and to my relation with other people
that have been through the same,

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:46.221
I must speak up,

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.315
since I'm able,
thanks to God,

00:00:52.316 --> 00:00:58.002
and to my hard work,
to talk to reach out to many people,

00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:02.037
therefore,
in order to help,

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.114
I feel obligated to talk.

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:08.437
We live in a miscegenated country,

00:01:08.964 --> 00:01:12.067
full of people, races, colors,

00:01:13.478 --> 00:01:19.544
and this miscegenation
keeps growing,

00:01:19.768 --> 00:01:26.698
therefore, these episodes
should never happen here.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.678
However, they've been happening
for quite a long time,

00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:36.272
it's not a recent thing,
it's been happening for a long time.

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:41.962
Words do harm people,
we must be very careful,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.674
I know that many people...

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.331
utter bad words
and promote racist acts...

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.700
toward athletes in general...

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:01.816
in order to get to us,

00:02:01.817 --> 00:02:03.720
in order to destabilize us,

00:02:04.242 --> 00:02:07.767
but that's not the right way.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.366
There are laws
forbidding those behaviors,

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:12.853
and we want those laws
to be fulfilled,

00:02:12.854 --> 00:02:16.354
once they were created
after a long period of struggle,

00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:20.753
I want people to be
as respectful as I am.

00:02:21.106 --> 00:02:24.703
Those things are not happening
on the stadiums' bleachers only,

00:02:24.704 --> 00:02:26.111
they happen everywhere,

00:02:26.392 --> 00:02:29.763
and I became relieved...

00:02:30.255 --> 00:02:32.708
and, in a certain way, satisfied,

00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:35.303
when they did what they did,

00:02:36.192 --> 00:02:41.946
because evil gets even stronger
when it is not detected,

00:02:43.534 --> 00:02:47.553
and that evil came forth yesterday,

00:02:47.678 --> 00:02:49.151
unfolding itself,

00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:53.562
giving us the chance
to counterattack,

00:02:53.995 --> 00:02:58.838
to defend ourselves
and to stand up for our rights.

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:04.664
So, if there is something good
about what happened yesterday,

00:03:04.665 --> 00:03:08.428
is that racism does exist,

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:13.669
and that we must fight back
while it can be defeated.

00:03:13.688 --> 00:03:16.968
When I talk about racism,
I'm not referring to black people only,

00:03:17.192 --> 00:03:21.102
I'm talking about discrimination
in general,

00:03:22.155 --> 00:03:25.953
concerning race, religion,
color, or any other type.

00:03:26.682 --> 00:03:32.942
We must come together as one,
we must be solidary,

00:03:33.497 --> 00:03:38.946
and when witnessing
a situation like this,

00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:41.019
we must oppose from the beginning.

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:44.627
People must learn about
where they come from,

00:03:45.126 --> 00:03:47.949
and, above it all, they must learn
to respect each other,

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:54.760
that's the only way in which
we may change the world.

00:03:55.086 --> 00:04:06.346
SAY NO TO RACISM
