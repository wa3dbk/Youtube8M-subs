Hello, and welcome to Your Money 2.0.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.580
I’m Thomas Fox, Community Outreach Director
for Cambridge Credit Counseling.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.000
It has been over a month since the Obama administration
announced the U.S. Treasury Department's Making

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.180
Home Affordable program.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.030
While the initiative has its merits, many
believe that it falls short of offering struggling

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.620
homeowners the help they desperately need.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.210
To recap, the Making Home Affordable program
works in two ways.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.579
First, homeowners who are on-time with an
existing mortgage owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.059
Mac may apply for refinancing under the The
Home Affordable Refinance portion of the plan.

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.130
In this case, eligible loans will include
those where the first mortgage does not exceed

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.340
105% of the current market value of the property.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.199
The second part of the Home Affordable Modification
allows homeovners who are struggling with

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.420
making their payments apply to modify their
mortage to make thing more manageable.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.780
This aspect of the plan is voluntary; therefore,
it is unknow how succesfull the initative

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.109
will be.

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:07.770
Both programs have a shelf life – the Home
Affordable Refinance program expires in June

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.010
of 2010 and the Home Affordable Modification
program expires on December 31, 2012.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.080
The predominant issue affecting homeowners
is the drastic decline in the value of their

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.500
homes – a term known as underwater where
a home is worth less than the mortgage.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.250
major limitation of the program is that it
does not attack the problem of negative equity

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:41.510
-- mortgage balances larger than the value
of the homes securing the mortgages.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:50.540
Furthermore, 65% of the mortgages originated
in 2005 and 2006 were not securitized by either

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.680
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.630
This means that there is a tremendous amount
of homeowners that will not be able to seek

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.450
help under the program.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:38.030
Economist Nouriel Roubini and market analyst
Meredith Whitney predict that prices in 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.510
the housing market will decline by another
20 percent before they level off.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.230
Nearly half of all homeowners will be underwater
and owe more on their mortgages than the current

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.230
value of their homes.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.923
That will increase the foreclosures and push
scores of banks into default.

00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:53.923
This logic is backed up by Merrill Lynch’s
economist,David Rosenberg, as he thorises

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:57.520
that the housing market will need another
three years to achieve price stability.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.130
Given the Making Home Affordable

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.630
Cambridge recently launched keepyourhome.us
to further the promotion of our Home Sweet

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.870
Home initiative which achiever economic stabilization
through recovery of the housing sector.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:28.510

for this edition.
