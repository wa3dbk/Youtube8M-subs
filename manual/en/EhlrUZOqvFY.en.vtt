00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.040
General Motors and NASA have a long history of working together,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.760
going back to the original lunar rover.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.390
And it would seem like a natural fit for the General Motors Corporation and NASA

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.660
to work together on the development of the next generation of robots: Robonaut.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:01:06.290
(MUSIC)

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.690
The current Robonaut was developed as result of a partnership

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.290
between the NASA Johnson Space Center and General Motors.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.350
So General Motors sent down a team of engineers to work side by side with the NASA engineers,

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.300
developing and assembling, designing and building the current model of Robonaut, R2.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.990
General Motors and NASA began working on the current Robonaut about three years ago.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.910
The relationship has been fantastic.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.870
The partnership’s been fantastic.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.490
And as you see from the robot, the robot’s a pretty amazing device.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.560
Starting with R1

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.170
we went after both the hands and arms.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.540
They give you a workspace and the dexterity that’s very similar to a human.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.540
When we went to R2, we increased that.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.120
We increased the speed at which could we performed tasks,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:08.480
and we increased the dexterity so that we could even perform more tasks than the original R1 can.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.970
From General Motor’s perspective, we want to be able to automate tasks that are very repetitious,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.620
dull or ergonomically challenging for our operators.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.730
And those requirements are very similar to some of the tasks

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.570
that NASA would like to be able to automate to help an astronaut.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.700
So from that perspective,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.950
we’re looking at using robots and automation to support our operators,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.260
to support our people doing the work,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.070
doing the things that are not as value added for the operator.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.480
Both organizations are looking for ways to add technology to both of our tool kits

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.930
so that space missions and assembly plants can be more efficient.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.810
One of GM’s core goals is to lead in advance technology and quality

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.570
in creating the world’s best vehicles.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.240
The partnership with NASA and the development of R2 provide those innovative technologies

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.640
that will help us achieve those goals in both our plants and our products.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.760
The goal here is that there are many tasks that can be more efficiently off loaded to robots.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.030
For example in space: When astronauts perform tasks,

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.900
there’s a lot of setup before the task is started

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.360
and a lot of tear down after the task is done.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.010
Particularly on space station, setting up the tools, setting up a variety of equipment.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.120
If a robot can perform that task, it allows the crew person to be much more efficient

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.000
doing the things that only a crew person can do.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.050
The partnership between NASA and GM has been a fantastic one,

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.570
and it has resulted in benefits that we hadn’t predicted when we first started together.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.700
Both sides are looking for as dexterous and efficient a robot as possible.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.140
But what’s also been amazing is the application overlap between the two groups.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.420
Many things that we have to do in space, that humans have to do,

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.020
are in many ways similar to the complexity of the situation when you’re building a car.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.960
Both are complex activities.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.470
And we have found interesting overlap that’s been to the benefit of both of us.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.030
For General Motors, it’s all about safer vehicles and safer plants.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.320
The technologies being developed in R2 will help our engineers

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.630
develop advanced vehicle safety systems that will be used in our future products.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:54.850
