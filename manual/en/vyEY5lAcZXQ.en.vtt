00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.420
When training your pit bull, whether you're
training them what you might consider basic

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.960
obedience or manner skills, or delightful
tricks, the approach should be the same as

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.890
it is with all other dogs.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.920
You should use a positive, motivational approach
that sets your dog up to have fun, love the

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:34.260
learning experience and decide that they absolutely
love being compliant to people's requests.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.160
When selecting tricks to train your pit bull,
it's useful to pick things that's going to

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.350
be to their advantage.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.649
Things that I like to focus on with bully
breeds would be impulse control or learning

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:54.239
some self-control, how to take it, drop it,
polite manners if they want to tug as an outlet.

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.719
But you could use a lot of your tricks training
to give your bully breed the outlets that

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.820
they need for the energy that they have.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.570
As in any successful training program, once
you want to pick a trick you're going to train,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.170
you want to know what the end result should
look like.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.390
But you want to break it down into small,
achievable steps so that you and your bully

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.480
breed are successful and having fun along
the way.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.530
Pick something that motivates them to use
as a reward.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.710
For most dogs that's food.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.890
If your bully breed loves playing with toys,
toys can also be a wonderful way of reinforcing

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.890
them.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.009
When you're doing a training session, keep
it short, and what I mean by short is go along

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.970
with your dog's attention span.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.039
You want to make sure that your dog, during
a training session, is enthusiastic and having

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.039
fun.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.270
So for your individual dog that might mean
three minutes.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.369
It might mean 30 minutes.

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.380
But you want to keep the training sessions
brief enough that your dog is accomplishing

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.590
the task and not burning out.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.460
Tricks training is a great thing to do with
all dogs, but especially bully breeds that

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.509
sometimes get a little bit of a bad rep from
some people, or people feel a little bit worrisome

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.310
around them.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.680
Having a well-behaved, well-trained dog makes
a wonderful ambassador for their breed.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.000
It allows them to interact with their family
members, neighbors, and children in the community

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.250
in a very positive way that's calm and well-mannered.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.170
So, they can become great ambassadors for
their breed if you train them some really

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.000
nice manners behaviors as well as some really
cute tricks.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.680
Right, honey?
