00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.800
You wouldn't think it, but for a game that
looks so chaotic Necrodancer works because

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.050
of the simple principles it's built upon.
And it's a philosophy that dates back to the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.920
games inception. The crazy idea of blending
rhythm with roguelikes wasn't a gimmicky way

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.380
to stand out, but the product of simple and
rational problem solving. Ryan Clark and Brace

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.020
Yourself Games wanted to make a turn-based
roguelike that was fair. The compromise resulted

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.649
in a rapid turn-based system in which your
turn only lasted a second. Clark likened it

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.330
to moving to a beat, so he played MJ's Thriller
in the background and well, the rest is history.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.400
As we said, this design attitude permeates
throughout the whole game. There's the simple

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.810
graphics that don't overcrowd the screen or
the fact that there's only 4 buttons that

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.710
contains the fast and constant dancing. The
alternating disco lights make it easier to

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.640
skip to the beat and building a rhythm multiplier
into coin scoring as well as particular weapons

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.439
and armour is simply genius. Necrodancer has
a lot of complexity and strategy, but when

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.000
broken down its design is simple; simple-y
the best.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.020
Crypt of the Necrodancer lets you dance to
your own beat by giving you so many different

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.319
ways to shake it. Starting with the music,
you can customise all the songs. As we found,

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.759
not every song works; whatever you choose
needs to have a constant beat. But once we

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.179
tried a song that did, specifically Sweet
Dreams by Eurythmics, we were in awe. Playing

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.810
the game to a song you know and love is just
awesome and the ability to change it up stops

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.520
the music from getting repetitive in a game
that is built to be replayed over and over.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.069
Also, if the Danny Baranowsky soundtrack was
somehow not enough, there is both a melody

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.459
and metal remix of it to be unlocked.
Moving on, the different characters that can

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.939
be unlocked fundamentally change the game.
Bard doesn't have to move to the beat, Eli

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.420
has infinite bombs but no weapons and Aria
will die if she misses just one beat. Perhaps

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.990
a seemingly minor feature is the ability to
add or remove items from the in-game chests.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.319
It can more easily net you your favourite
weapon or load up the chests with health regen

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.760
if you fear you take too much damage. Lastly,
you can play the game with a dance pad. It

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.560
probably won't consume most of your play time,
but it's a fun option to have and it epitomises

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.740
Necrodancer's commitment to giving the player
what they want. Through early access, they

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.280
have curated a highly user-friendly experience
that that lets you change how you play, and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.500
to whatever song you like.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.800
Ok, we're cheating a bit here because this
last point isn't really a point; it's just

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.850
us listing off the other things we love about
Necrodancer. We love how the shopkeeper busts

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.930
out his vocal talents midway through the awesome
songs. We love the monumental amount of weapons,

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.850
armour, relics, spells, and shrines that add
a whole extra layer of strategy on top of

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.800
the dancefloor grooving. We love the story
that at first appears superfluous but is full

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.430
of deep lore and intrigue the more you explore.
We love the mini-bosses that make completing

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.130
every stage an accomplishment. We also love
the big bosses and the character and stage

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.710
design of them; they're just phenomenal. Simply,
we love Crypt of the Necrodancer and that's

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.040
why it's our game of the Month for April and
why we recommend you put on your blue suede

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.650
shoes and cut loose with Necrodancer.
If you want more Necrodancer info, we suggest

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.500

Yourself Games made on its development.
