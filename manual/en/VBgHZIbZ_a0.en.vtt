00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:06.580
Hi, welcome back to arts and crafts and everything
fun. I'm here with Marybeth Murphy and she's

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:14.960
teaching us how to use the tarot cards. Next
she's going to teach us about three more Arcana

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.150
cards. These are the major Arcana cards and
as I'm going through each of these Arcana

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.859
cards I am using the book that comes with
the cards so you can feel free to utilize

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.839
that. Some people don't want to use the book
but it's okay, because you're going to get

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.870
a deeper meaning from the cards each time
you use them, and eventually you won't have

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.290
to use the book anymore but I've been using
these cards for what, close to ten years and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.480
I still go back to the book now and again
because sometimes I need a refresher on what

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.220
the card means or I'm just feeling guided
to do so. So be aware that your intuition

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.671
is going to play a big part in this. Here
we're going to look at the empress, and the

00:00:54.671 --> 00:01:02.680
empress is basically balance. It is how you'll
meet your success, and what it says is in

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.340
a true victory both sides will win, and so
you're going to consider all sides when you

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:17.509
are on your road to success or whatever it
is. It's that one will not be successful over

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:25.119
the cost of another. The emperor is the opposite;
basically real, true masculine power and strength,

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:32.040
and competitiveness. It's looking at the fact
that there's one winner and one loser, and

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.900
that's the way it is. It's kind of like, how
competitive are you, and are you going to

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.740
hit people up on your climb to the top or
not. Again I'm giving you a very literal sense

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.479
and these cards are developed over a long
period of time so be aware of that. The next

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.590
card is the hierophant or the pope if you
will, and that's really dealing with spiritual

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.729
authority and awareness. I'll read to you
"a spiritual guidance and authority, a tradition

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:13.160
instructor may be necessary at times to bring
order from chaos." This card may also signify

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.000
a serious change in relationships possibly.
Be aware that it's really looking at spiritual

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.380
guidance and awareness, and this is the pope
card. So what's coming up next, Marybeth?

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.332
I'm going to be dealing with three more of
the major Arcana cards. Three more of the

00:02:30.332 --> 00:02:32.560
major arcana cards. Stay tuned for that.
