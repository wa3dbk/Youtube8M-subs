00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.890
a freshly-painted engine can be the
crown jewel on your restoration and

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.400
really be a nice payoff for all that
hard work so if you've ever wanted to

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.180
know how to properly paint an engine we
got some great tips for you

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.480
the first thing like any painting
project is getting clean get clean get

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.289
it clean

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.500
if you disassembled in a rebuilding your
engine well it's probably already gonna

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.980
be hot tank so you're miles ahead of the
guy that's not if you're not just

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.610
assembling a rebuilding your engine well
start with a pressure washer and a good

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.570
organic cleaner to get all that nasty
crud off of the engine block and all the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.769
components that you want to refinish
after that nice bath with eastwards

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.010
chassis clean and some wire brushes will
further get into all the crevices and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.979
cracks and really do a nice job of
cleaning and follow that up with

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.879
eastwards pre-painting prep which sets
up for better adhesion and a nice

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.659
foundation for all of your engine code
insistence speaking of that lets talk

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.650
about paint now a great alternative to
the auto parts store rattle-can his

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.940
Eastwood's 2k aerospace a professional
painting system in a rattle can there's

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.840
a chamber that gets punctured and then
the catalyst is released into the rattle

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.400
can it becomes a professional coding I
never recommend to go paint right on top

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.630
of bare steel because it Heejun is not
the best so to Cairo spray has a high

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.410
temperature primer that's a perfect
ground coat then you follow with the top

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.000
coat color of your choice

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.320
the great thing about 2k arrow spray in
the engine paint is that there's a 650

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.620
degree temperature rating so it's not
gonna cook off right next to your

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.420
exhaust ports and things like that

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.440
now if you don't want to go to Cairo
spray Eastwood has high temp ceramic

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.890
engine paint in all of your standard
engine colors that way if you want to

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.640
use your pneumatic spray equipment or
even brush it on you've got that option

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.480
if you want to brush it on use a foam
brush and not a bristle brush that way

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.710
you don't brush strokes now engine paint
is not header paint but if you want to

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.370
take care of your headers and coat them
Eastwood has products specifically for

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.270
that are designed to withstand those
extreme temperatures so now let's talk

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.140
about masking obviously you want to mask
off for a nice clean job especially if

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.649
you're using more than one color but you
also want to be very meticulous around

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.610
your gasketed surfaces and make sure and
mask them off so you don't have any seal

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.360
problems or interference between
tolerances such as a carburetor or an

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.520
upper lower intake manifold

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.410
now here's a cool trick this guy has
left his spark plugs in place let's face

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.410
it you're going to replace the plugs
that's a consumable so he's left the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.740
plugs in place and that's going to keep
paint from getting down into the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.520
sparkplug bore or into the combustion
chamber and that's never good

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.510
these are easy to take out and it's a
simple masking trick so make sure you
