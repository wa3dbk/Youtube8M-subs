00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:01.749
- [Ann] Hey guys, so this is my

00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:04.493
Get Ready with Me video,
and it's not often

00:00:04.493 --> 00:00:06.913
that Eric and I will get to go on a date,

00:00:06.913 --> 00:00:08.991
but when we do, we like to have fun.

00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:10.943
We like to go out for dinner or we either

00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:14.214
go to a party, or just
a simple movie night.

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.271
So depending on the occasion,
I like to get dolled up.

00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:19.019
But in this case, I'm
going to show you guys

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.013
a few different variations of outfits

00:00:22.013 --> 00:00:24.253
and my makeup routine since a lot

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:27.202
of you guys have been requesting for it.

00:00:27.202 --> 00:00:29.795
I just got these two pretty
necklaces from BaubleBar.

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:32.206
This one is called
Cleopatra and the other one

00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:34.456
just reminds me of a
smiling crescent moon,

00:00:34.456 --> 00:00:37.060
which is really pretty,
it's nice and dainty.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.081
I'm going to style around these necklaces

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:40.734
and if there's anything you guys like,

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:43.148
I will try my very best to place links

00:00:43.148 --> 00:00:45.018
on the bottom of this video along

00:00:45.018 --> 00:00:48.125
with a 20 percent off
discount code from BaubleBar.

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:50.151
All right guys, so it's
time to work on the makeup.

00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:51.898
I'm going to start with my eyes.

00:00:51.898 --> 00:00:55.112
I always like to start with
my eyes first, that way when

00:00:55.112 --> 00:00:58.178
I do my face makeup,
everything will look fresh.

00:00:58.178 --> 00:00:59.565
So starting with the eye primer,

00:00:59.565 --> 00:01:01.986
I'm currently using LORAC Eye Primer.

00:01:01.986 --> 00:01:03.740
It's not my favorite, however it comes

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.277
with this amazing eye
palette also from LORAC

00:01:06.277 --> 00:01:08.825
and I am using the color Unconditional.

00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:11.651
And then later on I'm applying a darker

00:01:11.651 --> 00:01:13.998
shade over and that is Unbridled.

00:01:13.998 --> 00:01:15.360
And of course an essential part

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.546
of beauty is staying
hydrated and refreshed,

00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:20.843
so make sure to have
some water by your side.

00:01:20.843 --> 00:01:21.950
Time for the eyeliner.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.527
I'm starting with a liquid eyeliner

00:01:23.527 --> 00:01:25.630
and this is by Eyeko as part of

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.730
the Alexa Chung line and I love it.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.491
For the bottom lash line, I'm using this

00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:32.472
NYX gel liner and I love
this because it's so easy

00:01:32.472 --> 00:01:34.392
to blend and it goes on nice and dark,

00:01:34.392 --> 00:01:37.907
especially if you're looking
for a good black liner.

00:01:37.907 --> 00:01:39.821
Giving my eyes a softer look and also

00:01:39.821 --> 00:01:42.599
adding some depth, I'm using black shadow

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:45.579
around where my eyeliner was applied

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.677
and also on the outer corners of my eyes.

00:01:48.677 --> 00:01:50.402
For the face I'm using my Benefit primer

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:52.640
and I'm also mixing two
foundations together,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.791
my Naked and my HD MAKE
UP FOR EVER foundation.

00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:56.966
By doing so, this will give me

00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:58.873
something closer to my skin tone

00:01:58.873 --> 00:02:00.675
and it just looks a lot better

00:02:00.675 --> 00:02:04.196
than just using one foundation shade.

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:06.594
I usually have a hard
time looking for a good

00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:09.224
foundation that will
match my skin complexion.

00:02:09.224 --> 00:02:10.852
Onto the eyebrows.

00:02:10.852 --> 00:02:13.472
Now, I'm using a mix between the Eyeko

00:02:13.472 --> 00:02:16.309
brow liner and also the Milani brow kit.

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:17.916
I like to use the Eyeko brow liner

00:02:17.916 --> 00:02:19.306
for the lighter part of my eyebrows

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:20.806
and then for the darker part of my

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:22.586
eyebrows I will use the powder

00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:25.363
to darken the tail line of my brows.

00:02:25.363 --> 00:02:26.919
My current favorite lip moisturizer

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:28.927
is this i smell great lip moisturizer

00:02:28.927 --> 00:02:31.937
and it makes my lips feel amazing.

00:02:31.937 --> 00:02:33.138
For the lips, I'm going for this

00:02:33.138 --> 00:02:34.747
MAKE UP FOR EVER lipstick and it's

00:02:34.747 --> 00:02:36.787
a really, really pretty soft pink.

00:02:36.787 --> 00:02:39.169
For my cheeks, I'm using
Benefit Dandelion blush,

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:40.519
and for the highlighting part,

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.724
I will be using Philosophy Grace.

00:02:42.724 --> 00:02:45.461
We are onto the last
step guys, I promise you.

00:02:45.461 --> 00:02:49.219
Now, I just need to curl my
lashes and add on some mascara.

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:51.378
For a more dramatic look and to add

00:02:51.378 --> 00:02:53.450
a nice pop to my eyes, I usually like

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.930
to wear faux lashes when
I know that I'm going

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.765
to take lots of pictures and be on camera.

00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:02.199
That's usually how I do
my makeup when I go out.

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.162
And if you guys want to hear my thoughts

00:03:04.162 --> 00:03:06.468
on all these products that I used today

00:03:06.468 --> 00:03:08.696
in this video, then check out my blog

00:03:08.696 --> 00:03:10.837
lifeannstyle.com where I will do

00:03:10.837 --> 00:03:12.777
a more thorough review for you guys.

00:03:12.777 --> 00:03:13.709
Onto the hair.

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.518
I will have to do a separate video

00:03:15.518 --> 00:03:17.076
on how I usually like to style

00:03:17.076 --> 00:03:18.996
my hair, but this is just the basic.

00:03:18.996 --> 00:03:21.863
I like to start with a
heat protectant spray

00:03:21.863 --> 00:03:24.055
and then I would go in
with a one inch barrel

00:03:24.055 --> 00:03:27.434
and just curl all my hair
in different directions.

00:03:27.434 --> 00:03:28.584
I usually like to curl my hair

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:30.105
to give it some texture and body

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:33.005
just 'cause my hair is
so flat and straight.

00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:35.096
I like to focus on curling
near toward the roots

00:03:35.096 --> 00:03:37.670
and then after that, I
will work my way down

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.692
toward the bottom part of the hair

00:03:39.692 --> 00:03:43.198
so that way I can have more volume up top.

00:03:43.198 --> 00:03:45.415
After curling all my hair,
I usually just take out

00:03:45.415 --> 00:03:48.942
a nice, flexible hair spray
and spray all around my hair.

00:03:48.942 --> 00:03:49.942
(music)

00:03:49.942 --> 00:03:51.025
I would flip my head upside down

00:03:51.025 --> 00:03:53.385
so that way I can just mess up the curls

00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:57.217
a little bit more, giving
that effortless look.

00:03:57.217 --> 00:03:59.203
Before getting dressed,
I'm going to set my makeup

00:03:59.203 --> 00:04:02.186
in with this NYX finishing
powder in Banana.

00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:03.758
All I'm doing is just brushing it

00:04:03.758 --> 00:04:05.292
where I have my makeup so that

00:04:05.292 --> 00:04:07.332
way everything could set nicely.

00:04:07.332 --> 00:04:10.205
All right, so now it's time
to change and I picked out

00:04:10.205 --> 00:04:13.380
a couple of outfits
that I want to try out.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.418
One's super casual and one

00:04:16.418 --> 00:04:20.434
semi-casual but also can be dressy.

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:22.373
So I'm starting with this striped

00:04:22.373 --> 00:04:25.265
dress and some thigh-high boots

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:28.433
to cover the legs, since it is still

00:04:28.433 --> 00:04:31.272
somewhat wintertime,
but California winter,

00:04:31.272 --> 00:04:35.565
so I can still wear a dress
and a lightweight jacket.

00:04:35.565 --> 00:04:37.336
So here, I'm just wearing this jacket

00:04:37.336 --> 00:04:40.317
to kind of break it up
from being too dressy

00:04:40.317 --> 00:04:42.958
and I have my necklace,
my statement necklace

00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.605
underneath to just give
it an extra sparkle.

00:04:46.605 --> 00:04:48.757
And this is my overall outfit.

00:04:48.757 --> 00:04:49.600
I love it.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.450
I feel like it's not overly
dressy, but at the same

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.930
time it is if you get
what I'm talking about.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.939
It's that kind of outfit
that's in between.

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:00.723
This next one is my super casual outfit

00:05:00.723 --> 00:05:04.844
where it's just good to go for hot dogs

00:05:04.844 --> 00:05:09.284
and a movie, so I usually
get a vegan hot dog

00:05:09.284 --> 00:05:13.057
at Jerry's and then I go
to the movies with Eric.

00:05:13.057 --> 00:05:14.475
So this is something that I would wear

00:05:14.475 --> 00:05:16.582
and then I kinda switch it up by just

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:19.111
changing into a blazer jacket afterward

00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:21.071
and it just looks more chic this way,

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:24.039
so there's different ways of wearing this,

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.884
and I just love all the outfits.

00:05:26.884 --> 00:05:27.952
What do you guys think?

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:31.266
Comment below and I will see
you guys in my next video.

00:05:31.266 --> 00:05:32.460
Ciao.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.390
