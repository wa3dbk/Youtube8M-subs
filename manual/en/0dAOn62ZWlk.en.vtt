00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.652
- I don't really know
what's going on today.

00:00:02.652 --> 00:00:07.150
(creak)
(jazzy music playing)

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:19.672
- I tried to eat a kiwi in 2011

00:00:19.672 --> 00:00:20.820
- and I haven't since.
- Yeah.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.736
- You take a bite out of a kiwi
and you gotta take a shower.

00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:24.954
- There is so much shit on this.

00:00:24.954 --> 00:00:27.344
- It's like going to kiss
someone who has a beard.

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:30.159
- That is not bad.

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:32.098
- I mean, this is totally
a great way to eat a kiwi.

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:33.943
- I donno, hairs are kind
of hanging around though.

00:00:33.943 --> 00:00:37.322
- And here I was like
a moron in 2011, just

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:39.219
trying to, like, de-skin.

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.495
- Yeah, I think I honestly just never

00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:42.992
eat the skin just cuz...

00:00:42.992 --> 00:00:43.735
- [Man] It's weird.

00:00:43.735 --> 00:00:46.394
- It was a norm that
was impressed upon me.

00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:49.370
- It's supposed to be
like a fun little game,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.403
when you pull the string cheese down.

00:00:51.403 --> 00:00:54.104
- String cheese never comes
out in cute little strings.

00:00:54.104 --> 00:00:55.574
- Ain't nothin wrong with that.

00:00:55.574 --> 00:00:56.345
- Nothing to it.

00:00:56.345 --> 00:00:57.688
- I imagine that's what...

00:00:59.374 --> 00:01:00.921
eating a moth tastes like.

00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:02.081
- (laughs)

00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:03.696
- See, this just saves time.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:04.497
- This is gross.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:06.553
- It's cheese, it's good either way.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.023
- Like a little mini Persian cucumber.

00:01:11.023 --> 00:01:11.488
- Yeah.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:12.259
- Just biting into it.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.275
- Ow!

00:01:13.275 --> 00:01:14.494
- I have done this.

00:01:14.494 --> 00:01:15.597
Not in public!

00:01:15.597 --> 00:01:17.118
- It's like a little (beep)

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:18.550
- It's a big (beep)!

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.295
- This is very flexi--

00:01:22.331 --> 00:01:23.132
- Yeah.

00:01:23.132 --> 00:01:24.689
- Eew.

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.616
Gross.

00:01:26.864 --> 00:01:27.827
- I'm satisfied.

00:01:27.827 --> 00:01:30.178
- It's like a popsicle, but healthy.

00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:34.290
- Is that cereal with ice?

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.578
- Watery milk.

00:01:35.578 --> 00:01:37.341
Sounds like a nightmare.

00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:37.836
- (laughs)

00:01:37.836 --> 00:01:39.125
- There's more ice than cereal.

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:41.120
- I'm just gonna refuse,
that's disgusting.

00:01:43.273 --> 00:01:43.907
- Well.

00:01:43.907 --> 00:01:45.411
- I don't know him.
- I would say...

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:47.401
- I actually kinda like it.

00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:49.688
- Yeah, actually, I take
back everything I said.

00:01:49.688 --> 00:01:51.069
- The milk is so great cold.

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.451
- I dig it.

00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:54.000
(slurping)

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.299
- The ice kinda just brings
it all together, man.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.818
- We shouldn't be
constricted by what society

00:01:58.818 --> 00:01:59.584
tells us.

00:01:59.584 --> 00:02:01.360
- If we didn't have
rogue, crazy adventurous

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.846
people like you out
there, we wouldn't have

00:02:02.846 --> 00:02:06.724
wonderful things like
electricity or Netflix.

00:02:06.724 --> 00:02:08.657
- Maybe there's a way we can
make broccoli taste better.

00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:10.250
- Ice?

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.212
- I'm gonna try more things with ice.

00:02:12.212 --> 00:02:14.267
- I don't think it should
matter how you eat it,

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:15.971
as long as you enjoy it.

00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:19.391
Just like...

00:02:19.998 --> 00:02:20.951
Sex.
- Sex.

00:02:20.951 --> 00:02:22.364
(both laugh)
