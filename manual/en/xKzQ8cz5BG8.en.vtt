00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
right harry all of us are not armed

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.470
leading by a average of about twelve
point to three different polls uh...

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.570
crushing that ron the arriving early
date for the first although they have

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.529
now that he's in the race so my question
is

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.320
kendrick terry actually win the
presidency

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.899
uh... and

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:23.040
as a hell of a questions i think that
there's some sense

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.179
jenifer listen if you get he stands out
as a dumbass

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.709
in a field that includes gingrich

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:32.880
cents for a movie canon bachman

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.029
and he is the longest

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:37.580
says currently serving governor
america's so yes of course he can be

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.070
elected yeah

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.250
and loving kind to me he looks like josh
brolin playing george bush in the movie

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.930
w view while inside write-down and uh...
and i think you really worth going to go

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.399
back in that direction

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.769
but on the other hand michael i think
there are three republicans who've been

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:54.730
went every romney

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.490
uh... i think harry and i think huckabee
via speculates i think there's always a

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.230
way back off course i could be wrong
hill and i think i mean i think first of

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.350
all it it shows the fluidity of this
race the manager shows that they're not

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.139
happy with their candidates are

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:10.740
somebody thought comes along

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.360
goes to the head of the pack of course
is urs polls were relying on adored

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.920
could tacky now deciding whether or not
to run sarah pale in deciding whether or

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.769
not to run

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:22.290
of course i still think through the
mister bush got into the race he won the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.820
nomination hands-down uh... so i think
that that the other undecided nelson can

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.930
figure out what their constituents is

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.510
if their trade if independent white
males in the midwest are these are the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.760
swing vote in the selection mit romney
uh... basil i would think a better shot

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.559
at getting those voters than does rick
perry because he seems like the coop

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:43.620
but uh... but if the republicans in
other parts of the country already

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.530
decided that's gonna be who it is

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.439
it's in the you know it's still the
miracle battle for perry i think i i

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.240
just don't see his government attorneys
campaign released a video of the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.690
idealized vision of of american future

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.390
was called colonie barbarian so there
was there for a while you're mad max of

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.320
the state but sell his apparent

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.420
uh... obviously he feels the social
conservatives but at the same time

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.470
e-bills economic pressures that's why i
always thought if he got in he would be

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.030
eight incredibly formidable candidate
and he's got this record where he could

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.980
turn on this and that all the jobs are
created in texas now that's there's a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.050
lot of nuances and it's not exactly
right but there's some truth to it by

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.750
now so is at least enough for a
republican to be able to help my

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.929
guidance unconsciousness

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:33.709
beholden feckless if you have chosen the
greatest of all the members is there

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.659
anything this is all that is very
different in my michael dukakis ran on

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.519
the mountain messages as miracle and
uh... and it was up up and told them

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.300
what propelled his candidacy

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.850
in nineteen eighty eight and he comes
onto the scene in the tear apart goodbye

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.419
bill what then they're all was a

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.210
and i i think that that you know there's
something of that would that would would

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.850
uh... held an intake i think it all the
three carrie kennedy elected it depends

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.059
on if the media shows up in does even
half of the job

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:03.300
now they have in fact probably gonna but
if they did if the media shows up and

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.109
shines a light on israel record knowing
that he can get on a park worse than

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.130
michael dukakis because he's got a week
in his book he said that the other so

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.399
securities unconstitutional medicare's
unconstitutional in

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:18.169
see what happened in new york when
people say that stuff right so how i i

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:22.080
don't i think if the media it's all the
times out of the media shows up right

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.449
you had to be fair and i think the media
is on a pretty decent job of show a

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.059
couple of these rick perry things in the
beginning and and then uh... i love his

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:33.360
spokesperson to repair to respond to all
the charges of how the crazy the book is

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.450
weakened the book says this is an
amendment is wrong we should not any

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.390
income tax and all which you do this
basically national sales tax that killed

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.330
the poor in the middle class and less
touristy buys on what it's called the

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.590
fairtax which is so overwhelming is the
exact opposite of those of the republic

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.930
of texan i mean that's without further
about all that on the right but you know

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.020
what they did so with the responses
spokesperson was all of that book was

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.109
looking backwards not for any of that
book was written off

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.499
nine months ago non-japanese now and
there's a lot of that has come to light

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:07.359
i think you know and maybe i'm just
reading said to me the parece websites

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:07.960
that

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.199
that b_j_'s

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.060
but look i think he's got a real shot
here

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.850
but i think that there's some chance
that at some point he blows himself up

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:16.449
right

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.689
that he's gonna because he's just not
quite bright enough he doesn't have a

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:21.109
role that likely

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.660
rolf like i could grab and and i had
like a seat they will say that don't say

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.240
that those say that say missing they say
this rate right now without that kind of

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.520
discipline ideas some place of the
strength to report any doesn't have the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.249
the infrastructure that the bushes gave
to their son you know uh... that did

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:39.780
uh... you know so i think it can be very
difficult for him to sustain

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.190
it's been what few weeks cities in the
race he goes to the head of a class that

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.590
is not very impressive

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.110
uh... he takes both really away from
nobody he'd be picks up all those votes

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.349
from you know undecideds or people have
to be in trouble

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.490
who were just kind of looking for a
candidate again so i think that uh... i

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.730
wouldn't trust these numbers and i
certainly would not trust rick perry as

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.490
my nominee if i were republican yet

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.090
they you know what as as back and it is
a fatal bombings uh... i sanctity

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.149
rich parents and when the national

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:13.509
i think he can win it but you got it
can't be a lot of point all my god he's

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:17.629
doing everything wrong we say that i
think that we we know we always make fun

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:20.130
of uh... one of the team that uh...

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.610
the current public and

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.880
uh... presidential hopeful of is so
inward the pro endurance initial demand

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.660
anti science but it was that there was a
dummy you know we elected brocco bomber

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.539
who rules as a republican and we're
gonna vote for him again

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:33.440
maxwell

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.920
now was not with and planned everything
might my theory is that

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.140
uh... then you know i think it is all
driven by the money of course there and

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.329
you know so is always says and this is
an insanity of money from a certain

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:46.930
ratio in that direction generally
speaking

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.210
institutional pressure other personal
corruption right

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.450
so and so

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.830
this system sets up so you only two
choices only in the long run is a

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.950
corporal but or your uncle mama he

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.400
a little later building robots or
liability like carrier bachmann double

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.569
the whole place up great so villages
between the two corporal

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.430
and so i think that's for stopping
fortunes
