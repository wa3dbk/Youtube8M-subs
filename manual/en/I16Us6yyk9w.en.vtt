MC: She's won more comedy awards than I've got time to list. It's Sarah Millican!

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.960
*crowd applauds*

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.820
Hello, it's lovely to be here.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.960
I'm gradually sort of getting used to
your temperature though.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.060
The heat affects me in a really weird way. Sort of here...

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.980
*crowd laughs*

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.560
Just gets a bit... I would call it cloggy
where I'm from.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.200
*crowd laughs*

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.200
I understand your word for it is moist.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.550
*crowd laughs*

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.090
But what I do when that happens is I just
do a plie.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.680
I'm not a massive ballerina but if I was a ballerina I would be a massive ballerina.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.030
*crowd laughs*

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.930
And if it gets too much; if there's too much moisture... I just do this.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.820
*crowd laughs*

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.260
It's instantly better.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.840
*crowd laughs*

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.020
I'm enjoying my time in Australia but I do miss my cat terribly. I have a cat and he's adorable.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.220
But I have two friends who look after him while I'm away.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.370
The first friend is an animal lover.
Second one not really bothered.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.780
The animal lover will send me a photograph of my cat and he'll be having his dinner.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.240
or having a nap or playing because that's all they do.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.180
And underneath she'll put "hello mum."

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.950
I miss you.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.620
Yeah he calls me Mum, shut up. My other friend she does it because she loves me.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.380
She doesn't love animals at all but she loves me.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.200
It's really sweet. She sent a photograph
just the same but underneath her's it'll say:

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.320
"Here is the photograph
you requested."

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.360
*crowd laughs*

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.360
"It is still alive i will check again tomorrow."

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.820
*crowd laughs*

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.659
I bought a house last year, very exciting. I've never owned a house before.

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.759
I've realised though because I've lived in the city centre a long time it's very odd for me.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.320
I'm not used to country living. Every time i drive along my street

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.400
and I see somebody with a
white marquee tent in their garden,

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.980
instead of thinking '"Oh, somebody's having a lovely summer party."

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.980
I just think "Oh someone's been murdered."

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.160
*crowd laughs*

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.980
When I moved in I got a few things
changed. Just a few things.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.660
One of the things I got in was a grab rail in the shower because my mum and dad  are both disabled

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.020
and both getting on a bit and I
thought when they come to stay,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.480
it would be useful for them to have a grab rail.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.380
So I've got this really sturdy grab rail fitted in the shower, and I was showing my friend around the house,

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.540
and I said I've got a grab
rail and she went "oooooh."

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.860
*crowd laughs*

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.890
And I said no, not ooooh, trying to keep pensioners upright.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.970
*crowd laughs*

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.320
And I told my dad because I thought he'd find it funny. And he went oh for that you'd need two.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.480
*crowd laughs*

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.540
But my boyfriend also moved in, We've
been together for seven years.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.980
I think we might be rushing it. He moved in and he walked in when I was in the bath the other day.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.140
He walked into the bathroom and I don't
have a problem with that.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.200
We don't toilet in front of each other but I think, he can brush his teeth while i'm having a bath, that's fine.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.400
Mainly because I'm happy with my figure
and he's seen all of it.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.840
And he likes what he sees. But he like checked me out. He did like an up and down.

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.060
You know like people do but because I
was lying in the bath it was sort of side to side.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.520
*crowd laughs*

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.060
It already looked quite
dismissive to be honest.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.020
*crowd laughs*

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.820
And then his mouth opened and I thought oh, there's a comment coming I wasn't expecting to be bloody reviewed.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:58.220
And he leaned over and went "nice torso."
What kind of a compliment is that?

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.740
Nice torso. He's either been watching too
much CSI or he really hates limbs

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.780
*crowd laughs*

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.920
But what I like about living, I've
lived on my own for a long time.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.160
What I like about having somebody else in the
house is that he'll just come out with a

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.609
sentence that I would never have said.
The most recent one he said to me:

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.609
"Your shed's no good to have a wank in"

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:27.550
*crowd laughs*

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.590
And I said that's because it's a
greenhouse love.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.370
You've been lovely, thank you very much, good night!
