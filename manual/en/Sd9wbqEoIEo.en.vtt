How to grill the perfect roast:
Hi, I'm Stanley Lobel.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.630
Our customs are often intimidated by the
idea of grilling a piece of meat as

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.480
large as a rib roast but it's the same
basic technique use for grilling large

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.490
steaks. And the results are just
incredible, the juiciest, most tender

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.070
roast you can imagine, with unique flavor
you can only get from cooking over smoke

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.140
and flame. Once you try grilling a rib
roast you'll wonder why you haven't

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.900
learned this technique sooner. One thing
to note is that you don't need to sear a

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.020
roast over direct heat. In fact, you
should not sear a bone and tied rib roast.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.879
It will burn off the twine that
holds the ribs to the meat. If you choose

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.780
to sear the roast don't sear the fat side, sear only the meat or bone side on each

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.770
end. While grilling or roasting, the roast
will render a considerable amount of

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.360
juice and fat so you need to use a drip
pan. Fill the drip pan about half full of

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.890
water, wine, beer, or any other liquid.
You'll need to replenish the liquid as

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.420
needed to maintain a constant level for
the duration of the cooking time. the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.360
drip pan will prevent flare-ups and the
juices in the drip pan can be the basis

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.939
of a great sauce to serve with the
roast. Arrange your fire on each side of

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.509
the grill with the drip pan in the
middle. If you're using a chimney style

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.740
charcoal starter, just distribute the
coals evenly on each side.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.149
You can also build a large fire and then
push the coals from side to side. Remove

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.110
the roast from the refrigerator. Allow it to
come to room temperature,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.690
oh for about one to two hours, depending
on the size of the roast. Assemble your

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.090
ingredients, which includes olive oil, sea
salt or kosher salt, and pepper just

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.709
before putting the roast on the grill.
Once the roast has come to room

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.720
temperature, brush it with olive oil and
sprinkle with salt and freshly ground

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.830
pepper.
Now we're finally ready to grill. Grill

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.820
roasts in the center of the grill grid
over the drip pan, with the grill lid on.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.860
After about 80% of the estimated time
has elapsed, check the roast's internal

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.520
temperature. Don't poke the roast too
early, you'll only lose precious juices.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.710
Once the roast has reached the desirable
degree of doneness, remove it from the

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.870
grill and allow it to rest for 15 to 30
minutes, depending upon the size of the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.390
roast, so the juices can redistribute within the meat for
the juiciest roast you've ever tasted.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.370
For a boned and tied rib roast, just
before slicing and serving snip the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.920
twine that holds the ribs onto the roast,
separate the meat from the bones, and you

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.480
have a boneless rib roast for serving
and the delicious rack of beef of ribs

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.000
as a special treat. Check our website at
