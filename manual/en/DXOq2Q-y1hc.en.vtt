How to Choose Hair Color.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.960
Whether coloring your hair professionally
or at home, choose the right haircolor to

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.410
complement your skin tone.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.480
Be it all-over color, highlights, or lowlights,
the right shade will make your look come to

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.480
life.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.860
and selected items from your wardrobe.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.340
Step 1.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.690
Decide whether you're going to use a professional
salon or an at-home coloring kit.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.640
Base your decision on whether you are covering
gray, highlighting a natural hair color, or

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.000
using hair color to completely change your
image.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.010
Plan your commitment to hair coloring.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.650
Temporary hair colors wash out quickly, semi-permanent
products typically last for a couple of months,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.260
and permanent dyes will need to be grown out
or require frequent root touchups.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.260
Step 2.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.739
Get out your color shade selector and color
wheel.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.159
Use a mirror to decide if you have a cool
or warm complexion based on your skin tone,

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.670
eye color, and natural hair color.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.200
Remember, the results on the box or swatch
are only an approximation of the color.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.720
Cool complexions typically have deep brown
or ash-colored hair, with dark brown or dark

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.860
blue eye color and a medium to olive complexion.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.790
Warm complexions feature golden brown, green-blue
to hazel eye color, with golden brown to strawberry

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.430
blonde hair color and a fair to peachy complexion.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.750
Step 3.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.940
Examine your wardrobe to get a feel of what
hair color would suit you.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.260
Green, blue, and violet are cool shades.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.750
Warm hues are reds, oranges, and yellows.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.810
Step 4.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.960
Try highlights or lowlights if you're not
ready to commit to all-over hair color.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.520
Add caramel highlights for a sunkissed look;
copper highlights are great for warm complexions;

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.120
and chunky lowlights add dimension and a modern
flair.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.780
Step 5.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.110
Experiment with your look.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.820
Go for the black Goth look you've always craved
or see if blondes really do have more fun.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.480
Opt for a fiery red hue to match your fiery
personality.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.750
Temporary dyes make experimenting a cinch
-- after all, it's only color.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.730

indicate Ancient Egyptians used henna to dye

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.530
