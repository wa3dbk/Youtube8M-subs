Hi everyone, you're watching Fenkoplet.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.700
From this tutorial you will learn
how to make a Name friendship bracelet.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.300
This technique is called
Two-Colour Alpha.

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.800
A two-colour alpha scheme looks like this:

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.000
It doesn't have any arrows,
and there are only Forward and Backward knots in it.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.860
For today I've made this scheme: SUMMER

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.590
(The name and the season in one.)

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.700
The scheme has 7 squares in height.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.450
It means we need to take 7 strings for the base.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.320
The colour of the base will match the colour of letters.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.500
I'm going to take yellow.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.600
These strings are not much used in the process,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.790
so 50 cm (20 inches) will be enough.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.700
Also you need to take one more string,
it will be the weaving one.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.000
It should be at least 5 m (196 inches) long.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.850
The length of our scheme is 35 squares.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.320
Now I tell you what it means.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.500
We need the name to be in the center
of the bracelet

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.900
So we need to make some "blank" rows
on both sides.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.300
Now we need to calculate how many rows
we need on each side.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.200
First, measure your wrist circumference.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.010
For example, you need to make a
13 cm (~5 inches) long bracelet.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.000
On an average, it takes 5 rows to get the length of 1 cm.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.790
So, we multiply 13 by 5 = 65 rows.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.400
We've already counted
the length of the scheme (35 rows),

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.970
so there are 30 more "blank" rows to be made.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.800
Thus, we have 15 blank rows to make on each
side of the bracelet.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.700
Now secure your strings to a solid surface,
place your weaving string to the left,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.930
and start tying.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.530
First, make a row of Forward knots, tying your
weaving string over the base strings.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.770
Let's remember how it's done.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.400
Cross your weaving string over the base,
forming a loop.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.400
Pull it from the bottom upwards and tighten the knot.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.100
Make the second knot using the same strings.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.400
Remember that all knots in friendship bracelets
are made of two.

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.769
So, make the whole row.

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.200
After that, you change the direction

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.600
and make Backward knots using the same string.

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.400
We need to make 15 blank rows.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.149
After making 15 rows, start the scheme.

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:30.500
The first knot in the first row of our scheme is
the same colour,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.889
so you make it just as before.

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:36.349
The next three knots are yellow.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.700
For your next knot to be yellow,

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.929
just make a knot using the base string.

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:47.100
In other words, you make it the other way round.

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:50.000
That's it, real easy.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.929
The next knot is again green,

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.619
then yellow, and green.

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:59.900
So this is how two-colour alpha is made.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.900
Now we're going in the other direction.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.849
In this row the knots are alternating:

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.700
Green - Yellow - Green - Yellow -
Green - Yellow - Green.

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:09.600
Continue in the same way following the scheme.

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.769
The first letter "S" is done!

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.239
Continue making rows according to your scheme,

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.389
and don't forget to make 15 blank rows at the end.

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.100
The bracelet is done, and all you need to do now is

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.000
End your bracelet with simple braids or rope braids.

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:26.300
That's the Two-Colour Alpha friendship bracelet!

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.589
