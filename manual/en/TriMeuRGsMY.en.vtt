home

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.620
for I am Diane Wallace welcome to
Adorama TV

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.080
I don't know about you but I love my
phone I use it for everything

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.699
it always with me I love taking pictures
and sharing them

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.970
but all ways digital I can share them on
social media

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.550
I can't add text them to friends but I
never get to really see them in print

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.290
well now we have something new that will
change that the people it impossible

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.480
have a great solution for me

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.809
and for everybody who really loves to
see their pictures in print

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.520
this is the new instant lab and actually
Prince

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.100
your smartphone pictures to polaroid the
first thing you notice out of the box

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.160
is a great package design now if you've
been watching these videos from me you

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.730
know

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.719
miss tucker for really good boxing very
simple to get to

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.280
great design this is our instant lab now
the first thing you need to do

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.500
is download the free app it's available
for

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.500
any I less device and it's free online

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.689
but that's going to allow you to
transfer your image from your phone

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.060
to the lab instant lab works with
instant

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.930
film and they have that from impossible
but you can also use instant film for

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.090
Polaroid cameras

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.970
so that leads right into the front I've
already done it so I don't wanna open

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.670
this again

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.369
but it's really simple to split down the
front and pop in the cartridge

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.360
and you're good to go step three is to
extend the tower

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.380
and all you is pull it straight up from
the top

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.729
that's it there's five pieces they snap
into place

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.689
next open the app on your phone and
choose the image that you want to print

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.479
then it will let you crop and make some
adjustments you can really customize

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.070
what your picture will look like

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.820
now they are images ready all you do is
drop your phone

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.320
on the tray and wait for it to light up

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.159
when the flashlights up on your phone
you're ready to pull the shutter slide

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:00.950
in the back

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.390
leave it all the way open and when the
flash goes off

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.899
slide it back in that's it

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.940
you're done you can push the eject
button on the front

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.690
and I'll get corporate now

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.959
there is it cover that comes out to
cover your picture

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.989
you don't want to expose it to light
until it's ready so make sure when you

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.450
take it of the camera

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.420
but face down somewhere so that it's not
exposed and that's it

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.890
it's really simple you've now gone from
this picture
