Hello collectors, Pavle from CardzReview.com here

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:15.000
and in this video I'll be on unboxing starter
pack of Topps Match Attax England World Cup Trading card collection.

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:22.500
Topps published this collection
parallel with their sticker collection two weeks ago.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.759
Complete collection
features 304 cards

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.859
plus 18 limited edition cards.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.410
There are six players featured on
limited edition match attax cards

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.180
each player appears in three types of
cards :

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.710
goal, silver and bronze. Great thing about

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.900
this set is that there are 4000
signed trading cards that Topps randomly puts in

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.120
startpacks

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.239
so I hope to get one. Anyway if anyone
managed to get to one of these

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.260

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.930

collectors!

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.739
Price will distort the back is 3.99 GBP.

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.630
It includes  hardback collectors binder
10 Match Attax cards

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.470
and a collector's wallchart.  There is
also limited edition card inside.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.659
As you can see I'll get Wayne Rooney LE
limited edition gold card.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.510
Let's now opened this starter
pack and see what I will get.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.260
This collection  should not be confused
with World Stars 2014 that Topps

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.250
published in some other countries

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.260
both collections are similar but there
are

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.970
obvious differences. You can read my
