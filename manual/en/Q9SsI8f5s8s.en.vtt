00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.360
FOP is a Pontoon 21 hard bait  of the Woody Soul series.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.029
The main material

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.179
Woody Soul is made of

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.499
is the balsa tree.

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.099
And this material wasn’t chosen accidentally.

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.029
The balsa lure is known to have

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.660
a special rhythm and a 
smooth action which

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.500
doesn’t arouse the suspicion of

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.560
the most cautious fish.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.130
And the possibilities of the natural

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.730
material
emphasized

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.530
the peculiarities of FOP baits.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.220
Action, effortless and responsive to any manipulations,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.630
is possible at any kind of presentation.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.410
And upstream fishing is

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.350
sometimes the only

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.680
possible tactics.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.470
Moreover,  in many cases fish bite

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.490
upon the landing of the lure.  Lesser density

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.010
of balsa tree helps to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.890
imitate 
a natural fall of

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.010
a beetle or a big grasshopper, for instance.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.910
FOP is characterized by a relatively small

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.890
depth of sinking

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.700
when the lure leaves

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.750
feelers on the surface
which attract

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.010
a lot of predators.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.190
But balsa,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.850
being a delicate wood
exposed to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.780
absorbing water,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.150
requires a complicated process of

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.430
manufacture.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.380
It is quite difficult to produce

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.100
lures with identical action

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.410
from such a heterogeneous material. Nevertheless,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.820
Pontoon21 achieved high

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.990
reproducibility of the FOP  properties,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.150
having applied an original construction.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.640
This lure has a skeleton

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.479
made from another material
which helps to

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.280
stabilize 
its size and mass center.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.610
The body itself is made of balsa.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.000
This technology allowed Pontoon21

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.010
to reintroduce balsa into 
modern collection of

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.270
Hard baits.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.970
and remove the stigma of
the previous centuries from

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.640
this amazing natural

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.230
material.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.600
The body of the lure has 
a multilayer hard

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.160
coating which is also the result of a special

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.860
manufacturing process. Certain

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.320
details of

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.590
FOP

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.250
are encrusted with

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.840
metal foil, emphasizing the colors

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.250
of the series. The color spectrum of FOP consists of

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.639
different hues -

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.319
from warm Yamame
to cool Gill.

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.230
Trout, brown trout, grayling,
greedy for insects dace,

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.530
omnivorous chub and orfe
These are

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.969
the trophies of FOP models.
