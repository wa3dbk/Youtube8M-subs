00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.160
MoëtHennessy is the world leader in cognac and champagne 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.629
with the magical brands we all know, and Estates &amp; Wines,

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:13.110
a unique collection of estates and vineyards 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.460
around the world that are part of MoëtHennessy. 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.120
People often forgot that Maison Moët

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.880
was the first to go from the Old World to explore the New World 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.180
Three métiers have been combined into one, with three different products,

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.709
three expressions of our different terroirs.

00:00:26.709 --> 00:00:28.900
First, sparkling wines.

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.520
There are six Chandon brand vineyards worldwide, which is unique.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.540
We also have a second product category, 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.660
which we call lifestyle wines,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.550
these are global brands and wines designed to satisfy all tastes.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.800
Cloudy Bay is a perfect example and a global success.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.760
And finally we have expressions

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.490
of small vineyards and unique terroirs, veritable jewels.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.600
Numanthia, Newton and Cape Mentelle.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.220
They will never be able to produce large volumes, 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.430
but we make uniquely precise and refined wines there.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.420
When we look at a new acquisition,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.720
or at building a brand, it’s often because we instantly feel a certain passion. 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.299
Even if it’s sometimes irrational, it’s still based on 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.280
our experience and close observation of what’s being done. 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.360
Our real export is passion, 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.539
the talent and expertise of our people, plus financial, distribution and marketing resources,

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.539
and a strategic vision.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.840
We’re able to form local teams,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.300
and these resources let them express their savoir-faire,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.900
their amazing passion for their terroir.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.210
Currently the most exciting adventure 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.090
for Estates &amp; Wines is in Tibet, on the banks of the Mekong River.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.140
Originally, the idea was to make wine to be sold only in China, 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.220
but we changed direction 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.900
and we’re going to export this wine

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.560
with a certain pride, because we think it will be 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.750
one of the finest wines produced in China.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.460
The world of wine is about innovation, 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.590
continually challenging yourself, scientific research, adapting 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.270
and evolving styles. 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.560
I often tell our teams 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.460
don’t believe that anything is always true, have doubts 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.589
never stop searching and find inspiration 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.079
in what’s being done elsewhere, including the errors others might make.

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.439
The world of wine tends to be very conservative, 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.899
and never question what it does.

00:02:16,899 --&gt; 00:02:20,809

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:20.799
But we’ve believe that innovation and constantly challenging things,

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:23.800
striving for true excellence, are tremendous assets. 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.180
That’s really the DNA of Estates &amp; Wines and the MoëtHennessy Wines &amp; Spirits Division.
