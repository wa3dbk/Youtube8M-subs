00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.033
Hi, this is Megan Schwitzer with the National Weather Service office in Flagstaff, Arizona.

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:09.033
This is the winter outlook for the upcoming winter season

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:14.000
from December of 2014 through February of 2015.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Although currently in a neutral state, the Climate Prediction Center is anticipating the development of El 
Nino

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.066
with a 60 to 65% chance within the next couple of months. Most indications show that this will be a week to 
moderate El Nino event.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:35.000
Here's a look at the official winter precipitation outlook from the Climate Prediction Center.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We can see the areas shaded in the brown colors are showing higher chances for drier than normal 
conditions

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.066
while areas shaded in green show better chances for above normal precipitation.

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:53.033
We cn see much of the Southern United States including the state of Arizona

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:58.033
show a tilt in the odds favoring wetter than normal conditions, particularly areas from 

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:03.033
Flagstaff southward in the darker green shaded area.

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:11.033
Here's a look at the winter temperature outlook. Warmer colors are showing better chances for warmer 
temperatures this winter

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:16.000
generally along the Western United States and the cooler colors, the blue, showing 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
better chances for colder than normal conditions.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
In Arizona we can see that western portions of the state are showing a slight favor toward warmer 
temperatures

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.033
while the rest of Arizona shows no clear indication of warmer or cooler than normal conditions.

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:40.066
With the anticipation of an El Nino development let's look at winter precipitation from past El Nino years.

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:43.066
Here we're looking at two different composites

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:49.033
on the left side we've taken all of the weak El Nino years and averaged their precipitation together. 

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:55.033
We see a slightly wetter than normal signature across Western Arizona

00:01:55.033 --> 00:02:00.033
with not much indication for wetter or drier than normal across the rest of the state.

00:02:00.033 --> 00:02:08.066
On the right side, were looking at moderate and strong El Nino years averaged together.

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:13.033
We see a more widespread signal for wetter than normal conditions across much of 

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:18.033
the southwest including the entire state of Arizona.

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:27.066
Let's take that one step further and look at all of the weak El Nino years individually. We're looking at each 
weak El 

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:33.033
Nino year and its precipitation departure from average.

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:38.000
We can see that three of these years were drier than normal across Arizona

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.066
while two of these years were wetter than normal across Arizona.

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:45.033
With only five events a look at

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:51.000
and a varied signal it is hard to draw conclusions from the weak El Nino events.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Conversely, here's a look at all the strong El Nino events in their departures from average precipitation. Of 
the 7 events, 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.066
6 of these events were wetter than normal across Arizona

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:09.033
with only one events resulting in drier than normal conditions.

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:15.000
Now that we've looked at precipitation let's take a look at some seasonal snowfall in the Flagstaff area.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Each individual snowflake represents a seasonal snowfall total during an El Nino event. We've grouped all 
of the El Nino events into 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
weak El Nino on the left, moderate El Nino in the center, and Strong El Ninos on the right.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.033
The red line in the center indicates Flagstaff's normal seasonal snowfall of just about 100 inches.

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:42.066
The weak El Nino years when averaged together average just below normal snowfall,

00:03:42.066 --> 00:03:49.000
but they ranged anywhere from 50 inches to just over 130 inches.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
We see a similar signal with a moderate El Nino years while we see a stronger tendancy towards

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.033
snowier winters with the strong El Nino events.

00:03:59.033 --> 00:04:02.066
To summarize the winter outlook for the upcoming winter season,

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:07.066
we're looking at a good chance of El Nino developing, most likely a week to 

00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:12.066
moderate El Nino, and lasting into the spring of 2015.

00:04:12.066 --> 00:04:19.066
Climate patterns can vary considerably from one El Nino to the next and when looking at climatological data 
across Northern Arizona, 

00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:25.000
especially for the week El Nino events, it's hard to find conclusive trends.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.033
The official winter outlook which takes into account expected El Nino conditions

00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:32.066
as well as climate model projections

00:04:32.066 --> 00:04:38.000
calls for slightly enhance chances of above normal precipitation across Northern Arizona.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.033
The odds also slightly favor warmer than normal temperatures across Western Arizona.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:48.033
Thank you so much for your time and for listing to the winter outlook for the upcoming season!

00:04:48.033 --> 00:04:53.000
We hope that we were able to answer some of your questions about what is expected this winter.
