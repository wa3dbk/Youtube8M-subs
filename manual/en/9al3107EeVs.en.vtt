00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.270
In this step, we're going to take the tambourine
and we're going to take a drumstick in the

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:12.099
other hand and play on two and four with the
stick. Now, kind of the same principle as

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.020
playing with your hand, like hitting it in
the palm of your hand. The difference is the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.619
tone. And it is a little bit more awkward
to use a stick when playing the tambourine,

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.390
just because you're kind of hitting it sideways.
It's just a strange feeling for whatever hand

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.789
is holding the stick. It gives you kind of
a click sound when it hits, which is kind

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.890
of cool because it can help accent the snare
drum. Or if you're doing side sticks on the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:46.060
snare drum, it can help accentuate that as
well. So, grab the tambourine, and we'll start

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:56.590
playing. One and two, and three, and four,
and two, four, two, four, one, two, three,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:04.900
four, one, two, three, four. Now the thing
is it's not so much you're coming back and

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.790
hitting the tambourine as hard as you can.
It's more just like kind of clapping the stick

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:22.180
and the tambourine together.
Now the one thing about this is you'll notice

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.439
too, with, when you're hitting with the stick,
you're kind of getting a plastic sound, which

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.189
isn't bad. When you do it with a wood tambourine,
it sounds a little bit better because you're

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.240
hitting two pieces of wood--obviously the
stick and the tambourine. It gives you more

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:46.280
of a wood flavor, and more of a warm sound.
So, that is how we would go ahead and play

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.829
the tambourine with the stick. Another way
is, some people actually have--and I don't,

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.420
because I don't play a tambourine when I'm
playing my drum set--they might have a tambourine

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.500
mounted somewhere on the kit, and you would
actually--you could actually hit it like that.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.250
See how the cowbell is mounted? They might
have this stand for the tambourine. And you

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.870
can actually hit it with the stick just like
that. Just a little bit of an accessory on

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.069
the drum kit. Those are the two ways that
you could use a drumstick to play the tambourine.
