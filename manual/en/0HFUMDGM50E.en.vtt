00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.273
I'm Saskya Pane

00:00:01.273 --> 00:00:01.773
I'm Neno

00:00:01.773 --> 00:00:03.517
Back Again

00:00:03.517 --> 00:00:04.017
With Us

00:00:04.017 --> 00:00:05.097
on Masak.TV

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.540
On this webisode I accompanied with Neno. And we will make Martabak.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.220
Sweet Martabak. Not Martabak Bangka not the Martabak Bandung but Martabak a la Masak.TV

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.220
Neno, could you explain the Ingredient?

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.220
This is an egg, sugar, baking powder, multipurpose flour, Milk, 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.920
Baking soda, sunflower seed, almond, and meises.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.980
Now mix the multipurpose flour and egg.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.520
Mix it well.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.280
Why are you so silent Neno?

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.080
I'm mixing this.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.440
So how's it feels to be part of our family?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.240
Is it done?

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.260
Ya it's done.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.820
Nah this should be mix well.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:30.080
The bubble has came out. Then we should cover it with wet cloth and left it in the room temperature for about an hour.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.360
This is the mix after one hour.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.580
This is the baking soda we should add water. 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.520
1 table spoon more or less.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.740
Is it should be mix with water first?

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.240
yes

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.360
Why?

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.540
I don't know. The Street vendor told me just mix it with water. 

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:49.574
No I add it to the mix.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:59.880
This is the challenge. You should know when the pan already hot or not.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.180
It's been heated up for 5-10 minutes.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.640
It's hot enough.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.957
What about the kue lekker? is it use the same process?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.660
Nope it's different. The Kue Lekker more like Crepes.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.140
Now we add one ladle more or less . 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.500
I hope it will be like in the street vendor. I have studied from the master. We'll see.

00:02:22.687 --> 00:02:24.687
Have you try it before? 

00:02:24.687 --> 00:02:25.907
yes, I've tried 3 times.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.620
People said it like Kue Bolu lah.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.180
It's bubbling. Now we add sugar.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.907
It's depends to you

00:02:33.907 --> 00:02:37.860
If you like it sweet just add more. If you not really like sweet don't use any sugar at all.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:45.780
After you added the sugar, cover the pan and left it until the surface is turns a bit dry but still wet. 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.645
Then add the rest of the toppings.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.820
The Martabak is done. Turn off stove.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.340
Now it's dry.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.640
Scoop it and spread the room butter there. 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.240
This is the special type right? If you buy it in the street vendor it quiet expensive.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.560
yeah it's quiet expensive.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.760
Now sprinkle the chocolate. 

00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:23.041
Almond or sunflower seed?

00:03:23.041 --> 00:03:24.884
Almond.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.680
It's better than the Martabak ***bleron right?

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.220
Yeah you better make it your own.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.994
Cheese?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.460
This one we answering our viewer request right?

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.480
Yeah

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.160
This recipe is the most highly requested. But I forget who's requesting it. 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.520
want some milk?

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.020
Sure

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.500
If you want sunflower seed just add it. 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.700
Now cut just like martabak seller. 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.320

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.240

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.814
