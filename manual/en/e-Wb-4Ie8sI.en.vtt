00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.110
Somewhere over 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.240
the rainbow, 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.830
way up high

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.590
There's a 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.139
land that I've 

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:27.269
heard of once 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.410
in a lullaby.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.290
Somewhere 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.930
over 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.289
the rainbow

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.640
Skies are 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:44.719
blue

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.000
and the dream

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.719
that you dare

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.359
to dream

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.719
really do 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.149
come true.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.120
Someday I'll wish upon a star

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.469
And wake up where the clouds are far

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.590
behind me.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.440
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.010
oh way above the chimney tops,

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.010
That's where you'll find me.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.080
Somewhere over the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.830
rainbow,

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.950
blue birds fly

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.870
Birds fly 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.870
over the rainbow, Why then, oh why can't I?

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.240
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.120
Why, oh why can't I?

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.580
[APPLAUSE, WHISTLES]
