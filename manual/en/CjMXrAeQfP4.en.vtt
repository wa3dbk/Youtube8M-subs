I’m here with Andreas from Armada, he’s
got a pretty sweet looking ski here, tell

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:15.469
me more about it, what is it?

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.120
Yeah, this is the JJ. We came out with this
sort of concept with this rocker about 4 seasons

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.390
ago, we use a wood core. This L shoe technology
where basically we just raise the rocker put

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.180
it on that. We took it to market 4 years ago
everyone looked at it and thought it was a

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.829
crazy design. The benefits of that is you
get a really short of short ski basically

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.230
on the snow contact points here. But then
you get a really nice float in the crud and

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.289
the powder. So its just something that is
really versatile if you want to take one ski

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.350
with you that can both do piste and powder.
You’ve got something here that can just

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.929
do everything and it just rips on the piste.
Short turn radius you can get something like

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:56.539
14.8 metres turns on the piste but then you
just hone it through all the powder. It’s

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.280
a sweet ski. So we use a wood core in this
ski and we do something really interesting

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.470
as well, we route out the wood core here with
a router and we stick ABS side wall down here

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.050
so its gets really good sort of contact and
makes it really smooth underfoot. So it’s

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.290
a really sweet ski on the piste as well.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.050
Thanks for that.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.550
No worries

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.000
I’ll go give it a shred.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.730
The Armada AKJJ it’s designed as a big mountain
ski with piste capabilities and it performs.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.340
Fanging around on the piste at the end of
a run it really holds an edge, watch out on

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.700
the ice, but where it really performs is off-piste
the tips get it up and floating and the tails

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.060
just keep kicking back. Loads of fun.
