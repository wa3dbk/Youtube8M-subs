00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:07.080
Ok. Once you have that part done, we want
to go ahead and take out all the pins. And,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.610
then we're going to make sure that it came
out. Before we do that, it's a good idea to

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.889
trim your corners just a little bit. Because,
the corners will fill out a little better

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.711
then. Generally, I don't worry about the other
parts usually do just fine. And, you want

00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:30.039
to turn it inside out. And, make sure all
your straps are where they're supposed to

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:37.140
be. Make sure they're not caught in anything
else. And, then we are going to iron it after

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.469
I make sure I pull all the edges out as far
as you can get them. Just kind of work them

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:50.170
in between your fingers. Pull them out. You
can use your straps to kind of you pull it

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:58.940
out. So, it's there right in there. And, go
ahead and take an iron to it. And, the iron

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.500
makes it so much easier to get a nice clean
edge on it. If you try to sew it without ironing

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.520
it, you're usually going to have problems
with bunching and what not. Now on the bottom

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.840
of this, this is the time that you could put
something. If you wanted some lace or some

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.500
kind of decorative anything to hang down at
the bottom. This would be the time to put

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:30.210
it in there. Because, we left the bottom wide
open. My kids kind of like that rougher edge.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.270
So, I'm actually going to leave this edge
out and trim the bottoms. And, I'll do a stitch

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.030
here to secure it. But, I'm not going to finish
off the edges. Because, they kind of like

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.700
the raw edges. A little fun. Makes it look
a little more homemade. If you do want to

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:56.240
finish off the edge, all yo do is take both
sides tuck them in get them nice and even.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.041
And, then you iron this part flat. And, when
we stitch around the edges you would just

00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:06.970
stitch that to. I would suggest pinning it
to make sure all the sides stay even. Like

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.200
I said, we decided we want to leave this one
raw on the end. So, I'm just going to leave

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.800
it like that.
