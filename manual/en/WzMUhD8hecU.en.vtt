00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.640
Hi, in this section we're going to demonstrate
a few techniques that can be used for treating

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.720
back pain with acupuncture. So the first thing
I want to do is swab some points, and this

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.580
will just be a little cold on the skin. And
Johnny here has been kind enough to volunteer

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:22.580
to act as a model for us. And now that we've
swabbed the points, we can go ahead and get

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.332
our single-use needles to perform a little
bit of acupuncture. So some of the points

00:00:26.332 --> 00:00:30.300
are locally, 'cause he's actually got a lot
of muscle spasms in his back, and if you or

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.079
them were going to work more on the meridians
and the lines of energy that the acupuncture

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.950
needles work so well with. And we're using
the filiform needles, and we're just going

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:49.239
to paper and find a good spot, and tap that
in, and just do a little bit of stimulation,

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.640
and he can give us some feedback if he gets
any sensation other than that first initial

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:07.990
tap, he'll let us know. Good. So those are
local area points that we're doing. These

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.190
points also have some great effects on the
various organs as well, and the Chinese energetic

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.760
organs are little bit different from the real
organs. So with this, we're not only helping

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.799
him with some pain and spasm, but we're actually
going to help his Chinese energetic liver,

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.280
which will help his stress. Which sitting
in front of this camera for him is probably

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:36.860
slightly stressful.
This point, we call it DU-14, is actually

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.180
excellent for releasing some heat, which,
'cause I did do a little bit of intake with

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.640
him beforehand, to see, kind of diagnostically
what kinds of issues I might needed to work

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.159
with for him. So once we get these needles
inserted, we're going to let him rest quietly

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.420
here for about twenty minutes to let them
get the energy moving and help with the stagnation

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.110
that's creating some of his pain. All right.
We're going to go ahead and let you relax

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.810
comfortably there for a while, enjoy your
acupuncture.
