00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.770
Creating a boundary between
your lawn and garden beds

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.880
can really improve the
look of your garden.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.240
Making a garden border
is easy, and there's

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.730
a range of different kinds
available, from wooden

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.290
to pre-cast concrete.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.950
There are heaps of different
styles of pre-cast concrete

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.630
edging you can use to
make a nice clean edge

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.520
between your lawn
and your garden.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.411
We're using this
flat style here.

00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:28.660
I'm going to show you how
to install a concrete mowing

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.930
strip, which is going to
give us a nice defined edge

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.930
to our garden.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:32.430
OK.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.760
To do that, I'm just going
to lay my concrete edge

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.150
down there.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.550
That's about the line
I want it, so let's say

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.700
I'm measuring 600 mil
parallel off our back fence.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.200
OK.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.200
So what I'm going to
use is just an off-cut

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.920
of some reinforcing rod.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.890
You could use a peg of
anything if you like.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.740
Let's just tap that on one end.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.490
We're going to do the
same down the other.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.470
Now my section is slightly
sloping from here going down

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.070
that way.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.240
And it's a little bit
wibbly-wobbly in between.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.190
So what I want to do is put
a string line on from point A

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.161
to B. And I'm going to measure
100 mil off the ground.

00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:09.660
OK.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.540
So let's just adjust that
string line so we're 100 mil.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.180
And we'll come back
to our other end.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.270
OK.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.110
Now this 100 mil,
I'm going to use

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.000
this as my point of
reference or my datum

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.350
throughout the whole job.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.770
Now, my concrete
easing is 50 mil thick.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.590
I'm also going to have 50 mil
of concrete underneath that.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.650
Now, that's going to be bedded
in 10 mil into that concrete.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.270
And I'm also going to have 20
mil of base course underneath.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.290
So all up, I need to dig a
trench that's 110 mil deep.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.250
Now, these little
100-mil trenching shovels

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.440
are absolutely perfect for
this sort of situation.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.720
Let's just check out our hole.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.300
We need a 110 mil
deep for our trench.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.430
And we've got 100 mil
sticking off to our datum,

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.940
so that's 210 mil all
up we're looking for.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.860
Now, that's looking
pretty good, so I'll just

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.900
go along and finish that off.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.400
OK.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.025
The next thing we're
going to do is put

00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:09.240
in our 20 mil of base course.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.086
To do that, I'm just
using some scoria.

00:02:12.086 --> 00:02:13.210
And we'll just tip that in.

00:02:16.932 --> 00:02:18.390
And let's just give
it a stomp-down

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.750
so it's nice and solid,
using a sledge hammer.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.070
I'm going to finish that off.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.361
Then, we're ready for concrete.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.380
We're after 140
mil from our line

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.160
to the top of our
concrete, so we're not

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.447
looking too bad there now.

00:02:47.447 --> 00:02:49.280
Now, I've just made up
a little wooden float

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.129
out of an old bit of
4 by 2, so I'm just

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.420
going to use that just to
smooth this out a little bit.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.550
OK.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.220
So I'm just going to smooth
off the rest of this concrete.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.610
And then, we're ready to
install our concrete edging.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.080
So yes, you want to work
relatively quickly here.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.860
On a day like this,
it's quite overcast

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.140
and the concrete is not
going to go off too quick.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.410
But still, you've got
to be relatively quick.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.560
So I'm just bedding that in
the concrete about 10 mil down.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.380
Let's just double-check
off our line.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.900
We're after 100 mil, so
that's looking pretty good.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.240
So the whole time, I'm
just keeping an eye exactly

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.520
on that string line, just to
keep my pavers in line there,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.000
and just measuring the front
and back of every paver,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.160
just to ensure that
we're right on track.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.790
So the idea is not to put too
much concrete in your trench.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.790
We don't want the concrete
coming all the way up

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.680
to the top of the
paver, because we

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.960
want to push the grass
up to the edge of it

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.760
to give us a nice crisp line.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.650
That can come up a tad.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.560
So we just come up
to our last paver.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.170
Now I'm going to cut this
paver to length, because I want

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.800
this paver to finish in line
with our Mackey sleepers here,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.380
so I'm just going to run a
line down off our sleepers

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.829
and put a pencil
mark on our paver.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.250
So now I'm going to take
that away and cut it.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.860
I'm using an angle grinder
with a diamond blade on it.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.820
But you can also
use a masonry blade.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.110
Let's just double-check that
we're sitting on a hundee

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.310
and make sure nice and
straight on our line.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.270
That's looking good.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.769
OK.

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:45.970
So we've just got our
last place to cut.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.230
Going to measure that up and cut
it the same as this one, 375.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.010
Cool.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.370
Everything's looking fantastic.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.430
I'm just going to do one
more check, just to make

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.230
sure nothing's been knocked.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.210
We want these all
nice and straight,

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.930
and also exactly 100
mil off our line.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.980
So now, this is only
a small stretch.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.860
This is only about three
or four meters long.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.590
So if you're doing
any longer than this

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.006
and it's a really,
really hot day,

00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:23.170
I would suggest maybe only doing
maybe about four or five pavers

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.944
at a time.

00:05:23.944 --> 00:05:25.360
Especially if it
is a hot day, you

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.980
don't want that
concrete going off.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.730
Once the concrete sets, we'll
be ready for our next step.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.230
OK.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.830
I've just mixed up some
mortar, and I'm just

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.900
wedging it in there quite nicely
with a sort of pointing trowel.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.520
The idea with
mixing this up, you

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.810
want it relatively runny
to get it in between,

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.890
and just squeeze it off.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:45.900
Take off the excess.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.970
So I've let this dry
for about 10 minutes.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.999
And we're just taken
off the excess.

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:56.290
Don't want to take off too
much of the mortar in there.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.050
And that's the desired
effect I'm after.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.300
Now just give all the
edging a good old clean-up

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.649
as you go, because this
mortar can stain them

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:06.190
and then it'll stay
on there forever,

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.620
so you want to pick it up
while it's relatively wet.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.170
Right.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.700
All done.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.520
Now we have a great looking,
low-maintenance concrete

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.070
border.
