Hi, I'm Ann Myrick, and today, I'm going to
show you how to clean a stove top, with natural

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:21.269
products. I was just cleaning that pan. What
we want to do is, I'm going to be using baking

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:28.680
soda today. Baking soda is a great natural
product to use, so what I'm going to do, is

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:39.940
first sprinkle this on top, of the enamel
stove, and I'm just going to make some circular

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.149
motions, and while I do that, and I'm going
to let that set for a minute. I'm going to

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:52.699
come back over. Now, I put a little bit harsher
powder on the drip pan, because there was

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:01.280
a lot of burns, and a lot of drips, so I'm
soaking some of the pans, and then I'm going

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:11.290
to take each pan out, and just really put
elbow grease to it, and then with fresh clean

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:23.130
water, before I come back with the sponge,
any around my rims, where there might be some

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.050
grease, I can use my toothbrush. Toothbrushes
are great, because they get in all those little

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:43.110
nooks and crannies, and then with clean water,
rinse your cup, and just go all around the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.790
stove area, and then once you're happy with
the way your drip pans look, you can put them

00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:00.660
back into the holes, so with the baking soda,
after you sprinkle it on, and let it set,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:10.590
you just rinse it off with the sponge, and
that is how you clean a stove, without harsh

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.930
chemicals. This is Ann Myrick. Thanks.
