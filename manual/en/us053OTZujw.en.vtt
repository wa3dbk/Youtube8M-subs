00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.710
So I just played some metal and I'm going
to talk about distortion now.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.290
I went straight to metal because there is
no metal without distortion.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.800
But I wanted to talk about distortion and
exactly how to use it to get a sound that

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.930
ranges anywhere from classic rock to heavy
metal.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.480
What I have here is I have two very different
kinds of distortion pedals.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.320
The one I was just playing through is the
Metal Zone pedal.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.320
It's made by Boss.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.160
They used to make a pedal called the Heavy
Metal Pedal back in the '80's and I don't

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.860
know if they make it anymore, but this one
is the closest thing that I could find to

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.370
that pedal that they still make.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.940
You have some very basic settings on here.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.510
Same as all the other Boss pedals or overdrive
pedals that we were talking about before,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.900
you have an overall effect level.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.810
All the way on the right we have the distortion,
which is the amount of distortion, minimum

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.190
to maximum, and the EQ settings are in the
middle, different frequencies.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.610
The gray area about overdrive versus distortion
is that really to me, the simplest way to

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.810
describe it is whereas overdrive is trying
to achieve the sound of a cranked amp.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:22.290
And it works with the clean, transparent sound
of your guitar signal to sometimes color it,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.350
but mostly it's trying to emulate the sound
of the pre-amp tubes or power tubes in your

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.350
amp naturally distorting.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.719
It's an organic, natural way that amps used
to work to achieve the first early distortion

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.219
in the '50's and '60's.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:43.090
What distortion is is when you finally cross
the line of where the gain is colored or intense

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.420
enough it becomes distortion.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.799
The total sound and saturation and compression
and the distortion sound that is coming from

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.569
the box itself and not the amp.

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.820
That to me is where overdrive crosses the
line to distortion zone, where you're really

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.529
just coloring the sound so much and getting
it so saturated that at the lowest volume

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:08.860
you can sound like Metallica or Slayer or
any of your favorite bands, even as intense

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.039
as some of the Def Metal bands out there.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.510
Where it's just a really, really heavy saturated
distortion.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.970
So the second pedal I have here is this Zvex
Box of Rock.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.030
It is a distortion pedal.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.320
What's great about it is it has a boost feature
built-in, so when you take a solo or if you

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.390
want to boost the signal, it has a separate
button for boost.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.890
It also has a boost knob, which can boost
pretty substantially the level.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.080
These are two very different distortions,
the Metal Zone by Boss and the Box of Rock

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.220
by Zvex.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.990
It gives you a wide range of different kinds
of distortion.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:50.480
This Box of Rock is a little bit more of a
natural distortion sound.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:03:00.630
It's a very warm sound.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.230
It's a very natural sound, but it definitely
is coloring the tone.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.430
This is without it... so the amp is completely
clean.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.570
So all of the distortion is coming from the
pedal itself.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.981
You have a drive setting here, volume and
tone, and then the boost.

00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:22.160
Boost again, is pretty substantial.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.650
And one thing I really like about this pedal
is that it breaks up and starts to sound almost

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.770
like the speaker's failing.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.570
The Zvex pedal's are pretty crazy in the sense
that they go to extremes and this is definitely

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.780
no exception.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.800
You can really go crazy with this pedal, and
really get it to sound like the amp is trashed,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.980
and some people really like that effect.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.260
You can do some really cool things with it.
