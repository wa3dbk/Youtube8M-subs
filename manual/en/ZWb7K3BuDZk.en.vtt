Hi my name is Shotsie Gorman. I'm here as
a tattoo artist, a professional tattoo artist

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:11.630
for expert village. What we've done now is
cleaned up the area completely. Make sure

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:20.890
there is no plasma leaking. I'm using a sterile
stick to put petroleum jelly over the surface

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:28.890
of the tattoo. Then we're going to bandage
it up, keep it elevated for two hours. At

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:38.350
the end of two hours, these are plastic coated
gauze, at the end of two hours he's going

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.560
to take it off and wash it up thoroughly with
soap and water. He can go in the shower or

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:51.579
hand wash it. Then begin to apply ointment
to it at least three times a day. There is

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:58.040
a number of things you can use, Lubriderm,
if you prefer antibacterial, you can use bacatracin,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.679
as long as it doesn't irritate the skin. Really
all we're after at this point in time is to

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:15.029
keep it from making contact with the air for
a few hours giving the body a chance to close

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:35.159
itself off, and stop all the bleeding.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:58.530
Five minutes in the microwave and he's done.
{laughing} Using my 1920s tape dispenser here.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:09.640
Can you move around okay? Yeah! No jumping
jacks but.... how does it feel? Okay, no direct

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.080
sunlight for two weeks. No swimming. No excessive
exercise for the next couple days. No running.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:28.460
You don't want to over do the sweating for
two days. Okay, that won't be a problem. Get

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.019
relaxed, use common sense, and make sure your
hands are clean when you apply the ointment.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:39.880
You don't want to implant anything under the
surface of the skin. So, your hands have to

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.042
be clean or have someone else take care of
it. Make sure that when you put it on, put

00:02:45.042 --> 00:02:50.159
it on very lightly. Massage it into the surface
of the tattoo. Don't' just slick it on the

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:55.209
top. So you want it open to the air as much
as possible without overdoing the ointment.

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.609
And then within a week it will be peeling
and then in 10 days it will be back to its

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.680
original state. Thank you Shotsie. Okay!
