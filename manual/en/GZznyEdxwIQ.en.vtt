00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.520
If World of Tanks updates had names, the name “delicacy” would suit Update 9.8.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.960
It doesn’t contain a lot of new features, but the ones it does bring are excellent.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.680
A new game event, a new way of inviting players to a platoon,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.460
personal reserves and the separation of the game client into two versions.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.980
You’ll learn more from this review.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.280
A new game event, Domination, was introduced.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.020
In this mode, one of the things you need to do is shoot at vehicles.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.620
But that’s the only thing it has in common with the standard battle formats.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.300
The opportunities and ways of achieving victory are unlike anything we’ve had before.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.480
The battles are fought in Tier X tanks.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.740
These tanks are special versions of the T110E5, AMX 50 B, and Object 140.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.320
Their characteristics are similar to those of their researchable equivalents.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.980
But they can be used only in Domination mode.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.000
These tanks will be given to all players.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.800
So, if you were wondering whether or not to research these vehicles,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.580
you will able to try them out before you make a decision.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.460
The battle is fought between two teams

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.880
in a 15 vs 15 or 10 vs 10 format, depending on the map.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.160
The team that scores the most points wins.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.240
Points are given for delivering the flag to a special zone

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.820
and for destroying enemy tanks.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.820
If a team reaches the required score before the end of the battle, the battle ends.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.820
This mode has a unique playstyle

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.000
because you won’t be afraid to get your vehicle destroyed.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.500
After a few seconds, you’ll be able to respawn in the same battle and take revenge.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.620
We’ve implemented the ability to respawn multiple times

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.620
during the battle in Domination mode.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.880
These are the so-called “Garage battles.”

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.900
A menu shows up after your tank’s been destroyed.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.020
You’ll have 10 seconds to choose a new tank.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.300
The specific vehicle that was just destroyed will be unavailable for 30 seconds.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.140
The tank appears on the battlefield with full HP, ammunition and consumables.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.040
The setup of consumables is the player’s choice.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.720
You can select what you need in your Garage before the battle as usual.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.820
The number of respawns is unlimited.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.700
There are several vehicle repair points and resupply points.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.220
They add to the intrigue of the battle.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.140
A heavily damaged tank can suddenly rise from the ashes like a phoenix!

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.540
All you need to do is to roll inside a yellow circle,

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.420
indicated on the minimap by a special icon, and wait for 5 seconds.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.620
Just remember to avoid damage and not roll out of the circle during this time.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.720
A minute has to pass before a player is able to use the same point again.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.660
Several tanks can be repaired in one repair point at the same time,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.080
even if there are both enemy and allied vehicles.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.760
The number of vehicles is limited only by the capacity of the circle.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.340
The Domination event comes out soon. Check for updates.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.140
Coming next:

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.040
Separation of the client into HD and SD versions. Who needs which quality?

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.400
Personal reserves. Now everyone can get what clans have.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.220
Dynamic platoons. Together we will win!

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.320
Besides some significant changes, Update 9.8 brings a lot of smaller ones.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.840
Battle Performance Badges,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.980
which mark the effective actions of a player during the battle,

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.980
were added to the game.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.700
Many Personal Missions were corrected and updated.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.920
The range for all small-caliber automatic guns and machine guns was increased to 400 meters.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.460
Many vehicles were rebalanced.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.860
For example, the dispersion of the IS-7’s gun on the move and its aim time were reduced.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.600
The dispersion and aim time of the Conqueror Gun Carriage SPG were increased.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.600
You will find more details in the Update patch notes.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.860
Battles for Strongholds of Levels 5 to 7 in Tier VIII vehicles are now available.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.880
The Komarin map was removed from Random Battles.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.740
Many vehicles were reworked to HD quality.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.820
An opportunity to choose between HD

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.640
and SD game clients was added to the client installer and the launcher.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.500
The HD version contains textures of a higher quality but is a much larger file.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.780
So, if your PC specs don’t allow you to play with the highest settings,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.840
it will be better to choose the more compact SD version.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.400
Now we come to Dynamic Platoons. What are they and how will they change the game?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.820
Also, we’ll tell you about Personal Reserves.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.480
All players will now be able to receive more Experience.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.080
So, Dynamic Platoons.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.080
In general, this is the same squad of two or three players, but it is formed differently.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.680
Imagine that you’re fighting a battle. Only two allies are left.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.600
Superior enemy forces are coming. In most situations, this means a defeat.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.520
But now you’ll be able to unite your efforts together in a platoon,

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.760
start communicating with voice chat, coordinate your actions,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.160
and crush the more numerous but disorganized enemy forces.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.940
Of course, it’s not necessary to wait for such critical situations.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.760
You can platoon up with other players right away.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.080
This is especially effective if you fight on one particular flank

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.040
or play one vehicle type, for example, SPG or light tanks.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.180
The opportunity becomes available when the countdown starts.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.500
You just need to click on the player’s nickname and invite him or her to the platoon.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.920
Players can either accept or decline invitations.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.560
The platoon is not dismissed after the battle.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.100
So, if you feel you have found true brothers in arms, you can continue playing together.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.560
Let’s proceed to Personal Reserves.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.160
Basically, they are consumables

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.680
If you activate them, you will receive more experience

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.560
or free experience per battle.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.960
In fact, Personal Reserves are very similar to the Reserves

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.920
that clans prepare in their Strongholds…

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.180
except that these Reserves are personal.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.380
To receive Personal Reserves, you need to complete special missions in Random Battles.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.800
It’s important to remember that each Reserve has an expiration date,

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.260
which is noted in the description.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.500
You can activate Personal Reserves from the menu in the Garage.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.940
That’s all for now. Good luck on the battlefield!
