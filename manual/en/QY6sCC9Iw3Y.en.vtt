Hi I'm Grady Johnson and I'm a professional
painter and today I'm representing expertvillage.com.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.520
Okay now we are pressure washing the wall.
When you pressure wash a wall just like the

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.730
eaves you want to work with gravity start
on top of the wall and bring it all down.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.630
Now what we are doing primarily is taking
off the dirt and grime and the chalking. Chalking

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.800
is what happens to paint when it is hit with
sunlight for a long period of time. It is

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.250
sort of a white substance you may have seen
if you ever leaned on a wall. So start working

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:47.460
on top of the wall this is all pretty tight.
Once we got down below the eaves you would

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.829
see where the sunlight hits it, it is really
starting to peel. Now we are going to work

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.710
that off of there by working the water stream
like a chisel that would chisel out all of

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:16.259
those loose flakes. Now that is how we remove
the loose chips on the wall. The rest of the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.310
wall has to be done to because we want to
get the dirt and most importantly the sun

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.439
makes that white chalk. That is that white
filth you get on the wall when you put your

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.380
hand on it. Pressure washing takes all of
that off now you will want to find a way to

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.799
square that off. What that means it is going
to peel up and when you get to a strong part

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.899
you will keep going if you work it to much
you want to even that out and finish it out

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.740
with a scraper. By the end you will seal it
all down. I'm going to go ahead and pressure

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.640
wash this wall and get it ready for painting
but these are the basic tips you need to remember

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.130
when you are pressure washing a wall.
