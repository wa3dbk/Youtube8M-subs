Hi! I want to show you my gear shifter
that I made myself for driving in

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.860
European Truck Simulator 2

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.170
I've wanted a gear shifter for some time
and one day I stumbled upon a video made

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.270
by a guy who built a gear shifter for
himself. So I watched the video, thought

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.849
about it and decided I will i'll try to
build one for myself. And this is what I

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:38.340
came up with. Here I move the leaver
through the gears. It has eight gears.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:52.110
Well, actually seven gears plus a reverse
gear. Here we can see how high the gear

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.520
shifter is. It's a little above my knee
and I'm about 1 meter 90, so you have

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.520
a little bit of perspective.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.170
Here and move the lever through the
gears from another perspective, so you

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.730
have another shot of it. I built it myself
and my wife helped me with the leather

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.850
part, the leather cover and as you can
see here

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.969
And probably now I must show you
the important part: the inside of it.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.030
Well I used some metal fittings and wood
blocks to build the only the core of the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.660
gear shifter that holds the liver as
well. There are some springs for

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.390
resistance and actually have added this
some more springs on the other side to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.580
increase the centering force. I used some
micro switches to initiate the gears and

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.880
in the back there's a USB interface
board that I used to connect it all the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.209
computer. The board itself simulates a
joystick or a keyboard and I can simulate

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.489
some button presses from a joystick that
gives the signal to the game that the

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.170
gear must be changed.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.200
There's also a link to the interface
board in the description below if you're

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.540
interested in the system. And here's
another shot of the gear knob. It sits

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.550
comfortably in my palm. I use an
aftermarket gear knob that bought on

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.550
eBay.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.049
And here's another comparison shot to
show the height of the gear shifter.

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.719
You see it's a little bit above my
office chair and here's me again in the

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:04.799
background for comparison. As I said it's
a little bit above my need and it's

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.000
quite comfortable to reach when I'm
sitting in my chair and driving in European

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.489
truck. And here's some shots from your
eurotruck simulator with me driving and the

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.489
gear shifter on the right side.

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:51.229
Alright that will be all. Thank you for
watching. I hope you enjoyed it, give it a

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.520
like and bye.
