00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.280
One of the first steps you'll have to do in
any woodworking project is squaring out and

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.330
milling the rough lumber.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.420
All of our woodworking machines rely on straight,
square edges to do accurate work; The table

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.090
saw, chop saw, band saw, any of the tools,
the router; need straight, flat edges and

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.439
square faces to do their work properly.

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.200
So, milling up the lumber is always the first
step.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.310
Now, there's a procedure for milling wood
that's a simple one to follow, and it has

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.670
an acronym called FEE, which stands for Faces,
Edges, and Ends.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.880
What that means is that your always starting
with the faces first, the faces the wide part

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.510
of the board and you're flattening the face,
and then the edges refers to the edge here.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.559
You're squaring up the edge to the newly flattened
faces, and then the ends refer to the ends

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.149
of the boards that your then cutting off in
a cross-cut square to the edges that you just

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.440
now made square to the faces.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.840
So, it's the sequential process where your
squaring up and flattening the wood in a way

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.250
that leads to it perfectly square, flat board.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.730
Usually the first step in this process with
the faces is to hop onto the jointer, and

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.090
flatten your face.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.440
If you've got one flat face already, reasonably
flat and you can check in on our jointer table

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.250
if your pieces are small like this.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.500
If the pieces are sitting flat already, like
this one, there's no need to actually even

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.890
use the jointer, you can jump right into the
planer.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.590
But, most of the time there's some little
cupping or bowing that you need to take care

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.560
of on the jointer, so let's do that first.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.700
In my scenario we're working with two pieces
of wood that are going to end up being the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.310
same, we don't need them to be the same thickness,
and they're going to be a little table top.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.860
And so, whenever you do milling you always
do your work in a batch, meaning, whatever

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.640
I do to this piece I'm going to do to this
piece piece as well, before I change any of

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.890
the settings on the machines; and that goes
for jointer, the planter, and the table saw.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.490
You always work in a batch like this.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.090
Okay, so let's look at the jointer first,
let's say we had to flatten these faces.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.549
First step, let's get the jointer to the proper
widths to accommodate out stock, open this

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.960
fence up a little bit so we've got enough
room.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.159
Lock it in place, you want to check again
to see the depth that your cutting, so you

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.180
can use a little engineer square to check
that.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.730
See the height difference in the tables, looks
good to me we're not going to take a very

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.260
aggressive cut.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.790
And then we're ready to go.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.700
The last thing you want to look at and consider
when your using these machines, the jointer

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.280
and plane are especially is wood grain direction.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.280
Okay?

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.010
The grain direction of the wood actually has
a big impact on how the machines perform and

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.129
how smooth of a cut you're going to get.

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.970
Let's look at this wood for example here,
if you can see the grain of the wood in the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.150
side, we'll follow one of these with my pencil.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.950
You can see it's going up hill from right
to left.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.379
what that means is that the wood fiber is
in this piece of wood are actually sticking

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.079
out with this pencil out of the wood.

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:21.090
So, in a machine like this if we were to pass
this over top these blades, which are spinning

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:30.110
at me, if the wood is sticking out like this,
the blade is going catch the fibers of the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.650
wood and tear them out.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.709
So, one of the things that you always want
to do is make sure your wood is orientated

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.120
so that doesn't happen, if we spin this around
that means now the fibers are facing this

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.019
way.

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.019
That means now when the blade comes around
it's just going to push the fiber back down.

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.510
So it's going to be a much smoother cut, we're
not going get any tear-out.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.719
Okay, we're ready for our first face flattening.

00:03:51.719 --> 00:04:06.319
We're ready to go, I'm just going be passing
this over the blade.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:17.590
Alright, that's one.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.790
You want to check and make sure what you got
actually did get flattened.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.949
Let's put it on, the table.

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.590
Yes, looks, looks good nice and flat.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.970
So put that one aside.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.340
And then you would do this same thing for
your next piece.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.330
Run it through and flatten it as well.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.479
Once you have the flat faces done, you can
bring it over to the planer for the next step.
