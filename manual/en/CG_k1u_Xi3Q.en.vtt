00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.280
hi this is Joe Bruzek with cars.com
today we're taking a look at the 2008

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.420
chevrolet corvette we're gonna look at
some of the features on the Corvette as

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.420
well as what's new for 2008

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.980
under the hood there's some borrow power
from the corvette zo6 the high

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.640
performance version this there's new
cylinder heads as well as new fuel

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.090
injectors 9 from 206 that helps push out
an extra 30 horsepower from the base bet

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.670
there's also some extra displacement 6.2
leaders instead of six point out and

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.690
result 430 horsepower one of the
enjoyable features about the corvette

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.699
coupe is this removable center top I
comes off and it stores in the back but

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.960
it gives the feeling that you're driving
a convertible and just like convertible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.720
you also get the feeling of sunburn when
you have it off and you're driving

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.210
around all day the top removes with two
switches up front and one in the back

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.229
and it's light enough to where I could
take it off and put it in the back by

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.060
myself

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.850
the seats are probably some of the
comfiest that you'll find a sports car

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.930
at home

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.500
that combined with the smooth Highway
ride make this an excellent highway

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.470
cruiser 60 70 miles an hour now where we
can't find fault is where it's been

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.330
documented many times before including
bios's the interior some of the buttons

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.539
are flimsy and i'm not a big fan of the
painted interior but the two-tone does

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.690
pretty good

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.820
one of the features that confused many
first-time riders in this car including

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.400
myself are the door handles or the lack
of door handles others just a button on

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.620
the inside of this that pops the door
open and there's no pole handle there's

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.270
also push buttons on the inside where
you just push the button and the door

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:12.840
THX open new for 2008 two-mode exhaust
now basically this has little actuators

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.520
that will open up under heavy throttle
and I really changed the exhaustion and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.320
also helps flow and with this optional
exhaust system which is a twelve hundred

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.690
dollars to get an extra six horsepower
and for pound-feet of torque and its

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.690
really noticeable when the exhaust opens
up

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.600
chevrolet is kind of unintentionally
created the first easy-bake oven that

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.360
comes as standard equipment the center
counsel is a right on top of the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.400
transmission hoping it gets really hot

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.959
cell phones change anything you put in
there is warm to the touch after you

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.650
take it out don't put any chocolate

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.709
having driven the Corvette around a
racetrack i can say that it is racetrack

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.550
ready but it's also an excellent daily
driver really fun to drive

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.650
there's lots of power and it's usable
there's you know it easy clutch take up

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.350
and the steering is light so even the
event is capable of very illegal speeds

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.730
and very quickly

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:25.010
it's still an entirely capable daily
driver for additional information on
