Hi, I'm Bobby [krispy]

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.249
This guitar lesson is about how to play some [of] the themes from the movie Lord of the rings

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.889
So I'll play each riff then I'll show how they're played note for note using [the] tabs

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.519
Ok so there's three riffs [altogether]. I'll play each one, [and] I'll show how they're played note for note using the tabs

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.220
So here's the opening team

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.809
Okay, let's play like this first string. [sorry] the first string some friend

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.240
Okay, the next theme like this

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.170
Okay, split like this

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.200
It repeats

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.760
[oh]

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.659
It's a little different at the end second time good

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.640
[Hmm]

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.770
okay, the last theme is the concern how its

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.389
Let's put it like this

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.750
that's

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:14.249
Okay, so those the three main things of Florida rings

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:18.898
okay, I hope this lesson has been helpful and

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:25.888
A lot of people don't know this, but I was in or the rings the movie. I was [actually] in the movie and

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.588
Here's a picture. Here's the photographic evidence
