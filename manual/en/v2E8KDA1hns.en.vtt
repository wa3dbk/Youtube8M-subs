00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:23.619
Age of Empires II is one of those magical
classics. Nostalgia may affect that feeling,

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.400
at least for me, but it�s even more magical
that I love Age of Empires II as much as I

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.980
do considering I�m not crazy about RTS games.
That being said, I never thought the campaign

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.110
was its strong suit; I remember spending a
whole lot more time, late at night, playing

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.440
multiplayer or scenarios of my own creation.
Age of Empires III still allows that free-will

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.140
action, but it�s got a surprisingly solid
campaign to complete the package. I don�t

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.769
wanna say it�s better than II, but, like...it
is better�

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:02.380
Honestly, it�s hard to admit that. As I
said, I loved playing Age of Empires II scenarios

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.350
and multiplayer indefinitely. But that was
then, and while I still enjoy multiplayer,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.521
I find I�m more of a �finish the campaign
and rest on my laurels� kind of guy. I like

00:01:12.521 --> 00:01:16.640
to just finish the prescribed content, and
Age of Empires III provides a fun campaign

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.829
that actually has an interesting story. This
story follows early American discovery up

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.250
to the mid-1800s, all viewed from the perspective
of the Black family. Descendant stories are

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.450
cool, but it also takes the �behind the
scenes history� approach popularized most

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.030
recently by the Assassin�s Creed games,
and mostly follows political actions as influenced

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.590
by the tales of the Fountain of Youth. The
game even pulls off a cool, cliffhanger-ish

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.810
ending, and I wasn�t expecting to get into
the story as much as I did. Of course, I enjoyed

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:52.759
the gameplay even more.
Age of Empires III offers the same kind of

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.710
resource-hoarding, unit-building action as
its competitors and predecessors, but obviously

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.420
with a few differences and improvements. Most
notably, the game features an XP system which

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.649
factors into the Home City rewards; with the
XP points you gain from completing various

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.420
objectives, you can have baskets of food,
additional military units, and various other

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.480
upgrades and bonuses shipped to your colony.
And you can of course improve everything the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.260
colony has to offer as you accrue enough resources
to move onto the next age, each leap requiring

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.250
more and more resources. As such, there�s
a great balance between managing basic settlers

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.640
and their gathering tasks, building as necessary,
training units, and waging war. The menus

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.970
that operate all these tasks can initially
be a little overwhelming, but Age of Empires

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.920
III does a relatively great job at not letting
it be too overwhelming from the get-go. Once

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.860
you understand them all, these systems are
obviously fun in self-created scenarios or

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:53.580
multiplayer, but the campaign takes it to
another, not necessarily higher, level.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.770
You see, everything in the campaign is dynamic.
By dynamic, I mean PR speak for scripted and

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.770
a little bit above the everyday actions you
see in the other modes. Most missions follow

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.560
a set pattern: different types of defending
and sieging pop up often, but there are also

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.452
these�travelling missions, for lack of a
better term. These missions don�t allow

00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:15.100
the creation of
new units, resource gathering, or anything

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.240
else you would typically do in a strategy
game. So you would think these missions are

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.220
the weakest part of a strategy game, but I
was pleasantly surprised by them. They�re

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.390
a nice change of pace from the hectic management
present in most of the game, and offer their

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.540
own ways of garnering rewards and improvements.
Ultimately, they just end up being a ton of

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.400
fun while also being smart diversions, and
they don�t pop up too much that they ruin

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.850
the expected gameplay or grow tired. And they
also represent my favorite part of the typical

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.840
missions: exploring. Most maps are cloaked
in darkness at the onset, and only sending

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.220
units into the void reveals the map, and any
and all enemies, potential allies, and treasures

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.790
to be found. And once again, that balance
comes into play.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:02.340
Having a group of five or six go out of the
relative safety of the town center to scout,

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.040
settlers hunting, chopping, and mining, and
units gathering for the inevitable battle

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.930
is an immensely satisfying feeling. It�s
even more satisfying when you just totally

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.850
crush the enemy after patiently preparing,
and somehow even cooler when you win by the

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.070
skin of your teeth. Ultimately, Age of Empires
III�s calling card is balance, and it nails

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.889
RTS gameplay while not being totally inaccessible.
This is about as good as it gets for RTS fans,

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.120
whether you�re a casual admirer or a hardcore
fan. Just be aware that you haven�t had

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.400
any of the water from the Fountain of Youth,
so you can�t spend all of your time playing.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:41.280
Just late at night, when you�re supposed
to be sleeping.
