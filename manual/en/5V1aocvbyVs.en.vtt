00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:28.146
My name is Magdalena Sustere.

00:00:28.772 --> 00:00:31.127
Who am I?

00:00:31.127 --> 00:00:32.672
I am a cellist.

00:00:32.672 --> 00:00:36.197
I’m playing my instrument already for 12 years.

00:00:36.197 --> 00:00:37.568
And I like it! 

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:43.644
In the 1st grade I started to learn piano.

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:47.310
Afterwards my mom decided to send me to the Music school.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:54.240
We went to the entrance exams when I was 8.

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:59.461
I played my composition what I had learned before

00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:02.833
and then jury told, that I have a good hearing

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:07.209
and maybe I should try to pick up a string instrument.

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:13.356
The only string instrument i knew was violin

00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:16.880
but they offered cello to my mom.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.529
The name of the instrument sounded good for me 

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:22.529
and my mom knew what that was.

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:26.438
She agreed that I would start to play cello.

00:01:26.438 --> 00:01:28.331
Then I had some more tests.

00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:33.810
But this is how I started to play cello not knowing what that was.

00:01:34.456 --> 00:01:41.060
Of course, it is easy to learn to play an instrument „somehow”.

00:01:41.132 --> 00:01:44.210
But to learn to do something really good,

00:01:44.358 --> 00:01:50.210
including cello playing, is really hard.

00:01:50.213 --> 00:01:53.120
You have to work a lot.

00:01:53.123 --> 00:01:55.760
Often You get bored of that and want to leave

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.530
but afterwards understand You want to continue.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.480
That’s the way You can learn to play instrument.

00:02:06.327 --> 00:02:13.710
I practice every day - 4 hours on average.

00:02:13.714 --> 00:02:17.100
Sometimes I play more, sometimes less.

00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:23.000
But it’s important to practice that’s why I do it every day.

00:02:23.051 --> 00:02:30.400
Cello is a big violin or a small contrabass.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.870
Usually people don’t call it like this but I like the way it sounds. 

00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:39.660
Instead of calling it a big violin they call it a guitar.

00:02:39.657 --> 00:02:43.100
People don’t know what’s in the big suitcase.

00:02:43.745 --> 00:02:47.470
Once my cello was called – flute.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.250
It was a young kid who did that. And it still seems funny for me.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.760
Once I went in a shop with my cello and I met a little boy with his mom. 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.840
Every time when he saw me he called really loudly –

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.840
Guitar, Guitar!

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.630
He didn’t see me only once, he saw me about 10 times

00:03:13.634 --> 00:03:16.100
and every time he shouted –

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.860
Guitar, Guitar!

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.600
This is one of my stories which makes my smile.

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.310
When I play I often have the feeling – o, nothing goes right,

00:03:28.306 --> 00:03:30.880
I don’t want to play and practise anymore.

00:03:30.883 --> 00:03:36.800
And sometimes I don’t play for a while

00:03:36.798 --> 00:03:39.900
but afterwards i understand...

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:43.520
I miss it. 

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:48.290
I miss music and cello. And then I take it and start to play.

00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:54.690
What a joy to play cello again!

00:03:55.747 --> 00:04:02.180
I think... I’m sure that God has given music

00:04:05.752 --> 00:04:14.230
and He gives desire to make music, to make something beautiful and to play.

00:04:14.226 --> 00:04:18.950
In my opinion, You can learn something from every musician.

00:04:18.948 --> 00:04:25.330
Even from little children who have just started to play an instrument.

00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:27.540
You can learn from them -

00:04:27.544 --> 00:04:33.740
the way they play, the attitude while playing and for whom they play.

00:04:34.492 --> 00:04:40.310
That’s why it’s hard for me to call one artist,

00:04:40.311 --> 00:04:49.040
one person from whom I have inspired the most.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.180
I try to learn something from every person.

00:04:54.232 --> 00:04:59.700
I have given a lot of concerts this far.

00:04:59.698 --> 00:05:08.410
Recently I had to write down – in how many concerts and with whom I have played. 

00:05:08.406 --> 00:05:16.030
I realised that I have played in a lot of places

00:05:16.033 --> 00:05:19.150
but one of my favorite was

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:28.780
USA music festival in year 2010 –

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.490
Eastern Music Festival for 5 weeks.

00:05:31.978 --> 00:05:37.560
During the festival I had the privilege

00:05:37.565 --> 00:05:42.300
to work with cellist Lynn Harrell in masterclass.

00:05:42.295 --> 00:05:49.800
He is famous and well known in USA but not in Latvia.

00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:54.880
His playing was surprisingly amazing.

00:05:54.877 --> 00:06:02.180
This festival was a professional improvement for me as a musician.

00:06:02.183 --> 00:06:10.490
I’ll continue to study music and will become a professional cellist.

00:06:10.488 --> 00:06:18.300
I’ll study in Southern Illinois University Edwardsville USA.

00:06:18.297 --> 00:06:23.310
My teacher is already waiting me there.

00:06:23.307 --> 00:06:27.150
And in august I’ll start my studies.

00:06:31.151 --> 00:06:35.600
God, Bless Latvia!
