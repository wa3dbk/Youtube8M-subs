00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.150
this excerpt from the public television
program the piano guy is brought to you

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:12.150
by the roland corporation

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:23.429
now i've got a great little riff that Jerry Lee Lewis used as 
as well as a lot of

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.909
other boogie boogie players that just sounds harder than the 
 dickens

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:30.389
and when you play it really fast - it
is but the actual riff itself is pretty

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:37.389
simple so I am going to blindly give this
one away. It sounds like this:

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.950
Scott plays. Now that sounds like something you'd like
to sit down and sit down and play I'm assuming. Those are fun to do. Let

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.500
let me tear it apart
really slowly i'll show you exactly

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.120
what i did. ok were starting on a C chord. 
the three chords that we are going to deal with

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.350
C, F and a G chord. Now here is what

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.720
I am playing

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.610
I started out by

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.230
sliding up to this note. I went

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.450
now i don't want anyone to finger it this way

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.930
i think that's too serious and is too complicated

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.750
 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.550
There is the start of it.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.780
 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.780
now you separate the chord

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.760
that's it

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.590
add that to the beginning slide and it 
sounds like this

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.939
i'll do it again

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.170
Now you can also finger it a different way i have just caught myself doing i'm not sure

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.469
which way i do that i probably switch
back and forth instead of using the same

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.350
two fingers you could do

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.800
it like this

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.800
so probably a good exercise for that is to  
just get your fingers comfortable

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.200
The great news is that the exact same hand
position once you lock your hand in a cast,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.399
you can move it

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.399
in this case in the F  you are going go have to play the Bb instead but it is still the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.779
same

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:18.749
 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:23.479
Here it is in G

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:25.829
The G is exactly like the C one

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.309
so here it is again you really  need to start it by hitting that slide on the way in

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:36.309
That is what makes it sound bluesy

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:46.599
Go G...F...

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.329
now in your left hand I was playing a standard

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.900
 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.540
It is these notes

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.370
you can do that if you want to or you
can just play ...

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.849
when you're starting if you just want to play the roots by itself that's fine too

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.930
Do whatever you can do in your left hand
but the important part of this trick is

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.139
the lick we are playing in our  right-hand
so let me do it at full speed a couple

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.450
times i'll just give you a handle on what it
should sound like

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.209
It goes like this: Scott Plays ...

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.769
you know what,  i just caught myself there
you know what i'm doing

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.739
i guess i'm playing both of those at almost the
same time

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.209
So do it however you want to do it. That is good
testimony i can't even tell you how I finger as

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:38.209
it changes every time. so you go.

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:59.380
Scott Plays. Whatever ...

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.740
so that's a great lick to put in your
bag of tricks that is a really an

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.620
authentic, hamming out

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.579
jerry lee lewis style boggie boogie lick. i hope you put that one uh... in to your

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.870
repertoire and start using
it when you're having fun playing piano

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.209
in the style

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.090
