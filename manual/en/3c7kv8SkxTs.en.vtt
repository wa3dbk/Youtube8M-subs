00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:05.666
- [Voiceover] Tree rings
are rich with history

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.661
and can reveal the exact
age and geographic origin

00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:11.262
of a tree trunk or a piece of wood.

00:00:11.262 --> 00:00:14.211
The scientific analysis
of tree ring patterns

00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:16.533
is known as dendrochronology,

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:20.565
and was used to learn more
about the cabinet's wood.

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:22.802
Only certain types of wood can be analyzed

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:24.497
with dendrochronology.

00:00:24.497 --> 00:00:26.099
In the case of the cabinet,

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.955
the oak interior was most suitable.

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:31.370
But the end grain of these oak panels,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.113
where the tree pattern is
visible, was inaccessible.

00:00:35.113 --> 00:00:37.825
So to examine the hidden tree ring pattern

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:40.588
of the interior, an
innovative method of x-raying

00:00:40.588 --> 00:00:42.306
was devised.

00:00:42.306 --> 00:00:45.928
To begin, parts of the cabinet
were carefully disassembled,

00:00:45.928 --> 00:00:49.434
transferred to the
museum's x-ray laboratory

00:00:49.434 --> 00:00:53.287
and placed on a rotating table.

00:00:53.613 --> 00:00:55.773
For dendrochronology to be effective,

00:00:55.773 --> 00:01:00.063
the rings must be
measured very accurately.

00:01:01.156 --> 00:01:03.756
Once the tree rings
were perfectly aligned,

00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:07.237
the image was recorded on x-ray film.

00:01:08.656 --> 00:01:12.162
The tree rings were measured
from this high resolution image

00:01:12.162 --> 00:01:15.366
and these results, along
with many other samples,

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:18.036
were analyzed by a dendrochronologist,

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:20.010
who compared the tree ring measurements

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.461
to weather patterns in different regions,

00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:24.861
going back in history.

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:28.229
The dendrochronologist
concluded that these oak panels

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.899
came from a tree that grew
in the region of Burgundy,

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.899
in eastern France, and
was cut down in 1574,

00:01:36.153 --> 00:01:39.813
six years before the cabinet was made.

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:46.363
Even the cabinet's smallest details

00:01:46.363 --> 00:01:49.496
had much to reveal about its origins.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.190
The middle drawer is lined
with a silk and linen fabric,

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.881
which is held in place by rose head tacks.

00:01:56.881 --> 00:01:59.784
Scientific analysis could
tell us whether these tacks

00:01:59.784 --> 00:02:03.961
are from the 16th century
or are later reproductions.

00:02:04.172 --> 00:02:07.493
A loose, broken tack
discovered inside the cabinet

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:10.509
was prepared for analysis.

00:02:10.604 --> 00:02:12.415
It was embedded in liquid resin

00:02:12.415 --> 00:02:16.262
that was hardened under blue light.

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:22.281
The embedded tack was
then cut and polished.

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.350
To determine the tack's composition,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.136
it was analyzed using an x-ray technique

00:02:27.136 --> 00:02:31.199
known as X-ray fluorescence or XRF.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:33.312
The XRF instrument creates a spectrum

00:02:33.312 --> 00:02:37.550
with each line representing
a different chemical element.

00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:40.765
The spectrum showed that
the tack was made of brass,

00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:44.810
but also contained significant
traces of other metals.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.706
Such impure brass was
commonplace in the 1500s,

00:02:48.706 --> 00:02:51.915
but not in more recent times.

00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:54.511
Next, to determine how the tack was made

00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:57.927
it was examined under
an optical microscope.

00:02:57.948 --> 00:02:59.735
Getty scientists observed that the tack

00:02:59.735 --> 00:03:02.986
had a very even and
rounded crystal structure,

00:03:02.986 --> 00:03:05.912
which indicated that the
metal was cast into a mold

00:03:05.912 --> 00:03:08.559
and then allowed to cool naturally.

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:11.182
A common working method in the 1500s.

00:03:11.182 --> 00:03:13.388
A tack that had been made more recently,

00:03:13.388 --> 00:03:15.849
would probably have
been hammered or stamped

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.145
resulting in a very
different crystal structure.

00:03:19.588 --> 00:03:22.026
The microscope also revealed
an interesting layer

00:03:22.026 --> 00:03:25.087
on the surface of the tack.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.457
To identify the composition
of this surface coating,

00:03:28.457 --> 00:03:32.524
a scanning electron microscope was used.

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:36.166
The upper layer was targeted and analyzed

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:38.570
with an electron beam.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.738
The spectrum produced by the microscope

00:03:40.738 --> 00:03:42.876
showed that the layer
was primarily composed

00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:45.678
of the element tin.

00:03:46.615 --> 00:03:49.215
As you can see in this
replica, the thin layer of tin

00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:53.486
was used to imitate the
shiny appearance of silver.

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:55.775
These discoveries about
the manufacture and

00:03:55.775 --> 00:03:57.974
chemical composition of the tacks,

00:03:57.974 --> 00:04:00.611
enabled Getty scientists to conclude

00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:02.264
that they are authentic and date back

00:04:02.264 --> 00:04:06.976
to the fabrication of the cabinet in 1580.
