00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.109
Hi!

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.820
I’m Claire Brown and I’m standing outside
of the Lincoln model at Whisper Run, built

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.099
by KCH, named one of the top 100 builds in
the country.

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.190
I’m here to find out why more people are
buying KCH.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.769
Let’s go find out.

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.950
The first thing that I notice when I come
in here is how bright it is, and I think its

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.559
because I can see many of the rooms on the
first floor right from here, like this beautiful

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:51.690
sitting room.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.980
I’m a sucker for a bay window – I love
this!

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.600
It’s really nice and inviting and it mirrors
this dining room - c’mon, let’s go see.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.720
So one of the things I noticed when I came
in here is this detailing.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.740
I love the crown molding and the chair rail
molding.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.640
I specifically love the picture frame molding
around the bay window.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.290
This is so well thought out and really well-designed.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.570
This whole room is so lovely because its great
for a formal dining space, but because there’s

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.600
hardwood floors throughout, it almost feels
like this front entertaining party room with

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.820
the sitting room here and the dining room
here, right next to the kitchen.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.340
Come on, let’s go check it out.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.310
Just off the kitchen is the first floor laundry
room with plenty of counter space, a sink

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.700
and tons of counter space.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.250
That’s convenient.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.420
This kitchen is so inviting!

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.450
And I love it when appliances are built into
the wall, microwave oven, stainless steel

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.330
refrigerator, and this island!

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.590
It’s two levels and seating is on one side.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.880
And check out this detailing work, how beautiful.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.620
There’s so much cabinetry, tons of storage,
and I really appreciate when designers use

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.620
the space well.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.540
This desk is a great space for a workstation
to put your computer and iPad, or for the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.450
kids to do their homework.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.650
Well thought out.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.569
Now it’s really bright and airy in here,
but I want to know where that light is coming

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.569
from.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.920
Come on, let’s go see.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.129
Here is where it came from.

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:30.540
Check out this huge bay bump-out window and
look at all the beautiful molding work.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.940
Now, I saw this fireplace when I walked in
because of the open floor plan, but I had

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.020
no idea that the stonework went all the way
up to the ceiling.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.450
It’s so cozy and inviting in here.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.349
Okay, I want to go check out upstairs, so
let’s go see what is going on up there.

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.010
I remember this room from the front foyer,
this is a great den.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.450
Its got a fireplace.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.780
Look at this, its inlaid slate and you can
see right through the fireplace to the family

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.050
room and into the kitchen.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.370
That is so cool!

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.200
Okay, I’m really going upstairs now, come
on.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.870
Oh, are you seeing this?

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.830
It overlooks the family room we were in earlier
with those windows that are two stories and

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.830
this fireplace.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.900
You know, its even more impressive up here.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.069
I see the owner’s bedroom.

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.190
Here we are in the owner’s bedroom.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.270
I think in the owner’s bedroom, you want
to have these elements: comfort, bright open

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.269
spaces, and an awesome bath.

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.379
Come on.

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.650
On my way to the owner’s bath, I passed
by this oversized walk-in closet.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.870
The thing that ties this room together is
the tile, because its on the floor and around

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:04.000
this gorgeous soaking tub and in the walls
of this frameless glass shower.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.410
And it is such a clean look.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.569
And double sinks, that makes everything so
much easier.

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:17.600
I’m sure there’s more to see, let’s
go find out.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.810
Down at the other end of the landing is a
beautiful bedroom and a bathroom right next

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.000
door which offers great privacy for guests.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.250
This bedroom is also a good size and can you
imagine the stargazing you can do from these

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.880
windows?

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.000
And that’s this here?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.990
Ah, there’s a jack-and-jill bath leading
into both bedrooms.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.231
Its great because the sink is separate from
the rest of the room, so you can have two

00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:45.309
people using it without any trouble at all.

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:50.289
On the other side of the jack-and-jill bath
is this incredibly whimsical, imaginative

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.229
with a bay window.

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:58.360
Well, I have seen a lot, and I know what I
think of this house.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.619
There were so many romantic elemenet to this
house that I really appreciated.

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:05.919
One, was this fireplace in the family room.

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:11.610
I love how the stonework continues all the
way up to the ceiling, which I saw from the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.610
overlook.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.889
I love the fact that I can look over the family
room and see those beautiful floor to ceiling

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:18.900
windows.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.580
So stunning.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.069
And I have to say that my favorite is the
owner’s retreat.

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:25.830
I love that soaking tub.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.180
I just would want to get away from it all
up there.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:36.000
I know why more people are buying KCH, and
you should come see for yourself.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.690
Whisper Run is nestled in the rolling hills
of Windsor township.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:47.490
York county conveniences such as shopping,
restaurants, and recreation areas are close

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.589
by yet the location is very quiet and secluded.

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:55.789
So if you’re looking to get away from it
all, you have to check out Whisper Run.
