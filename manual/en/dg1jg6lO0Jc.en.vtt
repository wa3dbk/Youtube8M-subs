Hello, my name is Darin. On behalf of Expert
Village, I'm going to show you guys how to

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.960
do the "Melbourne Shuffle." Alright, in this
segment right here, I'm going to show you

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:18.100
how to do kicks. It's pretty simple, in a
way, you can do this going from a "shuffle",

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.890
or from the "running man." So, what you do
is pretty much when you're shuffling, you

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.330
know how you have the "T" position, you do
the two step, right? Up and then down; and

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:37.590
you shift side to side. Try this. When you
go up, and your foot slides up, kick out,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.269
but don't let it touch the ground when it
kicks out and you slide over but go back up

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:50.429
and kick that out again; and you can also
do a turn into it. So, try doing it like that.

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.370
Just slide and do that. And you can probably
go straight into the "running man" right after

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.539
that or go into some more shuffling. Another
way to kick is when you're kicking forward.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.080
Say for instance, if you're doing the "running
man" and you have your feet alternating left

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.500
to right, back and forth, say for instance,
you're on your right foot and you're about

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.610
to do the "running man" again and you step
forward with you're left, kick out instead

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.540
of touching the ground and have your right
foot slide back. Once your right foot slides

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.710
back, pick your knee back up from the left
foot, back to the middle and when you feel

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.671
like you're about to go back to a transition,
slide your right foot back again and kick

00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:45.060
back out. It's like a combination of a repeated
move. So, you just kick up, kick out, kick

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.340
out, kick out and then you go straight back
into the "running man." This is what it looks

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.750
like in these couple clips; and more suggestions.
