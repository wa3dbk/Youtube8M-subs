00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:16.600
PeopleSoft Absence Management enables your 
Managers and Absence Administrators to plan 
and manage absence events within a single, 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.200
configurable, rules-based dashboard.

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:22.899
Let’s start by logging in as an Administrator to 
view and manage absence events.

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:30.699
The Absence analytics Dashboard provides all of 
the tools you need to accurately analyze your 
organization’s absence data. Native PeopleTools 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.233
transforms a PS Query into an Excel-like pivot 
table or chart.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.600
Absence Analytics are actionable. In this  
example, let’s analyze the Absence Events 
data.

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:47.966
Clicking on a chart lets you review all the 
Absence Data in a grid type of format, or drill 
down for more information. 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.166
For each analytic delivered in this Dashboard, 
there are several types of Drill Downs or Views 
like  Analysis by Entry Source, Forecast Value, 

00:00:55.166 --> 00:01:02.666
Absences Entered in the Current Calendar Year,  
Fiscal Year, Processing Calendar, and so on.
In this example, let’s find out more about the 

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.732
absences waiting for approval, by looking at the 
types of absences.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:10.666
This chart shows you the absence types the 
employees used when requesting absences.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.200
From here, we can drill down even further.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.000
The chart now shows you the reasons 
employees used for their sick leave.

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:22.533
Clicking on a chart segment lets you see a 
detailed view of your data.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.700
From the detailed view, use Actions to complete 
work on any of the data shown.

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:32.433
For this employee, you have several different 
related actions you can perform.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.533
Use Bulk Actions to approve or reassign multiple 
absence requests at one time, with a single 
click.

00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:44.599
Now, let’s review the other delivered Absence 
Analytics.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.766
Use the Absence Liability and Trends pagelet to 
analyze your organization’s cost obligation and 
leave trends due to employee absences.

00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:59.932
You can apply additional filters to narrow down 
your analysis by Company, Business Unit, 
Department, Location,  and others.

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:08.299
The Absence Cost Analysis pagelet lets you 
analyze the estimated cost of your 
organization’s reported absences. You can 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.566
analyze the data by the absence type, the 
reason for the absence, or the absence take.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.566
The Periodic Absence Rate pagelet allows you 
to analyze the ratio of employees with 
Absences. You can analyze absence entries by 

00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:27.032
several different factors. For example, the chart 
currently shows you the overall absence rate for 
a specific date range by department.

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:36.399
You can analyze absence results for unpaid and 
partially paid absences using the Absence By 
Paid Unpaid Status pagelet.

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:44.866
The pivot grid in the By Generated Positive Input 
pagelet lets you analyze the absence 
information forwarded to Payroll or to the 

00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:45.699
Time and Labor system.

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:54.899
You can use the Employees with Negative 
Absence Balance pagelet to analyze absences 
for employees with negative absence balances 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.633
or to monitor those employees who constantly 
borrow against future absence balances earned.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.833
Use the Absence by Take and Type pagelet to 
analyze absence results by absence take and 
absence type.

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:14.233
The Absence Analytics Dashboard is available 
for our customers using PeopleSoft Absence 
Management.

00:03:15.566 --> 00:03:21.499
Absence Analytics can be deployed in other 
Dashboards. In this example, it's shown in the 
HCM Manager Dashboard.

00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:27.399
Now, we’re logged in as a Manager. Managers 
can analyze absence information using the 
Manager Dashboard.

00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:33.266
Your managers can click the Absence Analytics 
link to get more information about absence 
costs and absence rates.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.200
Selecting either of the Absence Analytics 
options opens a modal window where you can 
apply filters and change the chart options to 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.833
help you analyze your absence data. And when 
you’re done, you can return to the Manager 
Dashboard.

00:03:45.833 --> 00:03:49.166
In this example, the Periodic Absence Rate 
modal window is shown.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.666
PeopleSoft Absence Analytics delivers role-
based analytics that are designed to help 
reduce your organizations costs by enabling 

00:03:56.666 --> 00:04:00.832
