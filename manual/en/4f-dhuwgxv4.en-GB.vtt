Hi I'm Phil Della, the head of the School
of Nursing and Midwifery at Curtin University.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.240
Curtin's nursing and midwifery courses are
the best in Western Australia. By studying

of jobs in Australia and around the world.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.780
As a nurse or midwife you'll have the option
of working closely with people in a variety

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.590
of settings. Not just clinics and hospitals
but also community practices, birthing centres

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.949
or peoples homes. Continued growth in health
knowledge and technology means nurses need

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.170
to be fully equipped to meet current and future
patient needs.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.200

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.700
Hi, I'm Michelle I'm a graduate registered
nurse who works at the Mount Hospital. I chose

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.010
a career in nursing because the potential
career choices are just phenomenal. You can

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.970
travel the world with it. You're constantly
in demand and at the end of the day you've

made a difference to somebody's life.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.520
My studies at Curtin were fantastic. They
are very nurturing, they were up to date in

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.180
the most recent technology and nursing based
practises. And the staff were fantastic and

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.180
most of them are current nurses as well.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.450
For any prospective student who wants to pursue
a career in nursing I would definitely recommend

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.979
