00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.940
Hey everybody! This is Randy Santel, "Atlas"
with Atlas &amp; Zeus Promotions. Tonight I'm

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.900
friggin excited! I'm going for win #2 in Scotland
on this trip. It's day 7. I'm 6-0, hoping

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:24.510
to go 7-0. I'm at the Meat House in Dundee,
off of Perth Road. I'm taking on their undefeated,

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.720
72 ounce steak challenge. We've got the 72
ounce steak broken up into 2 big pieces. We've

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.410
got onion rings, we've got chips, and I'm
pretty sure this is going to be my first challenge

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.130
with macaroni &amp; cheese! So I'm very, very
excited! If I win, I'm going to get the steak

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.160
free, which I'm sure isn't cheap, and I'm
also going to get a shirt, and I'll be the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.370
first to win! It's also going to be fun tonight
because I'm going to be doing this challenge

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.370
with my friend Nick. This is going to be his
first quantity steak challenge, and I know

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.500
he's excited, so lets get it going! Alright,
let me get some Miley Cyrus on and we'll get

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.810
this going! Going for win #148. Can we get
a countdown? Five, four, three, two, one!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.010
Just making sure it's cut right. Oh yeah,
it's perfect! Do that last. I'm going to eatthese onion rings first.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.200
3:20 - all the sides are gone. Let's get this steak done!

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.650
The one thing about steak challenges are that you
need a good knife to cut it all. I ordered

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.650
it rare to medium-rare and it's just the way
I like it. While I'm cutting these up - when

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.240
I get back to the states I'll be combining
all of my favorite words from all eight countries.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:35.800
In Ireland (and here) my favorite word was
"wee". You can put all sorts of stuff in front of it.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.240
Last night after the Edinburgh Cafe challenge, a guy taught me "pish". That'sa good too! I'll be using that one a lot too.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:23.900
26:00 - the other reason I kept them together
was to keep them warm because they don't stay

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.700
warm forever. Time to use the soda to finish
it up.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:21.100
37:15 - People always ask me before any challenge no matter what I'm doing. . ."Am I going to win?"

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:28.110
I didn't come all the way to Scotland just to lose. Win #7 of the trip.
My second steak challenge. Very, very good,

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:36.180
cooked just like I wanted it. 72 ounces of
deliciousness. 37:45 - a first to win, so

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:58.700
obviously the new record. We are in Scotland.
It is day 7, and I have every other night,

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.720
so it time to celebrate in Dundee!
