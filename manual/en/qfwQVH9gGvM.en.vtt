00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.860
My relationship with nature is very interactive:
I don't want to just look at it, I want to

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.740
be part of it, which is why I love outdoor
recreation.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.830
Boom!

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.130
When it comes to the outdoors I really think
that its one of the best ways to learn.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.009
Education, like at PSU, is about more than
just getting a college degree.

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.029
Its about having a well rounded experience
and learning about the world, and I think

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.740
the outdoors is so powerful in doing that.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.580
The outdoor program offers a lot of activities,
a lot of ways and trainings and workshops

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.430
so that you can learn how to climb correctly,
so that you can learn how to kayak.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.820
We do backpacking trips, rafting trips...

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.980
caving and snowshoeing...

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.170
day hiking, snow camping, snow activities.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.310
Its student led, so every single year the
trips we're able to offer change.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.040
We take people out into the wilderness, into
the backcountry, and teach them the skills

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.350
to go out on their own.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.659
The outdoors is for everyone.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.340
Our trips are meant to help someone that is
maybe new to an activity feel comfortable.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.969
We have inclusive trips that are specially
designed for disabled students.

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:25.460
If you already have a foundation, it's a great
place to go and build on that foundation and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.009
get a lot more experience.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.810
You're learning the skills to not only navigate
the backcountry, but also to navigate relationships,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.909
to work on your communication, to build yourself
as a leader.

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.439
I like it because physically it's a challenge
just to get up everyday, to be hiking, and

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.829
you just don't stop, you just keep going,
but at the same time you get to learn a lot

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.930
about the people that you're trekking with,
the environment that you're in, and you learn

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.450
a lot about yourself.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.399
Allowing yourself to push your limits is a
one-of-a-kind opportunity.

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.060
Getting to that crux and just wondering, "can
I do it, can I make this big move"?, and just

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.399
getting over that move is really exciting.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.740
I always think that no matter what you're
doing in the outdoors, there's this moment

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:23.300
of euphoria that you eventually reach.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:37.210
It gives me a renewed sense of self, and it
connects me to my environment in a way that

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.340
I wasn't getting when I was just sitting at
home and it definitely makes it easier for

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.120
me to stay focused on my studies.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.520
I love getting outside, and I love sharing
it with people.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.200
It just leaves you completely enthused in
all of your interactions, and it gives you

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.540
a really strong sense of community as well,
because the relationships you develop in the

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.320
outdoors are so fulfilling.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.812
I like meeting new people, I like being in
the outdoors, I like having fun when other

00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:11.950
people are having fun too, its good to see--someone
whose always stuck inside, someone whose always

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.921
stuck down in the city or at their office
desk and they never get to go outside, they

00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:19.400
never get to really experience... a full part
of life.
