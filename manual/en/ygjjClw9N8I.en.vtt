00:00:12.173 --> 00:00:13.318
DO YOUR STEP TEST HERE

00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:27.165
The treadmill
has 5,000 capacitors,

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:30.411
which are sensors responsible
for measuring the plantar pressure...

00:00:30.412 --> 00:00:32.999
and indicating the user's
foot and footstep types.

00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:35.809
This is a pioneer initiative,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.029
which will allow us to avoid injuries
by determining their footstep type,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.559
they will be able
to strengthen their muscles,

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:46.361
avoiding associated pathologies,

00:00:46.562 --> 00:00:48.760
and improving their performance
on the field.

00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:53.402
We can see how they run
accordingly to their footsteps,

00:00:53.403 --> 00:00:56.342
so, besides
the dynamic baropodometry...

00:00:56.343 --> 00:01:02.150
performed on the treadmill,
allowing us to make corrections,

00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:05.563
we also have the moment
they were running recorded,

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:08.687
since the mechanics of their
performance is also very important.

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:12.920
They are going to walk at first,
we'll perform a marching test,

00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:16.444
and we'll be able to identify
their footstep type,

00:01:16.498 --> 00:01:18.700
then they will start running,

00:01:18.868 --> 00:01:20.659
some of them will be jogging,
some of them will be running,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.223
always faster than the usual
when they are playing,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.715
so that we can identify
their plantar pressure pattern,

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:32.238
which will allow us to identify
potential variations.

00:01:32.377 --> 00:01:35.729
All the data is automatically
gathered by the system,

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.243
so that we can manufacture
orthotic insoles...

00:01:39.244 --> 00:01:42.762
which will correct
eventual pathologies...

00:01:42.763 --> 00:01:44.828
or the existing ones.

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:47.848
Not all of them will need
orthotic insoles,

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.887
only those with variations
in their footsteps,

00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:55.181
that's why we brought
those specialists here...

00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:56.260
to work with us.
