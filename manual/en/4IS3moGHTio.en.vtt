00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.890
Ok, now we're going to do this top one. Go
ahead and take our rubber band off that we

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:16.840
used to hold it out of our way. Just go ahead
and put this to the side. Now we're going

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.450
to start out here because remember we're braiding
towards the middle spine. I'm just grabbing

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:36.039
a very small amount of hair
and go under, go under, all braids start the

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:51.289
same. Grab a small piece and go under, grab
another small piece and go under. Make sure

00:00:51.289 --> 00:01:00.300
you hold the hair really tight to keep it
lined up and to keep it smooth and flat. This

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.650
is one of the cleanest looking styles and
so it's really important to pay attention

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.110
to the detail and the alignment of your braid.
Just keep going under and you'll see, you'll

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.540
want to pay attention to make sure it stays
in the middle of the parted hair. Just keep

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:23.040
grabbing that hair and going under. Make sure
you keep this hair separated. I seem to have

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.821
lost my comb. Keep that separate. You don't
want this in here. lt's very important, this

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:38.080
is a very detailed style. Just keep this out
here, go under and go under and we're almost

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:50.070
toward the edge. Just keep grabbing that hair
and working it towards the middle. We've just

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.520
got one little piece. I'm just going to go
and add all of that in there. And braid it

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:06.270
loose so I don't lose my place. We're going
to rubber band it and bend it over so it does

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.069
not get in our way.
