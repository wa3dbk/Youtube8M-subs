00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.884
- Cha-choo, boo-boop.

00:00:03.014 --> 00:00:04.318
(bottle-top clunking)
- Boo-boop.

00:00:04.318 --> 00:00:05.606
This week on My Drunk Kitchen we are

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:06.630
going to challenge ourselves.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.558
by doing something
we've never done before.

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:09.917
Upload a video on time.

00:00:09.917 --> 00:00:12.912
We're going to be making cheese!

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:14.920
Two gallons of whole milk?

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.174
On no, I don't have that
much milk, even a little bit.

00:00:18.994 --> 00:00:20.394
(funky music)

00:00:20.394 --> 00:00:21.829
Anybody want French toast?

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.035
- (speaks in French)
To the people of France

00:00:24.035 --> 00:00:26.261
for everything that's about
to happen from this point on.

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.581
(funky music)

00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:32.805
- (imitating French
accent) Bonjour, 'allo.

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:34.970
It is me, Hannah, here to show you

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.191
how the French make French toast.

00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:39.479
Drinking wine, yes very good.

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:41.781
(speaks in French)

00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:42.581
Poetry.

00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:43.646
My mustache.

00:00:43.646 --> 00:00:47.487
It is also Christmas, a Paris, so ...

00:00:47.487 --> 00:00:48.607
You know.

00:00:48.607 --> 00:00:51.150
Step one, is your pitiful American bread.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.811
It is not good for French toast,

00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:54.640
it is filled with nuts and seeds.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.134
Know you must take your pitiful
American eggs filled with

00:00:59.134 --> 00:01:01.537
Omega 3s for some reason.

00:01:01.537 --> 00:01:04.337
America is so pitiful you
need to say these eggs are

00:01:04.337 --> 00:01:06.916
all-natural and they come from chickens.

00:01:06.916 --> 00:01:08.569
Hah, ptoo!

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:09.721
I just spit on myself.

00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:11.326
(egg cracks) Le crack

00:01:11.326 --> 00:01:12.936
Le crack!
(speaks in French)

00:01:12.936 --> 00:01:16.532
Oh no, as I look at these eggs
and I think about the shell

00:01:16.532 --> 00:01:20.155
I just threw away I am
overcome with, une vie.

00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:22.843
And I must write poetry to cope.

00:01:22.843 --> 00:01:26.365
(speaks in French)

00:01:26.365 --> 00:01:27.397
Oui.

00:01:27.397 --> 00:01:30.517
We must add le, milk?

00:01:30.517 --> 00:01:32.693
What is milk, what's milk in French?

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:34.651
Milk, lait.

00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:35.828
(speaks in French)

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.707
Now into your milk you must add
the cinnamon sugar, grinder,

00:01:40.707 --> 00:01:45.269
because in America,
everything is so convenient.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:49.629
The cinnamon, sugar, it's
all together in a grinder,

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:52.927
so easy-peasy, so useful for making

00:01:52.927 --> 00:01:54.715
French toast in particular.

00:01:54.715 --> 00:01:57.594
It's very, it's pretty
good, it's pretty good.

00:02:02.297 --> 00:02:05.488
This part is the saddest part,
you have an electric stove.

00:02:07.088 --> 00:02:07.614
What is this?

00:02:07.614 --> 00:02:09.089
Ptoo, I spit on this again.

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:10.993
(mumbles in French) is hot, wow!

00:02:10.993 --> 00:02:14.012
Here is a pan for your pain, French puns!

00:02:14.012 --> 00:02:16.217
(speaks in French)

00:02:16.217 --> 00:02:17.111
I feel the butter?

00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:19.398
Now we take your pitiful
American bread, ooh!

00:02:19.398 --> 00:02:22.056
Now we take this and we
wait for the pan to be hot.

00:02:22.056 --> 00:02:23.230
Pan, are you hot?

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.294
You seem hot to me, ah, call me later.

00:02:26.294 --> 00:02:27.838
Ooh-ahh!

00:02:27.838 --> 00:02:29.870
Magnifique, just like moi!

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.737
Ooh, le flip.

00:02:32.737 --> 00:02:35.035
(speaks in French)

00:02:35.065 --> 00:02:39.218
But that is not necessarily
that bad, it is like life.

00:02:39.218 --> 00:02:41.842
You find you might come away a

00:02:41.842 --> 00:02:44.721
little bit burnt, but who cares!

00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:46.672
Une pour for you, okay.

00:02:46.672 --> 00:02:49.237
Don't be a fool switch your tool.

00:02:49.237 --> 00:02:53.660
Le voila, a perfect tiny
piece of French toast.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.040
It is tiny because that is the French way

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.700
and you don't need to add anything

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.417
to it because it is cut perfectly.

00:03:00.417 --> 00:03:02.693
That is also the French way,

00:03:02.693 --> 00:03:05.154
to never ever make any mistakes.

00:03:05.154 --> 00:03:08.973
I don't think that's so, again,
apologies to all of France.

00:03:08.973 --> 00:03:10.099
Ummm.

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.840
God damn it I love French toast!

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.977
Oooh lets cover this and shut up.

00:03:13.977 --> 00:03:17.274
The best way to have French
toast is add a little butter

00:03:17.274 --> 00:03:20.571
and some powdered sugar, some fresh fruit.

00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:25.512
But none of that is here because
originally I was trying--

00:03:26.042 --> 00:03:27.365
I was trying to make cheese today,

00:03:27.365 --> 00:03:30.987
and now we have food, that's French toast.

00:03:30.987 --> 00:03:33.521
So today's lesson is ...

00:03:35.653 --> 00:03:37.630
Plan ahead there are some things that are,

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.254
actually in your control--

00:03:39.254 --> 00:03:40.973
To do, boo-boop.

00:03:40.973 --> 00:03:43.155

Maybe not the first half of the day

00:03:55.148 --> 00:03:57.029
but they'll definitely go up.

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:58.596
Mwah, mwah.

00:03:58.596 --> 00:03:59.908
Master of my own domain.

00:03:59.908 --> 00:04:02.348
Master of my own domain name.

00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:04.994
Internet jokes!
