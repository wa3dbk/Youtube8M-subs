00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.380
The conversation seems forever stuck in the
second grade

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.019
“We're all the same” - then what the fuck
about your rage?

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.429
Y'all just supposed to keep it zipped at the
lip?

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.820
Don't rock the boat, handle it cuz it's your
shit?

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.189
“Oh we just can't take it when y'all get
upset”

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.700
But what color dying in the hood and on the
rez?

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.190
Even if our past wasn't what it was
Present injustices alone would be enough

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.210
Oh what to do with what we actually feel?
The racial division and skisms they instilled?

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.670
Something so entrenched, so complex, so ill
I wanna stare that shit right in the grill

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.920
If there's one thing I do know from my own
experience

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.890
It's that wrongdoing needs acknowledgement
You can't magic wand that shit away

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.170
The one who suffered gonna have a lot to say

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.619
Black man, black man, black man!
Let's have it out

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.600
Don't wanna take the topic on another roundabout
I ain't scared of your anger: still, it hurts

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.350
Can I get over the fact that it ain't personally
deserved?

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.000
Can I remember the central issue here's your
pain?

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.000
Is my love strong enough to maintain
In the face of your truth?

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.170
And so many of my color gotta be convinced
that your specific agony is even legit

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.750
“Everybody's suffered-” well of course
that's true

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.090
And now I'm speaking bout white on black abuse
An oppression gnawing at my country's bones

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.640
No I cannot leave that shit alone
Collective memories of black bodies writhing

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.110
in flames
And on our side, we just writhing in shame

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.479
Whether we know it or not, they got our hearts
on lock

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.890
Clamoring at the cages of race that do not
Allow expression of our natural tendency

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.990
To know one another as family
Oh what to do in a nation based on so much denial

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.649
Years of terror raining down on black woman

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.189
and child
Feeding us a fantasy it's all in the past

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.950
But the brutality of slavery is heard in gun
blasts

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.730
Oh I know it: those ghosts are with us all
the time

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.900
No matter your side of the color divide
A nation built on something SO foul cannot

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.930
rest
The spirits simply must be addressed!

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.029
Black woman! Let's have it out!
Don't wanna take the topic on another roundabout

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:40.029
I ain't scared of your anger- still, it hurts
Can I get over the fact that it ain't personally

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:42.870
deserved?
Can I remember the central issue here's your

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.569
pain?
Is my love strong enough to maintain

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.200
In the face of your truth?

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.669
My right to speak in these tones is objectionable
to some

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:01.180
They got a word for it: appropriation
So I should keep it lily-white....right?

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.419
It ain't fair I rock the style when I never
had to fight

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.489
Through the same struggles
Oh the Man just hands me respect

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.779
Never had an ancestor noose around his neck
(Well that ain't exactly true the Inquisition

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:16.329
further back)
But hell no I don't know how it feels to be

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.669
black
It's understandably opening of deep-ass scars

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.870
To see these white kids like me spittin' bars
Shakin' ass

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.739
Plus I got the white girl pass?
Access to all the privileges of white middle

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.689
class
To the riches of a nation built on y'all's

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.340
broken heart
But it's the nature of this fertile goddess

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.719
we call art
To cross-pollinate, it's the movement of air

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:40.510
But the least I can do is actually care

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.370
Black people! Let's have it out!
Don't wanna take the topic on another roundabout

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.809
I ain't scared of your anger- still, it hurts
Can I get over the fact that it ain't personally

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:55.000
deserved?
Can I remember the central issue here's your

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.000
pain?
Is my love strong enough to maintain

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.500
In the face of your truth?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.099
Don't wanna take the topic on another roundabout

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:22.600
Yo for real, for real, in a spirit of respect and humility
I want to say thank you to the black people

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.470
of my country
For enduring what y'all have endured

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.229
To your ancestors for surviving and passing
on life and allowing y'all to be here as a

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.860
part of the fabric of this nation that has shown y'all SO
little love

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.100
Thank you for your culture, for your love
That has been a blessing to my life in more

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.919
ways than I could ever say
Than I could ever say
