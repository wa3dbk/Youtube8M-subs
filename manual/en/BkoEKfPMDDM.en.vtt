00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.640
I'm Julia Kester. I am a third year at Boston
University, and I am studying hospitality there.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.830
I was kind of at a point where I was like,
I know I don't want to do hotels anymore,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.139
I'm still in a hospitality major, what else can
I do?

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.500
I like the tourism industry and New Zealand
is huge into adventure tourism.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.239
I'm an intern for a company called GOOT which
stands for Get Out of Town, G-O-O-T.

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.259
The idea for GOOT, it's a company that set
out to provide study abroad students with

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.250
the best travel experiences in New Zealand.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.399
And that's me--so I am the audience for the
company that I'm working for.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.010
It's been fantastic having Julia involved
to provide that kind of insider information.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.219
We've also had a number of field trips that
she's organized.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.660
International students, you know, we're only
here for six months, a year--we're really

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.379
the ones who are more motivated to go and
get out and see the whole country.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.690
Well, the last trip we just ran was a trip
to Rotorua.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.500
Rotorua started off its history as a spa town.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.300
Things have changed a little bit, and it's now the main adventure capital in New Zealand.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.769
New Zealand has got quite a reputation now
as a place to go and do these crazy adventures.

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.250
We're here zorbing today. It's basically just
a big, giant inflatable ball and you go down

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.110
this big hill.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.050
It was like being in a big washing machine--a
big, warm washing machine. It was great.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.660
Here, in Rotorua, the work that I do is essentially
answer people's questions about where are

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.740
we going next, what are we doing, what do
I need to bring. You know, I've planned this,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.590
and I've helped put it together so I'm trying to
make it run smoothly, and trying to help out.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.450
Everybody has been looking forward to this
for a really long time, so I know they're all going to have fun.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.000
We're here on the Kaituna River and our Boston
University group is about to raft the largest

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.770
commercially rafted waterfall in the southern
hemisphere.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.000
The biggest waterfall we're going down today
is a little bit bigger than the shed here.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.500
Wicked, eh?

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.950
When you're going down a big waterfall you
can get underwater, sometimes it can get upside-down.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.000
If it does go upside-down, you guys always
want to hold on nice and tight, okay?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.470
Also, throwing in those educational components,
because those are often the things students might not do on their own.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.299
Well, here we are at the top of Mount Tarawera.
We're just looking down. here, into this amazing

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.590
crater. This place erupted last in 1886.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.579
And it blew this part of the mountain out,
which is where we are now, right there in

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.170
this crater here. Huge amounts of fire, flames,
rocks, buried villages completely. Very, very

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.189
violent eruption. And you're sitting right
in the middle of it.

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.269
I think a big thing that she's learned was
organizing the trip and being involved in

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.370
it and realizing quite what it is. It's not
just that you turn up, pick a few destinations,

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.319
jump in a van and go there. There's a lot
more work that needs to go into it.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.450
Tourism is another part of hospitality that
I can explore. I want to be outdoors, doing

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.370
something fun, leading people, leading a trip.
And that's kind of where I ended up, so I'm

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.939
really pleased with it.
