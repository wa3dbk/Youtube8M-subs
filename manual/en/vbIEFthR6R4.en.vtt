00:00:01.427 --> 00:00:02.472
- What up clan!

00:00:02.472 --> 00:00:04.863
Welcome to Monday, day 1074.

00:00:04.863 --> 00:00:05.862
Today's been a little weird.

00:00:05.862 --> 00:00:07.278
I got up right at 9 o'clock

00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:09.205
I even set my alarm in
case I didn't wake up

00:00:09.205 --> 00:00:11.202
at 9 o'clock but I did naturally so

00:00:11.202 --> 00:00:12.409
I don't have to go wake up from an alarm.

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:14.499
Got up, got Doug's brothers, came back

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:15.783
did all the stuff for the vlog.

00:00:15.783 --> 00:00:17.153
The vlog went up at 10AM this morning

00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:18.546
and hopefully you got it.

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:19.629
If you haven't, you're wondering

00:00:19.629 --> 00:00:20.558
what the heck the vlog is or what's

00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:21.255
been going on.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:24.165
Yesterday's was late almost 4 hours

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:26.069
because of my internet debacle.

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:28.692
Then today's went up early because

00:00:28.692 --> 00:00:29.575
I don't want to have to deal with

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:30.434
that debacle ever again.

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:32.709
In case you haven't seen yesterday's

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:34.613
video yet, here's the story, quickly

00:00:34.613 --> 00:00:36.587
vlogs are going to be edited at night

00:00:36.587 --> 00:00:38.142
and be uploaded before I go to bed

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:39.675
therefore they're going to be ready

00:00:39.675 --> 00:00:40.906
to go when I wake up in the morning

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:41.840
and at that point I'm just going

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.994
to publish them at 10AM
Pacific Standard Time.

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:45.314
That way I have no worries,

00:00:45.314 --> 00:00:46.939
nothing to worry about
the rest of the day.

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:49.052
The vlogs up, it's out,
you can already watch it.

00:00:49.052 --> 00:00:50.167
I don't have to worry about internet.

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:51.072
I don't have to worry about my computer.

00:00:51.072 --> 00:00:51.908
I don't have to worry about anything.

00:00:51.908 --> 00:00:54.787
That relieves a lot of stress for me.

00:00:54.787 --> 00:00:56.854
Then of course, the Apple event

00:00:56.854 --> 00:00:58.247
went on today at 10 o'clock,

00:00:58.247 --> 00:00:59.385
the time that I posted the vlog and

00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:00.801
so I spent about an hour and a half

00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:02.984
watching that, learning about the

00:01:02.984 --> 00:01:05.166
new Apple products, the new laptops

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.907
and of course the Apple
Watch, which is amazing.

00:01:06.907 --> 00:01:07.757
I can't wait.

00:01:07.757 --> 00:01:10.103
Pre-orders start in a month.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:12.332
That gives me a month to make sure

00:01:12.332 --> 00:01:13.034
I have the cash ready because

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:14.305
I'm definitely going to get one.

00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:15.582
Then I replied to comments, and

00:01:15.582 --> 00:01:16.766
that's pretty much all I've done today.

00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.578
Reply to comments and tweets and

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:19.669
kind of social media, everything

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:20.435
is good there.

00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:21.805
But I haven't done any actual work.

00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:24.313
I had all these ideas last night like

00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:25.334
I'm going to bed, I'm going to

00:01:25.334 --> 00:01:26.689
get up early, I'm going to seize the day.

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:27.850
It didn't go down that way

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.173
because of one thing or another.

00:01:29.173 --> 00:01:31.356
No big deal, I'm not complaining

00:01:31.356 --> 00:01:34.096
but I feel like I need to do something.

00:01:34.096 --> 00:01:35.349
It might be a late night tonight.

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:36.464
(keyboard)

00:01:37.114 --> 00:01:38.050
- [Clintus] Hello children!

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.582
- Hi!

00:01:39.582 --> 00:01:41.394
- [Clintus] We got Sierra,
we got Bryce and Mason.

00:01:41.394 --> 00:01:43.530
- He's not staying the night.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.853
- [Clintus] Of course
not, it's a school night.

00:01:44.853 --> 00:01:46.177
- And here's Tiffany in her normal

00:01:46.177 --> 00:01:48.313
Monday position, catching up on vlogs,

00:01:48.313 --> 00:01:50.240
being lazy before she goes to work.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.771
We decided to head to Surprise park

00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:55.045
and Surprise dog park with the dog

00:01:55.045 --> 00:01:57.165
for a little fun in the sun today since

00:01:57.165 --> 00:01:58.094
the weather is so amazing.

00:01:58.094 --> 00:01:59.959
I think it's like 80,
84 degrees right now.

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.236
Actually it is 84 degrees.

00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:03.163
Holy crap, I totally
got that out of the air.

00:02:03.163 --> 00:02:06.282
84 degrees right now in
sunny Surprise, Arizona.

00:02:06.282 --> 00:02:09.834
- [Child] Baby! We got our window open.

00:02:09.834 --> 00:02:10.879
Our back window.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.365
Baby's in the back.

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:14.548
You shed a lot baby.

00:02:14.548 --> 00:02:16.475
We can't have you in the
truck because you shed.

00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:18.475
(cars whoosh)

00:02:18.475 --> 00:02:23.065
(people talk)

00:02:23.065 --> 00:02:28.065
(dog pants)

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:34.361
- Oh, watch out, watch out!

00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:39.076
- [Clintus] Taking a break already?

00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:39.734
Huh?

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:40.507
Taking a break already?

00:02:40.507 --> 00:02:41.297
Oh you're not!

00:02:43.607 --> 00:02:44.757
What are you doing?

00:02:44.757 --> 00:02:45.685
Go find the kids!

00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:46.335
Come on!

00:02:46.335 --> 00:02:47.446
- Baby, baby!

00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:48.725
Up here, up here!

00:02:56.435 --> 00:02:57.511
- [Clintus] She doesn't get it.

00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:59.206
Let's get her on the
leash and walk her up it.

00:02:59.816 --> 00:03:02.631
(bouncing basketballs)

00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:20.862
- What's that?

00:03:20.862 --> 00:03:21.680
That for you?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.200
Is this your ball?

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.575
Don't ignore me.

00:03:26.575 --> 00:03:29.611
Hey, woman, I'm talking to you.

00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:30.594
(laughs)

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:32.405
Sierra's over there somewhere.

00:03:32.405 --> 00:03:33.752
She wanted to go play on the playground.

00:03:33.752 --> 00:03:35.934
I don't know.

00:03:35.934 --> 00:03:38.187
She's over there somewhere, hopefully.

00:03:38.187 --> 00:03:39.882
There she is, I see her.

00:03:39.882 --> 00:03:41.326
She just ran across over there.

00:03:41.326 --> 00:03:45.863
(kids laugh)

00:03:54.823 --> 00:03:56.099
- It's a work out!

00:03:58.857 --> 00:04:00.204
- These are new!

00:04:01.166 --> 00:04:01.857
- [Clintus] These are new?

00:04:01.857 --> 00:04:03.987
- But you can't hear it.

00:04:03.987 --> 00:04:05.450
- [Clintus] Yeah.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.633
- And then that thing was new.

00:04:24.474 --> 00:04:25.774
- Alright guys, so we made our back home

00:04:25.774 --> 00:04:26.889
but Bryce wasn't done playing yet.

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.375
He wanted to do some catch since

00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:29.768
we didn't bring our gloves to the park.

00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:31.742
So we're out front,
throwing the ball around.

00:04:31.742 --> 00:04:36.742
(pop music)

00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:44.318
We just got done eating a quick dinner.

00:04:44.318 --> 00:04:46.152
I made the kids some chicken marsala.

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:48.822
I cooked myself a salmon filet and

00:04:48.822 --> 00:04:49.867
a mahi mahi filet.

00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:52.886
Then we had some sriracha french fries.

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:54.650
I'm going to tell you guys sriracha's

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.322
making a killing right now.

00:04:56.322 --> 00:04:57.646
There's sriracha everything!

00:04:57.646 --> 00:04:58.690
We were at Sam's Club and we saw

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.550
sriracha everything!

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.150
There was sriracha
peanuts, sriracha popcorn

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.145
sriracha teriyaki mahi
mahi which is what had.

00:05:05.145 --> 00:05:08.048
Sriracha Ore-Ida fries,
there was sriracha ketchup.

00:05:08.048 --> 00:05:09.928
There was sriracha, there
was sriracha everything.

00:05:09.928 --> 00:05:11.484
Get it while you can.

00:05:11.484 --> 00:05:12.791
Now, what are we doing Bryce?

00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:14.370
- Watching motorcross.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.322
- Watching supercross!

00:05:15.322 --> 00:05:17.830
We have the entire season recorded

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.316
and we've only even watched the first

00:05:19.316 --> 00:05:20.338
three or four races.

00:05:20.338 --> 00:05:22.149
This is San Diego which I think

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:23.495
is week 5 or 6.

00:05:23.495 --> 00:05:27.837
We're going to start playing
catch up every night.

00:05:27.837 --> 00:05:29.765
- Is the season already over?

00:05:29.765 --> 00:05:30.879
- No, no, it's about halfway.

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:33.735
The first week of May is the championship

00:05:33.735 --> 00:05:35.755
which, by the way, I'll be there!

00:05:35.755 --> 00:05:36.661
Oh!

00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:37.682
- Can I?

00:05:37.682 --> 00:05:39.099
- No, sorry.

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:40.422
Adults only!

00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:41.978
This is where I'm going to end the video.

00:05:41.978 --> 00:05:43.139
Hope you enjoyed the video.

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.068
Be sure to give it a thumbs up.

00:05:44.068 --> 00:05:44.811
We'll see you guys tomorrow.

00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:45.723
Vlog on.

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:48.013
- [Man] Once again guys, I want

00:05:48.013 --> 00:05:49.592
to thank you from the bottom of my heart

00:05:49.592 --> 00:05:51.519
for taking your time out of your day

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:53.547
and everyday to watch our videos.

00:05:53.547 --> 00:05:55.126
It means the world to me.

00:05:55.126 --> 00:05:56.798
I really do appreciate it.

00:05:56.798 --> 00:05:59.027
Sorry today's video was a little shorter

00:05:59.027 --> 00:05:59.979
than the last few.

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.626
I had the dog with me at the park so

00:06:02.626 --> 00:06:04.459
I wasn't recording as much video

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:05.411
as I normally would because

00:06:05.411 --> 00:06:08.104
I had her in one hand and entertained her

00:06:08.104 --> 00:06:10.821
because she wanted to run around and bark.

00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:14.606
She took all my focus and I
wasn't focused on the kids.

00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:15.836
Sorry about that.

00:06:15.836 --> 00:06:18.460
That's what tomorrow is for,
another day, another vlog.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.200
On the screen, two really cool videos

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.143
you wouldn't, you definitely want

00:06:22.143 --> 00:06:23.374
to check out both of these videos.

00:06:23.374 --> 00:06:24.442
They were really, really cool.

00:06:24.442 --> 00:06:28.041
One year ago, I run in
my last half marathon.

00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:30.641
I have not ran a half marathon since.

00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:31.988
I can't believe it's been a year already.

00:06:31.988 --> 00:06:32.731
It's crazy.

00:06:32.731 --> 00:06:36.237
I hurt my knee and I ran the whole thing

00:06:36.237 --> 00:06:37.700
with my GoPro so you get to actually

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.966
run with me, with my GoPro and then we

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:43.008
get home and Tif and I
cook an awesome dinner.

00:06:43.008 --> 00:06:45.051
We do stuffed jalapeños.

00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:46.676
You definitely want to check that out.

00:06:46.676 --> 00:06:49.880
Two years ago, Tif and I are on a cruise

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.111
and we dock in Mexico.

00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:52.852
If you've never been to Mexico,

00:06:52.852 --> 00:06:55.360
you'll get a sneak peek
of what Mexico looks like.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.032
We visited cool bars.

00:06:57.032 --> 00:06:58.425
We visited a couple of art walks.

00:06:58.425 --> 00:07:03.255
Feast on some ceviche
and shrimp cocktails.

00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:05.901
While the kids are all
back here in Phoenix,

00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:08.665
doing there thing and vlogging up a storm.

00:07:08.665 --> 00:07:11.799
Like I said, two really,
really cool videos.

00:07:11.799 --> 00:07:12.705
Check them out.

00:07:12.705 --> 00:07:14.655
Annotations are clickable on the screen.

00:07:14.655 --> 00:07:17.581
Links are down in the description below.

00:07:17.581 --> 00:07:20.112
We will see you guys tomorrow.
