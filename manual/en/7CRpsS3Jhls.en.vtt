Wordpress tutorial 1 how to install wordpress to a blog or website

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:14.133
Hello and welcome to our video series on WordPress. 

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:19.666
Today ill be showing you how to get started with wordpress  by installing it on your blog or website

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:25.632
First step is to go to wordpress’s website wordpress.org 

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:34.633
once you go to wordpress.org you’ll notice that there’s a download wordpress button right on the front page or up at the top there’s a download tab

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:38.633
Go ahead and click on either one of those. And we want to download wordpress. 

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:48.866
One thing we want to note before doing anything is we want to definitely save wordpress to our desktop or another location 

00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:59.066
we can easily locate it cause we will be using the wordpress.zip file relatively soon. Go ahead and save it to the desktop.

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:06.066
And the next step is we need something to transfer wordpress files to our website.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.800
One of the tools we use to do that is a ftp program called filezilla.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:22.066
Filezilla again is a free program to use and when you do a google search it should be the first thing you see searching for filezilla 

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:30.699
and we want to download the client of that. Filezilla is great because it works on all three major operating systems 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.700
windows, linux, and mac os x.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:44.933
ok so once we get both filezila installed and wordpress downloaded to our computer its as simple as opening filezilla next.

00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:57.732
And when open filezilla we will notice a couple different window panes open up on left is a directory of our local computer, 

00:01:57.733 --> 00:02:08.433
and on the right side will be our server location. Next step to get in here is to log in with your database information. 

00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:16.299
Your host is going to be whatever your website is. User name is going to be the name that we use in our database and password is going to be 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.666
that exact same thing too. So we can go ahead and load our website.

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:32.999
Next on the right side we’re going to locate our folder ‘www’ 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.433
this is going to be where we were gonna want to download our wordpress folder to. 

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:47.366
Ok and once we get the folder open all we want to do next is open up our wordpress zip file. 

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:58.699
Im using a file program winrar. It’s another free program to use that opens a multitude of different .zip and .rar files.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:08.266
So once we open up our wordpress.zip what we want to do is take this wordpress folder and drag it to our desktop. 

00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:11.932
And it should be a quick process.

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:16.433
Alright, once we have our wordpress folder on our desktop what 

00:03:16.433 --> 00:03:24.899
we want to do is open it up real quick and locate the ‘wp-config sample’ file. 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:33.266
What we want to do next is open it up; and it should be open in a notepad format. 

00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:38.566
There’s one thing we want to change before putting it on to our website 

00:03:38.566 --> 00:03:47.199
or else its not going to work. We want to change our SQL data base name right here. Want to put in our password

00:03:47.200 --> 00:04:00.033
right here and database name goes up there. Local host name should be the same depending on who hosts your website. 

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:09.499
Best do a google search to check out what your SQL host name is but most cases it’s going to be local host.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:20.400
Alright once we do all that the next step is uploading it to our filezilla. So what im going to do is take 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:31.233
a preconfigured wordpress file and transfer it over. And all we gotta do is literally take the files and drag 

00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:41.933
them and drop them. You’ll notice down here is the different transferrings going on 

00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:47.533
its going to take a while so I’m going to pause and skip ahead.

00:04:47.533 --> 00:04:55.333
Alright now that we have all our wordpress files transferred over we want to make sure they all transferred over. 

00:04:55.333 --> 00:05:00.433
Down here there are three different tabs you can see if there’s any failed transfers. 

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:05.866
If everything went okay they should all be under successful transfers and 

00:05:05.866 --> 00:05:13.232
it looks like everything transferred ok. So the next step would be to open an internet browser.

00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:19.033
Alright in our browser what we want to next is navigate to our website

00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:28.666
And it’s going to be whatever your website is /wp-admin 

00:05:28.666 --> 00:05:35.332
and for this purpose I made demo so mine is a little different but it’s going to be pretty much all the same.

00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:41.499
Next we’re taken to the wordpress welcome screen if everything is successfully done 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.800
and this is going to give your site a title.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:55.500
So do “wordpress installation” we can choose our user name here, going to stick with the default. 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:08.333
Of course we’re going to enter a password and want to register it to an email.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.300
Once we get all that stuff inputted we want to click install. 

00:06:31.833 --> 00:06:35.833
And we should be given a screen like this for success. 

00:06:35.833 --> 00:06:40.533
And we can finally log in to test to make sure it works

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.300
And there we go wordpress is successfully installed on our website.

00:06:53.433 --> 00:06:58.366
