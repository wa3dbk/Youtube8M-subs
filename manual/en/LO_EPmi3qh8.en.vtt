00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.390
hi guys, it's me,

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.690
Ray23179

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.340
and, today, I'm going to be doing a mod review on the Crossbow Mod for

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.150
Minecraft 1.4.2

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.459
today, I'm just... with this mod review, I'm just going to be doing the

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.220
crafting recipes

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.650
I'm not gonna show you all the Crossbows and what they do cause there is a

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.550
but-load of Crossbows

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.089
and if I had to show you what all those do, it would just take forever, but

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.400
the names of

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.530
this crafting recipes mod review is gonna be complete. I'm gonna show you every crafting recipes

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.260
that it adds

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.010
and... yeah.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.710
so

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.280
let's get started

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.960
okay. The first, most basic, crafting recipe you're gonna know

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.750
need to know, is the Crossbow Crafting Bench

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.530
um...

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.710
it's 3 Iron Ingots on the top

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.020
wood like a boat

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.140
and a Crafting Table in the middle

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.050
and you get a Crossbow Crafting Bench

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.270
onto the Attachments and Scopes. Okay, so...

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.090
3 Flint and Steel down, like this, diagonally 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.830
and Iron Ingots around it basically

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.510
is a Flame Crossbow Attachment

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.780
um... cause of the Flint and Steel

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.140
the Lava Buckets

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.970
with the iron around it

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.770
makes the Lava Crossbow Attachment

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.450
the Glass Panes down, in the corners

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.560
the uh... Iron Ingots

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.940
around the Redstone Torch gives you the Basic Crossbow Scope

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.340
and the Glass Panes, the same thing as over here

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.300
um, with the Iron Ingots like this

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.460
kinda curved around the back

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.940
the Basic Crossbow Scope, which is the here, and a Button

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.010
that give you a long-range classless co

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.740
kick the people them

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.610
long-range consequences

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.560
next we have um...

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.870
my personal favorite the latent raffle
attachment

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.540
but to get by being closed down in the
corner is that still in the middle and

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.969
then ironing gets around it

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.269
uh... explosive customer attachment yet
that they didn't seem to be banned and

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.609
painless and it

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:15.280
the point that what's happening

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.019
i think

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.819
this uh...

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:19.949
leather work

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:24.709
uh... you could call me get this kind by
using two or my anything

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.520
than normal and that they'll work

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.450
would be like it's that you can get in
survival

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.409
but it doesn't work to make the poison
attachment

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.119
for some reason i don't know why but

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:40.680
so if you're not being treated or have
cm i

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.349
not too many items i don't think you can
really make this

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.389
langley advani gets around and that's
the poison craft but thats mean

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:51.489
they stick

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.370
call

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.230
and plain steel what the hanger and inc

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.479
give your torch crossbow

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:59.999
charcoal will not work

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:01.549
it has to be called

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.169
camping trip

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.659
last one

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.759
uh... is that proscar what that meant
that you get up and smell here

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.469
smilebox

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.629
handing it soon

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.929
so that's the attachments and now
they're going onto the streets

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:19.239
there five votes

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.189
and uh...

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.879
me you can use any kind of one plank
status but has declined can

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.470
became eight what bolts

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.549
cobblestone unless they can get stone
uh... eight stumbles

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.979
with parenting and stick together

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.549
all and bolts

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.189
with that

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.859
holding an estate mediate the cobalt

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.920
and obviously the best ones at the
diamond instinctively and heat and bold

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.319
what solvable

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.069
right now being made

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.929
uh... across the land

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:51.669
these are very important

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.359
uh...

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.639
if you put sticks orlando in a column
like this and then

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.919
oprah planks any kind again

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.629
needed three woodlands

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.729
sticks and cobblestone get the spell
names

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:08.919
sticks and they really need to get the
admins

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:12.559
sticks and courtney you called

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:17.519
and the best that they can statesmen
give it to them

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.660
yet at the craft will

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.160
and i'm to the mechanisms therefore

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.330
they're kind of complicated looking but

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.380
you get there

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.189
um... you cobblestone and upper left
corner like this

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:33.449
and making an air of and she

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:38.949
stickiest here in strange places to get
the basic costal mechanism

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.080
yuki you hanging

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.369
in the place in this couple's them but
used to cover film these poor

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:47.499
cobblestone places at the same his over
here

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:48.650
and you put this

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.669
that pizza couple mechanism here

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.750
and string the same way mystic seeming

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.090
forget though lee

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.469
automatic crossbow mechanism

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:03.079
and the next line and ironing it's just
like the covers that appear conforming

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:05.570
and a role in the upper left corner in

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.880
uh... to extend near ethnic and this
delight automatic rifle making him into

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.229
this but in the middle

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.889
when you get the medium automatic
crossbow mechanism

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.930
and i know that's a huge i a m

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.289
big words

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.740
but a diamond in the place at this one
because at that period but payment

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.810
within this month

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.090
what a dime in the president's one
believe the other for any the scene

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.280
thapa the medium automatic possible
mechanism in the middle directs them

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.770
like this and stayed here you get the
heavy automatic cost booming

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.639
formats are mechanisms

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.490
now the uh... type capping bench it
looks a bit new year

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.139
like this

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.050
uh...

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.460
and it's getting better and move the
because you're wondering

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.969
so

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:59.770
you're gonna need three sticks always
thinkin costello in those places

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.849
slapstick there

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:04.230
and you're going to need the lands

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.280
five lands to bill and plates

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.370
and i'd like to have borrowed the over
the past no

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.520
your mechanism any kind

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.499
in the area

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:16.269
you know are you make it but if you want
to scope

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:16.960
format

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.559
or an attachment

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:20.080
you can put it up there

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.099
this is pursuing my favorite kind of
crossbow

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:28.229
heavy out of that crap though mechanism
diamond winds and lightning attachment

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:33.150
justice crossbow uh... you can make a
lightning strike by that name

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.389
it's uber understand what

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:41.270
and two children doesn't fit in

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.069
it's so much fun

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.100
that

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.100
the air

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.319
so

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:47.889
anyway gags

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:49.059
that instead

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:51.019
crossbow mine

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:51.719
and uh...

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:55.439
ironman sharing right now

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:56.860
right here

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:02.490
there is a lot of combinations that you
can do it hospital let it all that

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:08.110
there are a lot of profit they measured
light and want to go over them all

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.499
but no

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:12.699
that the explosive attachment thing

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:13.709
beyond its

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:16.400
that uh...

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.379
meets well

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:23.999
but i think it takes a little bit of
time thirteen like uh... chimney

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:28.339
when you pulled up and get a little and
world

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:34.699
so yeah guys that is across the line for
my draft one point four point cn

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:35.479
baggy hope

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.419
that's like the video

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:38.979
and i will see
