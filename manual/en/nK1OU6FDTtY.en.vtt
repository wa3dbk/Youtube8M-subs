00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.240
In the bowels of the earth 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.680
live creatures perfectly adapted to life in perpetual darkness.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.360
Bats’ extraordinary ability of to navigate through echolocation

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.920
 allows them to move at incredible speed,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.120
 in complete darkness,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.160
 dodging obstacles and even 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.640
detecting and giving chase to insects in flight. 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.440
During the breeding season,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.320
 multitudes of bats gather, 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.560
sometimes forming groups made up of different species. 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.640
These massive crowds are true communal nurseries.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.080
Such density of numbers helps to maintain body heat,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.720
 but it also encourages the spread of external parasites. 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.840
Fleas and mites in their millions feed on the blood of those

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.240
 who in turn feed on larger insects. 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.680
This diminutive winged mammal 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.880
plays a crucial role in the control of insect populations.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.520
At dusk, the adults share the commune’s tasks:

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.640
some remain to look after the nursery,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.120
while most disperse along the riverbanks

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.080
 to hunt mosquitoes, moths and beetles.
