00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.280
Hey guys.

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.550
Michael here once again with The Daily Note.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.660
Welcome to part 4 of what's new on Android
4.4 for the Samsung Galaxy Note 2.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.799
Today let's look at what the NFC card mode
is all about and how that works differently

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.209
compared to google wallet and tap and pay.

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:24.050
So let's get started.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.900
So let's look at NFC card mode.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.010
When I enable it from the notification panel,
you'll notice that the NFC chip behaves a

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.140
little differently than it did before.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.440
You will see that when NFC Card mode is on
I can scan it, and the scan is more similar

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.640
to a smart card than a NFC tag.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.000
What you've enabled is a new feature introduced
in Android 4.4 called Host Card Emulation.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.730
It will turn your Android effectively into
a smart card for new payment and identification

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.339
systems that should be adopted in the future.

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.480
One new possibility that this will bring is
for example say a subway system wanted to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.899
let people pay by swiping their smartphone
as they entered a turnstile.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.710
The limitation was, either the subway company
had to overhaul their payment scanners so

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.700
that it worked with the NFC chip on our smartphones,
or it required the customer, you, to open

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.979
the subway card app and make it temporarily
work the subway scanner.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.660
Both of these ch ices never seemed like an
attractive solution for either parties.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.579
Now with NFC Card Mode, the subway system
should theoretically only need to update their

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.820
software, and you should able to scan your
smartphone and a transaction can take place

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.130
without you having to open any apps.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.899
It just does it in the background.

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.430
Next, as mentioned earlier, NFC Card mode
can handle more complex transactions of paying

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.740
with a credit card but without the need for
a middleman like Google Wallet.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.929
Currently, how NFC payments work is that it
needs a secure element, aka a google wallet

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:59.060
or something like it, and your cellular service
provider had to allow it to be on there.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.179
And you can see why credit card companies,
cellular providers, and google would all have

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.110
some conflicts of interest.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.450
But now with NFC Card Mode it eliminates the
need for a middleman.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.300
But here's the deal with NFC Card Mode.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.070
It's so new, you'll most likely won't be using
it for a while.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.030
And until then you can use the older NFC payment
systems that accepts Google Wallet and wallets

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.330
like it, which are actually somewhat in place.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.970
And that's where this new setting called "tap
and pay" comes along.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.421
This setting will let you have multiple wallets
such as Google Wallet and Isis and you can

00:02:31.421 --> 00:02:32.790
change which one to use.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.209
I believe before Android 4.4, you were locked
into 1.

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.440
You can see that I currently have google wallet
configured under tap and pay.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.320
The way you get google wallet under tap and
pay is to install the app, set up a pin, and

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.170
enable tap and pay.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.440
And now it should show up in your NFC tap
and pay settings.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.470
So just to recap.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.519
NFC Card Mode.

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.549
That'll come in handy for simple payment systems
such as paying a subway fare, or maybe unlocking

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.480
a secured door at your work.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.200
For payments, you'll have to use an app to
handle the transaction, but you won't be required

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.680
to go through a wallet system that your phone
company has selected to allow.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.610
The catch, at the time of this video, this
is all for the future, and you can't use it

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.610
yet.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.140
Tap and pay on the other hand, requires the
full read and write modes of NFC to be enabled.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.110
Which I find annoying to have always enabled
because it makes this noise every time my

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.480
phone brushes up against a smart card.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.400
But, that's another matter.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.230
Android 4.4 lets you have more than one wallet.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.751
And you should be able to use it now if you
see the NFC payment sysmbol and you have a

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:41.060
something like Google wallet set up.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.150
So that's it for today.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.750
It took a while to figure how all that worked
but I'm glad I understand it now and look

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.750
forward to carrying less cards in my wallet.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.650
