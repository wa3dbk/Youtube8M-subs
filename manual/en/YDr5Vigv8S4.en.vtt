00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.850
Me huele a.... ¡quemao! (It smells like… burned!)

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.290
Hi boyz and gurls!

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.289
In this second cutting video we are going to teach you  how to cut  julienne style.

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:11.299
We are to show you how to make it with an onion,

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.589
a carrot

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:13.660
and a leek

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.169
for you to compare with the previous video.

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:18.939
(because those are the ingredients that we mostly have in our fridge!)

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.880
Let’s start with the onion.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.939
Cut from root to top.

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.419
As usual

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.619
we need to find where is the basal template,

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.660
so we can start to chop from the other side.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.650
In this case,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.980
our goal is to get

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.100
 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.100
as  many little strips as possible

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.739
Now It's time for the carrot.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.570
Start making  a steady base. It is called “calzar”. This way it will be stable/firm in the cutting board.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.600
After that we cut it in half or less

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.810
and laminate it.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.460
 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.190
At this point,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.320
it is better to lay down  and prevent cutting our fingers.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.880
 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.280
Once it’s done

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.890
start making

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.890
the strips in  julienne.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.600
Last we are showing you the leek, we start with the white part,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.840
Cut it in  several pieces

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.310
and then cut it in half,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.020
now we make the julienne strips.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.740
 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.740
Cutting the leek is easier than cutting the carrot uh?

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.420
The julienne cut is used for salads,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.939
garnish and for making the famous julienne soup.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:12.879
Also it can be used in sauces.

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.959
That’s all… that is our second cutting video.
We hope it was useful and until our next video!

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.819
and until our next video!

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.310
Me huele a.... ¡quemao! (It smells like… burned!)
