00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:15.220
Hi, I’m Dan Gray for MPGomatic.com and this
is a Hyundai Accent.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.370
The 2012 Hyundai Accent is powered by a Gasoline
Direct Injected 1.6-liter inline four-cylinder

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.240
engine producing 138 horsepower (HP) and 123
foot pounds of torque.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.759
A six-speed manual transmission is standard
and a six-speed automatic is optional.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.410
The Accent is offered as a four-door GLS sedan
and five-door hatchback models with two levels

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.100
of trim: GS and SE.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.369
The official fuel economy estimates for the
2012 Accent are 30 city / 40 highway miles

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:46.690
per gallon (MPG) for both the manual and automatic.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.900
We traveled more than 300 miles in our top-of-the-line
manual-equipped Electrolyte Green SE five-door

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.580
review unit (sticker priced at just $15,795)
and nudged past the official mileage estimates,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:03.440
with an average of 42.7 MPG on the Interstate
highway and 36.6 MPG combined with spring

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.820
temperatures ranging from the forties through
the seventies.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:24.290
The Accent’s 1.6-liter GDI four delivers
a sprightly run up to sixty miles per hour.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.740
The center-mounted monochrome display provides
trip meters, range to empty, average and instant

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.420
fuel economy data, along with an handy upshift
light while in Eco mode.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.440
The Accent SE is equipped with “sport-tuned
steering,” which is not available on the

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.200
GS or GLS models, and is fun to whip about,
as it goes to battle against a class full

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.160
of go-karts, including the Fiat 500, the Ford
Fiesta and Chevy Sonic.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.659
Inside the cabin, the techie touches are tipped
off with a digitally-inspired cloth upholstery.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.650
The driver’s seat provides six-way manual
adjustment.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.229
The SE model includes a leather wrapped shift
knob and steering wheel with integrated audio

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.810
controls and hands-free Bluetooth.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.790
The 172-watt six-speaker audio system includes
XM satellite radio and iPod integration, with

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.420
a monochrome display somewhat reminiscent
of the early-gen iPod interface.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.860
A single twelve-volt outlet is located at
the base of the dash next to the USB and audio

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.889
inputs.

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:27.379
The Accent hatchback provides 37.8 inches
of headroom and 33.3 inches of legroom.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.090
There’s slightly less space for taller folks
in the sedan (37.2 inches of rear seat headroom).

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.489
The Accent five-door allows for 21.2 cubic
feet of cargo area with the 60/40 split-folding

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:50.999
rear seat up and 47.5 cubic feet of storage
when folded down.

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:55.430
All-in-all, the 2012 Hyundai Accent isn’t
just one of the most affordable and practical

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.400
vehicles available today ... the manual-equipped
SE hatchback is genuinely fun to drive.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.200
With a starting price of just over $12,500
(for the basic GLS Sedan), excellent fuel

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.340
economy, and a robust warranty program, the
Accent plays the trump card with total cost

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.459
of ownership.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:20.459
