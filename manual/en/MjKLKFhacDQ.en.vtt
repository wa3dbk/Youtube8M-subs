00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.640
Field researcher Denver Holt is heading to
his summer job.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.799
The only way to get to the office is to head
out of town on gravel roads and over the wind-swept

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.430
tundra around Barrow, Alaska, located more
than 300 miles above the Arctic Circle.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.939
Holt has been coming here for more than two
decades to study Snowy Owls on their breeding

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:25.939
grounds.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:33.080
He is monitoring 20 nests during this summer
of 2014, in a study area that covers 100 square

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.080
miles.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.620
On this late July day, he's looking for chicks
at a nest about 10 miles from town.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.930
The trick is to keep moving, scanning the
wide open spaces.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.790
Another clue: the parents are watching closely.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.760
There must be a nest or young nearby.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.690
He was just sound asleep, his head down.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.900
Each owlet Holt finds is banded when it's
large enough.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.960
This nest started with seven eggs.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.730
They all hatched, but this small chick is
the only survivor.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.290
Well, it's not biting at my fingers, and usually
they're biting fingers because they're hungry.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.240
It still looks a little stunted in its growth,
it's about 25, 26 days old, probably should

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.250
be a little further from the nest about now.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.490
Information for each nest is kept in its own
booklet: egg-laying dates, hatching, and other

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.550
details about each nest visit.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.360
Holt checks back on each nest every few days.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.680
At other nests farther out on the tundra,
Holt finds chicks that are even younger.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.530
These are only about 14 days old.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.310
By looking at the remains of prey scattered
nearby Holt can tell what the owls are eating.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.130
Right now it seems to be mostly other birds,
rather than the brown lemmings that usually

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.710
make up 90% of the snowy owl diet in any given
year.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.080
We've also been monitoring the lemmings for
23 years as well.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.940
So your typical winter nest looks like this,
it's a pretty good-sized one and you can see

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.780
here, here's a nest chamber and apparently
this keeps them warm enough with good snow

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.450
cover during the winter time.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.091
Given the clutch sizes of the owls this year,
ranging from three to nine, but probably in

00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:19.810
that six range, that's a pretty good number,
that probably indicated that lemmings, at

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.780
least in April and May, were relatively high,
and for reasons I don't know, they either

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.310
didn't stay high or they didn't keep going.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.250
With fewer lemmings to eat, mortality at the
nests is high this summer.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.650
Anywhere from 40% to 100% of the chicks in
each nest have died so far, most likely because

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.450
of starvation.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:50.270
At another nest Holt finds two older chicks,
about 35 and 36 days old.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.209
They become especially beautiful at this stage,
as white feathers begin replacing their fluffy

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.209
gray down.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.830
They look like they're wearing goggles.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.980
These birds will be flying in another couple
of weeks.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.860
Holt has clearly never lost his appreciation
for these magnificent owls.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.220
Whoa, she's exercising!

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.700
Beautiful, beautiful young bird.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.550
Absolutely gorgeous bird.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.410
Look at this.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.319
Number one is I just enjoy the heck out of
it, and then the other thing is, too, you

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.349
enjoy the owls, and you enjoy the lemmings,
and you enjoy the ecology of the tundra, and

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.910
you want to maybe do things that you can provide
some valuable and reliable information for

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.110
the conservation of the whole system.
