00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Before we start real quick i forgot to put this in the episode itself

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.480
This is Dan Jones, he is doing the guest art for the episode this week he's really cool.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.080
okay here we go!

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.520
â™« intro song â™«

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.980
okay so if you watch this show you probably know, we are believers in the free to play model

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.460
We think it has the potential to be one of the best things to happen to video games

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.760
allowing consumers to pay what they feel a game is worth.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.460
while at the same time making sure that game developers don't miss out on customers who might not be able to afford the full retail price

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.180
or customers who are willing pay far far more then standard retail value for a expanded experience

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.380
in an ideal scenario this model is fantastic!

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.920
That said I have had enough!

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.640
the current free to play model is just broken, and morally wrong!

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.980
James has consulted on plenty of free to play games and they are all racing head long to the same precipitous.(steep slope as in no return)

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.780
you see many of the free to play games of today make 90% or more of their revenue's off of less than 10% of their audience

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.100
They depend on what they call whales

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.000
The people who will spend Thousands of dollars on their games

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.960
And this mentality is breaking the model for the consumer

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.700
It making it unprofitable for the Businesses trying to compete in it

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.660
and it's just morally repugnant anyway

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.780
it is something we should be ashamed of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.980
So lets talk about why this is just bad business

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.160
As I think it will resonant most to some of those making these games

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.020
So here the problem you've gotten yourself into a free to play arms race

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.000
There is a limited number of whales out there

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.320
and everyone needs them to sustain their games

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.300
which means everyone is trying to out compete each other for these whales (I hate that term)

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.200
This had led to skyrocketing budgets for free to play titles

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.360
Especially, in the mobile and social world

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.720
and user acquisition cost, that simply climb year after year

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.320
as incentives and ad space simultaneously become more expensive and less effective

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.020
This arms race has in turn led us to create games that cater to the whales specifically

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.980
many game in the free to play space has led further and further

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.060
from allowing a $5 or $10 purchase to create a satisfying experience for the customer

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.300
Instead, focusing on creating a domination experience for players who are willing to drop hundreds if not thousands of dollars in a month

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.520
this lack of play for anyone not willing or not able to pony up that kind of cash

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.000
in turn means that the non-whale sections of the player base are getting turned away from these games

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.060
which not only causes these games to lose revenue from these customers

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.000
but also causes these games to lose those players as content for the whales

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.100
which is essential because most of what the whales are looking for from their large scale expenditures

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.880
is the satisfaction of helping or crushing these players

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.300
this exodus of the low spending player and the free player because of the lack of ability to access a satisfying experience

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.600
after a while leads to higher rates of players just quitting the game

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.340
But since these players are essential to creating the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.760
experience the whales are looking for

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.140
it becomes necessary for the company making game

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.020
to acquire new players as fast as the old players are turned out

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.060
This in turn leads to high advertising cost

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.100
and a further increase in user acquisition cost

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.040
as players cycle out and companies have to reach further and further a field

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.740
to find players to serve as content for the whales

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.460
The center will not hold

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.380
if the free to play market continues this way it is going to collapse in on itself

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.700
if the free to play industry wants to survive we have too look at the average player

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.600
as designers I'm not even remotely saying that I think we should think of these experiences as

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.640
"being free"

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.400
heck, even as a consumer I don't think we should think of these experiences as "being free"

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.960
I'm ok with spending $5-$10 on a game

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.520
I mean I'm already buy games all the time for $60

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.280
and i'm happy to pay that for a good game

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.400
but that is the sort of investment we should be looking for from your consumer

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.780
not five to ten thousand dollar chunks

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.880
listen I will be the first person to say, I think the people who decry free to play game for not actually being free

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.380
who bemoan free to play companies for not simply giving them a product that cost the company a million dollars to make

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.280
are acting super entitled

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.080
I'll even admit this is one of the hurdle we're gonna have to overcome

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.740
as this sort of entitlement has become a somewhat ingrained part of our internet culture

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.400
but I'll be the first person to defend everybody who says they won't play free to play game because they can't afford to actually play them

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.220
in the current market with the current standard business model

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.920
They're right

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.120
I don't have the numbers for it but I'm willing to wager fairly heavily

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.980
that more than 10% of Blizzard's revenue from Hearthstone

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.340
comes from players who spend less than $50 a month on that game

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.000
in fact, I'd wager it's far far north of that

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.560
why because they crafted a satisfying experience the player can have for $2

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.520
and they didn't they didn't exclude the whales either

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.040
they didn't exclude the people who wanted to immediately build the best deck and are willing to spend $1000 to get it right away

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.140
but they didn't make themselves slaves to those people either

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.260
that is the sustainable beneficial free to play of the future

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.180
I know I sound like i'm mad about this and I am a little bit

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.440
Even beyond the sustainable business issue

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.940
I would also ague that today's free to play world has crossed a moral line

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.140
we have free to play games accused of trying to trick their children into spend their parents money

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.600
and of bankrupting people

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.280
Look I don't begrudge people spending money to find joy or a little escapism I'd be a hypocrite if I did

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.160
But when you make game and you stop talking about joy or fun or engagement in the office

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.540
and instead start talking about how to part people from tens of thousands of dollars of their money

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.360
for something completely ephemeral, something

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.640
which is often not even permanent within your game

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.580
you have gone down the wrong path

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.140
there are plenty of way to play on the human psyche

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.720
to part the insecure, the over-rich, or the lonely from their money but

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.440
that is not what games are about

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.460
"Mark my words" -Dan

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.400
when you are looking to get person to part with $10,000 for something like bragging right or virtual friends

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.960
there is not way your doing it without intentionally exploiting the worst parts of the human psyche

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.360
and you know it and your doing it consciously when your putting together your design

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.120
is that why any one of us decide we wanted to make these things

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.000
look, there are many of us in this industry making a very good living with having to cross that line

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.960
a new monetization model don't mean we have to cross that line

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.720
but we've said it over and over again this model have incredible potential

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.580
numerous studios are proving it right now

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.520
(these ones^)

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.500
this model can be consumer friendly

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.780
and incredible successful with resorting to the predatory tactics

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.220
just for your own sake, knock it off

00:05:46.220 --> 00:06:02.580
