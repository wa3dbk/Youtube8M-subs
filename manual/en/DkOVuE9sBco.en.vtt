one nine two david p twenty four hours a

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.500
day we miss your voice still hears a
voice mail on the transgender name

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.919
change denial that we spoke about

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:16.539
heretic packed with people at
expectation doctor marching

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.439
your video about the republican church
groups deny it

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.529
the transgender lady of her name changed

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.029
uh... prying for

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.920
sororities are shelter

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.560
time eugene oregon and to get out of the
way higher trend schechter

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.170
type of thing really annoys me because
of the issues fit

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.080
republicans and trish

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.640
however much they might paid trajectory
people like me and the water

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.210
um... that however much

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.310
spirit and that therefore others

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.750
heart surgery

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.650
stuff that you pointed out that i find
that really going really does

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.580
that they're ok u_n_

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.010
you know

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.130
basically

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.850
making so nothing is bad because uh...
yen hui talking about here as the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.040
completely arbitrary nature

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.299
of everything

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.159
that uh... is bible based or rohr
religious text-based in decision making

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.470
whenever we see people making decisions
with some kind of so-called sacred text

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.390
as the barometer as the rubric we see
incredible double standards that that

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.750
don't make any sense

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.990
like all the people with plastic surgery
on that in the seven hundred clobber

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.430
whatever and uh... yeah university right
