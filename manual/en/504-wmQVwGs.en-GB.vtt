00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.569
[Music]

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:13.090
It's the summer solstice - the longest day,
and Mark is on a date with girlfriend Natalie

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.460
who's going to experience her first romantic
evening out rabbit shooting. It's a good job

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.119
Mark has his and hers outfits on test from
new kids on the block ShooterKing from Belgium.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.330
Natalie is going to need it.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.710
Two is company, three is a crowd and four
o'clock in the morning is when Mark wants

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.070
to see us next. That's in six hours' time,
when Mark is going to have a go at the local

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.160
corvid population.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.930
They bring quite a lot of disease into the
cattle feeders. It is all stored in open bins

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:49.780
and then they mix it up and feed it to the
cows and they carry disease and also the farmer

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.270
doesn't want to feed 150 crows every morning.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.120
He is being joined by Zeiss pro stalker Alex
Hinkin who is setting up on the other side

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.120
of the farmyard.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:06.579
And most of your stuff is going to come over
like this or back from behind you. Like that

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.789
yes. But as soon as you start banging they
will start moving towards the farmyard.

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.530
Ok where are you from here?

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.530
Other side of those trees.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.499
Now the point of Hunter Gatherer is to eat
what we shoot... hmm... not sure how that

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:25.539
got there... We are a bit late with this one.
The traditional date for shooting young rooks,

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:31.289
or branchers, is the 12th May. We know stuff
is late coming-on this year, but this is really

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.409
pushing it - So what do blackbirds baked in
a pie taste like?

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.280
Well they are supposed to taste like pigeon.
If they were dead everyone would eat them.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:51.720
So I am naturally quite sceptical. I made
rook pie as in branchers in a pie for Sporting

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:03.999
Shooter two or three years ago. It was pleasant
I suppose, but I wouldn't rush out to eat

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:06.679
it again. But if there was nothing else to
eat I would eat it.

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.489
As the nursery rhyme goes it's 4 and 20 blackbirds,
so what does that really add up to?

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.670
Well 4 and 20 is probably 80 so we have some
way to go before we can make a pie. I don't

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.020
think we are even going to have enough for
a small casserole if we carry on like this.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.799
With the way the morning is going probably
best to stick to 24.

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:49.819
13 unlucky for some. 14, 15 we might get the
80 yet. 16, 4 and 20.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:56.390
It's been a slow start but Mark is able to
get his eye in. He is loving this work.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:13.349
Oh yes. Oh. Tell me you have got that one
David. Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh man. I know you

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.410
didn't film that because you ...

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.160
As well as his smart ShooterKing jacket which
we all know looks too good for Mr Gilchrist

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.269
and will get as cleaned as regularly as his
guns - i.e. not at all - he is also giving

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.540
a Mossberg pump action shotgun from York Guns
a work out. These days, the pump action seems

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.000
to come second place to the semi auto. Mark
does not really understand why. It's a practical

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.019
way of getting shots down the barrel, especially
in a hide- situation. It requires a modicum

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.760
more skill than a semi-auto but there s less
to go wrong. Pumps don't jam like autos can.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.249
I am not trying to be rude, but I think a
lot of people think they need to fire lots

00:03:54.249 --> 00:04:01.840
of shots really quickly. Anyone that is buying
a gun because its fast cycling is never going

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.129
to make a bag of anything. So I think people
think they are getting something good if they

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.900
can get through the shells really quickly.
But if you see a really good shot like Andy

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.170
Crow firing three shots, he will probably
go bang ... bang ..... bang. The shots are

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:28.009
probably that far apart because if you are
doing it any quicker you are guessing where

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:32.410
your next shot is going. You very rarely go
bang, bang, bang and get three kills, because

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.590
you are just not taking the line of the bird
properly. I think that is why people go for

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:45.370
autos over pumps. I must say I am quite fond
of a pump.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.830
Mark has also got a silenced Mossbeg .410
on test too and we'll be playing with that

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.470
in an upcoming episode. He is pretty pleased
with that too.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.150
With tummies rumbling and nearly 80 birds
on the floor it looks like crow for breakfast

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.150
... or maybe not - the garage-bought disposable
bbq just isn't making it... plus we're feeling

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.120
pretty sorry for Natalie - yes, remember Natalie?
- she's trying to get some sleep in Mark's

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.360
van and to be honest she'd prefer she had
some cornflakes and a coffee.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.720
Ok so it was quite a good morning. It wasn't
as good as I hoped it would be. We picked

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:26.610
76, I thought we would get 120, 150 so it
is a bit disappointing from that point of

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.500
view. We were going to round it up with a
bbq with a young rook, but we failed on quite

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.330
a few levels. Firstly, that is a jackdaw and
not a rook and David just can't light a disposable

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.800
bbq, which between us is quite a poor effort
for hunter gatherer if we one can't hunt and

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.240
gather the right thing and two can't make
fire. I think the series might be doomed.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.110
Fear not we will eat branchers next year and
even crow at some point. Maybe some of you

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.050
can tell us what it tastes like and the best
way to cook it?
