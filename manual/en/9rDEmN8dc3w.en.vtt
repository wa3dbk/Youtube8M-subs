00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.060
Here we are, in the Manga convention of Barcelona 2014, In the block number one

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.080
 they reported us that there's a digimon protest march, of digimon fans in this Manga Convention

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.380
as you can see, they are marching behind me right now!

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.640
and it's formed for a group people, protesters, 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.540
who have decided that the digimon presence in the convention wasn't enough in this convention

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.600
and they disposed to protest to increase it

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.180
&lt;"You play so much, eat my digi-nuts "&gt;

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.880
I join this people, the digi-outraged

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.900
the reason for being here, is because pokemons of the 4th generation sucks.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.080
they are *ucking ugly, they are ugly as cancer

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.340
third generation was already unsightly

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.654
also the new teams, the Magma equip, and those guys, they look gay, they

00:00:34.654 --> 00:00:36.894
THEY DON'T HAVE POKE-BALLS! Not as Pedro SÃ¡nchez (spanish politician), *UCK!

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.740
... we'll be able to win the evil at 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.500
the EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEND... &lt;singing&gt;

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.720
... beside our digimon...

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.120
they are ugly as a tumor

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.540
when i see them i jus think: "Please, they are begging me to kill them"

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:54.554
&lt;Jump, Jump, Jump, Poke-fan, who doesn't jump!&gt;&lt;Jump, Jump, Jump, Poke-fan, who doesn't jump!&gt;

00:00:55.074 --> 00:00:56.694
-Well here we are with the protest Leader.

00:00:56.694 --> 00:00:57.194
+ Yeah, yeah

00:00:57.194 --> 00:00:58.315
- Who are you guys?, for what purpose did you come here ?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.920
+ We are just an outraged people...

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.080
... is just...&lt;Giovanni asshole, go out with pokemon&gt;

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.560
... we are nobody, just people who are outraged for all this, 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.880
for the fact that the convention is turning into pokemon stuff

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.280
&lt;Jump, Jump, Jump, Poke-fan, who doesn't jump!&gt;&lt;Jump, Jump, Jump, Poke-fan, who doesn't jump!&gt;

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.000
+ Since the last year, when i fought with a pokemon fanatic 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.760
... it's crazy for me that this year the convention...

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.020
... the convention position themselves toward pokemon side

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.020
... it's a dumbass move

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.894
so

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.100
this protest march is to show all the convention the silent majority

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.960
who support digimon, and doesn't do for pokemon

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.920
because this kind of stuff do not must be allowed

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.100
hey, record this

00:01:28.534 --> 00:01:30.534
this is a bite that made me the last year fan

00:01:30.534 --> 00:01:31.960
this, this can't be

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.980
this can't be allowed here, It can't be allowed that a guy to bite my ear the last year letting me like this

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.180
- So, the last year, you were bitten by someone in your ear

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.780
+ Yeah, 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.220
it was that guy, the poke-fan son of a *itch

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.000
yeah, yeah, see this

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.660
I'm lurking at him, the mother*ucker... If I see him here... If Ifound him here i will kick his *ss

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.400
look at him, look at his *ucking smile, how he makes his photos  

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.020
And then he goes so happy

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.520
- Okay dude, and...

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.420
what are you claim for in this convention? what's your objective?

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.440
- Just don't let so many pokemons in the convention, we must finish this discrimination in pokemon-digimon

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.120
It can't be

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.200
It must be 50 percent digimon, 50 percent pokemon, or more, because

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.240
 is the soulchild serie

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.575
but, yeah, because pokemon have the MONEY!

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.760
BECAUSE POKEMON HAVE THE MONEY! you come here to buy the entire convention

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.640
and then this kind of stuff happens

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.280
&lt;Die pikachu!&gt;

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.780
&lt;what's wrong with you?&gt;

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:21.300
&lt;Digimon intro Song first Season&gt;

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.360
&lt;Giovani badass, return us the manga's&gt;                   &lt;Giovani badass, return us the manga's&gt;

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:35.680
&lt; Digimon Opening season 1&gt;

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.460
&lt;threating&gt;

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.180
+ This is the last year poke-asshole

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.160
[people shouting &lt;he will kill him!&gt;]

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.360
- I will shatter your face!

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.920
- I will smash your face on the street!

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.500
[People &lt;hey, move away of them, move away, move away!&gt;]

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.520
[Security &lt;Hey! HEY!&gt;]

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.200
[Security [What the *uck is happening here?!&gt;]

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.400
[Security [Stop or i will shoot you both!&gt;]

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.460
- The Staff doesn't let us continue recording, and police just arrested the two guys...

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.160
... now we will try to know what happened

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.460
+ They finished fighting for fan diferences between pokemon and digimon

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.220
+ A poke-fan suddenly appears and starts to discuss with the protest leader

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.315
and they finished...

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.440
... embroiled in a fight

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.840
and the security just come to separate them

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.400
+ I don't know what happened

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.720
it starts, one guy comes defending pikachu, so much pikachu, and we...

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.660
were pacefully protesting, and suddenly he just jumped against one of our banners and

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.240
he fell at the floor

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.220
the security comes, and then we just don't know what happened next, but we...

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.520
...are peacefully protesting...

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.380
... for digimon, for the weak, because we are ever marginated...

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.400
... ever they go against us, and we wanted reivindicate our rights as digimon.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.780
+ Like a circle, the history stars again...

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.480
.. but this time, fortunately, it was only one person who come, and starts to disturb to one of us

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.980
+Yes, it was a little hard, and i'm the opposite, like pokemon...

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.996
...but...

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.200
.. the protest was too much hard, but they have the right to defend their serie

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.400
+ If we are expressing us, and they comes someone to kick us, just for express ourselves...

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.340
... its...  

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.318
... you may understand, if we can't say...

00:04:16.318 --> 00:04:17.398
...eh...

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.640
... it's an expression act, so...

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.480
we are just expressing that we want digimon in the convention...

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.880
... and that poke-fan comes here with their *ucking pokemon in the middle of the convention...

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.660
... acting like that only because we are claiming that we also wants digimon in the convention...

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.080
.. it's... I don't like that

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.160
- I'm not sure but, i think i've just see pokemon people trying to do something.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.880
+ This was a pokemon event, not for digimon.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.120
+ It's so crazy, so crazy, this people...

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.740
.. must have the entry banned EVEN from their own houses.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.240
its... I really think this is a bad way to live

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.520
Until here, is what we lived today in the convention

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.340
the event staff didn't want to detail what happened with the two guys

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.760
and we are waiting for an official notice.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.840
This has beeing

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.880
