00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.270
Okay,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.500
Let's get started!

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.700
First thing,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.300
log in the YouTube channel you want to monetize.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.110
I created a brand new channel for this video. 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.500
Select settings, and you will open the Overview page.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.770
Double check your channel is in good standing, 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.510
And make sure allow advertisements is turned on.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.950
Now, on the left side,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.020
under Channel Settings, select Features. 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.960
Features is brand new, and it shows you all the available features on YouTube.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.890
Select the big Enable button next to Monetization. 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.460
This opens the monetization page. 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.250
Select the big blue button, Enable my Account.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.900
This opens a popup, 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.210
with the YouTube monetization agreement. 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.440
Read the agreement. (hahaha)

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.370
And after reading the agreement, check the 3 little boxes. 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.710
This will light up the I Accept button.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.660
Click this blue button.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.540
This opens another popup that briefly explains monetization.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.400
Click the blue I got it button.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.939
This open the Uploads page of your video manager. 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.590
As you can see,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.769
I have no videos, yet.

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.019
This is a brand new channel. 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.189
If I had videos, they would appear here, and I would be able to start

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:19.989
monetizing them.

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.359
Go ahead and select Settings in the upper bar.

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.629
And this brings us back to the Overview page, where we started. 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.629
Select Monetization on the left side, under Channel settings.

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:38.239

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.699
