00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.310
Welcome and thank you for joining me.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.500
I'm Gerry Oginski, a New York medical malpractice
and personal injury trial lawyer practicing

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.960
law here in the state of New York.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.190
Today's topic is the straight truth about
lawyer advertising.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.230
I want to thank you for coming into my office
for a few minutes so I can talk with you about

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.829
how important this is.

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.210
If you need an attorney let's say you to go
the yellow pages to try and find an attorney,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.630
here's what you need to know.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.090
Typically you're going to open up the book
and you're gonna find about thirty or forty

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.340
pages worth of yellow pages ads.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.910
But let me ask you a question.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.070
How do you know which lawyer is right for
you?

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.460
How are you able to distinguish one law firm
from another simply by looking at the ads

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.920
in the yellow pages.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.960
In all likelihood, the photographs that you
see in the yellow pages ads are going to be

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.239
pictures of crashed cars, picture of a gavel,
a picture of a courtroom or maybe you're going

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.730
to see some attorney standing there looking
really mean with their arms folded.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.100
So how do you distinguish whether one firm
is right for you?

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.680
Also, the fact that an attorney has a small
quarter page ad, does that mean that they

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.049
are not as good as the law firm that has a
big full page ad?

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.780
What about those law firms who have double
full page ads or four full page ads?

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.060
Those ads literally you can take the name
of one law firm off of one ad put them on

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.640
another and you as the consumer are never
really going to know the difference as to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.170
whether one law firm has the ability to properly
represent you in your matter.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.729
So how do you distinguish one firm from another
and how do you figure out which firm is right

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:29.729
for you?

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.270
Well, here's the straight truth about these
advertisements.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.049
The fact is you have to look critically to
see which firm offers the most experience

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.680
for cases just like yours.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.020
Do they handle medical malpractice cases similar
to ones that you are inquiring about?

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.900
Have they handled accident cases like yours?

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.990
Maybe you were involved in a bicycle accident
or a car or a truck accident and you want

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.540
to know what type of experience they've had.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.180
All of these advertisements tend to scream
at you.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.400
They say come to us, we're the best, we're
great, look at all the results we've accomplished

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.060
come to us that's why.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.230
But let me ask you this question, what information
do these lawyer ads provide to you that's

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.410
going to tell you whether or not this firm
is right for you.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.730
The problem with most yellow pages ads is
that they offer very little information.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.590
If those pictures of crashed cars and people
being taken away in ambulances make you feel

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.080
all warm and fuzzy and that's the kind of
firm that you want then by all means you go

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.459
ahead and go there, I'm sure you'll feel comfortable
there.

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.930
For the most part those photographs showing
and depicting terrible accidents and injuries

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.720
don't really make people want to pick up the
phone and call.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.220
There are some law firms who will accept a
client into their office, take them on as

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.760
a client and then send them out to another
attorney because they don't handle those particular

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.760
matters.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.349
So when you call up that law firm you need
to ask a number of things.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.670
Importantly, whether they hold on to your
case, how much experience do they have handling

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.690
your particularly type of case.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.840
You need to know who's going to handle your
case on a day to day basis.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.610
Is it going to be the trial attorney?

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.620
Is it going to be a junior associate?

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.450
Is it going to be a paralegal?

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.150
Because often times in bigger firms, you will
not get to see and speak to the senior trial

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.920
attorney who may ultimately try your case
until you get to trial.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.430
If you're going to be deciding on an attorney
from the yellow pages, look critically at

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.030
each ad.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.310
Look to see what information they give you
as a potential client so that they inform

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.040
you and advise you of things you need to know
like how lawsuits work, how do you know the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.540
process, how do you know what the lawyer needs
to look for in order to evaluate whether or

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.540
not you have a case.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.080
And here's the bottom line.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.510
DO you really want to pick a lawyer the way
you pick a plumber?

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.930
Because really, does it matter which plumber
you hire?

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.909
You just want them to come and fix your plumbing
problem right?

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.489
But, it's different with an attorney.

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.780
It's not you pick one you get the same result
no matter what.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.470
Because each lawyer has different experience
level.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.920
Each lawyer handles different types of matters.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.519
Each firm is set up differently so that you
have a tier where you have the junior associates

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.191
doing most of the work leading all the way
up to the senior attorneys who do most of

00:04:05.191 --> 00:04:06.420
the trial work.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.340
And that's something that you need to know.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.830
When you go to a smaller firm you have one
attorney who handles all of those matters.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.739
So please, be very critical when you look
at yellow pages advertisements and donâ€™t'

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.329
base your decisions solely upon the pictures
that you see there.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.960
Look for the information that's going to help
you solve your problem.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.009
And that's it for the straight truth about
lawyer advertising, I'm Gerry Oginski.

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:28.399
Have a great day.
