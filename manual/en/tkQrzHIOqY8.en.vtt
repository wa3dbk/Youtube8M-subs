00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:00.989
It's so funny

00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:05.849
I've said this before but reading comments on the tongue twister video people are always so surprised that I'm

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.260
half Mexican and that I can speak Spanish. And my Spanish isn't wonderful, grammatically

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.039
it's a bit appalling, but I really enjoy speaking it and I try to keep it up as much as possible.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.250
I try where possible to speak to my mom, who's the Mexican member of my family, only in Spanish.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.149
And I haven't been back to Mexico since 2007 which is a shame. My abuelito, my grandfather on my mother's side died in

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.639
2008. In some way maybe part of me doesn't to go back because he's still alive for me there and going back and seeing his empty

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.890
house will be very sad. But that said I have so much family there. So many lovely cousins. Sadly as most

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.890
of you know the situation in Mexico right now isn't

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.599
great because there's kidnappings everywhere

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.550
and there's murders. One of the things that I would say is probably the nicest thing about being in the US is how much

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.940
Mexican food there is everywhere and how much Spanish you hear around. I mean even here on the east coast.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.629
I heard a lot of it when I was in San Diego, but here it's also everywhere.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.070
And I was I was quite surprised by that.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.939
Which is really, really lovely. There's a Mexican supermarket really near me. Well by near me

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.570
I mean like a 25 minute walk, and no one walks around here, but I walk so it's fun.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.239
I go from time to time. I don't go as much as I would like but

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.830
I went today, and it was funny because every time I walk in. I'm just kind of attacked by memories.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.689
Which is amazing because for me a large part of my relationship with Mexico is my relationship with food.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.769
Obviously when I went I would only go for a week or two. Everything my mom cooks I feel has a Mexican influence somewhere in there

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.949
and then obviously when we would go out there certain people would have

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.710
things that they ate. So for example tamales

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.029
I always associate with one of my uncle's who always offers me tamales.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.900
I walked in today

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.019
and I saw a little green things of jelly or jello as they call them here

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.599
in little packages and they reminded me so much of my abuelita who used to always have them in the fridge and

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.489
would always offer you jelly. And just the range of flavors of jelly as well

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.670
just always blows my mind. And then quesadillas oaxaca which we would have like in the cars on our car journeys and

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.479
travelling places to see family. It's amazing how much food

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.369
defines my relationship with Mexico. One thing it's been really interesting about the

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.509
Critical Race theory in American Literature and Culture class that I took this semester

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.230
and that has just finished today actually, apart from the 15 page essay I have to write about it,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.439
is that the idea of assimilation is addressed a lot.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.790
Recently, especially and I strangely found myself identifying what a lot of the creative works about a mixed-race individual

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.499
I've never lived in Mexico even though I've grown up in the same house, in the UK my whole life. It's remarkable

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.500
how many of these things I felt I

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.640
identified with. Anyway food.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.570
So I've got two types of Mexican bread today.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.010
This one is called a Conchas, so it's like a shell

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.639
This was my favourite, this has always been my favourite. The other one

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.380
I got in honor or abuelito, an Oreja. But it's gonna get sugar all over my desk.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.160
I associate Mexico with food and people I get to see and they're certain like smells

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.660
that I really miss.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.540
I miss It so much, I really

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.989
really, miss it. That is one of the loveliest things being here, and I'm very grateful to the US for that.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.779
I'm also grateful because I went to a thrift shop today and found this hat for a dollar and it's keeping my ears nice and

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.780
warm. Bye guys.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.220
Hasta luego.
