Hi class and welcome to the art of acrylic,
if this is your first time with acrylics you

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.810
can achieve results close to this if you just
follow the step by step guide.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.560
You’ll really be able to get it.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.410
There very simple principles you’ve just
got to follow them a little bit at a time.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.340
This is what we are going to achieve from
this painting it’s a very simple still life

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.380
set up but it looks at a lot of the principles
used in painting a lot of different elements

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.240
all working together.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.380
So the ideas of negative space which are really
helpful for you to be able to draw things

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.880
more accurately you’ll see here in the handle
and this little shape here.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.230
The idea of perspective and giving your viewer
an idea of relationships and sizes is used

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.480
with overlap.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.359
So how we’ve got the lemon placed in front
of the jug here.

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:00.190
So the method that I’m going to talk through
in this painting is using a very limited palette

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.310
to start with and then slowly introducing
colors as we get further along closer to the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.310
finish.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.560
however as you get more adept at painting
and more used to it you can of course start

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.220
with a full range of colours to start with
and it will be quicker than your first one.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.510
As with everything its always better to kinda
start slowly creep up on it so we don’t

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.010
have hundreds of colours, get in a mess and
then never get our paintings finished.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.780
You’ll also learn how to you’ve got to
hold off your highlights until right at the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.200
end to make this jug have this real nice sheen
to it.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.670
How to make your lemon juicy with glazes over
the top to really bring that warmth and how

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.290
to make your tea, just look tea and really
good to drink.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.490
So we are going to start with one colour,
a brown, burnt umber a very very useful colour

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.870
and we’re going to block in our painting.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.220
This is just looking at the masses of the
drawing as in what is a light area and what

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.090
is a dark area.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.130
This has been shown here from using one single
light source.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.750
This is very effective when your painting
because it really helps to give the illusion

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.069
of depth and that is one of the trickiest
things to get when your trying to convince

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.040
the viewer of your subject.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.370
If we had lots of different light sources
all coming from different angles it would

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.180
look more like a photo shoot were everything
is really highly finished.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.890
In painting you want to try and keep it simple
so it looks more effective.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.629
So here we’ve got one light source which
produces these lovely shapes of what are called

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:37.629
cast shadows.

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.099
As in the shadow cast by an object.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.780
So grab a brew, grab your brushes, maybe a
biscuit you might need it and lets get learning.
