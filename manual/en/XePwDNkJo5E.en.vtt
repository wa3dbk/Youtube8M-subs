Most times before you go to render a final 
sequence of images, you’re going to want to 
render out a preview animation. Preview 

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:24.066
animations allow you to test your animation and 
make sure that everything works properly before 
committing to a final render. In this lesson we’re 

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:34.033
going to create a preview rendering in order to be 
able to see the camera motion in real time. Let’s 
open a file, from the application drop down 
menu, 

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:49.033
choose open, navigate to the chapter six folder, 
and open the file ch06_façade03.max. The file 
opens to the front view of our building façade; if 

00:00:49.033 --> 00:01:00.066
we scrub the timeline you’ll see that we have a 
100 frame camera animation. We want to 
preview this animation without doing a full render 
to make sure 

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:12.066
that the animation of the camera is the way that 
we want it to be. To create a preview animation, 
click on the tools menu, put your cursor over the 
grab 

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:24.000
viewport option, and choose the “create 
animated sequence file” from the grab viewport 
fly out menu. This opens the make a preview 
dialog box. We’re 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.066
first going to look in the preview range section. 
We have two options we can use; the current 
active time segment or a custom range to be 
able to 

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:45.000
render out a specific range of frames as a 
preview. In this case were going to keep the 
active time segment option selected. In the 
frame rate section, 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.066
we’re going to render every frame so we’ll leave 
the every nth frame equal to one. And since 
we’re rendering this for video and not for film we 
want to 

00:01:55.066 --> 00:02:07.066
keep the playback frames per second at 30. 
Since this is a preview render we don’t need to 
see the full size of the image to test out the 
animation, keep 

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:19.066
the percent of output value set to 50%. This will 
use half the resolution of our current active final 
resolution to create the preview. In the display 
filter 

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:31.033
area, uncheck all the options except for 
geometry. We just want to render only the 
geometry in the scene. If we’re editing after we 
render this preview, 

00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:40.033
sometimes it’s a good idea to have the frame 
number and the camera name embedded into 
the image. In the overlay section check the 
frame 

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:52.066
numbers option and check the camera / view 
name option. In the visual style area, click the 
down arrow on the right hand side of the 
rendering level drop 

00:02:52.066 --> 00:03:03.066
down list, and choose a realistic from the drop 
down list. This will render the frame using the 
realistic viewport rendering settings. In the 
output 

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:15.000
section, click on the codec option for the AVI 
selection. In the video compression dialog box 
that opens, choose the Microsoft video one 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:26.066
compressor from the compressor drop down list. 
This is a codec that is used to compress the 
video so we can play back as an animation. 
We’ll leave 

00:03:26.066 --> 00:03:37.000
all the other settings at their default, and click 
OK to close the dialog. We want to make sure 
that were rendering the camera one view port. 
Now that we 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:47.066
have all our parameters set, click the create 
button to create the preview animation. You’ll 
see 3DS Max running through the frames of the 
timeline 

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:59.066
while it creates the preview animation file. When 
it completes the file, it will open up the 
appropriate media player and play it back. In 
this case it opens 

00:03:59.066 --> 00:04:10.000
up windows media player and as you can see it 
plays the scene back in real time, and has used 
the realistic shading settings. Creating the 
preview 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:20.033
animation can be a critical step in the success 
of your animation. I recommend that you make it 
part of your production pipeline. It is not only a 
great 

00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:29.033
visualization tool but it can help reduce the 
amount of rerendering you have to do because of 
animation issues. Go ahead and press control S 

00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:30.166
to save the file.
