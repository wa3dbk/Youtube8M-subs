00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.359
Wind chill is the perceived decrease in air
temperature that your skin feels

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:07.479
when it’s exposed to moving cold air.

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:12.379
That cold air makes your exposed skin lose
heat and moisture faster than normal.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.559
So when the wind chill is real strong,

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:21.030
all the problems that dry cold winter air
causes are increased and intensified.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.190
While you should always apply a moisturizer
to protect exposed parts of your skin

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.380
before going outside in the winter,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.570
do you need to rethink that moisturizer

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.960
to ensure that it protects against blistering
cold wind and its wind chill?

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.539
Yes, and I’ll explain how in this episode.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:37.539
Hello,

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.149
I'm Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.149
[pause]

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.940
And welcome to DermTV.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.280
In the DermTV episode on choosing a moisturizer
for the winter,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.600
I discussed different weights of moisturizers

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.989
and mentioned specific ingredients to look
for.

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.980
But to understand how to help prevent the
more severe problems

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.109
that wind chill cause for your skin,

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.370
we need to dive a little deeper into how moisturizers
work.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.870
There are two main types of ingredients in
most moisturizers:

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.280
emollients and humectants.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.790
Emollients work by forming a thin film...
like a barrier layer...

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.970
on top of the skin that traps water in the
skin and prevents its loss.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.870
Emollients are better than humectants for
wind chill protection for two reasons.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.500
First, they decrease water loss by evaporation,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.870
and evaporation causes you to lose heat in
addition to water.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.920
Second, emollients, by virtue of their barrier
nature,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.340
literally provide a layer of insulation to
further slow heat loss.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.880
Examples of emollients are dimethicone, silicone,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.940
mineral oil – which is really harmless -- lanolin,
petrolatum,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.000
ceramides -- which are the major lipid constituent
of the top layer of your epidermis --

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.280
and of course, naturally occurring skin lipids.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.490
Now lets move onto the second main type of
ingredient in moisturizers: humectants.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.960
They attract and absorb moisture, even from
the air,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.320
which they can then share with your skin.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.229
But the air involved in wind chill has very
little moisture,

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.370
so these ingredients, like glycerin, hyaluronic
acid, aloe vera, and propylene glycol,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.470
are not that helpful for protecting the skin
from the extreme effects of wind chill.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.640
So as you knew, not all moisturizers are created
equal,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.709
and now you have a rational basis with which
to choose moisturizers

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:42.500
to better protect you from the uncomfortable
effects of severe wind chill.
