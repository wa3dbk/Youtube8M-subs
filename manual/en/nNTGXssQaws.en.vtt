00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.730
Alright so today we’re painting the caliper
on my truck.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.780
Got a ’98 Toyota Tacoma.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.120
Nice tan.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.570
The rims right here are kind of a lighter
gray or darker gray.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.500
And we’re going to be putting a copper colored
paint on the calipers.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.880
So mostly, you know, it’s not something
super visible, you know, during your every

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.880
day driving.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.760
But as your wheels are spinning it will be
more visible.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.840
It has kind of a gloss color to it.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.690
So yeah, right now we’re just…we’ve
got it jacked up off the ground and we’re

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.690
taking the tires off.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.660
So right now we’re just scraping off all
the dust and mud and stuff that’s on the

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.660
caliper itself.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:53.230
Making it all nice and a clean surface to
paint on.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:01.930
Alright, next step is to just kind of isolate
the caliper.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.420
Make sure you put tape over all those inside
components because you don’t want paint

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.740
on the actual rotor itself.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.400
And the towel kind of works itself up underneath
the caliper and around the backside so you

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.530
don’t get paint on anything important.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.390
The paint we’re actually using….where’d
that go?

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.300
Oh it’s right here.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.360
It’s actually a high temp paint so it says
it’s good up to one thousand two hundred

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.810
degrees.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.300
Which that works out pretty well because the
calipers get pretty hot, but if they get up

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.549
to one thousand two hundred degrees, you’re
going to have more problems on your hands

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:39.049
besides chipping paint.

00:01:39.049 --> 00:02:06.660
Alright we’re going to do a second coat.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:19.340
We’ve waited for about 10 minutes or so
now.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:43.620
Alright so when you’re spray painting you
just want to make sure you keep it about,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.980
you know, 10 to 12 inches away.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.050
And then I do it in short bursts just so I
don’t get any runs or drips or anything

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.440
going off of it.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.440
Just kind of like that.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.640
Making sure it’s not dripping.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.670
This is the 3rd coat.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:13.750
We’re only going to do three.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.000
Alright so we took off all the tape and the
towels.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.569
One thing you want to do is if you’re going
to let it dry overnight, one important thing

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.540
is to do take off the tape though, otherwise
the paint on the tape sticks with the paint

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.470
on the caliper and it will peel off in chunks.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:36.450
So it will just kind of peel off like a sunburn
if you know what I’m talking about.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.190
Alright so with the truck you can see the
caliper inside of there.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.921
Obviously as the wheel’s spinning you’ll
be able to see it a lot better.

00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:50.610
It’s a lot more noticeable than that black,
just kind of faded black color that it was

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.610
before.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.360
Anyway, so yeah, that’s how you paint the
calipers on your car.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.319
So if you have any questions, be sure to ask
me in the comments.

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.459
