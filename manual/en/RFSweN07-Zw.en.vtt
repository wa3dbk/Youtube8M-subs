00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.270
phil jackson refuses to condemn uh... arizona's
immigration law in fact he kinda came out

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.189
in support of it

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:17.689
and um... people are upset because uh... huge
majority of lakers fans are hispanic fell

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.199
and during game one of the western conference
on the seventeen th

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.239
uh... there were an estimated forty protesters
in front of staples center and they were protesting

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.619
uh... phil jackson and the fact that he will
not condemn the immigration law let's cue

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.500
sports

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.270
okay sowell at

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.470
first off he says during an interview with
the s_p_ end he basically said and i crazy

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.700
and i the only one who heard the legislatures
say that we took the united states immigration

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.670
law and adapted to our state

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.860
so he seems to think that uh... it's no problem
at all when the astm sports reporter jay at

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.290
dundee ask them

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.490
hey i don't you think it's usurping of federal
law to do that and he said no it's not a serving

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.440
they give it some key they'll be able to enforce
it

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.950
now art so he's in favor of the law

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.480
he's glad to be in favor of a lot you know

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.780
it is what it is right

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.350
but then his second comment to bother me more

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.140
because

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.430
that he went on to talk about how the sun's
should make this political

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.520
he says i don't think you should get involved
in the political stuff

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.619
if i heard right the american people are really
four stronger immediate immigration laws icon

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.640
not mistaken where we stand as basketball
teams we should let that kind of play out

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.189
and that the political end of it go where
it's going to go

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:34.980
weather may sense uh...

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.480
i mean you came out and said u_p_ seems like
you're in federal law i mean it's not that

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.790
hard to figure out right

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.880
so if you're saying you're apparel all white
and they say they're against the law

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.390
okay except that

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.270
as at that time

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.590
mystifies me a little bit

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.100
by looking jackson could as a case a pay no
what

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.479
uh... stay put lost sons on their jersey i'm
not changing the the jersey

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.479
how would he change uh... young emanated from
loss los angeles lakers to you-know-what is

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.600
now the city of angels lakers

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.409
okay working the los out

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:10.330
okay

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.410
that would be unique that you can go that
far of course i get it right

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.210
he's allowed to believe whatever he believes
you're right it's dumb because until i moved

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.770
l_a_ i didn't realize that apparently the
lakers of the team of latinos ok died just

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.949
about latinos

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:30.659
lakers here and obviously i'm generalizing
obviously somebody does belmont especially

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.029
if they live in phoenix

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:33.419
well maybe

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.969
that's a different situation but then they
were too low sons there's a lot of ways this

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:38.569
thing goes ok

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.369
uh... but i was writing to say hey you know
what

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:46.299
so phil jackson believes that may be some
smart marketing move

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.790
but i don't think it just dial the vessel
emmys

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.950
ease you know prejudicial or anything along
those lines

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.239
so i was gonna

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.739
hind apartment okay

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.469
but then this other quote that i hadn't seen
before yes popped up

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.349
and this is from the past but

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.729
it made me kinda go

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:07.930
you'd go and give that to assess ok cell at

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.459
basically the n_b_a_ pass this dress code
right and phil jackson gave a comment as far

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.509
as what he thought about the dress code initially
set

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:21.299
i don't mean to say this as a snide remarks
toward a certain population our society but

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.569
they have a limitation of uh... of their attention
span a lot of it probably due to too much

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.609
rap music going on in their years and coming
out of there being

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.249
i don't know what that means ahah

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:36.950
uh... split the players have been dressing
in prison garb

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.950
the last five or six years all that stuff
goes on it's like gangster thuggery stuff

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.370
date

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.330
and i'm noah man sa spring that in the beginning
i thought well maybe somebody on kids right

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.459
he's like that

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.529
because he says

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:59.649
uh... stewart a certain population in our
society they have a limitation of their cash

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:04.679
is back up okay maybe kids right then he goes
to probably too much a rap music going in

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:07.060
there years and coming out of there being

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.219
the funny thing is he supposed to some liberal
hit the debt

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:13.730
and like coming out of there being that's
that's you know that's the kind of like the

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.629
nineteen sixties targets that are

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:16.919
hold hansen's

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.289
you know etcetera

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.270
might appear at music that's that's not go
to the right direction and paper

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.999
dressing in prison are less for six years

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:30.360
all that stuff that goes on a slight gangster
thuggery stuff

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.139
we have to know your loosening

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.580
does it make

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.000
i mean you put all that stuff together and
i mean they think i don't know

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.290
were

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.460
lower fills going all the stuff

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.979
and uh... an israeli not united new anything
about it so people should boycott the lakers

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.429
but the people that are now laying a like
the lakers and this is an attitude remind

00:04:51.429 --> 00:04:55.050
alike right

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.740
and public what they should stay out of sports
hehehe because that's all right what is owner

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.229
of the lakers think was the point that electives
they hope is that branch of the lakers thank

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.229
i mean et cetera et cetera right so i get
that line if a kid

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.090
all i'm saying is i got a note mister phil
jackson's them now i watch it

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.930
okay

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.590
is that still questionable for the things
that are all

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.880
and it it makes me wonder where the hell you're
coming from
