Hi, I’m Jenny from the Missouri Star Quilt
Company.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.460
Take a look at this great quilt behind me.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.510
This is an awesome quilt.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.660
I love the look of it and love the layout.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.510
This is the envelope block right here.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.590
It’s a half-square triangle quilt and it’s
so easy and we are going to show you how to

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.640
do that.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.730
The fun thing about this quilt is that we’re
calling it “you’ve got mail” because

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.110
it’s all based on these envelopes and we
all love to have that mail.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.800
As much as email and all that improves our
lives and speeds things up, when you get that

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.810
handwritten mail in your hand it just means
something, it’s really special.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.601
When I was a little girl my mom would save
all of the cards and letters she got, and

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:45.210
she put them all in a basket and she called
it her basket of love.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.650
And just love that idea, and periodically
I get letters from you guys and I’ve done

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.650
the same thing.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.890
I have my own basket of love and you know
if you are having a rough day you just get

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.260
some of those out and read them and it cheers
you right up.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.649
So to make this quilt I use two layer-cakes.

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.080
One is a solid background and then the other
one I used was Tim Holtz’s new fabric called

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.360
Eclectic Elements and it’s by Coats, and
I love this fabric.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.070
Look at the clocks and the tape measurers
and the letters.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.650
I just love this kind of fabric it’s so
cute.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.640
And then we also did a piano key border around
it and I used two charm packs for that and

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.080
basically you just cut them in half, mix them
up and you sew long sides together and make

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.229
a long strip for your borders.

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.440
And I’m going to do a tutorial on some border
ideas soon so keep a watch for that, but this

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.580
quilt is going to be queen size when it’s
done.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.900
When you put two layer-cakes together it makes
a queen size quilt.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.189
So the block we are using is called the envelope
block, and it is made using half-square triangles,

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.520
and how I make my half-square triangles is
I sew all the way around the outside edge,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.030
just completely around and then I cut it diagonally
both sides.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.310
So lets take these two pieces, I have two
layer-cakes here.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.229
I have my background and my printed one, and
I’m putting them right sides together and

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.750
I’m just going to sew all the way around
this.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.280
So here we go.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.650
This is such a fast way to make half-square
triangles, I love it.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:26.040
Now you can stop at a quarter of an inch or
you can sew right off the edge.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.939
So now we have sewed this all around the outside
edge and we just need to cut it diagonally

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.810
both directions.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.579
So I lay my ruler on the opposite corners
diagonally across the block, and we’re going

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.340
to make a cut there.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.189
And then we are going to come here and do
the same thing on the other side.

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.040
This is going to give you four half-square
triangles right off the bat.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.230
So then we are going to iron these open, just
like this.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.519
I keep my darker fabric to the top, and then
you can just set your seam and roll it back.

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.819
I can’t get those apart.

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.669
There we go.

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.170
And then I got one more over here.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.400
There we are.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.319
And for the envelope block what you are going
to need is three of these and then you’re

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.659
going to bring in one more for the other block.

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:30.359
So what I have here is three of these blue
ones right here and you can see the envelope.

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.109
And then I am going to bring in this one.

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.650
And I put it in what’s going to look backwards
for the time being and so it’s going to

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.029
stick up at the top like that like and open
flap.

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:51.290
So what we are going to do is sew two of these
together like this and get that right there

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.290
together.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:02.859
And I’m going to stretch this down here
and make this fit perfect.

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:09.379
And then we’re going to iron this open.

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.139
And then we are going to bring it over here,
and you can see I’ve already sewn these

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.579
two right here together.

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.810
And this makes the base of the envelope block.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.949
And then we’re going to join these two rows.

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:24.810
And basically its just like putting a four-patch
together there’s that one seam in the middle

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:32.580
we have to match and I’m going to put a
pin right in there so I can just whiz down

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.080
that seam, I’ve made sure those seams are
nested right nicely together.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.060
And then we are going to go over to the machine
and sew this row.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.379
There we go.

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:57.690
Here we go.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:05.289
Okay so now we just need to press this open.

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.840
And the trick really for this is in the layout.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.740
It makes a, it just is a quick and easy layout
and I’ll show you how to do that.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:21.449
So just to recap when you make this block
you are going to use three of these from one

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.590
block, that’s going to make your envelope,
right like this, and then you’re going to

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.689
bring in a lid and set that in backwards.

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:33.330
I just wanted to make sure you got that because
it’s really important to the layout of the

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.080
quilt so the block looks right.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.800
And so now we are just going to lay them out,
and we’re going to put them together.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.270
The only thing you need to make sure of when
you’re laying these out is that they are

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.259
all pointing the same direction.

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:50.390
You don’t want the renegade letter going
off to the side.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:56.050
So then what we have, we’re just going to
put them together in rows like this and add

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.410
our second row and just keep adding them on
and putting them forward.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.290
So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial today
on the envelope quilt from the Missouri Star

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:12.960
