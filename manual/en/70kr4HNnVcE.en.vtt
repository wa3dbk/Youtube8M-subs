00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.140
Hey beardlovers.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.020
Something totally awesome is about to happen
in this intro.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.520
I am so excited about it.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.520
Wow!

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.520
Okay, fine.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.520
Spoiler.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.520
Flash forward.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.520
EXPLOSION!

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.520
That's gonna be so awesome!

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.520
Woo!

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.520
I can't wait.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.520
EXPLOSION!

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.520
Ah, it was overhyped.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.480
Wheezy Waiter
I wonder if that would have been better if

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.800
I was wearing this instead.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.099
Let's find out.

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.099
EXPLOSION!

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.099
That was better.

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.400
But why did the shirt start on fire so easily?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.400
Hmm.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.400
Oh yeah.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.400
I was playing WD-40 Toss earlier.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.400
- That one was tossed real good.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.400
Ah, WD-40 Toss.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.949
It's a fun game.

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.520
Looks simple enough but you gotta be real
slick.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.520
That just slipped out.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.520
Oh, that one squeaked by too.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.520
Oh ho, triple pun!

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.070
I just put my finger in my nose.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.539
So anyway, today's EXPLOSION Wednesday.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.329
Well, it's a trial run.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.130
We're testing it out to see how the public
reacts.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.570
We'll see if we make it official or not.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.250
In explosion news, Awesome Time Lapse Shows
How Rolls-Royce Built Its Jet Engines.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.600
Yep, there's a seriously cool time lapse video
of how they make jet engines.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.300
And as many of you know, most jet engines
are internal combustion engines, which means

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.309
they're making giant explosion machines.

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:59.309
Explines!

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.309
Machplosions!

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:01.309
Exploschines!

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:02.309
Machinshions!

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.309
Anyway, that time lapse reminds me.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.670
You know those time lapse videos people do
of them taking photos of themselves like once

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.200
a day for a year or something?

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.640
And then they put it all together in a video?

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.880
Well, I've been working on something like
that.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.980
Only on a much gianter huge scale.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.650
And it's done and I'm ready to show it.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.670
28 years in the making.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.930
The project is I've been taking one photo
per 28 years.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.000
Cue sentimental music.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Here it is.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.490
Gah, it's so interesting to see gradual changes
like that.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.990
Gonna take another one in 28 years.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.990
I wonder what I'll look like.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.210
Flash forward.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.240
Hey, you wanna know something awesome about
being a professional video blogger that not

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.240
a lot of people know about?

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.490
I don't have to button my shirt down all the
way.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.490
It's nice.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.280
Get a nice little draft on my belly, which
is good because a higher percentage of my

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.120
body is now my belly because I just sit here
and make videos all day.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.079
In other explosion news, All guns blazing!

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.009
Madonna comes under fire for brandishing AK-47
as she kicks off MDNA tour in Israel calling

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.009
for world peace.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.009
What?

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.009
That's ridiculous.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.460
Okay, I'm all for world peace but just waving
a gun around on stage?

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.110
Madonna, that's just a publicity stunt.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.440
You're just promoting yourself.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.490
Shame on you . There shouldn't even be guns
involved in anything ever.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.250
I don't like guns and you know what?

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.250
I'm angry!

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:13.239
I need to blow off some steam.

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.900
Okay?

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.569
Grrrrr!

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.900
That's better.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.560
What?

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.230
What?

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.890
What?

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:33.220
Wheezy Waiter
Just a reminder.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.099
You have less than a week before a portion
of the Wheezy Wardrobe explodes into non-existence.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.370
A lot of it's gonna be gone forever and aside
from the new poster everything is 15 percent

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.370
off.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.370
Use code 'Explodesale.'

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.739
Oh, hey, remember my pet whale was missing?

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.080
I wonder if it's back yet.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.120
It's gone!

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.120
Whale's been kidnapped!

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.670
It was supposed to zoom in.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.580
Do it again.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.690
Whale's been kidnapped!

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.690
Where could it be?

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.690
I hear it.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.220
Oh that must have been my imagination.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.310
I think I left the thought microphone on again.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.310
Oh man, I wish I didn't leave the thought
microphone on again.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.269
Has there been enough explosions in this video?

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.269
Probably not.

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.269
I'll do another one.

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.269
Explosion!

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.269
Agh!

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.269
I shouldn't have done that internally.

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.269
Headache.

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.269
Boobies.

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:10.270
Ow!
