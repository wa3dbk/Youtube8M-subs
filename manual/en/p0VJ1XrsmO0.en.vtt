00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.100
I'm going to take a little of my existing
soil that I have here and I'm going to add

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.719
that to my mix for finalizing planting. I'm
going to stir that into the mix that I have

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.790
already prepared. It's always good to add
some of the existing soil to your mix. We

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:30.010
got that worked in. Now, I'm going to back
fill around this perennial, all around the

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:39.260
edges. Make sure as you're putting it in that
you pack real well. You want to get out all

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.890
the air bubbles that might be down in the
hole. You can also add your hoes and soak

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:55.820
a little bit as you go. Bring this over. I'm
going to add just a little bit of water around.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:09.729
If I can get it on. I don't want too much
pressure. That's just enough. Since the mix

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:18.799
is fairly light, you want to pack it and you're
going to add a bit more. You're going to just

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:27.450
gently cover back in and around some of that
other existing soil so that's it nice and

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:37.939
level. I got a little area here I got to fill
in. So it's nice and level. I'm going to use

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:50.969
my hands and really pack it down so that we
minimize air exposure. A little bit more.

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:58.340
It's nice and level. I can see the base here.
I'm just going to fill in and I'm going to

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:09.011
water this plant in a little more so that
it's nice and evenly soaked. Some people will

00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:15.860
actually make a little rim around, a little
ring around to hold moisture in. This one's

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:28.060
got a nice little pocket already. There you
go. She's in the ground. Ready for the next

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.450
step.
