Pottery Barn Easy Updates with Nico de Swert
Coffee Table Basics 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.450
A coffee table can easily become a greeting place for clutter.
We place all kinds of things on it from 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.679
remote controls to telephones to objects and books.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.449
I'm gonna show you three easy ways to make your
coffee table look beautiful and organized.

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.669
The first way is really a practical way.

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:23.570
The first step

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.960
we're going to try to make some sense of what
we already have on the table

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.060
and a good way to style your books is always
to style them from large to small, so what we're gonna do

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.170
I pulled some colored books that are kind of
in the color palette of the pillows on my sofa.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.950
Just that makes it a little bit more beautiful
and stylized.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.880
You're going to put these all together from

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.250
large to small just like that

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.520
and then my style secret for this organized
tip

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.480
is a tray. A tray's always a great way to keep things organized

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.650
and mess free.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.110
So the rest of the stuff we're just gonna place
inside of the tray,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.550
you know always beautiful if you go from small
to large,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.060
and then we place the objects that we have left,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.299
just in the tray,

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.070
kind of the neatly together,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.210
remote controls can be dumped in the tray just like that,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.900
and to anchor it all together I have this beautiful
wooden bowl, that we're gonna place in here,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.590
and to put some color from outside,

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.410
indoors, I have these beautiful leaves,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.180
in the bowl, voila,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.299
and it's all finished, beautiful

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.410
organized and simple

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.819
and a good thing about a tray is that when you have 
guests over

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.020
it's easy to remove, 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.540
and you have a free coffee table.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.229
Another great way to decorate your coffee table
is to showcase a collection.

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.930
Here I have some bottles that I've collected over the years

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.570
and I have some new ones that I just got from 
Pottery Barn,

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.570
and we're going to create a beautiful landscape
on the table

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.360
just very easy, we're going to start 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.530
with having the bottles,

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.439
just you know play around with them in different
sizes, now we're gonna add

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.650
some beautiful Dutch tulips

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.420
and again the color from the tulips I picked
up from the

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.909
pillows on my sofa.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.369
I'm just going to give them a quick cut and place them 
simply inside

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.300
the bottles just like that.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.129
You know, incorporating flowers into your home 
it's always beautiful

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.069
to bring nature

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.769
gonna cut this a little shorter...like that.

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.120
So the last one we're gonna put

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.099
in here and that's it,

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.629
very simple easy affordable and beautiful.

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.440
Another great way to organize your coffee table
is to create groupings,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.590
and as you can see I've got all kinds of objects
and books in same color palette because it's

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.779
easy on the eye 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:36.419
and again what we're going to do is create beautiful
piles of the books from large to small

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:38.639
just like that, we're going to push that aside

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.869
put the books here

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.209
put the tray in the center

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.619
and we have this beautiful object we're gonna place on
top

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:47.029
of this pile of books,

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:52.149
and then I have these beautiful glass vases from
pottery barn with some rosemary,

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:55.499
I'm gonna put that in the tray in a grouping of four,

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:59.639
and again I'm using a tray to contain my four
vases and it's easy 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.290
because of the rosemary, you can use it in the kitchen,
it's easy to take it off the table take it

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.109
into your kitchen and later place it back on your table,

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.649
And then the last pile

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.519
we're going to do a beautiful stack again of the books

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.539
and then the objects that are left on my table

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.420
this beautiful little vase, and this beautiful

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.810
apple and that's it

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.599
beautiful, simple and organized.
