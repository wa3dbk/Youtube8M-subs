Hey, this is Chase from ShotScience.com
and today I'm going to talk to you about the "Flash."

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.230
The "Flash" is used by the post player to
gain possession of the ball away from the

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.350
basket, or to create space from their post
defender.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.000
To have an effective "Flash" in the post,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.010
you want to come straight back towards the
person with the ball. 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.940
You want to be very visible. So that means

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.190
you want to have your hands in the air; show
them a target.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.440
You also want to be very verbal. You want

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.469
to call for the ball and let them know that
you're open so that they don't miss you.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.970
And lastly, we want to make sure that we're

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.970
under control. We want to be on balance.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.950
When we catch the ball, we want to make sure
that we "Chin" the ball, that we're in athletic

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.420
position so that we're not knocked off or
we don't travel when we catch the ball.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.000
And one last element to remember when we're

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.369
Flashing back to the ball is to make sure
that we greet the ball.

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.709
And what that means is that we have to be

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:14.770
responsible for the last 10% of that pass.
We can't sit back and let the ball come to

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.929
us because the defender will step around us
and tip it away.

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:18.799
So we want to make sure we take our hands

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.539
out in front of us, really go out and grab
the ball, and keep running into it and then

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:30.539
be on balance. As opposed to sitting back
and waiting for it.

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.289
So remember, when performing the "Flash,"

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:36.670
we want to Flash strong.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.349
We want to be visible.

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:39.749
We want to be verbal.

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.450
And we want to be under control.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.479
And remember to meet the ball so that we're
not waiting for it to come to us.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.349
So that's the "Flash" and it's really a great

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:51.419
way as a post player to get the ball in your
hands.

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:53.590
And make sure to check out our future downloadable

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.829
videos on post moves.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:01.829
