00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.870
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.430
SALLY HORCHOW: I'm
Sally Horchow.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.740
And this is "Very Good Looking,"
where you can find

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.226
taste every day.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.430
As you can see, I have let my
office go into a complete and

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.440
utter clutter catastrophe.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.740
It is a nightmare.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.430
So I had to call in
the big guns.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.230
Tracy McCubbin is a declutterer
by trade.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.310
She's a pro.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.560
So I asked her to come over here
and give me some tips on

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.510
how to get out of this situation
and how not to get

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.760
into it in the first place.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.455
Tracy, thank you so
much for coming.

00:00:41.455 --> 00:00:42.620
TRACY MC CUBBIN:
You're welcome.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.340
SALLY HORCHOW: This is a dire
situation, as you can see, and

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.250
I need all the help that I can
get to declutter this office.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.190
I have not even come down here
in a couple months, because

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.270
it's so overwhelming.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.490
TRACY MC CUBBIN: Clutter is
something that you have to

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.560
stay on top of.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.000
People get this idea, like,
oh, I'll clean my desk off

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.250
once, and it'll stay perfect.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.940
It's a constant battle.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.830
SALLY HORCHOW: Well, now, I
know that that is true.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.379
And I feel like I will stay
on top of it once I

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.470
get it under control.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.000
But I don't even know
how to start.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.770
TRACY MC CUBBIN: So one of the
things that comes into play

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.990
with it-- it's a little bit
of time management issues.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.610
It's about blocking off time to
say, OK, I'm going to take

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.400
15 minutes at the start
of every day.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.940
Or I'm going to take a half an
hour on Tuesday, and I'm just

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.470
going to deal with the
things on my desk.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.800
And if you can just build that
time in and actually do it,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.580
you're going to stay on top of
it, and you're not going to

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.370
get so upside down that
you don't even

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.170
know where to start.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.960
SALLY HORCHOW: So there are so
many things on this desk that

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.970
have just ended up here because
I don't have any place

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.890
to put them.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.500
There's just items like--

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.810
I'm going to donate these
things, I guess,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.580
or give them away.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.140
But I don't know what
to do with them.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.380
TRACY MC CUBBIN: OK.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.415
So these are things that you
have plans to donate.

00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:44.120
And you know you want to give
them away, but they're just

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.665
swimming around.

00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:47.310
So one of the things that I like
to do for donations is I

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.380
like to have a bag.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.870
For instance, this tote bag,
because it's easy to carry.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.230
I just put my donations
in here.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.650
It lives by the door.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.940
And then when it gets full
or I know I'm going by my

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.000
favorite place to donate,
I grab it, and it goes.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.990
And then that way, you have
a place for everything and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.670
everything in its place.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.960
These things don't live
on your desk.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.060
They live in this bag.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.580
SALLY HORCHOW: OK.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.550
Exactly.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.419
So everything in its place.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.520
Now this is a file.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.509
It's all one trip.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.200
It's a travel file.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.310
I even have a place
for this to go.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.060
It goes in the file cabinet.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.530
Look at this file.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.435
It's so full.

00:02:18.435 --> 00:02:20.120
TRACY MC CUBBIN: So for
instance, right off the bat, I

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.050
can see these are
old tax returns.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.380
Great.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.840
You need to keep
those forever.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.040
So what I like to
do is create--

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.610
I have these boxes that I like
to use, really inexpensive,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.680
Target, Staples, anywhere.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.660
And I would just have one
called Tax Returns.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.500
And then my old tax returns
would go in there, and then

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.500
this lives in the closet
or in the garage or

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.410
somewhere out of the way.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.060
SALLY HORCHOW: So should I start
this whole process in

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.360
the file cabinets then
and not on the desk?

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.420
TRACY MC CUBBIN: I would.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.750
I would.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.120
Because then you're going
to have a home

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.220
for everything, right?

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.140
So let's say you make a bunch
of new files on here.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.140
And then you go here and
the files are too full.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.670
Then you're going to put the
new files here, and you're

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.370
going to go lay down
and take a nap.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.990
So clean out a place to put
it, and then you'll have a

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.660
home for it.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.350
SALLY HORCHOW: And
that's another

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.700
question is about mail.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.900
Mail is something that
just piles up.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.200
And there's things in the file
cabinet that pile up.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.400
And look at this.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.510
I have a shredder, but I have
this bag of stuff to shred.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.010
TRACY MC CUBBIN: OK.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.470
So this is a great example of
what we talked about earlier

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.790
about staying on top of it.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.810
I always tell my clients, open
your mail over your shredder.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.100
So shred it right away.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.210
And then what will happen
is this won't build up.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.940
We won't hit that tipping
point of you're

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.160
buried under something.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.700
You just deal with
it right away.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.100
SALLY HORCHOW: OK.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.995
I'm going to deal with
this right away.

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:25.990
TRACY MC CUBBIN: Oh,
that's so great.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.380
SALLY HORCHOW: I'm going
to shred right now.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.550
TRACY MC CUBBIN: Oh,
it's so awesome.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.980
SALLY HORCHOW: It's going to
feel like the most satisfying

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.400
thing in the whole world.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.170
TRACY MC CUBBIN: See?

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.260
It's like the clutter's
just disappearing.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.750
SALLY HORCHOW: Oh my
god, I love it.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.790
Oh, it's a satisfying
noise, isn't it?

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.890
TRACY MC CUBBIN:
It's fantastic.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.200
I love shredding.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.700
SALLY HORCHOW: All right.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.710
Thank you so much.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.560
I really appreciate it.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.800
TRACY MC CUBBIN:
You're welcome.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.510
SALLY HORCHOW: So I've got
my work cut out for me.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.840
But thanks to Tracy's tips,
I'm just the slightest bit

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.921
more confident that I'll
actually get it done.

00:03:51.921 --> 00:03:54.220
And hey, if we can all remember,
everything in its

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.830
place, a place for everything,
then we'll get rid of our

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.970
clutter altogether.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.920
And that will be "Very
Good Looking."

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.040

episode of "Very Good

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.250
