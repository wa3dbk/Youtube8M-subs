00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We are today at pizzeria "La Figlia del Presidente" to show you how to make the real fried Neapolitan pizza

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.700
Today we're going to knead this dough by hand

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
we're going to pour 1,1 L of water

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
50 gr of salt

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
2 or 3 gr of yeast depending by the kind of rising you wish

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
let it melt a little bit

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
add 1 kg/1,2kg of flour

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
depending by the kind of dough required

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.500
and then let's make our fried pizza

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.000
here we knead dough everyday

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and we use a kind of flour that makes a long lasting dough

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.500
We have made a 8 liters dough

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
with a 8/10 hours rising

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
it's a kind of rising nor long nor short
that makes the dough soft and light

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
That's a good dough kind of making

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Under the dough loaves we place a cotton cloth absorbing the flour in order to prevent it blends into the oil

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.500
and then we roll it out

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.500
the same goes for pizza baked in the oven

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
here it is!

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.500
Here comes the stuffing

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
ricotta

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
pork rinds

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
smoked provola

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The fried pizza is with no tomato. 
The most important thing is to close it very well

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.500
let's spread it out

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
let's stretch its sides

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and now let's cook it

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The oil temperature must be not so high

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
otherwise pizza cooks soon and stuffing stays raw

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.500
pizza is ready

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Enjoy it!
