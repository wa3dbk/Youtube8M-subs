00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.540
Welcome to the South Neighborhood at Case
Hall.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.680
I want to take you on a virtual tour today.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.260
My name is Tony Rhodes, I'm the project representative
for this project.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.439
Let's take a look.

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:35.820
Let me start off by saying that we went into
the student rooms, we installed new life safety

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.230
equipment, fire suppression, fire alarms,
and we also went through and we painted the

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.800
corridors and installed new carpeting.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.050
We also put new shower enclosures in each
student room.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.110
And this is what it looks like.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.310
Now we're in the north lobby.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.360
Some of the unique features are we have a
graphic interactive panel behind us that shows

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.460
bus routing, campus map, also it shows the
building layout, the floors, and the room

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.460
numbers.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.640
In this area we repainted the ceiling, painted
the walls, and then we also installed new

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.930
furniture for an interactive area for the
students.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.420
Welcome to Sparty's, this Sparty's is located
in the north end of the building, out of the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.420
North Lobby.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.280
There are two access points, one from right
off the sidewalk, or you can enter from the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.280
North Lobby.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.659
They offer the combo exchange, along with
pizza from the dining facility that will be

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.000
provided here that you can purchase also.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.240
As you can see the facility has quite a bit
of merchandise, and coffee and cappuccinos.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.180
Welcome to South Pointe, this could be considered
the crown jewel of the project.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:02:01.630
We've got five venues, and let's go take a
look.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.780
Welcome to Bliss, this is where you can have
made to order crepes, or all kinds of different

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.400
pastries, pies, or cakes.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:19.890
Welcome to Brimstone where we're serving burgers,
fries, chicken sandwiches and different items.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.820
Welcome to Ciao, this is where they're going
to have subs, baked sandwiches, pizza and

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.820
breadsticks.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:38.630
Welcome to S2, this is where we serve salad
and sushi.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.470
Welcome to great lakes plate, this is where
we're serving dishes from the Great Lakes

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:51.660
area: Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and
Wisconsin.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:03:03.110
So here at South Pointe, we have a capacity
of 650 seats.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.430
If you've been around the project for a while,
you know that there's a new addition.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.669
The new addition starts at the columns and
goes all the way to the glass wall.

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:23.190
Well this is our unique feature that we've
been talking about: the Mary Mayo doors that

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.190
we've relocated to Case Hall.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.390
As you can see it's a barn-style door that
we can slide back and forth.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.390
I want to thank everybody for coming on our
Virtual Tour with us today.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.390
I would like to thank all the internal and
external partners that helped this project

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.390
be so successful.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.397
Have a Spartan day, thanks a lot.
