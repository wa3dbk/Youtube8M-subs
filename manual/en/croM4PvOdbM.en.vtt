00:00:00.017 --> 00:00:04.464
(lighthearted music)

00:00:04.464 --> 00:00:06.730
Male Voiceover: Auguste
Rodin had been, perhaps,

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.196
the first person to willfully
distort, destroy the human body,

00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:15.411
which for thousands of
years, had been something

00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:19.159
to represent fully and
completely and reverentially;

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:22.062
but, to do that in
sculpture, meant to refer

00:00:22.062 --> 00:00:24.433
to the ancient Greek
sculptures and their fragments.

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:27.898
Egon Schiele, in 1910, does it in paint.

00:00:27.898 --> 00:00:31.083
Female Voiceover: It's a
remarkably radical image.

00:00:31.083 --> 00:00:34.834
We're looking at the Seated
Male Nude, a self-portrait

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:38.357
by Egon Schiele, from 1910,
in the Loepold Museum.

00:00:38.357 --> 00:00:41.146
Schiele's only 20 when he paints this.

00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:44.286
It's a really large square canvas,

00:00:44.286 --> 00:00:47.515
and he presents this
figure, himself, his body

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:52.152
with his feet cut off, and
his hands tightly wound,

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:56.871
stretched across diagonally on
this empty white background.

00:00:56.871 --> 00:00:59.241
Male Voiceover: The hands
are so wound, as you said,

00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:00.774
that you can't actually see them;

00:01:00.774 --> 00:01:05.700
so, he is simply his head,
his torso, his limbs,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.481
without the parts of the body
that we grasp the world with.

00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:11.992
He is literally floating unmoored.

00:01:11.992 --> 00:01:14.741
Female Voiceover: The
expressiveness of the body

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.468
reminds me of Michelangelo,
the way that Michelangelo

00:01:17.468 --> 00:01:20.468
used the body to express emotion.

00:01:20.468 --> 00:01:22.547
Male Voiceover: Instead
of the musculature,

00:01:22.547 --> 00:01:25.320
the heroism, the way that
Michelangelo would imbue a body

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.145
with divinity through its power,

00:01:27.145 --> 00:01:29.604
here we have a body that
is virtually emaciated,

00:01:29.604 --> 00:01:33.749
that has been attenuated so that
is almost will stretch and break.

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:36.447
There is a delicacy
and a sensitivity here.

00:01:36.447 --> 00:01:39.622
Look, for instance, at
the hair on the legs,

00:01:39.622 --> 00:01:43.825
what they can, almost like the
tendrils of an undersea creature,

00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:47.387
feel the slightest wind,
feel the slightest pulse.

00:01:47.387 --> 00:01:51.009
There is a intensified
perception that exists here.

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.153
It's, in part, because the eyes are red,

00:01:53.153 --> 00:01:56.532
the nipples are red, the genitals
are red, the navel is red.

00:01:56.532 --> 00:02:00.160
All that also speaks to a
kind of interior intensity,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.707
so this is sexualized, it's violent,

00:02:02.707 --> 00:02:07.100
and he also seemed to be
nothing but a physical shell

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.577
that somehow is at odds with the intensity

00:02:09.577 --> 00:02:12.862
and the power of the
emotional being within.

00:02:12.862 --> 00:02:14.986
Female Voiceover: It's
amazing to me, the way

00:02:14.986 --> 00:02:19.763
that Schiele took himself so
seriously as a subject for art.

00:02:19.763 --> 00:02:22.297
If you think about art
history, its subjects

00:02:22.297 --> 00:02:26.524
are religion, the
aristocracy, princes, kings;

00:02:26.524 --> 00:02:29.510
and here, at this moment at
the end of the 19th century

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.765
and beginning of the 20th century,

00:02:30.765 --> 00:02:34.703
this portrayal of subjectivity,
of this focus on the self,

00:02:34.703 --> 00:02:39.922
of expressing the self and
using radical, formal means.

00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:41.444
Male Voiceover: The problem, then,

00:02:41.444 --> 00:02:43.118
that Schiele seems to
have set for himself is,

00:02:43.118 --> 00:02:47.406
"How can I convey visually
the external body as a means

00:02:47.406 --> 00:02:49.068
to understand the interior self?"

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:57.313
(lighthearted music)
