00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.980
Hey Guys

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.020
today i want to show you the S50 Smartphone from CAT.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.320
Before i can say that it can withstand a lot without burst in several parts.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.360
What I have done with it and what it can do you now see in the video. Have fun.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.120
The CAT S50 is a smartphone which can withstand a lot without a Case

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.660
and which was specially designed for use in harsh environments.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.500
It is well suited for outdoor activities

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.600
at the construction site or in other areas where a normal smartphone is quickly broken.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.120
When it comes to design, the CAT S50 smartphone is not the prettiest but its not designed for this.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.560
At the edges you will find hard rubber bumpers that ensure the impact resistance.

00:00:48.813 --> 00:00:53.073
The covers between them are plastic and not as the first look suspect of metal.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.800
However, the covers are screwed with allen screws and the smartphone appear again a little more robust.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.100
The back is decorated with a large CAT logo and comes with a non-slip surface.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:16.140
Also robust the 4.7-inch display with a HD resolution of 1280x720 pixels which look very sharp for this size.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.420
The Gorilla Glass 3 protects the display against external impact. What it can withstand, let's look shortly.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.500
It can be operated easy and even with wet fingers, also the operation with gloves worked well.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.420
Outdoors in sunlight unfortunately the display is too weak for good read off.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.000
The 1.2 Ghz Snapdragon 400 with 4 cores ensures a smooth operate.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.200
Together with the two gigabytes of memory the the Android 4.4 system runs very good

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.200
and also in Antutu benchmark its enough for almost 18,000 points.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.180
To save your outdoor images or music comes the S50 only with 8GB internal memory,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.400
two and a half GB are used for the system and preinstalled apps.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.820
It should be noted that CAT has integrated "LinkApps" to their websites and the Construction Shop.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.260
Plus, there are 2 real apps.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.120
Once the Shark Tracker app, a project for the protection of sharks, that Caterpillar supports as a sponsor.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.680
And the Toolbox app in which you clearly find further applications

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.940
that match the intended purpose of this smartphone.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.860
The preinstalled apps can not be uninstalled by the way.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.180
If you need more storage, you can extend the memory with a microSD card up to 64GB.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.700
For apps, this memory is not available.
Let's talk about the built-in cameras.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.640
On the back is located in the hex socket a 8 megapixel camera with flash

00:02:50.782 --> 00:02:56.122
so you can capture photos and videos in Full HD at 30 frames per second.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.220
But the quality could be a bit better in my opinion but its enough for the most necessary

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.260
Really only for the most necessary is the VGA front camera.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.340
With only 0.3 megapixels it just enough for emergency video chats.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.280
Selfies or other gimmicks I would take on a different camera.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.920
The test pictures I link to you below into the description.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:27.120
Through the IP67 standard, the S50 is waterproof to a depth of one meter for a time of 30min.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.860
Also against dust, for example, at the construction site or in the sandy terrain the S50 is insensitive.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.900
To ensure this protection, it is important that the rubber seals are always properly closed.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.380
These are left to the USB connector, on top of the headphone input and top right of the Sim and SD card slot.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.320
Further the S50 is tested according to the Military Standard 810G and thus impact and shockproof.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.180
In addition, it keeps strong vibrations which is important for the work on site.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.880
The specified drop test from 1.2 meters height, the S50 withstands effortlessly

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.900
and also 2 drops directly on the screen of 3 meters height has endured the Gorilla glass in my test.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:17.240
After the third test drop I had beside a few notches, unfortunately, a crack in the glass top left corner.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.260
Of course, the body gets here and there a few scratches but the function is not impaired.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.500
The scratch resistance I have to say this is really good

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.660
and I had through the coarse gravel only 2-3 very fine scratches which are difficult to see.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:42.020
During harder tests the Gorilla Glass completely cracked after a fall from about 6m height into a debris tub.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.620
But should be noted that the smartphone still could be operated with little limitation after this drop.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.000
Also at low operating temperatures, the S50 keeps running

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.940
and who is traveling in hot regions, can rely on the S50.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.140
After about 30 seconds in flames, the sidebars and bumpers of plastic stewed on

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.160
but the function has not been compromised and the smartphone keeps running without problems.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.280
Let's take a look on some general information.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.860
The non-removable lithium-ion battery of the smartphone has 2630mAh

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.340
and thus holds in everyday use with WLAN and co. max. one and a half days.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.420
Battery charging via the mirco USB2.0 connection.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.860
The standby time in Ideal conditions with the single version simcards is at up to 33 days

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.309
and talk time up to 16 hours.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.760
Also, you can operate the S50 unlike its predecessor, now also in the LTE or 4G networks.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.180
Besides the use as an MP3 player

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.240
you can use the CAT S50 via the 3.5mm jack and your headphones also for receive FM radio.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.660
In conclusion. The scope of delivery, the weight and dimensions.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:03.400
The S50 comes in a box in the typical CAT colors contained therein is the smartphone, the guide and the USB cable with power plug.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.460
It weighs 185g and can be compare with the weight of an iPhone 6+.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.740
Having a dimension of 145mm in length

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.920
77mm in width and a thickness of 13mm,

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.560
the S50 is a true battleship and nothing for small hands.
Now we come to the conclusion

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.540
Back again, that was the Cat S50.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.487
My opinion of the smartphone is mixed.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.660
I really it is really very robust and can withstand a lot.

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:34.692
Add to that the really good battery performance.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.500
In addition, I found the sound and voice quality for a smartphone that is waterproof is better than rated in some reviews.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.060
The CONS I have a few more that I list now.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.260
- Outdoors in bright sunlight the display is too weak.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.880
- The cameras are real only for the bare necessities

00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:56.221
- The pre-installed apps and links can not be uninstall

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.220
- For the sealings a proper lock is missing.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.040
- The external memory can not be used for Apps

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.660
- And finally, I have to say that the price of the S50 is too high.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.000
Now the new S40 from CAT has been released

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.280
and perhaps if the price for the S50 falls

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:17.240
and you can cope with the negative points, then it's a solid smartphone for abroad.

00:07:17.965 --> 00:07:22.025
Who can do without LTE network and dont need much.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.940
The can take a look at the predecessor the B15Q.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.220
That's not bad either.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.240
Thats It!

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.980
I hope you enjoy the video.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.940
If you want, write down in the comments what smartphones or mobile phones do you use  outdoors!?

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.280
And Would you be interested in a review about the CAT S40?

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.180
take care! Until next time!
