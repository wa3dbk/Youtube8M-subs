"Grandma's iPad"
(based on real story)

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
My grandmother is 80 years old.
She outlived her 3 husbands.

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:48.000
She also outlived all her neighbors and even her parquet.
She's still very energetic and cheerful.

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:57.000
She loves to live.
She also loves to read.

00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:04.000
That is why I bought her a brand new ipad. 

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:10.000
My friend helped to install the internet.
He asked "How is she going to understand everything?"

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:20.000
I replied:"At first she'll learn to use mozilla firefox.
And then be sure, that she'll hack into your bank account."

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:26.000
It almost happened the way I predicted. 
We chat on skype with her.

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:32.000
She calls me every time something happens
and tells me so many different things.

00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:42.000
She learned to send messages.
Sometimes she teaches me to bleach curtains.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:51.000
I've even learned in every detail
the way the tomatoes grow in her garden.

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:58.000
She changes into different outfits in front of me.
I counted about 115 different ones.

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:08.000
She goes shopping with her iPad,
Making every schoolboy in town envy her.

00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:17.000
One day the neighbors above flooded her apartment with water.
They also made a lot of noise.

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:24.000
She promptly took me to them on the iPad.
So I could resolve the issue. 

00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:30.000
Every time she gets in trouble,
she takes me everywhere with her.

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:37.000
Sometimes it happens, when somebody doesn't offer her a seat,
or when somebody doesn't return her the change.

00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm very well informed about the weather now.
I know exactly when it's going to rain and when it's going to be sunny.

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:53.000
And recently, there was a striped woolen iPad case knitted for the iPad.

00:02:53.001 --> 00:03:00.000
This is the way my grandma found herself a new hobby.
I've even cheered her up, saying:

00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:09.000
"This iPad has a 10-year warranty.
You have to outlive it, ok?"
