00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.899
Now that we've completed our bow, we have
four different strapped areas right here,

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:10.400
now is the time to actually put the bow string
on. What I've done is I've created the exact

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.940
same loop, right there at that end, and I'm
going to put this over the top of our biggest

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.900
branch, right there, then I'm going to wrap
it around a couple times, just like that,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.109
now I'm going to come to the other side. Now
this other side, it's a little bit tricky,

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.950
I'm going to bend the bow, just slightly,
I'm going to stick it through there and I'm

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.720
going to stick that string right through there,
I'm going to wrap it around and then I'm going

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:46.100
to bring it back on top of itself, make sure
that it's nice and tight, just like that.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.180
Now, we have a finished bow, just like that.
Now we need an arrow, let me show you how

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.829
to do that. What I have right here is a straight
stick, you're going to want to find the straightest

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.960
stick that you can find out here. You're going
to have to find a really strong wood because

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.960
if you have a very light wood, it's just going
to fly through there without any force. So,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.630
we have our stick right here, we're going
to make sure and carve a nice good tip on

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.221
it. A lot of Indians use rocks, a really sharp
pointed rock, but we aren't going to do that

00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:30.920
right now we're just going to shave this until
it's nice and sharp. Now I have a nice sharp

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.560
point on here, you can always make it sharper
when you have the time, then on the back right

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:45.049
here, make sure it's flat, then you're going
to break off a little wedge in here, just

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.909
for the string to sit in on your back here.
There's all sorts of different ways you can

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.530
make arrows and bows, you can add a fin to
it so it will fly better, you can add the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.930
rock like I was talking about on the front
there, but since we don't have the time we're

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:07.270
just going to do this. We have our bow right
here, the back of the arrow fits nicely, right

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:16.620
in the bow string. Now, just like archery
class, you pull back and you shoot it and

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.659
that's how you make a bow and arrow.
