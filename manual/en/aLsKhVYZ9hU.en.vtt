00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.659
Today we're in the "Becoming Virginians" gallery
of "The Story of Virginia" exhibition.

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:23.600
This engagement ring was given to Sarah Waters
by her fiancÃ©, David Meade II, on May 12, 1768.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.300
Although small, this ring symbolizes
the experiences of a woman who wore it

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.899
through her courtship,
marriage, and perhaps widowhood.

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:36.235
Colonial courtship began young for both men
and women, more often for the woman,

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:40.580
and courtship involved the entire community,
from relatives to friends, who became

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.870
advisers, intermediaries, and
advocates for the suitor and lady.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.120
Because all of it was kept public,
what better way to get acquainted

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.960
and show your social graces than by dancing?

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.810
Courting gave the woman power to choose
by whom she wanted to be courted,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.800
but once the marriage was proposed,
it became a legal matter outside her control.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.000
At first colonial weddings were
performed with great simplicity,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.690
but eventually the traditional ceremony
of today took hold to the populace.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.370
A wealthier family like Sarah Waters' would
have prepared a trousseau for the new bride.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.120
A trousseau is an outfit of clothing
or household linen that a bride accumulates

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.350
in anticipation of marriage.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.100
As soon as they say "I do," husband and wife
are one, and under common law doctrine

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.350
are known as "feme coverts."

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.740
This means that the woman has 
no legal existence of her own.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.729
In an advice book from 1716,
a mother counsels her daughter 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.200
in the union between husband and wife:

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.010
"You are, therefore, to make your best of what
is settled by law and custom, and not vainly

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.640
imagine that I will be changed for your sake."

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.040
Unfortunately, life wasn't eternal
in colonial Virginia.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.310
A widow was entitled to a minimum
of 1/3 of her husband's property.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.570
This was known as the widow's "dower right."

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.209
The widow's status became known as "feme sole,"
so she was allowed to own property, 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:03.470
enter into contracts, and execute a will.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.109
The power the woman had during her courtship
appears again during her widowhood--

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:14.200
everything comes full circle,
just like the ring on her finger.
