00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.230
s

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:08.210
and i will say this about uh... marco
rubios uh... a presentation aside from

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.429
the fact

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.319
that rubio did not

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:16.869
really present to any new ideas it was a
a litany of complaints president obama

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.939
says that we don't like children that we
wanna plays in the skies we don't want a

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.499
poison the skies when you have to say we
don't want to poison the skies you have

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.560
a problem

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.560
you have a serious problem because again

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.890
nobody's claiming that they want to do
this it's just that they don't care if

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.460
it happens

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.450
and that the policies that promote

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.380
actually do poison our air

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.770
it is just like ron paul

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.980
saying

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.420
if becca i'd made a mistake and then buy
health insurance than he did

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.320
i don't want him to die

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.700
but you know is gonna die

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.510
and that's you know that's just the way
it is

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.510
the other thing is that really does
pitch was completely

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.170
i mean he he he was pushing all that it
was literally like it he wasn't it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.560
some type of info at

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.200
like it was like uh... you know

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.040
pushing all sorts of republican troops

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.790
we know the government uh... created the
mortgage crisis and we know fast and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.430
furious but before we get to that let me
tell you how you can make

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.550
thousands of dollars a month seven
thousand dollars a month on passive

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.930
income from your website

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.420
and then just about

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.730
oh them

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.729
button

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.470
all but

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.560
that's right can you imagine being at
home with your children and making seven

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.640
thousand dollars a month

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.009
without doing anything just because
you've set up the proper u r l with my

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.770
asio

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.770
