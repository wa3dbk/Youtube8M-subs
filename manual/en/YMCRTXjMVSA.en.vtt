Hello! I'm Ionut and I'm with the Samsung Mobilers from Romania.

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:12.103
Today I'm going to show you a must have accessory
for the Galaxy S III and the Galaxy Note II

00:00:13.204 --> 00:00:15.104
The "AllShare Cast Dongle".

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:21.105
The "AllShare Cast Dongle" is an accessory that
helps you mirror your phone's screen

00:00:22.106 --> 00:00:26.106
with a big TV that is equipped
with an HDMI port.

00:00:27.107 --> 00:00:31.107
Unlike the "AllShare" function
that we were used to

00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:36.108
with which we could've seen
multimedia content from the phone

00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:40.509
on a big screen TV via a WiFi network,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.510
this dongle allows you to stream
your phone display on the big TV

00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:50.511
no mater that you're browsing the web,
playing a game

00:00:51.512 --> 00:00:53.512
or you are watching a movie.

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:57.013
Let's see what's in the box.

00:01:02.014 --> 00:01:04.900
The content of the package is very simple.

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:09.901
As you can see we have the dongle itself

00:01:10.902 --> 00:01:14.902
which is very lightweight and small.

00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:17.500
The dongle has two ports:

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:23.533
one for HDMI and the other one
for the power supply.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.334
This is the power supply.

00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:31.500
We also have the HDMI cable

00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:37.501
to connect the dongle to an HDMI port on our TV set.

00:01:39.502 --> 00:01:42.502
We have the manuals and the quick start guides

00:01:45.503 --> 00:01:53.503
And some safety notes and some open source licenses,
for the software that's installed on the dongle.

00:01:54.504 --> 00:01:57.504
The setup process is a very easy
and straightforward one.

00:01:58.505 --> 00:02:03.100
I just plugged in the power supply
and the HDMI cable

00:02:04.304 --> 00:02:08.607
The HDMI cable goes from my TV to the dongle

00:02:09.494 --> 00:02:13.315
and the other cable in the power supply.
Let's turn it on.

00:02:14.516 --> 00:02:22.284
After connecting the dongle to the HDMI port of your TV
and after connecting it to the power supply

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.789
All you have to do is to go to pick your source

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.039
I chose the HDMI port I connected it with

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.913
You are greeted with a quick start guide

00:02:35.403 --> 00:02:42.123
in order to help you to connect your AllShare Cast
capable device to the dongle.

00:02:44.684 --> 00:02:49.456
Please check before if your device
is AllShare Cast enabled.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.494
Samsung Galaxy S III and
Samsung Galaxy Note II work with this dongle.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.149
In order to pair them you go to "Apps"

00:03:00.873 --> 00:03:02.607
then go to "Settings"

00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:06.427
and underneath the "WiFi Settings"
click the "More settings" item

00:03:07.304 --> 00:03:10.000
and scroll down to the "AllShare Cast".

00:03:10.342 --> 00:03:16.350
When clicked it will look for
"AllShare Cast" enabled devices.

00:03:17.182 --> 00:03:20.991
As you can see it found it and
it will connect to it.

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:22.065
And... Voila! :)

00:03:22.712 --> 00:03:28.340
What I have on my phone display
I get to have on my big screen TV.

00:03:29.532 --> 00:03:33.346
I'm using this either to browse the internet

00:03:34.927 --> 00:03:39.137
As you can see there's no lag
The rotation works very fast

00:03:39.777 --> 00:03:46.472
and there is real time streaming on the TV.

00:03:47.165 --> 00:03:56.476
Or you could present a PowerPoint presentation
and you don't need to carry a projector.

00:03:57.608 --> 00:04:02.856
wherever you go, if you have
this dongle and an HDMI TV

00:04:02.856 --> 00:04:07.323
just hook them up and play
the presentation from your phone.

00:04:07.388 --> 00:04:11.293
What I love most about this setup is...

00:04:12.778 --> 00:04:13.870
the... GAMING :)

00:04:14.576 --> 00:04:19.526
I get to have real time mirroring
of the games I play on my phone

00:04:20.072 --> 00:04:25.990
And as you are aware there
are planty of titles to choose from.

00:04:26.693 --> 00:04:34.557
If you are used with the controls you
don't have to look at the phone anymore.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.304
You just play it like you'd play it on a console.

00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:45.048
That's about it... About the Samsung
AllShare Cast dongle.

00:04:46.034 --> 00:04:48.169
