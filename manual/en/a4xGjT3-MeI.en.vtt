Best location ever, it's right in the middle
of the city, we've got everything around us.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.190
Plenty of variety when it comes to food and
shopping and everything else,

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.410
so yeah it's good it you've got a nice long
lunch break!

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.900
I just love the view, it's just awesome, I
just love it!

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.160
It's really good that it's near a train line,
from the street - you can't get more central

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.300
than that.
We've got two stations so five minutes walk

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.550
to either one.
We're really close to Flagstaff station, less

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.660
than a block away and we're also close to
Melbourne Central as well.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.299
I love the atmosphere of the campuses, the
students I've studied with have all been fantastic.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.369
The teachers are good because they have industry
length and experiences.

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:56.720
They're there to help, they're there to teach,
you're there to learn and they're just great,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.720
they're really good.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.050
Very encouraging, they've got plenty of time
for you and make sure you get through

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.580
There's a lot more support here than at other
universities, the lecturers actually have

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.130
time to
sit down and have a chat with you.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.362
The osteopathy course is actually a very hands
on course, you've got 5 years of experience

00:01:16.362 --> 00:01:19.000
when you step out of that door.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.460
We're really lucky because it is a law campus
and it's really tailored to us, so we've got

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.000
the Moot court - And I appear on behalf of
the prosecution.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.550
There's pretty state-of-the-art type of studios,
they've all been really well set up.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.451
The best thing about the course is working
in the design studio, where we get to work

00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:37.820
on projects for real life clients.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.810
We get to experience the treatments as well
as perform the treatments which is excellent,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.070
it's a luxurious course to study!

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.690
I've made heaps of friends at uni.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.680
They're a fantastic bunch, I think there's
more than a couple that I will probably be

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.030
lifelong friends with.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.690
Everyone's really nice and welcoming, everyone's
really warm and friendly, so I think it's

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.460
really awesome here quite honestly.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.340
At the moment I'm studying 2 days a week.
That's one of the beauties of this place is

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.340
the flexibility and the time.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.280
You can do different amounts of units per
semester.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.300
There's a lot of mature age students like
me, so we have this kind of love of wanting

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.439
to be here because it's something we've wanted
to do all our lives and finally get here.

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:25.829
We're new, we're young - the extra resources
and the extra support are all there.

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.349
It gets us ready for the real world, it gives
us a good feel about what's really out there.

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.939
I think it's the best course for you, if you
do want to work hard and you want to commit

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.969
yourself and if you enjoy the course then
you'll go far.
