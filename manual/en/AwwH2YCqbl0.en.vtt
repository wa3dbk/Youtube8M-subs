00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:05.549
What's up, everybody?

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.549
Justin Hays from SuperhumanPurusits.

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:12.250
And today I wanted to go over self myofascial
release on the bottom of your foot.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.250
And we're going to use just the balls in front
of me here today.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.650
I got a tennis ball, a lacrosse ball and a
golf ball.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.630
The tennis ball is more of an entry-level
device, it's a lot softer and has some give

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.630
to it.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.989
The lacrosse ball, same dimensions as the
tennis ball but quite a bit harder, and so

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.800
it would be a step up, you'd graduate from
the tennis ball to the lacrosse ball.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.059
And the golf ball is obviously way more focal
than these two and a bit harder.

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.690
So they all three serve their purpose, can
go over them real quick.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.700
Let's get to the floor.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.719
So we'll start off here with the tennis ball.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.769
The tennis ball, obviously not nearly as hard
as the lacrosse ball or the golf ball, it

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.679
has quite a bit more give to it, so it's a
good entry level starting point.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.109
This is, when you start doing myofascial release
on your foot, this would be the guy to start

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:05.790
with before you graduate to anything that's
a little bit heavier and applies more pressure.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.740
Take the tennis ball and you roll it from
your heel all the way to the ball of your

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.740
foot here.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.950
And you can invert and avert your ankle and
this will kind of produce, it will give you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.530
access to different muscles down there in
your feet, you'll feel it in different areas.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.690
You can also point your toe down and pull
it back.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.970
And then like I said, as a tennis ball becomes,
it will start to feel soft, it won't produce

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.210
the same pressure and you won't have the same
results, so you need to graduate to something

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.410
like the lacrosse ball.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.430
And so the lacrosse ball, same principles
here.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.970
When you find something that, you know, a
trigger point, you think you've identified

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.660
something, what you want to do is just stick
on that area and if you need to, I kind of

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.340
will, so I'll lift this front leg and lean
over and apply a little bit more pressure

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.880
down on this foot at times, and that can kind
of help out and dig in quite a bit more.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.770
The golf ball, obviously harder than both
of the two balls I just previously used.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.010
It's also extremely focal, you know, it's
smaller, so it definitely applies more pressure.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.890
And I really like this in the areas of the
balls of my feet up here close to my toes

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.560
and stuff because it really kind of gets in
between, in between areas that you can't get

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.560
with the other two balls.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.590
So it also is, like I said, significantly
harder, so you've got to be a little bit more

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.100
gentler until you've become accommodated to
the pressure from the other two balls.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.470
So that's it for everything on the floor,
guys, hope this helps.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.819
Talk to you soon.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.360

general feedback, please feel free to leave
