00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:04.000
university which is a catholic
institution in cincinnati has decided

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.620
that they will stop finding about
contraception for their employees to

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.759
their insurance plan

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.739
apparently they have this insurance plan
that covered contraception for quite

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:17.559
awhile and it was never an issue until
the au bon administration had decided

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:21.489
that it would force all employers ought
to have insurance that covers

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.920
contraception for their employees now
hot

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.720
michael graham who is the president of
the university said that you know

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.960
all bob miles uh... proposal made him

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.929
reflect on their health insurance plan
and decide cap

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:39.429
they want to cover a contraception soap
screw you employees when you take that

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.480
away and of because of this

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.450
style

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.600
i feel like they're taking something
that competitor woman's health and their

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.440
media lee turning it into something
political right obviously university had

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.090
no problem with this before but this is
your attempted chilling opposition to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.390
the obama administration so you're gonna
make your female employees suffer

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.630
ido

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.860
obviously agree with that right

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.049
i mean i don't know maybe i'm not clear
it up

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.229
but what are your thoughts on this for
one thing that i would disagree is that

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.720
i don't think they're just showing
opposition to the obama administration i

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.329
think that this is them saying look
you're trying to change

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:19.810
how we control are women

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.240
we still control are women that we can
take away any of the stuff that we've

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.730
been so generous enough to give them in
the past

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.440
now we still control them that's that's
a part of our religion we're an exercise

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.570
it and look at the even if it means

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.390
sinking alf plan in the middle the
wouldn't you don't even know really do

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.740
that's up from the quoted

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.460
to that effect don't wouldn't say they
will

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.080
with that the planet

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.900
that the religious leaders say if that's
what's happened religious liberty

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.840
is making them cover something that many
do-or-die cover

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.400
it is an extremely year to cover it

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.860
wide what do they need the year for to
add that coverage they can't think about

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.280
the moral qualms of all women being able
to control or mold levels in

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.810
it's bs they're they're just showing

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.200
control over women

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.049
any woman that uh... faculty working
their they should be a wake-up call they

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.319
should think about

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.969
both their appointment and probably the
religious of standing i would think

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.959
absolutely and by late look

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.530
i feel horrible for these employees
right but at the same time just said

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.239
still by august first first your shirts
company will cover for you

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:22.719
in mississippi
