00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:07.440
Today we test the Skoda Octavia RS with the 2.0 TSI 220 hp engine.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:16.080
Cruise control is set to 94 km/h which gives, in fact, 90 km/h on DriftBox.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:25.200
In sixth gear the engine speed is about 1750 rpm.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.280
Air conditioning is turned on and set to 22 degrees Celsius and the fan operates in first gear.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.320
The Drive Mode Selection is set to ECO mode.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.280
After five kilometers trip average fuel consumption is 5.8 l / 100km.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.040
We finish our measurement. After 11 kilometers average fuel consumption at 90 km/h is 5.3 l/100km.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:08.640
This time the cruise control is set at 146 km / h which is equivalent to 140 km / h on DriftBox.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:19.520
Engine speed at 140 km/h in sixth gear is about 2600 rpm.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.680
Average fuel consumption after about 6 kilometers is 8.7 l/100km.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:37.200
Behind us eleven km and average fuel consumption is 8.6 l / 100km.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.880
Now let's test average fuel consumption on a cold motor.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.400
After the first kilometer, average fuel consumption is 15.6 l / 100km.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.560
After two kilometers average fuel consumption is 12 l / 100km.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.000
After three kilometers average fuel consumption is 10 l / 100km.

00:01:57.318 --> 00:01:59.318
Yet the result after five kilometers ...

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.480
... average fuel consumption is 9.2 l / 100km.
