Hey everyone, Jeff Salzenstein here,

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.740
and in today’s video, we’re going to talk about, actually, a question that I got from a fan,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.940
and first of all, I want to thank all of you. I get

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.640
tons of emails every day, and

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.120
I’m loving this community that’s growing

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.140
so many great questions, so many great

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.860
people that want to get better at tennis, and I’m very passionate about helping you.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.440
So, getting right into what you just saw,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.180
I got this question that most traditional coaches are teaching players.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.920
To swing low to high on their forehand.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.120
Now, I’m a big fan of going low to high

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.820
when you’re learning tennis and on certain forehands, but,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.140
even for beginners, even for intermediates, and especially for advanced players,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.060
you want to be able to drive the ball with the tight spin,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.200
and when you do that, you’re going to swing,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.820
and the racket goes more across the body.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.840
So, you’re going to focus on going across the body with your swing

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.020
instead of low to high.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.040
So, I’m going to go ahead and demonstrate that one more time for you, but basically,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.880
the key to driving the ball

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.920
is to swing across the body,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.860
and notice that my hand is going, going to turn

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.960
when I swing.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.880
It’s not going to stay like this, and it’s not going to stay like this.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.220
It’s actually going to relax and turn,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.560
and then I add the last element of catching the racket, which we’ll do in another video someday.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.700
So, I’m just going to go back and do this again,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.140
and we’ll see you in a second.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.880
So, as you can see, in that video, what you want to focus on

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.880
is swinging across your body

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.520
and turning the hand. That way, you can get a tight spin,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.400
you can get the ball to go low over the net.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.800
And, let me know what you think, I mean I’d love to hear your comments.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.020
We always get great comments and questions from

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.860
all of you, and we’ll talk to you soon. Thanks again.
