00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.269
Hyperlinks in PowerPoint act just like the
links you find online.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.390
They have their own display text for example,
"USA.gov Retirement Resources", and also an

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.800
email address, web page, or some other location
that they're linked to.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:34.650
I'd like show you how to turn text into a
link starting here.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.380
All you have to do is go to the Insert tab...
then Hyperlink.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.640
In this dialog box, you can see the text the
link is going to display and change it if

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.769
you need to.

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.159
You can also enter a web address here.

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.510
When you're done, click OK, and the text turns
into a hyperlink.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.030
Why don't we try linking to something else,
maybe an email address?

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.370
I think it would be nice if new employees
could click this person's name to contact

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.500
Human Resources.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.530
This time, I'm going to right-click the text,
and choose Hyperlink here instead of going

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.460
to the Insert tab.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:27.580
Now click Email Address, and just enter the
recipient's email address here.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.830
Other options include linking to a file on
your computer.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.920
For example, I'd like to be able to pull up
the Employee Benefits Guide, which happens

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.710
to be a Word document.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.810
Again just right-click, go to Hyperlink, and
choose Existing File or Web Page.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.640
Here you can navigate to any file on your
computer, and double-click the one you want

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.250
to create a link.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.440
Keep in mind: Your link to another file may
not work if you plan to send your PowerPoint

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.570
out, or present it on a different computer.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.930
Make sure you have a copy of the linked file
on the computer you're using to present, and

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.000
always test your hyperlinks before giving
a presentation.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.250
To test, just right-click, and go to Open
Hyperlink.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.370
Looks like this one's working just fine!

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.660
Other things you can access by right-clicking
any of your links: the ability to edit the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.530
hyperlink, or remove it.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.510
There's one more type of link I'd like to
try, at the beginning of my presentation where

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.840
I have sort of table of contents.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.540
I'd like the viewer to be able to click on
an item to go to that place in the presentation.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.160
And instead of making the text the hyperlink,
we can use the whole shape itself.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.870
This way the viewer can click anywhere on
the shape to jump to that slide.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.700
Let's start with "About Ad Works".

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:58.190
Just select the shape, right click, and select
hyperlink.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.280
Now to link this to another slide, go to Place
in This Document, and you can choose from

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.290
a list of slides with a little preview to
the right.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.720
Here's the one we want to link to.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.360
Keep going until your table of contents is
complete.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.010
And don't be afraid to get creative - there
are lots of things you can do with the ability

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.890
to link to other slides.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.510
Let's try out one of these out in Slide Show
View.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.510
See that?

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.099
I was just on slide 2 and now I'm on slide
11!

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.680
These hyperlinks are going to be a big help
to me, and also to anyone who views the presentation

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.459
on their own.
