its awesome it's called some people
called bulletproof coffee

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.569
depending like a brand name
but just different things that I do not

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:56.129
show you what's up so

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.659
over to start with we use a Vitamix you
have a mix for everything

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.139
the greatest greatest tool in the
kitchen by far so

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:07.590
recertified makes and then I got the
coffee started so we're going to get

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.970
some

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.720
black coffee and for coffee I use a
obviously bulletproof a soluble approved

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.050
but

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.300
I use grumpy mule your because I
really like the name

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.850
and its organic and fair-trade com and
it is great

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.660
so use that you the stovetop percolator

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.200
on it's really like Wat case it's it's a
little bit stronger

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.570
but being in Europe now that's three
like coffee so

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.130
we'll start with that sorry love coupled
up

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.900
just for that

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.180
in to you the Vitamix container

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.180
per check so you got that in there

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.990
awesome throughout that in

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.230
then the next thing greedy and is
grass-fed butter

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.480
organic grass-fed butter on found this
great place is called a phone call

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.500
in the UK and they deliver us fresh
vegetables forget my group in your from

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.280
at Saregama butter from and they have a
deal with this dairy

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.010
unbelievable there is a the cowards
their grass fed

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.660
they're treated holistically on just
blows my mind that this is actually

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.080
helping so it's it's awesome

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.330
and it's called berkeley farm so show to
my

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.850
my favorite little girl it there on
provides every day ever

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.170
so what we do is take grass-fed butter
calls for a few

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.340
like a big tablespoon I just gonna take
a take a good chunk of it

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.650
and people are gonna get scared they're
gonna think they're getting fat

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.420
but this remember that doesn't make you
fat

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.600
sugar makes you fat so get that in your
coffee

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.940
that's gonna substitute cream as well if
you like cream in your coffee

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.810
on this is this is way better taste way
better

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.330
and to healthy fats really good for you

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.390
so then Nexus that brain octane oil such
the MCT oil

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.120
on it's great for just mental clarity
are so many different benefits i mean

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.650
you can go on and on their stands videos
just about that

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.190
on help with metabolism helps a lot of
things and what it essentially what

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.600
happens is the biter

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.340
works as a vehicle to get the NCT on

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.510
up to your brain that helps his brain
functions and just gets around your body

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.480
so the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.320
butter is really the vehicle so on what
this calls for as one tablespoon

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.920
