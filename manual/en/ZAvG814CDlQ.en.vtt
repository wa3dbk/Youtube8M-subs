00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Today, I believe, will be very-very hot battles. It's probably one of the best Russian Cyphers.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I really don't know how the levels are going to be, but I'm sure whoever wins will deserve it.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I participated in BC One myself and I know it's a very difficult competition because of the pressure.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.000
I want to see new things, more creativity, more originality, more perfection.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I'm very impressed by Russian b-boys, especially with the creativity and originality. I never seen so many original movements and patterns. 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.000
I travel all over the world and I see a lot of dancers. And I can definitely say that Russians are doing something right. They are original. 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:02:05.000
Whatever their influences are, you can tell that they are not too influenced by everybody else.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:26.000
I really felt that the Russian Red Bull BC One Cypher had some of the best b-boys that I've judged so far in this season.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.500
Cheerito... yeah, he was crazy!

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.500
He listens to the music and everything is perfect, no mistakes.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.500
For b-boy Cheerito, I think the winning strategy was his execution and his fire. 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
He has a lot of energy and you could see it in his eyes that he was determined to win and take it all the way.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Cheerito was very consistent and strong all the way through.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
In final battle with the two b-boys, you could tell that they had a very different style from the rest of top-16. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
They had a lot of original moves.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Okay, judges... B-boy Cheerito! Yeah! 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Great respect to b-boy Gun, second place, bro!

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
First, I am very pleased because there was a live webcast. My parents were watching, my girlfriend was watching, guys from the crew were watching.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000
It's the coolest feeling. And of course, I just happened to move through all the battles with energy. I've been recharged.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Many thanks to all the guys who were dancing today, the first round was great! 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Thanks to everybody who came and thanks to everybody who dances because they are promoting the culture. Peace!
