00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Yo!

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Where my red lines at?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.869
I picture Frank Lloyd Wright, 
while you think I'm Mike Brady

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.910
And engineers devour our work and call us crazy

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.500
We got rounded specs, but they ain't for looks

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.000
It's from staring at our screens and all those
history books

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.980
We turn an empty space, into a world of possibility

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.500
Maintaining privacy, and tranquility

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.040
Graduate from school, about to change the world,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.620
But I'm stuck designing thrones with a clockwise swirl

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.000
We're architects oh! With creative flair

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.620
Re-designing the world, from buildings to chairs

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.379
It's a daily grind, but we love what we do

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.000
A satisfying job giving you a better view

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.500
Lord of the Elmer's, and king of scraps

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.059
Making models our of paper, and bottle caps

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.570
I'm a master of BIM, making lines with dashes,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.500
Except I'll lose my mind, if Revit crashes

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.500
GREEN is gold, and LEED is big,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.720
Know the golden triangle, and learn your trig

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.520
Challenge the formula, push the envelope,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.280
Put more glazing over here. That looks really dope!

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.530
We're architects oh! With creative flair

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.530
Re-designing the world, from buildings to chairs

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.300
It's a daily grind, but we love what we do

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.030
A satisfying job giving you a better view

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.689
Crank the A/C in the office just to stay awake,

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.000
Espresso and Red Bull till I get a stomach ache

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.229
With our cotton blazers high, we have a sense of style,

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.500
But to the rest of the world we just point and smile

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.960
I read code books, while I'm on vacation

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.200
Take pictures of, my latest creation

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.200
We wear black and gray, with no logos on our threads

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.609
So many sleepless nights we're like the walking dead

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.609
We're architects oh! With creative flair

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:53.609
Re-designing the world, from buildings to chairs

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.380
It's a daily grind, but we love what we do

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.000
A satisfying job giving you a better view

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.630
Got so many scales, myswell (might as well) call me a fish

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.249
Does your lawn look boring? I'll design you a dish

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:08.500
Starchitects, no!, call them Hollywood actors,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.950
Cause they can't deal with general contractors

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.000
Spec book wasn't clear so I got these RFI's

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.390
Clients making changes that we all despise.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.230
We got better FORM, than Jordan's jump shot

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.730
And designs that function like a million dollar yacht.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.400
We're architects oh! With creative flair

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.230
Re-designing the world, from buildings to chairs

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.810
It's a daily grind, but we love what we do

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.500
A satisfying job giving you a better view

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.000
I'm an architect, "Oh you mean like Ted Mosby?"
