00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.130
The head's not stuffed yet but you can kind
of imagine what this will look like when the

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.950
head is filled with stuffing. And you know
we kind of got the snout on already so that

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.950
is good. A little three dimensional snout
going on. So now it's just a matter of putting

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.270
the rest of parts on and stuffing them. So
you could do the ears next if you want. I

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.710
am going to do the eyes next just because.
You could do the ears first then the eyes.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.620
I am going to go ahead and do the eyes. I
have got these plastic animal eyes that are

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.781
used for making stuffed animals. You can get
them at the sewing store, hobby store, and

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:35.219
craft store. They kind of have these little
ridges on the back that look like screw threads.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.149
They are not really screw threads. But basically
you just have to kind of poke these into the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.519
fabric. Cut a little hole if you need to or
you can just probably with the sock I might

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.600
just be able to poke it through some of the
threads. And then you have this other part

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.539
that will come with the eye it's kind of like
the I guess sort of like the snap or something

00:00:52.539 --> 00:01:00.899
like that. And then once you've put one into
the other one on the front of the fabric you

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.000
know where the eye is and one on the back
side then you pinch them together. It will

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.470
make a really nice tight fit and probably
won't come out once you kind of get that together

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.580
so. And again it's time to make an artistic
decision about the placement of these eyes.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.850
So whatever you have them close together.
You know you can have them kind of far apart.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.060
I'm going to kind of put these sort of close
together. But you know how close do you want

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.990
them to the snout? Do you want them high up?
It just gives them a different look depending

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.250
on where you put them you know. Two eyes close
together you know far apart you now high low.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:44.360
So I am going to maybe do them you know maybe
I don't know maybe about an half an inch above

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.870
the snout. Let me try that. So I am going
to kind of screw this, not really screw it

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.890
in but I'm just kind of pushing it through
the threads here. You can kind of see how

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.870
that's working out. This is now the inside
of it. There it goes. Okay. Check my placement.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:11.690
That looks pretty good. It looks really cute.
So I am going to go back there to where the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.580
other side of the eye is. I lost it. Remember
we are doing everything through the hiney

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.390
hole of this little monkey. But anyway. There
we go, got it. Going to put the little snap

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.410
on, I am going to put the flat side against
it and I am going to squeeze. You are going

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:38.630
to hear it snap. Come on. There it goes. Snap
one. Is one time enough? Let's see if one

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.440
time is enough. Probably want to go a couple
of more times to get it as tight as you can.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:51.450
But we've got an eye on our monkey now. Let
me see if I can get one more snap out of it.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.350
There it went a little bit. So there we go.
And once you have these eyes they are pretty

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.849
permanent once you have them in. You just
kind of there we go but there is another snap.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.910
So there it is that eye is not going anywhere.
One eyed sock monkey. So we are going to put

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.069
the other one in and do the ears after that.
