00:00:01.771 --> 00:00:08.016
Did you know that the castanets used in Spanish folk dancing 
 have been dated back as many as 10,000 years?

00:00:08.147 --> 00:00:11.185
The particular style used today can be tuned for different pitches.

00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:22.094
Within the walls of New York’s Modern Museum of 
 Art, dancers have filled the expansive atrium

00:00:22.094 --> 00:00:25.608
performing a brand new work from French choreographer Boris Charmatz.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.385
“Musée de la Danse: Three Collective Gestures” was a three-weekend affair,

00:00:30.385 --> 00:00:33.628
each installment adding life and movement to the empty halls.

00:00:33.628 --> 00:00:38.261
With 25 simple, repetitive movements set in unique patterns on the 24 dancers,

00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:43.180
Charmatz’s choreography created interesting and unexpected synchronous moments.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.415
How awesome to see the museum involving art 
 that can’t be hung in a gallery!

00:00:47.953 --> 00:00:55.019
I know summer is over, but as temperatures drop, Tim 
 Milgrams latest is sure to warm your dancin' soul.

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.257
Performed and choreographed by Kento Mori, Mona Berntsen, Hefa Tuita and Randi Kemper.

00:01:00.257 --> 00:01:05.521
"Jammin" takes you from the streets to the 
 beach with a unique blend of styles.

00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:09.243
It's colorful, it's personality and for me, it's different.  Check it out…

00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:34.486

Former So You Think You Can Dance finalist Cole 
 Horibe is bringing his martial arts experience

00:01:53.164 --> 00:01:57.100
to David Henry Hwang’s new off-Broadway show, Kung Fu.

00:01:57.104 --> 00:02:03.040
Landing the lead role of Bruce Lee, Cole with be reunited 
 with another familiar So You Think You Can Dance face,

00:02:03.036 --> 00:02:06.260
as Sonya Tayeh has been selected to choreograph the show.

00:02:06.263 --> 00:02:12.270
This ought to be a kick-ass production! Which by 
 the way is opening next February 2014…

00:02:12.693 --> 00:02:18.010
It’s part of the job as a dancer to have the 
 willingness to try anything the choreographer asks of you, right?

00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:22.300
Marie Chouinard really challenged her dancers with her newest work, “Gymnopedies”,

00:02:22.302 --> 00:02:25.320
by making them learn to play the music they would be dancing to!

00:02:25.323 --> 00:02:27.930
Considering it “choreography for the fingers”,

00:02:27.927 --> 00:02:32.560
Chouinard had each dancer learn to play one of the 
 three piano pieces being used for the work.

00:02:32.558 --> 00:02:35.960
None of them had any prior piano experience, but with enough practice

00:02:35.962 --> 00:02:40.070
they managed to play their own music in performance. Pretty impressive!

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:45.580
My song pick of the week is the 
 unlikely duo of Lady Gaga and R.kelly

00:02:45.581 --> 00:02:49.110
with a new track off her Artpop album called "Do what you want"

00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:55.670
I'm digging the synth heaving melody mixed with R. 
 Kelly's R&amp;amp;B vocals and Gaga's "Aguleria" like riffing.

00:02:55.667 --> 00:03:00.960
Weather their singing to their haters or lovers, this club 
 banger definitely gives you something to dance to.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.770
Get creative in the studio and send us what you come up with.

00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:09.000
You know when the music speaks to you and you just 
 wanna dance to the beat of your own drum?

00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:14.000
It’s a sensation that this adorable little tap dancer definitely 
 felt when she got under those bright lights

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:15.420
and she ran with it!

00:03:15.423 --> 00:03:19.100
Though the other dancers tried to keep up with their “Broadway Baby” choreography,

00:03:19.101 --> 00:03:24.050
this little starlet definitely stole the show with 
 the heartfelt abandon of her unique interpretation.

00:03:27.657 --> 00:03:31.530
Amongst her accomplishments, this week’s plugger Stephanie Gevone Heckert

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.210
taught dance and music to children in Germany, Holland, Poland, Sweden, and China

00:03:36.213 --> 00:03:39.490
as a part of the International Music Outreach Tours.
