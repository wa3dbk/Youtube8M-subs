00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.250
Hello and welcome to my Mists of Pandaria
Affliction Warlock quick look.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.820
In this video I'm going to try to explain
the changes and rotation differences between

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.840
the current Affliction skillset and the one
implemented in the Mists beta.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.020
In the background will be my Warlock going
through the rotation described later in the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.020
video.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.080
I haven't spent too much time in front of
the target dummies, so the rotation is sloppy

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.860
and I let a few debuffs fall off here and
there.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.340
Up on the screen are the tooltips of your
major spells, taken directly from the beta

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.340
client.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.779
Bog-standard tooltips, nothing fancy.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.010
We'll start with the stuff that hasn't really
changed.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.410
Corruption, Unstable Affliction, and Agony
are still the main DoT effects, and have minor

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.700
changes.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.090
Agony's scaling effect now is a stacking debuff
that deals more damage with more stacks, and

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.870
is refreshed with however many stacks you
had on it before you refreshed.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.050
Fel Flame still is an instant cast, but now
increases Corruption's length as well as Unstable

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.379
Affliction's.

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.269
Curse of the Elements is still a fire and
forget magic damage debuff, and Life Tap is

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.350
still the same "exchange mana for health"
button it's always been.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.690
Soul Burn is basically the same spell as it
used to be- pop it, it consumes a soul shard,

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.320
and grants an additional effect to a few of
your spells.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.890
The only really notable effect is Soulburn:
Soulswap, which applies all your shadow DoTs

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.530
to a target, saving about two GCDs.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.030
Drain Soul is still a channel execute spell,
but has a new effect once you hit execute

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.610
phase that I'll detail in a minute.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.700
Finally, Dark Soul is the new Demon Soul,
and is losing it's per demon effect to just

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.150
give a straight spell haste buff for affliction.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.560
It's not rocket science, and if you've played
a warlock for any length of time in the past

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.649
expansion, these spells come as no surprise.

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.040
The real treat comes from our new spell and
the changes to soul shards.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.229
Ok, first thing's first.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.880
Affliction warlocks no longer use Shadow bolt
as our filler spell.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.460
We have a completely new spell: Malefic Grasp.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.320
It's a channeled spell that ticks about once
a second for a small amount of damage, but

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.630
the meat of the spell comes from it's secondary
effect.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.229
While you are channeling Malefic Grasp, all
of your Damage over Time spells have their

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.510
duration increased by 100% and their tick
time decreased by 100%.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.510
Basically, while you channel this spell, your
DoTs deal damage 100% faster.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.820
tick times of 2 seconds become just 1.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.770
The duration increase is to offset the decreased
tick times so that your DoTs still have the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.600
same amount of time on them during the channel
that they had when you started the channel.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.650
This secondary effect also gets applied to
drain soul when your target is in the execute

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.970
phase, therefore replacing malefic grasp as
your filler once the target hits 20% health.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.030
As for the other major change, Soul Shards
have been overhauled again.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.070
Only Aff locks get access to them this time,
along with their attendant spell, Soul Burn.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.280
You'll notice in the video a few green orbs
around my character's head; those are my soul

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.280
shards.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.870
Normally, they are a nice purple and look
more like crystals, but they can be modified

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.120
by a new glyph to look like Kael'thas's green
orbs.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.209
I've applied the glyph in this video so that
the orbs are easier to see against the purple

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.810
and blue of the Exodar.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.169
Soul shards are regenerated through an out
of combat passive effect, in combat through

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.950
two ticks of drain soul, or through Nightfall.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.280
Nightfall is a passive effect off of corruption,
as it is in Cata, but now has a 10% chance

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.549
to regenerate Soul Shards.

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.440
However, nightfall cannot proc more than 5
times every minute.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.630
Now here's where things get interesting.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.980
Soul shards are spent by casting Haunt, which
is now a 40% spell damage increase that lasts

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.660
8 seconds.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.090
This means that you have to spend at least
7.5 shards a minute to keep 100% uptime on

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.090
Haunt.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.380
Remember that the Nightfal proc, our main
way of regenerating soul shards, only regenerates

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.630
5 soul shards per minute.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.751
This means, that with perfect play and perfect
procs, you have a deficit of about 3 shards

00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:50.660
per minute.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.090
If we take into account the time putting debuffs
up on the target and letting Agony stack up

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.871
and assuming you have the glyph which increases
the shard count from 3 to 4, this means that

00:03:59.871 --> 00:04:03.310
it takes about 2 minutes before you run out
of shards.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.470
ONce this happens, your only way of regenerating
shards beyond the 5 per minute is letting

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.630
drain soul tick twice.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.500
This introduces an interesting choice- whether
to ignore the 40% increased damage and only

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.019
cast haunt when you can, or to cast Drain
Soul and loose out on the faster DoT tick

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.410
time of Malefic Grasp.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.850
Now, on to the rotation that I've stumbled
upon.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.090
Start with putting your DoTs and debuffs on
a target manually, then channel Malefic Grasp

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.930
until Agony is at 10 stacks.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.290
Cast Haunt, and then go back to Malefic Grasp.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.530
Refresh Corruption and Unstable Affliction
with two Fel Flame casts, as two casts will

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.870
refresh both to back to around maximum duration
while dealing damage you wouldn't get otherwise.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.570
Refresh Agony when you have to, making sure
to only put up haunt if all of your dots have

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.880
at least 10s of time left so that you can
channel Malefic Grasp for the entire duration

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.090
of the Haunt debuff without having to refresh
your dots in the middle of it.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.780
Cast Drain Soul during the execution phase
or only when you have no dots that need refreshing

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.820
and haunt is not up AND you have no Soul Shards.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.680
Do not cancel the channel on Odd numbered
ticks.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.100
Now with this rotation, I've found that I
haven't had to cast drain soul all that much,

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.870
as Nightfall usually proc'ed when I was refreshing
my Dots.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.780
Combine this with movement and I can see a
few fights where you wouldn't need to cast

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.930
Drain Soul beyond the execute phase.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.360
However, at higher levels of play, I can see
the 5 shards/minute becoming a problem, and

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.940
the player will need to have better judgement
on when to cast Drain Soul and when to ignore

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.970
Haunt.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.940
Overall though, while the Affliction rotation
has a few built in kinks to it, playing with

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.000
it feels smooth and a lot less like whack-a-mole
of previous expansions.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.060
Definitely a win for the class and a load
of fun to play.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.640

My name is Vorpal Stick, and this has been
my Affliction Warlock Quick Look.
