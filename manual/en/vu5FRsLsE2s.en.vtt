00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The German car manufactures always keep an eye on each other

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
An example is the GLE Coupé in comparison with the X6

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But it also happens the other way around; BMW also keeps an eye on Mercedes-Benz

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
For example the 2-Series Active Tourer in comparison the the B-Class

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But that's not what it is about today

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Today we take a look at the new BMW X6

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In the near future we will drive the new Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupé

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But first we are going to try the new X6 and we do that with an M-Performance model

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The BMW X6 M50D!

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
That's a 3.0 six in line diesel engine with 381 hp and 740 Nm 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Which results in 0 to 100 km/h sprint in 5.2 seconds

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And a limited top speed of 250 km/h

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
But we already know that engine from the new BMW X5 M50D which we have driven before

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But in this new X6 it's supposed to be even more dynamic and sportive

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Today we are going to find out what we thinkf of the new X6

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But more important; if it is ready for the arrival of the GLE Coupé

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
This new X6 is in comparison with the new X5 even more sportive

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Mainly due to the sloping roofline; the center of gravity is lower

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Thanks to that the X6 has less body roll and we can reach higher cornering speeds

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
The new X6 standard features an adaptive M-chassis

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It makes the car very fixed, especially when cornering

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The only downside of that chassis is that we miss a bit more comfort, the car is pretty rigid

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I can't adjust the chassis for more comfort

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I do can put the car in comfort mode but it refers to the steering and the gearbox

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.000
That M50D engine still is a nice piece of technique

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.000
A 3.0 liter diesel engine with three turbos, a great throttle response, 740 Nm!

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
If you step on the gas it goes in a straight line pretty fast

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The first turbo works till 1500 rpm

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The second turbo kicks in till 2700 tpm

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And the last turbo takes care of the full power, 381 hp and 740 Nm

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Good numbers for a diesel engine!

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.000
But we miss a bit emotion when driving this car; we do have a sound generator in sport mode

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But that doesn't give me goosebumps

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
They have set the bar high by putting an M-badge on the car and maybe that's why I'm a bit disappointed

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Besides that; the steering is also pretty light and we can make it less light but activating the sport mode

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
But then the gearbox is getting nervous because the steering and gearbox can't be set separately

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
That sloping roofline also gives it a distinctive look

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
The first generation of the X6 which was introduced in 2006...

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
That was a brutal looking car with a pretty aggressive look

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
This second generation has become a bit more friendly and easier too like

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
That's because the roofline is a bit longer

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
The previous X6 had a pretty big and high rear end 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
It's a clean looking car, also thanks to the rear- and headlights

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
These are now a bit more thin and a bit more clean

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And we also see that in the interior; it's a very clean car and it feels like coming home

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
We have a nice thin M-Performance steering wheel

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000
But like I said the steering is light and doesn't feel very sportive, it feels a bit too easy sometimes

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.000
You can order the new X6 M50D for €118.000,- but of course this isn't the only diesel version

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
For €86.000,- you can order an X6 30D with nearly 300 hp

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Then there is a 40D with 313 hp and of course there are a few gasoline version with the X6 M as top model

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
In short: there is an ample supply in a good outfit

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The X6 is ready for the arrival of the GLE Coupé so I say: bring it on!
