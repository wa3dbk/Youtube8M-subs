Hello this is Chef Sean Roe on behalf of expertvillage.com
and our first step in fish preparation is

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:13.590
making a nice marinade. As in all marinades
it is always compromise of one part of acid

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.380
which could be wine, vinegar, citrus juice,
and two parts oil which I'm going to be using

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.990
olive oil and a flavoring. So I'm going to
make a simple marinade of course this is completely

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.770
up to your own preference. With fish I always
like to use white wine. So we are going to

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.810
put a little white wine. I'm using a Sauvignon
Blanc which is a nice dry white wine. A little

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:50.690
lemon juice for a little more acid. We are
going to be using some virgin olive oil for

00:00:50.690 --> 00:01:00.280
our oil. Again the purpose of our marinade
is for the acid to help tenderize the product

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.650
and for the oil to maintain the fat content
and moisture. I'm going to put a little bit

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:16.000
of chili powder in here give it a little bit
of a kick. Some thyme which really works well

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:28.670
with fish. Some paprika
and of course always some salt and pepper.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:43.780
We are going to take that and whisk it around.
Make a temperately motion. We are going to

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:55.461
place one piece of our orange ruffy into a
baking dish and we are going to pour our marinade

00:01:55.461 --> 00:02:02.680
over it. Now with fish there is not a lot
of connective tissue or to break down so it

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.799
really marinade. It doesn't add to much of
the tenderness to it but it does add a lot

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.409
of flavor and moisture to it. You really have
to marinade fish for about 20-30 minutes.
