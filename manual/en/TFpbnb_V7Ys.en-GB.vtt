00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.980
BURP!

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.200
Drums...

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.440
Drums in the Deep!

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.020
... and I strayed out of thought and time...

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.240
Drums!

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.860
Drums in the Deep!

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.060
