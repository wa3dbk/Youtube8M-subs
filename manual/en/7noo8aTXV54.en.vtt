Hi this is Gary with MacMost Now.

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:08.690
On today's episode let's take a look at iTunes
Radio.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.880
iTunes Radio is a new service from Apple.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.750
It is available on your Mac, some PC's.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.130
It is on iOS devices running iOS 7 and even
on Apple TV's running the latest version 6.0

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.630
of the operating system.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.890
iTunes Radio is a streaming music service.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.310
The way it works is you give it a song or
an artist or a genre and it will play music

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.699
related to that song, artist, or genre.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.390
It may not necessarily play the song or artist
that you specified but it will play music

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.190
that kind of sounds like it and it may actually
then play that artist from time to time.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.580
It works very similar, as a matter of fact
pretty much exactly the same, to services

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.780
as Pandora and Last FM that have been around
for a while.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.860
So when you first upgrade to iTunes 11.1 on
your Mac you will be faced with something

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.110
like this where it tells you iTunes radio
is now available on your Mac and you can press

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.160
the start listening button.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.100
Once you go in there it will give you some
featured stations that are suggested and you

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.360
can also add a station here below.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.850
So let's start by adding our own station.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.060
Click that button there and type any artist
that you want in there.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.630
So type that and it will give me some suggestions
down here of specific songs that I may like

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.460
or I can just choose the artist overall here.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.390
It will create that radio station here and
then it will start playing music from it.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.810
You can see it streaming there.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.340
In this case it is going to play a song by
the Beatles right off the bat.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.049
But the next one may not be.

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.170
What this is basically doing is playing my
own personal radio station.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.570
Nobody else is hearing these songs at the
same time as I am.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.759
It is just streaming from Apple to my Mac
and playing this.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.090
Then when this song is done it will play another
song.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.829
I will see a history build up here.

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.180
I can actually skip some songs.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.970
I'm going to skip this song here and you can
see it will play another one.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.360
So I've got a new song playing here and I've
got a history of the songs I recently heard

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.360
right here.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.509
Now there are various other controls.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:11.650
For instance I can go back up to radio here
by clicking the X button there and you can

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.950
see there is the station and it is still playing
but I can jump to another station.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.079
I can also add another station here.

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:22.790
It even lets me turn whether or not you can
hear explicit lyrics on or off which is good

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.769
if you are listening in the car with your
kids.

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.760
That brings up the subject of listening to
iTunes Radio on an iOS device.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.180
On your iPhone or iPad or your iPod Touch,
as long as you have iOS 7 you can go into

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.180
the music app.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.609
There is no special app for iTunes Radio.

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.849
It is just inside the music app.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.620
You can see there along the bottom you've
got Radio.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.370
Tap that and you can see those featured stations
and your station.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.680
If you are using an iCloud account it's going
to sync your station between all your devices.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.980
So if you have set up a station on one you
should see it on the other.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.790
You can tap on a station there and it will
begin playing the music from there as you

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.790
can see.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.739
Now the cool thing about iTunes Radio is you
don't stop when you just create the station

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.769
by naming a song or an artist.

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.409
You can actually fine tune the station.

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:11.489
For instance, here in iOS if I tap the star
button you can see that I have some options.

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.980
I can hit play more like this or never play
this song.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.139
These will fine tune the station to get it
more that I want.

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:24.099
So if you choose an artist but say they have
songs over a wide range of genres you can

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.200
kind of basically use these two buttons.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.639
On Pandora it was thumbs up and thumbs down.

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.709
It is the same thing here where you are fine
tuning the station so you hear more of the

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:34.709
songs that you want.

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.849
Now iTunes Match is free but there is advertising
in it.

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.779
Every few songs or so an ad will play.

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:44.400
But you can get rid of the ads by simply being
a subscriber to iTunes Match.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.959
iTunes Match is a $25 a year service where
you can upload all of your music to Apple's

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.609
Cloud servers and then access them from any
of your devices.

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:59.840
So as a bonus for iTunes Match users they
also get ads removed from iTunes Radio.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.619
Now note that iTunes Radio is very new and
there is going to be, I'm sure, some changes

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:08.980
in the next few weeks and months as the system
matures.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.299
For one thing the iTunes Radio interface in
iTunes on the Mac isn't quite as robust as

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:21.459
the one in iOS but we can expect maybe when
Mavericks comes out later this year that iTunes

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.139
Radio there will have all the features that
iOS has.

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.389
Also there is a new client for Apple TV that
allows you to access iTunes Radio there as

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.389
well.

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.410
Now keep in mind this is streaming music service
so it is streaming over the internet.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.830
So you need some sort of internet connection.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.150
A typical WiFi connection at home or at work
should be fine for streaming music like this.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.270
But of course if you are mobile then it is
going to be more difficult.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.180
As a matter of fact iTunes is going to warn
you if you try to use it the first time over

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.120
a connection through your mobile carrier.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.620
People have been using other services over
a mobile carrier for a long time.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.810
I have and it really doesn't effect the band
width that much.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.689
So it is something you want to monitor if
you have a very restricted band width package.

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:04.750
So there is a quick look at iTunes Radio.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.630
Since it is free and easy to try whether you
are on a Mac, Apple TV or using an iOS device

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.949
just give it a go.

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.409
Create a few stations though, not just one.

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:16.490
No one station is going to fit all the different
types of music you like.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.639
It is better maybe to create a station that
is specific to a mood or an activity and create

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.289
a set of them so you can pick and choose between
iTunes radio stations.

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:27.550
Hope you found this useful.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:52.460
Until next time this is Gary 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:06:00.910
with MacMost Now.
