00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.970
supposed to

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.660
make sure the Wall Street firms that
want us to invest with them play by the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.420
rules

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.670

keep in mind

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.030
where it's coming from

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.710
maybe being you Wall Street firms isn't
such a terrible

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.809
look when I mean billion-dollar

exploited undocumented immigrants a real

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.720
chance

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.979

the retreating millions middle-class

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:05.990
investors

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.650

every

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:10.000
you are

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.049
deserves a fair shot

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.320
asking voters it seemed to me

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.120
on

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.340
I'm I think that is brilliant and it's
not just because

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.950
our fan its birth cert as less cuz I
Mehmet a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.130
and I'm just in there of course
reporting the news I because he takes

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.320
a disadvantage and he by the endeavor
had

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.480
almost there is it into an advantage
personal he's honest about it that's the

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.290
most important thing

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.040
to look I screwed up big time there's no
question about that and by then do that

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.030
he says look

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.400
a I tried to get the little guy a fair
shot which is totally true any could

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.880
prove

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.320
right and he's like can I also get a
fair shot from you

seen in a long time

with his already comfortable lead he
looks to be in really good shape your

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.380
