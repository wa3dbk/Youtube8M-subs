00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.180
Until yesterday

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.860
I couldn't feel it

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.840
But I can feel it is real that I'm here now

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.140
The children are wearing the clothes of Mosca

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.180
I felt the need of having at least 2 secret weapons for the show

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.860
They fit well with the concept of the show

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.360
On the stage

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.760
They could make the show more fun

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.420
And I thought they could make people think once more

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.520
WHat is your other secret weapon?

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.240
Hye Park!

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.020
I think I should go

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.980
Check the seating plan

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.380
Models are really important

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.000
But the guests should also be able to enjoy the show

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.820
So I have to take care of that

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.160
This is my father

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.500
Actually he is the head of the factory and she is his wife

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.960
He keeps giving me pocket money to have a go-together with everyone

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.280
I just kept whining to him

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.780
To make the samples faster

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.540
There is a so-called Mosca Agency

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.760
And she's a member haha

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.580
I am the ace of Mosca

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.460
I am the director of the agency

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.060
You were the first one to press 'like'

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.560
On the ‘Mosca’ TV clip

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.120
Oh, really?

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.520
I didn't know they check such thing...

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.080
Don't you also check?

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.540
I don't know how...

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.200
The rehearsal time and the mealtime for the models happen to conflict

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.360
I think they will have to skip a meal...

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.700
Did you eat something?

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.200
Food?

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.560
I didn't eat yet

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.600
But I have about 5 minutes to eat!

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.920
It's rehearsal time!

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:09.840
When the kids come about here

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.980
They were confused about where to go next

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.840
So please tell them where to go when they come here!

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.820
The kids are so cute!

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.420
When you are walking

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.660
You could walk a little more powerfully

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.040
When the show is over, let’s go out together!

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.880
Ok?

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.380
Yes!

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.860
Can I be called as Sis to them?

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.840
Ji-yun and Ji-an, are you ready?

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.740
You look really pretty today!

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.240
The waist support that you made for my concert was really nice

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.860
I could sing really well

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.460
What if people don't show up?

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.200
What do you want the guests to feel after watching your show?

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.640
I just want my clothes to be sold a lot!

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.880
The clothes are really pretty

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.380
Really?

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.460
With all your heart?

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.920
Thank god...

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.040
I’m nervous!

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.000
Let’s go!

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.320
When I was young fashion, was my fantasy

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.740
Imagining, drawing, and thinking

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.140
Were really fun

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.640
I wanted to make

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.940
The fantasy that I've dreamt of

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.620
So I launched the brand as soon as possible

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.100
There must be people

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.900
Who are not satisfied with the design that is already in the market

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.700
I would like to be one of the various choices

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.340
Rather than the major

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.660
Thank you for your hardship!

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.560
This color is 'pig pink'!

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.760
This is cute!

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.880
Usually photographers

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.760
Take photos of the models not me

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.560
When they say, “Please stand aside!”

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.660
Then even when I was retouching the clothes

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.520
I would always step aside...

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.840
But you're the hero!

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.460
No, I am not

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.300
My clothes are the hero

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.520
Not me

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.760
It was fun

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.460
The kids were cute

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:48.260
I have been showing you the preparation for Seoul Fashion Week through The ICONtv

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.220
Are you coming to see me for the 2015 F/W?

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.200
See you next time!

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.900
I gotta go!

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.240
I am getting calls again!

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.180
Hello?
