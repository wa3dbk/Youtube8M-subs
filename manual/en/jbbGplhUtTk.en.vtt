00:00:00.154 --> 00:00:00.320
[MUSIC]

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.560
My name is

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.440
Grant Robbins and I am a principal with
Robbins Reed.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.480
We started our company in 2007.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.750
My business partner and I both have oh,
about

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.810
twenty years of some experience each in
the construction industry.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.850
We had both worked previously for large
national

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.000
corporate construction companies and used
all sorts of,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.588
project management software, and just saw
so many

00:00:37.588 --> 00:00:41.500
pitfalls in them despite their costs or
complexities.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.380
And really we wanted a platform that
allowed us to

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.530
manage our projects in the simplest, most
user friendly way possible.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.850
[NOISE]

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.200
I've used Expedition, Prolog [NOISE]
custom built software.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.260
For some of the company's we'd [NOISE]
used before.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.340
Really, it didn't have all the features,
they would have some of

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.290
the features we wanted, but not

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.870
necessarily all the features that we
wanted.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.660
And then one of the biggest things that
Procore offered us was the ability to get

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.398
other users, subcontractors, consultants,
owners on board and access to it.

00:01:14.398 --> 00:01:19.590
That typically is much more cumbersome and
costly than a lot of the other platforms.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.420
I'd say the biggest success story was,
just how quickly

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.210
everyone was able to get up and running on
it.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.430
It didn't create a lot of downtime for our
employees at the time.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.820
They were able to get into it.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.900
I would say, the support system from
Procore was phenomenal.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.740
It really, really, and to this day, not
even, it just in

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.570
the initial training, but in the follow up
support phone calls and emails.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.810
Has really been one, I'd say they greatest
success stories,

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.940
cuz it allow us to be successful with the
software.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.440
And then, I think Procore also just really
enabled us to jump right in.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.752
Part of that is because of easy use, but
the easy

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:02.290
views for other people using it the
consultants and what not.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.650
You know, telling them hey we have the

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.420
software Procore, and it's gonna allow us
to

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.240
do RFIs, and answer submittals, and what
not, and they quickly are able to buy in.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.870
If they're not buying in and using it,
we're

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.140
only getting about 50% of the benefit out
of it.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.936
And the fact, that was, sort of seamless
really made Procore that much better.

00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:26.260
[SOUND]

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.990
In just a few trainings training sessions
with all of

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.199
our employees, and they were quickly up
and running on Procore.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.610
You I always do cost management in

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.620
our industry typically, through your
accounting software.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.200
And we were doing some of that.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.470
When the upgrades came, that was really
beneficial.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.005
And really you know, if you wanna call it
a surprise, was, was refreshing

00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:53.340
to see how well improved it was and how
great it's worked so far.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.250
I think that was a great upgrade for
Procore.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.810
The really, really great thing I have to
say is how well

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.510
the consultants and owners have embraced
it and been part of it.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.830
Punchless feature was one, we weren't
thinking end of job when we got

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.810
it, we were thinking beginning of job and,
you know, our advisers middles.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.240
But the how well Procore manages the
punchless

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.962
system was monumentally beneficial to
closing out projects.

00:03:19.962 --> 00:03:22.848
[NOISE]

00:03:22.848 --> 00:03:26.040
I would say, Procore saved us money mostly
in time.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.450
Having good project management software,
allows people

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.870
to be efficient in what they do.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.960
Time sensitivity in our business cuz it's
so much going on at any one point in time.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.130
Any time you can ex, expedite anything, or
minimize

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.400
duplication of effort, or double entry,
like that, really makes

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.880
people work more efficiently and Procor
definitely allows us to

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.205
reduce the amount of project management
time on specific activities.

00:03:52.205 --> 00:03:55.390
[NOISE]

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.840
RFI process I think would be one of the
largest ones.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.480
And then the punch list process.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.140
Punch list maybe even outweighs all of
them.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.270
That is one of those things that's project

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.520
engineer, project manager, superintendent,
whoever it might be

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.010
can spend hours upon hours on the phone,

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.040
email, sending things out, following up,
walking job sites.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.630
And to be able to distribute a well
organized list with

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.910
even photos or anything else along with
it, was just monumentally helpful.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.300
Not only in getting the information out to
people but,

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.890
making it extremely clear when they came
to the site.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.450
It was actually quite funny cuz you have
the Procore has the

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.100
ability to send out the automatic
reminders if they haven't done their work.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.735
And we would have subcontractors show up
to the job site

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:39.610
freaking out holding a piece of paper
going my boss told me

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.940
if I don't correct number 63, I'm fired,
cuz they're sick

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.280
of getting an email in their office, and
it would get done.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.300
The cost in change order tracking has been
very, very helpful as far as processing.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.170
Change orders and the, and subcontractor
requests

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.170
for proposals on the pricing and what not.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.230
To be able to roll those up.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.675
And email a lot of things directly from

00:05:02.675 --> 00:05:05.220
Procore to the owners has been very
beneficial.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.690
One of the surprisingly beneficial
features

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.140
is just the document storage, that

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.620
whole document section isn't one of the
things you think about up front.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.180
You know, we've got remote servers and all
that kind of stuff.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.760
But, it's just a very useful place to keep
data and

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.580
information and, and it's easy to access
for a lot of people.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.150
And in fact, that you can put the controls
and the, the

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.665
locks on certain things, to really manage
access is is really beneficial.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:38.770
[SOUND] We use Procore on our phones, the
app on the phone quite a bit.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.900
The Punch List feature I think you had
mentioned earlier.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.910
Gil, one of our project engineers,
actually gave

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.250
some feedback that helped get, put an
update out.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.480
And he was am, amazed, like these guys
fixed this based on my input.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.280
And so we're using the phone app and then
all of

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.710
our project managers, our superintendents
that are on site have iPads.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.060
And so, they're walking around with the
iPads, they're doing punch

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.670
lists from there, they can take photos of
things that they

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.740
may need to store or just project photos
and they're able

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.985
to access documents, whatever they might
need right there on the site.

00:06:09.985 --> 00:06:17.280
[SOUND] It's been something that has
helped maybe separate us from others.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.070
Procore's definitely been something that
we brag about to people.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.410
We bring it up to them.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.116
We've shown people the project the
software.

00:06:25.116 --> 00:06:29.450
Procore has been, I think beneficial in
people seeing how.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.930
Maybe potentially us, as a younger company
can bring a level

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.530
of sophistication to a job and, and
Procore definitely shows that.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.400
And it's easy to show that to people.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.440
They can immediately see the benefits to
it, and you can email them.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.480
I even emailed a potential client owner
access to the sandbox test site,

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.820
so they can jump on there and see what it
has to offer.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.680
And it's helped, and we now have a

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.710
couple owners that are using it fully
integrated, and

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.630
are, you know, potentially looking at
using it

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.650
just for their development purposes, and
things like that.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.510
We have a very complex business.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.710
I've been in it, long enough that I've
seen

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.780
a lot of the other software that's out
there.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.620
And it does everything you need Project
Management Software to do.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.800
As far as, you know, commercial
construction

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.320
projects and everything like that it
definitely

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:23.822
for a good price, great support and
functionality,

00:07:23.822 --> 00:07:26.100
you know, Procore is definitely the one to
recommend.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.330
We're happy with it.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.328
Every one of our employees is happy with
it.

00:07:34.328 --> 00:07:36.770
and, I think, you know, that speaks
volumes to

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.940
what, you know, Procore's built, and what
they have done.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.750
I think maybe one thing that's, I think
important to note

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.360
is the fact that you guys are always
looking to better it

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.090
and improve it, and there's constant
updates, they're not once a

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.610
year or every six months, they're as they
come about, and so.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.660
You know, as things are changing and

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.890
getting better, we're getting the benefits
of that.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.060
And you're not getting stung with costs
and upgrade fees and all of that.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.100
And Procore's done a phenomenal job of
getting that in our

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.198
hands so that we can implement it in the
field quickly.

00:08:06.198 --> 00:08:09.193
