Hey, this is Nate Storey at Bright Agrotech.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:15.960
Today is part of our nutrient series, I'm
going to talk quickly about sulfur.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.870
We have the primary plant nutrients and everyone
seeing this as NPK.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:27.220
Then our secondary macro nutrients are calcium,
magnesium and sulfur, we've already talked

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.600
about calcium, we've chatted about magnesium
pretty quickly, today I'm going to quickly

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.530
address sulfur because a lot of people are
concerned about it.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.600
Sulfur is present in our system in the form
of sulfate or SO4.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.170
Sulfate is just floating around our system
and the plants are taking it up, and they're

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.850
reducing it, and they're using it for things,
mostly things like building amino acids and

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.560
other chemicals that are very important to
the plant.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.260
This is how sulfur occurs in the system.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.850
Now you'll also notice that a lot of the amendments
that we've talked about over the years are

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.530
sulfate-based amendments.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.190
Potassium sulfate.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.800
In the last video, we talked about epsom salts,
magnesium sulfate.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.760
I've heard it from a lot of different people.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.409
I say "oh, well, use a potassium sulfate to
help supplement potassium" and they say "okay,

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.810
that's great".

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.200
I'm really, really worried about having too
much sulfate in my system.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.080
Today I'm going to talk a little bit about
that.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.729
Sulfur toxicity, sulfate toxicity and we're
just going to kind of debunk the idea that

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.510
sulfate is a problem in most aquaponics system.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.030
Sulfate is almost never deficient.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.800
I have yet to see an aquaponics system where
there was a problem with sulfate being too

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.909
low.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.950
I've also never seen a system where there's
a problem with sulfate being too high.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.799
Now, I will say that in aquaponics system,
sulfates tend to run pretty high.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.900
Some folks have systems that run up above
hundreds parts per million, some even 180,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.049
200 parts per million.

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.869
That's not necessarily a problem.

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.480
I will say, try to keep your sulfate below
60 parts per million ideally, but if it bumps

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.790
even way up above that, you're not going to
be hurting your plants and you're probably

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.499
not going to be hurting your fish.

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:23.519
Now the worst thing that can happen is you'll
start to see a little bit of a nitrogen deficiency

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:30.290
because what happens is this sulfate starts
to interfere with nitrate uptake in the plants.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.269
Long before you actually see any kind of toxicity,
you're just going to see a reduction in your

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.489
nitrate use.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.540
The way you recognize that is that nitrogen
deficiency but when you test your water, you've

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.969
got high nitrates consistently.

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.900
That's one way to diagnose the fact that you
got a little bit too much sulfate in your

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.319
system.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.900
Is this something to be worried about?

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.439
Probably not.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.290
Like I said, I've seen very few systems where
sulfate is a problem.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.829
Either too much of it or too little of it.

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.030
Remember, the plants can take up variable
amounts of these compounds, if you've got

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.890
a little bit too much of something, often
times the plants are just taking up extra,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.840
that's called luxury consumption.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.489
It's more than they need but it's not going
to hurt them, it's not always going to help

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.480
them but it's certainly not going to hurt
them.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.579
That's important to remember.

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:24.329
When you're adding sulfate based supplements,
a potassium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, that

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:30.170
kind of thing, most likely you're not going
to have to be worrying about having too much

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.889
sulfate in your system, any kind of toxicity.

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:38.579
Feel free to add away until you start to see
a loss of efficiency when it comes to nitrate

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:39.579
uptake.

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.629
Again, this is a really important plant nutrient.

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:50.010
Sulfur, plants use almost as much as of it
as phosphate at different times.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.959
This is definitely something you need in your
system and you'll probably be supplementing

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.450
it in some form or another.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.139
If you have been worried about sulfate, if
you are using sulfate based supplements, stop

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.709
your worrying, keep an eye on your nitrate
consumption.

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.870
Enjoy being able to supplement really potent
forms of certain elements in combination with

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.820
sulfate and just enjoy the fact that you can
have a really healthy system in a hurry using

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.840
sulfate-based supplements.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.850
Hey, hopefully this video is really useful
to you.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.160
Definitely check out the vertical food blog
after this video or post.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.100
We'll definitely do a blog post on sulfate,
on sulfur, why plants need it, how much is

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.750
too much, how much is too little, we'll go
through some more of the details on the blog

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.290
and so check that out.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.320
Also check out the store, if you're interested
in towers, we've got a lot of new kind of

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.310
products coming out here in the next couple
months so keep an eye on that.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.540
Thanks so much for watching.

Hey, this is Nate Storey at Bright Agrotech.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.200
Today we're going to talk a little bit about
Magnesium as part of our ongoing series on

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.980
managing your nutrients in your aquaponics
system.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.590
We're adding potassium to the system.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.320
Many folks who are adding like seaweed extracts,
that kind of thing, they don't realize that

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.540
they're also supplementing potassium.
