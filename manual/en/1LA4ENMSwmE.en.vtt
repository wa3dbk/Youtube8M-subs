00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.120
Iâ€™m Lynn Goldstein, a Registered Dietitian.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.140
Sugar.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.000
It's sweet and simple right?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.340
Well, no.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.860
There's more to the sweet stuff than you'd
think, more and less.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:22.310
Raw sugar, honey, table sugar, brown sugar,
molasses, cane juice, malt syrup, high fructose

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.321
corn syrup, glucose, fructose, sucrose, dextrose,
These are all different forms of sugar, high

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:32.410
in calories and low in nutrients.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.020
So what's the low down on the sugar high?

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.550
Sugar is the essential energy source we need
live.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.320
In particular, glucose (the simplest form
of sugar) is our body's preferred fuel.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.480
It's what our cells burn.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.809
Most of our glucose comes from the carbohydrates
we eat.

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.879
There are two kinds of carbohydrates.

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.100
Complex carbs include whole grain breads and
cereals, and starchy vegetables.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.700
Many complex carbohydrates are good sources
of fiber and other nutrients along with all

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.100
that energy.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.130
Simple carbs include sugars found naturally
in foods like honey, fruits, vegetables, dairy

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.460
products.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.819
Simple carbs also include sugars added during
food processing and those are the ones to

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:15.450
avoid, which is not always so easy to do.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.899
That's because the typical American diet includes
more refined food than ever before and too

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.509
many of us are mainlining sugar as a result.

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.869
That's because of all the places manufacturers
hide sugar in their foods.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.060
Added sugar is everywhere, in lots of different
forms.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.010
Table sugar (or sucrose) is a combination
of fructose and glucose which are both simple

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.189
sugars produced naturally by plants.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.149
What about high fructose corn syrup?

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.780
Now there's no naturally occurring fructose
in corn.&nbsp;

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.500
But, in the 1950's, scientists found a way
to transform the glucose in corn into fructose.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.939
The resulting mixture is 90% fructose (which
is very sweet).

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.039
The benefit of high fructose corn syrup is
that it's cheaper and dissolves more easily

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.329
in liquid than table sugar does.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.820
Also, high fructose corn syrup acts as a preservative.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.009
These qualities make high fructose corn syrup
very attractive to food manufacturers, especially

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.610
as an ingredient in many sweetened drinks
like sodas and other processed foods.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.120
But there have been growing concerns about
the role high fructose corn syrup plays in

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.849
encouraging obesity.&nbsp;

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.370
Some studies suggest that drinking calories
is more likely to cause weight gain than eating

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.799
the same amount of calories from solid foods.

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.019
This may be because liquid calories are not
as satisfying as calories from solid foods,

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.460
so people tend to over do it.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.481
And high fructose corn syrup in drinks and
other processed foods sure packs in the calories

00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:37.481
while being light on nutritional value.

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:40.230
The American Heart Association recommends
that most American women should consume no

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.859
more than 100 calories a day from added sugar,
and for men no more than 150 calories a day.

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:51.170
That's about 6 teaspoons of added sugar for
women and 9 for men.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.819
To give you an idea of what that really means:
one 12-ounce can of a sweetened soft drink

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.200
contains 8 teaspoons of added sugar, or about
130 calories.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.329
That's already near or over the recommended
daily limit!

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:11.000
In fact, most Americans get more than 22 teaspoons
of added sugar a day, or 355 calories, way

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.900
beyond both the USDA guidelines and the American
Heart Association recommendations.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.900
Here's what I tell my patients: cut down on
the added sugar in your diet and keep your

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.709
eye on maintaining a healthy weight.

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.681
By doing that, you'll lower your risk for
serious conditions like type 2 diabetes, high

00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:31.480
blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and
even tooth decay!

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.709
Now that's sweet.
