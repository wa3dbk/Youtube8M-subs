00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.019
Mike &amp; Emma: Hey!

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.750
Emma: To quote Benjamin Franklin, "What person
among us has not felt the frightful pierce

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.750
of disenchantment after finding themselves
with a rotten cantaloupe on special at Trader

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.750
Joe's?"

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.750
Mike:I just got the chills.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.750
Emma: Right?

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.910
Mike: So let's talk about how to avoid that
gravest of all disappointments, here are five

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.850
tips on how to find the ultimate fresh produce.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.100
Emma: Jane Austen right?

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.100
Mike: Nailed it.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.000
Emma: Tip number 1 for melons and fruits,
get friendly.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.640
Like pick up the produce.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.500
To quote Lifehacker, "The surface should be
largely smooth and even."

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.780
If you feel any dents under the surface that's
a frown-face maker, the fruit was probably

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.720
dented during shipping, or is rotting.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.650
Mike: So the flesh should be like my guns.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.700
Emma: Firm.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.140
Mike: With a little give.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.670
If they're, like Emma's guns, rock hard, they're
not ripe.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.240
Emma: I tried to get Mike to cut that line,
but then the Benny Franklin quote, "It's too

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.330
true to get rid of."

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.680
Mike: But to quote Lifehacker again, "Citrus
fruits that are too firm are probably dry

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.760
on the inside."

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.579
Also, pay attention to weight.

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.770
If the fruit is heavy for its size, then that's
a good indicator that it's nice and juicy.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.229
Emma: but I gotta tell you it's not all about
the sense of touch.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.281
Mike: Makes sense to me, and that's why we
have tip number two, follow your nose, like

00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:30.909
Toucan Sam, give that fruit a good sniffin'.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.869
Emma: You don't need to nose slam it, but
you should get a light and sweet aroma with

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.209
a hint of awesome.

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:37.720
Light plus sweet equals fresh fruit.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.329
Too strong a smell can be over-ripeness.

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.139
If you have a fruit that's like your great-uncle
Bobo at Thanksgiving...

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:44.139
Mike: sour and stinky...

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:46.170
Emma: you probably have a fruit that's past
it's prime.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.009
Mike: But you know Emma, it's not just touch
and smell that can help you.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.790
Emma: Well color me surprised, and that brings
us to tip number three, color me good.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.349
Pre-ripened fruits like bananas should have
even color with no dark spots, and citrus

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:03.609
fruits like oranges should have no white spots
and no out of place colors on the surface.

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:08.200
Mike: Melons are a little bit different, avoid
denting and bruising, but, to quote Lifehacker,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.360
"Don't toss out a vine-ripened melon for a
little scarring on one side.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.349
As long as it's not tender or thinner then
the rest of the rind, it's likely only the

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.820
place where the melon rested on the ground
while ripening."

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.430
But what about choosing vegetables that suffuse
the soul with unspeakable joy?

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.950
Emma: Are you talking to me?

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.670
Mike: Right

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.110
Emma: Oh, I was confused because you were
quoting Shakespeare just then.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.110
Mike: Easy mistake.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.870
Tip number 4: for veggies follow the fruit
rules.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.870
Kinda.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.870
Sometimes.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.190
As with fruits, it is important that vegetables
have a surface that is quite firm and evenly

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.190
colored.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.490
Emma: Firmness is key, especially with veggies
like peppers, cucumbers, potatoes, and onions.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.400
With fruits you like a little give, but in
vegetables it is a sign of over-ripeness.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.970
And in some vegetables there are spots that
especially should not be soft.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.740
It varies veg to veg, but we'll link you to
an awesome vegetable buying guide in the doobly-doo

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.740
below.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.111
Mike: To again quote our Lifehacker friends,
"Most vegetables don't give you clues to their

00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:07.010
ripeness by smell the way that fruits do,
but use common sense: steer clear if something

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.820
doesn't smell right.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.690
Root vegetables should be firm and tough,
as well.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.170
Avoid root vegetables with cracks at the base,
which means it's too dry."

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.160
Now as you know, we're all about the Benjamin.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.270
But that's not the only green we're going
to talk about.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.360
Emma: I wouldn't say we're all about the Benjamins.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.360
Mike: Okay.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.540
Emma: I'd say that we have like, like a conscious
concern for the Benjamins.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.540
Mike: Well...

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.190
Emma: And how they factor into our lives.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.060
And that brings us to tip number 5: like a
Benjamin, leafy greens are best when crisp.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.720
And like a pocket full of Benjamins, leafy
greens are best when plump.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.430
This applies to lettuce and kale, most of
the leaves should be intact and smooth.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.430
Mike: Ah, snap!

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.540
Emma: That is Mike doing his impression of
a leafy green when you break it.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.340
That is a similar type sound.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.030
Mike: The same rule applies to peas in their
pods, as well as to string beans or green

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.030
beans.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.500
E-How has a really fantastic video on how
to pick these vegetables, and we're totally

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.820
going to put a link in the doobly-doo.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.280
Emma: That's all we've got for you today,
if you have any tips for picking fresh produce,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.860
we would love to hear from you in the comments
section below.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.630
In the mean time.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.450
Mike: We've "bean" doing this show for a long
time.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.670
Emma: We're "plum"ing the depths here.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.440
Mike: "Orange" you wanting a catchphrase?

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.350
Emma: I know I'm "pine"ing

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.130
Mike: Well one day, "apple" a surprise and
reveal it to you.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.990
Emma: That will be a "grape" and glorious
day.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.380
But today is not that day.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:39.419
Mike: Don't "kale" us.

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.940
