00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.663
Hello! I'm Mery, and welcome to cooking for everyone

00:00:02.763 --> 00:00:05.011
Today we will make some cookies Nutella cookies

00:00:05.211 --> 00:00:07.811
And to them we will need the following ingredients:

00:00:07.911 --> 00:00:10.937
220g or 2 cups flour,

00:00:11.337 --> 00:00:13.973
115 g or 1/2 cup butter,

00:00:14.373 --> 00:00:15.246
2 eggs,

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:18.350
150 g and 2/3 cup sugar,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.824
150 g and 1 cup of chocolate chips,

00:00:22.124 --> 00:00:26.678
115 g or 1/2 cup cocoa cream and hazelnuts very cold, such as Nutella.

00:00:26.978 --> 00:00:30.619
1 tablespoon baking powder also known as baking powders

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:32.444
and 1 tablespoon vanilla essence

00:00:32.544 --> 00:00:35.200
The first thing we do is put the butter is

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.351
at room temperature in a container

00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:38.996
And we add sugar

00:00:39.346 --> 00:00:41.761
And using a wire whisk we beat well

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:45.794
Once we have a whitish mixture

00:00:45.794 --> 00:00:47.454
we will add the essence

00:00:48.254 --> 00:00:50.648
and 2 eggs which are at room temperature

00:00:51.248 --> 00:00:52.741
And it is again mix well

00:00:55.777 --> 00:00:58.553
Now let's move on to mix the yeast with flour

00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:04.953
And we add half to the above mixture, sifted if you want

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.546
And we integrate well into the mix with a spatula

00:01:10.546 --> 00:01:11.499
or pastry language.

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:15.822
We do the same with the other half

00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:23.727
Once you have built is already stuck with this consistency

00:01:23.727 --> 00:01:25.659
As you can see, it's nothing sticky

00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:29.251
If it is sticky, you add a little more flour and of integrity

00:01:29.351 --> 00:01:31.698
Since it depends on the size of eggs you use,

00:01:31.698 --> 00:01:33.981
And we will preheat the oven

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:37.932
I will put to preheat the oven to 175 째 C or 340 째 F

00:01:38.332 --> 00:01:40.613
We add to the mass of chocolate tears

00:01:41.672 --> 00:01:43.082
and integrate them into the dough

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:49.648
We already have the dough ready, and I have also prepared a tray

00:01:49.648 --> 00:01:51.273
oven with baking paper

00:01:51.273 --> 00:01:53.209
So now let's start making cookies

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.029
We take a teaspoon of dough, put it in the palm of your hand

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.847
and we will crush round shape

00:02:00.247 --> 00:02:01.788
If it is hot where you live

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:05.146
the advise to put the dough about 20 minutes in the freezer

00:02:05.146 --> 00:02:06.729
before you start making cookies

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:09.297
We put in half 1 teaspoon of Nutella

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.242
and we already closing

00:02:22.696 --> 00:02:24.505
And we are going to do with all

00:02:24.705 --> 00:02:27.856
In total 19 have left and are all made in the tray

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:29.496
So let's put them in the oven

00:02:29.696 --> 00:02:34.695
I am going to leave in the oven to heat up and down to 175 째 C or 340 째 F

00:02:36.147 --> 00:02:38.929
It's been 12 minutes and cookies are ready

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:40.313
So let's make them

00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:42.578
And we do the same with the other tray

00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:47.160
And while we'll let cookies cool on a rack

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.079
We have all made cookies, and as you can see

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.262
They have been great

00:02:51.562 --> 00:02:54.942
So I'll pass, to teach them how one remains inside

00:02:56.314 --> 00:02:57.463
Oh my God mother

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:00.270
