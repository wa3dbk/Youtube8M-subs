Well the other half of Jaystepher's order finally came in.

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.660
This is my Pick-a-Brick order and it took two weeks.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.820
I don't know why they just didn't put this in with the other package.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.189
Well let's open it up here and see what I got.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.189
Let's take a look here.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.040
Okay, get rid of that bag.
Let's see what I got here.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.870
I got a lot of tiles and such.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.160
I got a lot of tiles and such.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
But it's like they Ziploc the bag.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.920
But it's like they Ziploc the bag.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.030
This is vacuumed. What are we going, like we're packing meat?

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.000
This is vacuumed. What are we going, like we're packing meat?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.850
This is vacuumed. What are we going, like we're packing meat?

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.850
Let's take a look here.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.200
I guess I paid for all that extra paper.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.180
Let's see what we got here. Well I ordered pretty much a lot of tiles. That's what I ordered.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.610
I ordered some, I think a hundred dark reds, probably a hundred blacks,

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.870
I ordered some, I think a hundred dark reds, probably a hundred blacks,

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.130
a hundred whites, and I ordered 1 by 2s

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.090
and 1 by 1s.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.790
I think I ordered a few 1 by 3s. I still have to go through the order

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.840
and do inventory.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.640
But I want to get some of this for my next house project,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.700
and for the black and white, they are mostly going to be for QRs and stuff like that.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.420
So and I got a few of these 1 by 3s.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.050
So and I got a few of these 1 by 3s.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.260
Yup .... I don't know.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.080
I also ordered some panes of glass especially for those windows I get in some of those sets

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.070
that don't have the glass.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.400
So that's pretty much my order.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.800
So that's pretty much my order.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.820
It's not really spectacular but hey, it will get me tiling here. [Laughs]

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.420
It's not really spectacular but hey, it will get me tiling here. [Laughs]

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.090
It's not really spectacular but hey, it will get me tiling here. [Laughs]

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.119
