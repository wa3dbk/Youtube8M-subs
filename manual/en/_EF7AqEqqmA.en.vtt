One. Two. Three. (Cheering)

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
(Cheering)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Winners!

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.000
Absolutely fantastically challenging.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.000
You will be challenged.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.800
It's easy to make friends because everybody's really kind and everyone wants to talk to each other.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.800
You're going to have to do things that you've never done before.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.500
This is our tent. It's comfortable.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.500
The first week is like a personal challenge. We were able to over come things we hadn't done before.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You seem to trust the people around you. This place gives you the opportunity to really test yourselves.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We did a community survey, the outcome of which was that people wanted a happier community.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.500
The third week was to organise our campaign and fund raiser.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.500
And hopefully change some views on how some people think young people are.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.400
Amazing.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.000
It shows that I can work in a team.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.800
It makes you smarter as a person.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Inspiring.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.400
You learn a lot of skills.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.200
And challenging!

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.000
It's like the challenge I always wanted.
