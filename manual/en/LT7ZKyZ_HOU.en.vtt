Prehistorik Man is a video game. It�s also
a platformer. It�s also a donation, from

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.510
our good friend James from Texas. And it�s
also...a perfect example, of how a game with

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.800
awesome ideas can be ruined by bad execution.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.579
We�re talking Einstein ideas.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.980
Caveman execution.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:56.050
Alright, so maybe it doesn�t have Einstein
ideas, but...Prehistorik Man is actually an

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.189
interesting game. This thing was originally
released as Prehistorik 2, a sequel to the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:07.940
1991 platformer Prehistorik. Those games never
made it to the major consoles, so when Prehistorik

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.540
2 was ported to the Super NES, it came with
a new name.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.970
Same problems, though.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:27.110
So you play as Sam, a would-be heroic caveman
if not for...his, you know, being a caveman.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.210
I mean, he�s not the brightest bulb in the
prehistoric pack, and in fact, he only seems

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.750
to accept the quest�in which he has to find
food for his entire village�because he�s

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.690
promised the old man�s daughter, as a reward.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.650
Oh, Sam. You...neanderthal, you.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:57.880
Of course, despite his low brow and small
brain, Sam�s actually ahead of the game.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.270
That�s because Prehistorik Man isn�t exactly
your typical 2D platformer. In fact, it almost

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.870
plays like a 3D game, at times. See, you�re
not always just running to the endpoint. The

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.070
game often involves specific objectives. For
example, find all three stones hidden in the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.120
level, and bring them back to open a path.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.629
I mean, the gameplay is obviously in 2D, but
with the searching and the vehicles and the

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:32.200
open feel of the levels, this game does a
lot more than just side scroll.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.300
Another nice touch is that...the game just
looks great. I mean, this thing came out in

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.820
1995, so that�s a pretty late release for
the Super NES. And obviously, it looks the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.312
part. It�s colorful, the sprites are great,
there are huge bosses...Prehistorik Man looks

00:02:46.312 --> 00:02:50.770
like a game you could fall in love with. Some
of its ideas give you the same impression.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.620
So, uh...what goes wrong?

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.420
Well, the biggest thing is...what almost always
holds back a platform game. And that�s the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.819
actual platforming. I mean, think back to
the best Super NES platformers. Mario or Mega

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.170
Man or whatever...the movement�s always
sharp and precise. The physics just feel right.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.480
I guess cavemen didn�t understand physics.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.001
Of course, the core gameplay is a bit repetitive,
but honestly...it would be fine if the game

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:26.480
just played better. The objectives, the concept
of collecting as much food as you can...that

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.550
stuff goes a long way. But it�s kind of
hard to enjoy it when even the simplest platforming

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.599
is so problematic. There�s not much that
bugs me more than a platformer with floaty

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.690
gameplay and bad hit detection.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.349
I mean, Donkey Kong could grab a vine.

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.750
Why can�t Prehistorik Man?

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:53.380
Sigh. Great ideas, caveman execution.
