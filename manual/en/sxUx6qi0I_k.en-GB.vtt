00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.030
Steve Sutcliffe: A Formula Ford racing car
is not perhaps the most obvious choice of

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.030
vehicles compared with an Audi R8 supercar,
a BMW M6 GranCoupe, or a Mercedes A45 AMG.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.490
But here's the thing, because this particular
Formula Ford is, in fact, road legal. Hence,

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:32.750
the reason it wears numberplates, has a set
of headlights, and even has a tax disc to

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.660
prove it.
Okay, I'm sitting on a 1.0-litre turbocharged

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.660
engine. It's been pretty heavily turbocharged.
Ford says it's got just over 200bhp, which

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.940
might not sound a great deal until you realise
that this car weighs less than 500kg. It's

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.670
got mega, mega performance as a result - quite
a lot more straight line performance than

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.520
a regular Formula Ford would have.
It's the torque that's most impressive. I

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.520
just put my foot down now, and - wow - in
fourth gear you've got a big, big thrust

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.650
in the back for starters, but you also get
all these massive chatters and fizzes from

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.750
the wastegate because it opens and closes
as it dumps boost. It sounds just like a mid-80s

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.750
touring car. It's fantastic. Listen. (Laughs),

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:38.299
I mean the rest of this car is absolutely straight Formula Ford - sequential gearbox, double wishbone suspension front and rear,

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:45.479
actually be no curb weight whatsoever. Super
hyper-instinctive, hyper-precise steering.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.680
And the movement on all the pedals, it's just
tiny. The brake pedal moves about an inch

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.850
backwards and forwards through its total travel.
That's really nice because it's a lovely solid

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.850
pedal to lean up against.
This car is all about showcasing Ford's award-winning

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:15.629
three-cylinder engine. It's basically to show
the world, I guess, an alternative view to

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.060
what a sports car could be like. We're going
to show you what it will do to an Audi R8 V10

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.020
in a straight line, and to an M6 going around
a corner, and a Mercedes A45 AMG going

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.370
through The Snake (test track). It can live with or beat
all of those cars, despite having only a 1.0-litre

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.840
engine.
I think the real killer point about this car

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.840
is not just how fast it is in a straight line
or around corners, it's how much fuel you

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.870
don't use in the process. Ford reckons that
this car will do 118mpg. That's mad - all that

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.140
performance and 100mpg. That's the answers
to all of our prayers, isn't it?

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.319
Okay, so here's how the Ecoboost from the Ford
compared with the Audi in a straight drag race

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.580
up to about 100mph. Unfortunately, it was
soaking wet when we started filming as you

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.870
can see, which gave the four-wheel drive Audi
a massive advantage off the line.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.930
But when we compared them in the dry a bit
earlier, before the cameras started rolling,

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.930
the Formula Ford could stay with the Audi
up to 90. In fact, it was a little bit quicker.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.220
Once again, it was wet when we filmed the
Ford and the M6 going through our favourite corner on the test track.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.370
As you can see, the M6
was all over the place while the Ford just

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.409
basically drove through with no problems.
Even so, the lack of inertia in the Ford was

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:09.680
very obvious. Beside it, the M6 felt like
a bit of a tank, although it did provide us

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.940
with the perfect opportunity to do some gratuitous sideways driving.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.940
It was the same when we compared the Ford
with the A45 through The Snake. The A-class

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:29.650
felt more stable, true, and it probably had
a bit more grip, thanks mainly to the Ford's

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.610
not entirely rain-friendly tyres, but the
way the Ford could change directions so rapidly,

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.110
thanks to its light weight, was still a real
eye opener.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.849
That's the one key lesson in all this, I guess,
which is lightness in a sports car really

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:51.229
is the Holy Grail. And when you don't have
two tonnes of car to lug about but instead,

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.979
in this case, just half a ton, when everything
else kind of falls into place, sports car

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.819
makers of the world, please take note.
