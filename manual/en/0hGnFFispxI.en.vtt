TYLER WILLIAMS: Start
working on moves

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.640
that we've been practicing.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.473
INTERVIEWER: The moment
they've been waiting

00:00:04.473 --> 00:00:05.970
for is just minutes away.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.860
TYLER WILLIAMS: You
ready to go today?

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:07.420
SUBJECT 1: Yeah!

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.540
TYLER WILLIAMS: You
ready to have some fun?

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.050
INTERVIEWER: Dozens
of young kids

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.800
eager to prove what they can do.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.667
SHELBY BULLARD: 2.4.

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:16.000
TYLER WILLIAMS: You've got
to weigh in in your division,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.420
and you've got to get marked.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.913
INTERVIEWER: The Oklahoma City
Youth Wrestling Foundation.

00:00:19.913 --> 00:00:21.204
TYLER WILLIAMS: Ready, stretch.

00:00:21.204 --> 00:00:22.200
SUBJECT 2: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.290
INTERVIEWER: Before you
see how far they've come--

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.207
TYLER WILLIAMS:
Win or lose, you're

00:00:25.207 --> 00:00:27.000
going to shake hands with them.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.690
Roll it out.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.740
INTERVIEWER: --it's
important to know--

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.300
TYLER WILLIAMS: Roll it out.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.716
INTERVIEWER: --where
they started.

00:00:30.716 --> 00:00:32.122
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:32.122 --> 00:00:33.580
TYLER WILLIAMS:
Our first practice,

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.840
though, we had 12 kids.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.692
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:37.250
KOJO AGYAPONG: They put one
on there's, we'll put one

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.912
on there's.

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.676
Put it on, [INAUDIBLE] you see?

00:00:39.676 --> 00:00:40.404
Exactly.

00:00:40.404 --> 00:00:42.070
TYLER WILLIAMS: There
was no opportunity

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.330
for children in Oklahoma
City to participate

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.611
in the sport of wrestling
at the elementary age level.

00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:48.860
SHELBY BULLARD: Good, Malachi.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.430
TYLER WILLIAMS: Ultimately, it's
a lot more than just wrestling.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.370
SHELBY BULLARD: Drag
that outside leg up, OK?

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.010
Use your head.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.468
TYLER WILLIAMS:
The kids here, they

00:00:55.468 --> 00:00:57.700
come from all different
ranges, all different types

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.520
of backgrounds.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.390
KOJO AGYAPONG: Put
your hands on Cameron.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.280
Right there, boom.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.779
Take it.

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:01.980
Boom, right there, perfect.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.160
TYLER WILLIAMS: Many
of them are fatherless.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.010
We had dozens, and dozens, and
dozens, and dozens, of fist

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.650
fights our first two years.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.200
Last year, we only had two.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.950
SHELBY BULLARD: That's
a natural reaction.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.230
Jeffrey, Jeffrey, I need you
to listen and stop talking.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.300
One of the biggest things we're
trying to teach these guys how

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.700
to do is to listen.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.320
TYLER WILLIAMS: We want to
teach them positive character.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.028
KOJO AGYAPONG: And he
spun right into it.

00:01:27.028 --> 00:01:28.880
Discipline, just,
you know, leadership,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.829
being able to help each
other, pride, confidence.

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.120
Easy way I would do it,
instead of coming from up here,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.430
I don't want you to start here.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.437
Start up grabbing him.

00:01:37.437 --> 00:01:38.270
And then slide back.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.460
Now pop it up.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.610
Boom, but you're jumping.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.470
You're jumping.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.730
TYLER WILLIAMS: Mainly,
just try to love on them

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.804
and care about them.

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:44.470
Let him work it.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.940
Let's go.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.270
Let's see it--

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.645
INTERVIEWER: The
wrestling serves

00:01:46.645 --> 00:01:50.244
as a foundation on which to
build essential life lessons.

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:51.410
TYLER WILLIAMS: Peel it off.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.050
Good!

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.910
SHELBY BULLARD: We want to teach
them to strive to be better.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.980
To not just accept, you
know, whatever situation

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.568
they've been given.

00:01:59.568 --> 00:02:01.526
TYLER WILLIAMS: You find
a book and go with him

00:02:01.526 --> 00:02:03.042
to another classroom, OK?

00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:06.400
INTERVIEWER: At a local church,
once a week, coaches and tutors

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.275
mentor the children.

00:02:07.275 --> 00:02:08.900
SUBJECT 3: Would you
give me an example

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.600
of how you keep your promises?

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.070
TYLER WILLIAMS: We do about
10 minutes of reading.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.710
We do 15 minutes of school work,
and the rest of the time, just

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.584
positive interaction.

00:02:15.584 --> 00:02:16.924
SUBJECT 4: Good job.

00:02:16.924 --> 00:02:18.340
INTERVIEWER:
Hundreds of kids have

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.490
been helped by the foundation
since its inception five

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.090
years ago.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.039
SUBJECT 5: This is my medal,
Mommy, for first place.

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.080
TYLER WILLIAMS: Good job.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.820
INTERVIEWER: But recently,
the nonprofit organization

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.707
was in danger of
running out of money.

00:02:31.707 --> 00:02:33.540
TYLER WILLIAMS: In my
conversation with God,

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.200
I said, OK, God you know,
we're going to need somewhere

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.090
near $40,000, and
probably by someone

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.860
that's not on our
donor list right now--

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.810
I don't know who it might be--
and I said, it's by September.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.450
DAVE MORTENSEN: You and
I tonight, mano a mano.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.290
INTERVIEWER: Just one
week before September 1st,

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.380
Anytime Fitness co-founders,
Dave Mortensen and Chuck

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.904
Runyon, arrived in
town with a big secret.

00:02:56.904 --> 00:02:59.320
TYLER WILLIAMS: They just
really acted like, I don't know,

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.330
regular Joes.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.050
DAVE MORTENSEN: Lean
back into him now.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.270
You can turn and go.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.470
INTERVIEWER: Posing as
ordinary volunteers--

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.750
DAVE MORTENSEN: Nice work!

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.800
INTERVIEWER: --Chuck
and Dave wrestled

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.509
and trained with the
kids for a few days.

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:11.050
DAVE MORTENSEN:
Let's try that again.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.020
Let's go down to here.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.920
TYLER WILLIAMS: And we
were ready to have them

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.380
full time volunteering for us.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.850
We wanted them back
this wrestling season.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.350
INTERVIEWER: At the
end of the week,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.179
they returned with
a big surprise.

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:21.720
TYLER WILLIAMS:
Well, they absolutely

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.570
were dressed differently.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.570
That was the first
thing I noticed.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.111
I thought we were going to roll
up mats and do a little work.

00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:28.430
And they came walking
in right over there.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.360
And they were dressed nice.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.050
And then they just
started talking.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.930
And they started talking
a little bit differently,

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.900
really intelligently,
I would say.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.770
And then, Dave, as he's
going through the story

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.780
and explaining some of his
childhood years, you know,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.230
is just tearing up.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.560
They talked about how
proud they were of us

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.730
and what we're doing here.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.290
And that's when they
dropped the bomb.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.030
INTERVIEWER: The bomb
was a check for $40,000

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.725
and the keys to a brand
new Anytime Fitness club.

00:04:00.725 --> 00:04:02.100
TYLER WILLIAMS:
It was a miracle.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.934
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:05.934 --> 00:04:07.350
INTERVIEWER: Revenue
from the club

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.260
will help fund the OKC
Youth Wrestling Foundation

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.110
for generations to come.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.150
TYLER WILLIAMS: It is a
launching device for us

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.603
to help the community.

00:04:15.603 --> 00:04:17.019
DAVE MORTENSEN: I
think these guys

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.227
are going to be the best
franchisees, because they're

00:04:19.227 --> 00:04:20.490
about helping others.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.350
And if you help others,
the rest just happens.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.920
TYLER WILLIAMS: When you're on
top, what are you going to do?

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.310
SUBJECT 6: Break down.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.110
TYLER WILLIAMS: Break him down.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.985
INTERVIEWER: The moments
they've been waiting

00:04:27.985 --> 00:04:29.511
for have finally arrived.

00:04:29.511 --> 00:04:31.235
TYLER WILLIAMS: Go, go, go, go!

00:04:31.235 --> 00:04:32.370
Half, half!

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.708
INTERVIEWER: Kids learning
and then proving--

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:36.380
TYLER WILLIAMS: Good
job, [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.620
INTERVIEWER: --what they can do.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.360
TYLER WILLIAMS: That's
the way to wrestle, man.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.730
That's the way to wrestle
hard the whole time, man.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:41.467
I'm proud of you.

00:04:41.467 --> 00:04:43.050
INTERVIEWER: My, how
far they've come.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.440
TYLER WILLIAMS: That's the
way to get out there, man.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.050
I like watching you wrestle.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.611
SHELBY BULLARD: Wrestling
is a lesson in life.

00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:50.360
TYLER WILLIAMS: They'll
be better behaved.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.060
They'll have better attitudes.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.940
They'll be better
wrestlers, of course.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.687
SHELBY BULLARD:
Give your stance.

00:04:55.687 --> 00:04:58.270
INTERVIEWER: And goodness knows
how far they'll eventually go.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.870
TYLER WILLIAMS: They just
have a different outlook.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.720
Way to go, man!

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.310
Way to go!
