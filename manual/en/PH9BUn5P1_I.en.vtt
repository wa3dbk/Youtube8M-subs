Hi I’m Peg from Sony and I’m here to show
you how to pair a Sony WALKMAN with a Bluetooth

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.430
audio device such as a pair of Bluetooth headphones
speaker or an A/V receiver with a Bluetooth

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.710
adapter

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.740
Pairing creates a link allowing the WALKMAN
to wirelessly transmit music to a compatible

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.099
Bluetooth device

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.770
If your WALKMAN came in a kit with a pair
of Bluetooth headphones the two may already

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.640
be paired

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:45.460
Turn both on and play a song to see if the
connection is active

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.539
Each WALKMAN is slightly different so be sure
to check the owner’s manual or visit us

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:56.590
at esupport.sony.com for your specific features
and menu options

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.969
Turn on the WALKMAN by pressing any button

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.210
If the word HOLD flashes in yellow at the
top of the screen find the HOLD button on

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.230
the right edge of the device and slide it
to turn it off

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.010
If you see anything other than the HOME screen
press the HOME button at the bottom front

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.560
of the WALKMAN

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.760
Using the arrow keys navigate to the bluetooth
icon

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.960
Using the arrow keys navigate to add device
(pairing) to pair the WALKMAN with another

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.640
bluetooth device

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.750
The WALKMAN will begin searching for another
Bluetooth device and will continue to search

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.000
for 30 seconds

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.450
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for
the headphones speaker or other Bluetooth

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.360
receiver to put it in pairing mode as well

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.080
Remember the walkman will scan for 30 seconds
so make sure to activate the Bluetooth device

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.850
within that timeframe

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.490
Set the devices within three feet of each
other to allow them to complete the pairing

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.250
process

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.480
Some devices may ask for a passcode to complete
the pairing process

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.569
If you are pairing a Sony product to your
WALKMAN and a passcode is requested you can

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.040
enter the numbers 0000

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.540
For all other products consult the manufacturer’s
user guide for the correct passcode

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.489
