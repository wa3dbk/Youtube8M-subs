00:00:03.628 --> 00:00:07.961
The President:
Well, let me; first of all, say
how grateful I am for all of you

00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:14.661
being here, and how much
we appreciate everything

00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:15.227
that you've done.

00:00:15.227 --> 00:00:20.227
I know that there are a lot of
people here who have been so

00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:24.294
engaged in the campaign,
have sacrificed so much,

00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:28.728
people who've been
involved back since 2007.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:31.628
(applause)

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:36.561
And so I want all of you to
know how appreciative I am.

00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:41.728
And I know many of you came here
today for a campaign event.

00:00:42.828 --> 00:00:48.027
I was looking forward to having
a fun conversation with you

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:51.895
about some really important
matters that we face as a

00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:59.795
country and the differences
between myself and my opponent

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:01.895
in this election.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:09.094
But this morning, we woke up to
news of a tragedy that reminds

00:01:09.094 --> 00:01:16.061
us of all the ways that we are
united as one American family.

00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:20.394
By now, many of you know, many
of you have heard that a few

00:01:20.394 --> 00:01:24.895
miles outside of Denver
in a town call Aurora,

00:01:24.895 --> 00:01:29.695
at least 12 people were killed
when a gunman opened fire in a

00:01:29.695 --> 00:01:35.661
movie theater, and dozens more
are being treated for injuries

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:38.127
at a local hospital.

00:01:38.127 --> 00:01:40.994
Some of the victims
are being treated at

00:01:40.994 --> 00:01:42.261
a children's hospital.

00:01:44.094 --> 00:01:47.094
We're still gathering all the
facts about what happened in

00:01:47.094 --> 00:01:50.061
Aurora, but what we do know
is that the police have one

00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:52.461
suspect in custody.

00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:56.461
And the federal government
stands ready to do whatever is

00:01:56.461 --> 00:02:00.094
necessary to bring whoever is
responsible for this heinous

00:02:00.094 --> 00:02:01.628
crime to justice.

00:02:01.628 --> 00:02:08.261
(applause)

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:12.428
And we will take every step
possible to ensure the safety

00:02:12.428 --> 00:02:14.594
of all of our people.

00:02:14.594 --> 00:02:18.594
We're going to stand by our
neighbors in Colorado during

00:02:18.594 --> 00:02:20.261
this extraordinarily
difficult time.

00:02:20.261 --> 00:02:23.494
And I had a chance to speak with
the Mayor of Aurora as well as

00:02:23.494 --> 00:02:27.094
the Governor of
Colorado to express,

00:02:27.094 --> 00:02:29.661
not just on behalf of
Michelle and myself,

00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:33.928
but the entire American family,
how heartbroken we are.

00:02:33.928 --> 00:02:42.161
Now, even as we learn how this
happened and who's responsible,

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:46.227
we may never understand what
leads anybody to terrorize their

00:02:46.227 --> 00:02:48.928
fellow human beings like this.

00:02:48.928 --> 00:02:53.928
Such violence, such
evil is senseless.

00:02:53.928 --> 00:02:56.061
It's beyond reason.

00:02:56.061 --> 00:03:00.094
But while we will never know
fully what causes somebody to

00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:03.728
take the life of another,
we do know what makes life

00:03:03.728 --> 00:03:04.728
worth living.

00:03:04.728 --> 00:03:11.261
The people we lost in Aurora
loved and they were loved.

00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:15.661
They were mothers and fathers;
they were husbands and wives;

00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:19.828
sisters and brothers;
sons and daughters,

00:03:19.828 --> 00:03:22.428
friends and neighbors.

00:03:22.428 --> 00:03:26.928
They had hopes for the future
and they had dreams that were

00:03:26.928 --> 00:03:28.895
not yet fulfilled.

00:03:28.895 --> 00:03:32.761
And if there's anything to take
away from this tragedy it's the

00:03:32.761 --> 00:03:37.194
reminder that life
is very fragile.

00:03:37.194 --> 00:03:41.861
Our time here is limited
and it is precious.

00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:46.528
And what matters at the end of
the day is not the small things,

00:03:46.528 --> 00:03:51.928
it's not the trivial things,
which so often consume us and

00:03:51.928 --> 00:03:54.061
our daily lives.

00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:57.661
Ultimately, it's how we choose
to treat one another and how we

00:03:57.661 --> 00:03:58.761
love one another.

00:03:58.761 --> 00:04:09.861
(applause)

00:04:09.861 --> 00:04:13.661
It's what we do on a daily basis
to give our lives meaning and to

00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:16.328
give our lives purpose.

00:04:16.328 --> 00:04:17.361
That's what matters.

00:04:19.828 --> 00:04:24.594
At the end of the day, what
we'll remember will be those

00:04:24.594 --> 00:04:28.561
we loved and what
we did for others.

00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:31.261
That's why we're here.

00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:35.094
I'm sure that many of you who
are parents here had the same

00:04:35.094 --> 00:04:37.994
reaction that I did
when I heard this news.

00:04:40.828 --> 00:04:42.828
My daughters go to the movies.

00:04:44.594 --> 00:04:49.027
What if Malia and Sasha
had been at the theater,

00:04:49.027 --> 00:04:51.594
as so many of our
kids do every day?

00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:56.528
Michelle and I will be fortunate
enough to hug our girls a little

00:04:56.528 --> 00:04:59.628
tighter tonight, and I'm
sure you will do the same

00:04:59.628 --> 00:05:00.628
with your children.

00:05:00.628 --> 00:05:04.628
But for those parents
who may not be so lucky,

00:05:04.628 --> 00:05:09.761
we have to embrace them and let
them know we will be there for

00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:11.828
them as a nation.

00:05:11.828 --> 00:05:16.628
So, again, I am so grateful
that all of you are here.

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:22.828
I am so moved by your support.

00:05:24.928 --> 00:05:26.861
But there are going to be
other days for politics.

00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:31.828
This, I think, is a day
for prayer and reflection.

00:05:31.828 --> 00:05:44.695
(applause)

00:05:44.695 --> 00:05:50.728
So what I'd ask everybody to do,
I'd like us to pause in a moment

00:05:50.728 --> 00:05:54.328
of silence for the victims
of this terrible tragedy,

00:05:54.328 --> 00:05:58.094
for the people who knew
them and loved them,

00:05:58.094 --> 00:06:00.994
for those who are still
struggling to recover,

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:05.628
and for all the victims of less
publicized acts of violence that

00:06:05.628 --> 00:06:08.861
plague our communities
every single day.

00:06:08.861 --> 00:06:11.328
So if everybody can
just take a moment.

00:06:11.328 --> 00:06:35.294
(moment of silence)

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:37.127
The President:
Thank you, everybody.

00:06:37.127 --> 00:06:41.661
I hope all of you will keep the
people of Aurora in your hearts

00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:44.127
and minds today.

00:06:44.127 --> 00:06:48.561
May the Lord bring them
comfort and healing in

00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:51.061
hard days to come.

00:06:51.061 --> 00:06:56.494
I am grateful to all of you, and
I hope that as a consequence of

00:06:56.494 --> 00:07:00.227
today's events,
as you leave here,

00:07:00.227 --> 00:07:04.528
you spend a little time thinking
about the incredible blessings

00:07:04.528 --> 00:07:05.528
that God has given us.

00:07:05.528 --> 00:07:06.528
Audience Member:
We love you, Obama!

00:07:06.528 --> 00:07:08.361
(applause)

00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:09.795
The President:
Thank you very much, everybody.

00:07:09.795 --> 00:07:11.428
God bless you.

00:07:11.428 --> 00:07:13.194
God bless the United
States of America.

00:07:13.194 --> 00:07:15.994
(applause)
