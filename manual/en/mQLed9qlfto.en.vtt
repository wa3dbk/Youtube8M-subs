00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:14.720
This is the second of the video clips on the
series of death and immortality; as a matter

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.490
of fact this is a mantra for immortality from
this great Saint Arunagiri.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:34.360
Arunagiri was a Tamil saint who decided to
commit suicide because he had had a very promiscuous

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:46.990
and then later on he had a realization after
he was afflicted with a terrible disease called

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.699
leprosy and he wanted to commit suicide.

00:00:50.699 --> 00:01:02.220
He jumped out off the tower of Thiruvannamalai
where a miracle happened, Muruga, the son

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.619
of Siva came in the form of an old man and
then held the falling saint in his hand and

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.200
then put him down on the ground.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.960
He then initiated him, from that time onwards.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:31.299
Arunagiri became devoted to Muruga and composed
what came to be known as Thiruppugazh which

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:46.740
is the praise of the lord and in one of his
later poems perhaps the last one called Kandar

00:01:46.740 --> 00:02:21.569
Anubhuti, he address the issue of death and
how one can become deathless?.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:30.930
You have to protect me ,Muruga, from death
because I don’t want to die but then one

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.800
day the God of death , Yama is going to come
and protest to take my life away and at that

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:52.570
time you have to come and rescue me from death.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:03:06.870
Ka Ka is the mantra, these are just two syllables
but they are two words in Tamil although they

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.909
are one syllable words.

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:21.590
Ka means protect, protect.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:29.290
Then he goes on again giving us this very
valuable mantra to protect ourselves from

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.000
death.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:50.120
Again the words composed from two syllables
Va Ka Muruga.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:04:14.599
He says when the God of death comes to me,
Ka ka these are the mantras and then Va ka.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.380
So what you may want to recite is.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:45.280
Ka Ka and Va ka are mantras.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:56.700
Whether you know Tamil or not it is irrelevant
but however if you understand Tamil then you

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:34.680
can see the power of the hymn and appreciate
it more because it will melt your heart.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:48.370
You 
may want to recite the whole thing, the whole

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:56.740
course of lines and if you can’t at least
listen to them because they are words or sounds

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.910
of power, mantras to conquer death.
