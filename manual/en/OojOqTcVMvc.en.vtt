Episode 6 Robbie Maddison.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:01:04.430
Robbie Maddison is one of the best free-style
motocross riders in the world.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:19.390
So Robbie came on vacation and he shot me
a text saying he's on the island and he wanted

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.791
to go for a little tow surf session so I just
said have your gear on and be outside of your

00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:26.430
hotel at six in the morning.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.590
Welcome to Maui.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.910
Good to see ya, looks clean.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:30.910
It does.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.710
It's not gonna be a hundred feet, yea, but
it'll be fun, yea.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.570
I got you a suit and some trunks and stuff
too.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.410
Gonna do a little bit of a towing session
with the Walsh boys right here on Maui and,

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.510
and my first time so, I'm excited.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.570
I just gave Robbie a quick rundown on how
the whole thing works and he's a phenomenal

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.480
surfer as well as a motocross rider so he
pretty much knew what was up with everything

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.470
with the jet ski with the ocean and it didn't
really take much I just kind of explained

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.340
to him how to do some pick-ups in the water
in case something bad happened and he's right

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.340
on it, boom.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.170
So the first wave that I actually towed him
into was kind of like you know I-I don't think

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.390
I'd ever done any surfing with him so when
he got up on the rope really quick I was like

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.060
wow he's either done this a lot or he wake
boards a lot cuz he had no problem getting

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.060
up on the rope.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.150
And then right when I led him into the wave
and I gassed the jet ski over to the shoulder

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.650
so I could watch him surf, you know he surfed
amazing.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:50.270
He's he's definitely a good surfer.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:59.110
So this is just like a small, clean day on
Maui, sunny, no wind, and you know perfect

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.240
little three foot day.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.411
And it was at a reef I hadn't surfed in a
long time so I was pretty excited just to

00:03:04.411 --> 00:03:07.530
go out there and have a session.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:34.919
I got to tow Robbie in for a couple hours
and find him a couple perfect peaks.

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:55.000
It's really inspiring to see him be able to
transfer into our world so easily.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:19.060
We came in, rapped out for a minute.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:34.780
What you need is a little bit of a drink,
you know you're like on holidays and uh just

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.220
beautiful water and amazing weather and great
company.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.630
He did a lot better than I thought he was
gonna do.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.990
I don't think in any way, shape or form if
Robbie can tow surf does that mean Ian can

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.139
jump a 200 foot tabletop on a dirt bike.

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.470
Favorite moment of the day, probably Robbie
going to jump off the ski and getting caught

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.100
with the leash, not quite making it into the
water.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.570
Yea I forgot about that part.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.850
Probably going in the funniest two of the
day yea.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.630
Probably the funniest and the best part of
the day luckily the camera wasn't on for that

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.360
but I got it all up here.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.000
Welcome to the Ian Walsh Experience.
