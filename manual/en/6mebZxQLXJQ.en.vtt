First, clean the glass with a paper towel soaked in cleaner then place it on top of the pattern

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.980
Start by drawing the tree with black contour liner

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.340
Always work with pulling movements

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.660
Draw the flowers with transparent contour liner...

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.580
and highlight leaves with a gold liner

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.020
Use the gold liner for the remaining lines

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:26.580
HINT: wipe off any excess contour liner spilling from the tip of the tube with a paper towel regularly

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.780
Drying time for the contour liner is min. 30 mins...

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:43.180
Afterwards, start filling in the tree trunk with dark brown and transparent solvent-based glass paint

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.700
blend the two colours with the brush

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.460
work your way down the tree trunk

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.860
HINT: wipe off any accidental paint drops from the surface immediately

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.940
Always clean the brush in alcohol-based solvent if you are changing to another colour or has finished using one

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.020
Fill in the leaves with a mix of green and yellow colours

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.220
Use different colours and a thin brush for the flowers

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.980
Fill in the rectangles with solid colours

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.580
Paint the background by blending transparent and blue paint

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:33.340
Wait at least 2 hours for the glass paint to dry then with a contour liner decorate the branches...

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.260
and the tree trunk as well

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:48.540
Use a gold contour liner to draw the flowers and leaves.
