Hi. I'm Craig Weisman and on behalf of Expert
Village I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:11.190
the ultimate holiday stuffing. Okay in this
segment we're going to assemble the ingredients

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.539
for the delicious ultimate stuffing. Okay
so we have our rye bread, our wheat bread,

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.230
our white bread, whatever you want to use.
You can use store bought or you can use it

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.170
out of your shelf. Because the secret to this
is also in the herbs. Okay so we have a little

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.330
more. If we have to add more. We have chicken
broth if we want to add more or less. And

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.390
remember we're making a 22 pound turkey here
and we want to have leftover stuffing, too.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.710
We can have leftovers another night. So we're
going to put some in a casserole dish as well

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.540
as whatever is left over from the turkey.
And over here we have what we just cooked

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.540
before. The herbs and the onions and the celery
all mixed together. And we add this to the

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:06.270
stuffing or the bread mixture. And then what
we're going to do is. My preheated oven is

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.250
waiting for me. We preheat the over to 400
if we're going to cook the stuffing in the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.960
oven for about a half hour to an hour. But
what we're going to do today is put it inside

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.869
the turkey. So I preheated the oven for Diane's
turkey to 400 degrees. Okay so now we're going

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:31.909
to get this out of the way. And then we're
going to just basically pour this in. This

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:40.990
is the chicken stock. And that was a quart
of chicken stock. And now let me start to

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:52.760
mix. So we have a nice consistency here. Going
to tilt it towards the camera. Alright. That's

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:06.170
all mixing in here. Starting to be absorbed
by the bread. Okay now that we have this altogether,

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.099
the chicken stock I let cool a little bit
to room temperature so when I mix this in

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:20.319
it's not too hot, okay? Now what we're going
to do is add either 2 large, extra large eggs

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:30.790
or 3 medium size or large eggs. And because
I'm making extra stuffing I have 3 eggs here

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.059
that I'd beaten. I had beaten before hand.
And I'm going to mix that in. So now we have

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:41.189
your stuffing, your herbs, you butter mixture.
We still have a little butter left over. We'll

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.379
show you want to do with that as we stuff
the turkey but as you see this is all starting

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:53.419
to kind of like mesh together and become gorgeous.
Gosh, if you could smell this. Oh boy. And

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:59.290
it's going to smell even better. Now you can.
I actually would have tasted it before the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:07.459
egg. Oh my God this is good. This is really
good. This is really moist too. So what I'm

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.459
going to do is add a few more bread crumbs
to it. And in the next segment we're going

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.629
to stuff the turkey. By the way you're going
to add the parsley that we had before. Now

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.379
is an okay time to add the parsley. Because
you don't want to add it when it's too hot.

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:25.510
You can see it adds some beautiful color to
it. And this'll add a little more pizazz to

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.519
your turkey. So we'll see you in the next
segment.
