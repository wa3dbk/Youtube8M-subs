00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.970
We're here from Exeter University with a group of undergraduates

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.100
and we're looking at Geomorphology

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.600
and looking at climate and we're looking
at relief and ecology across a transect

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.000
which really runs from the Mojave Desert in the centre,
across to the Redwoods in the west.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.100
So we're in the Redwood forest in California
and we've been working out here for a few days

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.900
and students have been studying the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.800
interactions between the hydrology and
the ecology and the climate of this system.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.650
This is a really great place to come because it's

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.100
a really big contrast to where we start the trip
which is in the Mojave Desert

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.600
which is very dry, very hot and where
there are lots of water resource issues,

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.000
so quite different from what we actually
get to study while we're here.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.700
Today we've brought the students along to learn
a little bit about invasive species management

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:46.500
and it's really that ethos of learning about systems but 
then also actually giving them an opportunity

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.699
to go out and do research in the field

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:55.000
or in this case actually hands-on management, which is
something that we've tried to encourage in the fieldtrips.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.240
California's one of these amazing places where

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.840
where you can very clearly see the links between

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.200
topography, relief, geology and climate.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.520
You have er amongst the driest deserts in North America,
you have amongst the wettest forest

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.930
which we're standing in at the moment,
in western North America

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.400
and this is the... these contrasts,
these climatic contrasts are caused by

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.300
the interaction really, of the relief, the mountains and the climate.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.300
So this is an amazing landscape and
is a remarkable opportunity I think,

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.800
for undergraduates to understand a whole range of issues
within a ten or twelve day field trip.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.800
We've seen such vast differences in, 
between the coastline and the forest

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.200
and there are other issues that the students
have been able to consider.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.700
We've been looking at the physical processes
but we've also been looking at

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.300
the human impact and the way that humans interact with the environment and ways in which that can be controlled

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:48.000
through legislation, policy and through schemes
like we've seen today with Acterra

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000
where we've been looking at how California,
as an example, deals with invasive species.
