00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.980
[Darris McNeely] Steve's program on "You Are
What You Eat" has generated a great deal of

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:04.980
response.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.340
We've already covered some questions that
have come in from our viewers in regard to

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.480
the matter of clean and unclean meats.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.340
And we have another one that's come in regarding
the verse in 1 Timothy 4:4 about what is sanctified

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.340
and what is not.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.710
[Steve Myers] Yeah, it's an interesting passage
because oftentimes people have a question

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.820
about it and they say, well doesn't this show
that we can eat whatever we want?

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.990
So, let's read that passage and see exactly
what it says.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.339
In verse 4 of 1 Timothy 4 it says, "For every
creature of God is good and nothing is to

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:39.219
be refused if it's received with thanksgiving
for it is sanctified by the word of God and

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.530
prayer."†So normally if you would just read
that little section you would say, well, if

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.120
I pray about this and ask God to bless it,
then I should be able to eat whatever I want.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.399
There shouldn't be any restrictions.

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.199
I shouldn't have to worry about anything back
in the Old Testament.

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.519
And so, that's the normal misconception about
what that verse is saying.

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.029
But that's not what it's saying.

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:01.029
[Darris McNeely} No.

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:05.519
And again one of the principles of understanding
the Bible is to keep every verse and all of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.600
it in context.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.201
In verse 3, it also talks about thisóit talks
about those who, "Forbidding to marry, and

00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:18.030
commanding to abstain from foods which God
created to be received with thanksgiving by

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.439
those who believe and know the truth" (1 Timothy
4:3).

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.770
And so when you look at verse 3, you see that
it again brings in the foods that God created

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.109
to be received.

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:35.090
And again we go back to Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
which show exactly which are the foods God

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.990
created to be received.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.530
And again when you read further in this section
of Timothy, Paul is really addressing something

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.549
that's even deeper than just the matter of
the food laws from what we call the Old Testament.

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.829
He's really addressing a philosophy that was
prominent in the ancient world that he wanted

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.679
members of the church to remove themselves
fromóthat really kept them from understanding

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.990
the whole plan and purpose of God.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.630
And the problem with the philosophy of that
world at that time was foods thatóall foodsóand

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.830
an unbalanced, improper approach toward food
as a whole.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.920
[Steve Myers] And that's an amazing thing
when you really see what this section says.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.680
The first verse in chapter 4 brings that out
so clearly.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.879
He says, "The spirit expressly says that in
the latter times some will depart from the

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:24.879
faith" (1 Timothy 4:1).

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.409
Alright, how will they depart from the faith?

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.780
He said, "Giving heed to deceiving spirits
and doctrines of demons."

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.680
And part of those doctrines that influence
from the demonic realms are those that forbid

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.150
to marry, like you mentioned in verse 3.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.420
So it wasn't just about food.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.800
They also forbid marriage and then it says,
"Abstain from foods."

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.580
And that word for foods there means any kinds
of foodsónot justÖjust not meats.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.150
And so that's what Paul was arguing against
pointing out very clearly; don't get involved

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.280
with that sort of thing.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.280
It's not good.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.651
[Darris McNeely] Really, the whole context
and the whole background to this subject that

00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:05.680
Paul was addressing is a heresy that really
has some really unbalanced approaches toward

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.959
not only marriage and foods, but all of physical
life in itself and denying the self unnecessarily

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.569
apart from what God said was right and good
in all aspects of lifeónot just foods.

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.840
[Steve Myers] One group was the Essenes.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.189
And some of them by this time were followers
of Pythagoras.

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.049
He was a famous mathematician.

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.049
And some of his followersÖ

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.049
[Darris McNeely] Another GreekÖ

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.790
[Steve Myers] Another Greekósome of his followers
would do something very interesting.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.680
What they would doóbecause they felt that
anything physical was evil, so you deny yourself.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.000
The spirit was good, the flesh was evil.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.200
Deny yourself and you'll be closer to God.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.820
So what they would do is they would set up
tables with beautiful foods, wonderful things,

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.450
a regular feast, then they would come and
sit around that table and they would smell

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.040
all of those beautiful aromas.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.299
They'd look at that gorgeous food.

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.069
Then they'd get up from that table and throw
it all away.

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.469
They wouldn't eat a single bite because they
felt that was growing in character.

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:05.579
But see Paul is saying that's ridiculous.

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.340
That kind of an attitude is ridiculous.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.490
When God set apart foodóLeviticus 11, Deuteronomy
14óthat can be eaten, don't abstain from

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.490
it.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.830
Matter is not evil.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.410
This is very good, the things that God sanctifies
and that's the important part.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.170
What did God sanctify?

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.170
That we should be thankful for.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.050
[Darris McNeely] Enjoy what God has given
to us in balance and in moderation, but keep

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.530
your focus upon what God's word says is right
and goodówhether it's dealing with food,

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.550
or anything dealing with this physical life.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.550
[Steve Myers] That's right.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.550
That's BT Daily.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.555
We'll see you next time.
