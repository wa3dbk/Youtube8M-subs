00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:18.880
When I 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.160
saw that Ninja Crash had apparently won second-runner-up
in the 2012 DreamBuildPlay competition for

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.609
indie games, my primary thought was, “You
can get in the top three by making a Balloon

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.009
Fight clone?

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.169
Was anyone on this panel over the age of 25?”

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.510
I know it’s a harsh stance to take, but
that thought right there started the ball

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.510
rolling.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.699
I thought of the words “Balloon Fight.”

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.320
And that meant I absolutely had to try this
game, because...

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.320
Balloon Fight.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.390
It’s not something you just forget about.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.450
It’s ridiculously simple, but dangerously
addictive.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.969
So, 28 years after its inspiration, here’s
2012’s take on aerial platform-based combat.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:05.670
And I’m presently eating my earlier words,
because this thing is serious fun.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.920
SOMEONE STOLE THE CHEESE.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.670
And this isn’t going to go unpunished.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.280
As one of the elite hit-squad ninja pursuing
the weird flame-skulled demon cheesenapper,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.910
your goal is to survive through nine stages
of henchmen.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.770
These henchmen attack two at a time, and - like
yourself - are kept airborne through the use

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.009
of paper lanterns, which can be slashed off
if you hit ‘em from above... though if you

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.979
linger too long at the top of the screen,
the giant finger of God (as drawn by Tatsuya

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.509
Ishida) will poke you down, and God don’t
care if there’s enemies or spikes or solar

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.259
flares down below you.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.009
The challenge is to maneuver in mid-air, with
only the left and right buttons for control

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.680
and the A button to flap your arms wildly
in an attempt to gain altitude and speed.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.690
Momentum is a cruel mistress.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.080
The description up to this point could be
lifted directly from Balloon Fight, it’s

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.430
true, but Ninja Crash sets itself apart with
the inclusion of a spate of interesting power-ups,

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.479
from speed-boosting sushi to a shield of whirling
shuriken to projectile weapons like bombs,

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.920
kama, and kunai.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.780
This is... exactly what the game needed.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.349
Projectile fire and explosives.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.830
An awesome retro-flavored soundtrack doesn’t
hurt, either.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.680
Aside from the single-player campaign mode,
there are multiplayer configurations for up

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.660
to four players, including deathmatch, sudden
death, and team challenges.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.819
Further, progression through the game will
unlock “ninja skills,” which are basically

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.170
just achievements that don’t count as achievements
because this is an indie game.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.900
Still, I have to recommend Ninja Crash for
any situation that might see four or more

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.819
people, especially if said four or more people
remember Balloon Fight.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.459
This is the perfect update to a nostalgic
classic, and deserves the recognition it saw,

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.800
not to mention every penny of the three bucks
I paid for it.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.620
My sincere apologies for my prejudice.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.159
I was in the wrong.

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:06.620
And humble pie tastes horrible the day after.
