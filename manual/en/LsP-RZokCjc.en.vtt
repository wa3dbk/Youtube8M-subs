00:00:05.853 --> 00:00:11.083
Tell me how to fix PS4 Error NW-31453-6.

00:00:11.083 --> 00:00:15.353
I cannot figure out what it means, much less
what to do about it.

00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:18.383
That’s the delayed server response error.

00:00:18.383 --> 00:00:23.443
All I know is that my PlayStation 4 is slow
to do much of anything because of it.

00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:28.453
The first thing to do is to stop streaming
Netflix while trying to connect to the PSN

00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:29.453
site.

00:00:29.453 --> 00:00:32.413
I’m not trying to multi-task that hard.

00:00:32.413 --> 00:00:34.423
Check your internet connection.

00:00:34.423 --> 00:00:39.373
If someone else is downloading a game or uploading
a lot of video to Youtube, you’ll get a

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:44.373
slow connection and possibly that PS4 error
NW-31453-6.

00:00:44.373 --> 00:00:51.023
Let’s assume it is not because someone else
is trying to download Game of Thrones.

00:00:51.023 --> 00:00:56.763
Then check your internet connection for the
PS4 by going to settings, network, test internet

00:00:56.763 --> 00:00:57.763
connection.

00:00:57.763 --> 00:01:01.963
It’ll tell you that the internet status
is valid or not.

00:01:01.963 --> 00:01:03.732
What else could I do?

00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:10.233
If you get the PS4 Error NW-31453-6 along
with a notice that the connection has been

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:14.292
lost, your connection may have been so slow
that it timed out.

00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:17.253
I do not have time to put up with this.

00:01:17.253 --> 00:01:22.152
You may want to try changing the NAT setting
from 3 to 2, so you are not faced with an

00:01:22.152 --> 00:01:28.092
internet equivalent of the TSA, slowing things
to a crawl for minimal benefit, but do not

00:01:28.092 --> 00:01:33.242
put it on open NAT 1 or you’ll be the flower
child of internet security.

00:01:33.242 --> 00:01:34.893
I do not get it.

00:01:34.893 --> 00:01:39.092
Everyone will want to take you out just out
of sheer annoyance, and you’ll be an easy

00:01:39.092 --> 00:01:42.242
target because you cannot or will not defend
yourself.

00:01:42.242 --> 00:01:46.412
I’ve heard of people getting the error as
soon as they try to log in.

00:01:46.412 --> 00:01:51.292
The same problem could be because too many
other people are trying to log in right then,

00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:52.292
too.

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:57.323
Are you sure that is not the solution for
error NW-31456-9?

00:01:57.323 --> 00:02:04.232
The PlayStation error NW-31456-9 is a connection
error, which can occur because you cannot

00:02:04.232 --> 00:02:08.683
connect or because the connection is slow
because the server is delayed.

00:02:08.683 --> 00:02:12.262
Ah, so you can have both at the same time.

00:02:12.262 --> 00:02:17.863
Or get both errors intermittently because
the servers are slow due to demand or updates.

00:02:17.863 --> 00:02:23.833
You can get both errors if the PSN server
is unavailable due to DDOS or if a particular

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:27.533
game server is unavailable due to maintenance.

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:31.663
At least if it is the game server, I could
try a different game.

00:02:31.663 --> 00:02:35.093
And as Sony suggests, you can try back later,
too.
