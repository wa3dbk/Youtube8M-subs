&gt;&gt; Here I had friends,
now I have sisters.

00:00:08.936 --> 00:00:13.356
Here I helped people,
now I help the community.

00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:14.896
Do you know where I am?

00:00:15.116 --> 00:00:15.986
I am in girl scouts.

CEO Girl Scouts of
Central Indiana

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.826
and we're located
here in Indianapolis.

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:27.806
We started this when we looked
out over the landscape and saw

00:00:27.806 --> 00:00:29.356
that central Indiana
was changing.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:33.376
We first went out and asked the
new communities what it is you

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:37.116
want for your young girls that
girl scouting can provide?

00:00:37.716 --> 00:00:39.536
We found two things
very interesting.

00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:42.996
We want our girls to know
how to navigate the system

00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:45.516
and be successful,
and we would want you

00:00:45.516 --> 00:00:46.946
to respect our culture
and our families.

00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:49.836
So, we took that and
we moved forward.

00:00:50.026 --> 00:00:51.356
We have a dual program.

00:00:51.876 --> 00:00:53.936
A program for women
who are bilingual,

00:00:54.246 --> 00:00:55.586
who are new in our community,

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:59.186
help develop their leadership
skill, and we have the girls.

00:00:59.996 --> 00:01:02.366
&gt;&gt; The volunteers, or the
leaders, that we are working

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.336
with us, is Spanish speaking,

00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.846
are a little afraid
to try new things.

00:01:08.376 --> 00:01:10.676
They need to learn
and understand our way

00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:15.006
and our promise, and helped
them to do that very easy.

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:19.316
Having these books has been
excellent because it explains

00:01:19.356 --> 00:01:22.986
from the beginning to the
end what girl scout is about.

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:26.266
The leadership is there,
from the page one to the end.

00:01:27.046 --> 00:01:30.036
For them to understand and
for the girls to also see

00:01:30.036 --> 00:01:35.786
that it is there program,
they are the leaders, the mom

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:37.826
or the volunteer is just
there to support them

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:39.696
and to help them,
and they understand

00:01:39.696 --> 00:01:41.466
that from the very first moment.

&gt;&gt; The new troop leaders
that I am trying to recruit,

00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:13.766
they have the new troops.

00:02:14.326 --> 00:02:17.706
I try to encourage them to
work in My Promise, My Faith.

00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:22.656
It's easy for all
Latinos work on a topic

00:02:22.806 --> 00:02:28.986
that is represent the community,
and we are very family oriented

00:02:28.986 --> 00:02:30.106
and [inaudible] oriented.

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:33.076
And, when you are speaking
out My Promise, My Faith,

00:02:33.456 --> 00:02:38.016
you are speaking their
self and hope they are.

00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:40.616
&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter
how old you are.

00:02:41.226 --> 00:02:44.986
You can always do anything
other people can do.

00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:51.906
You just got to believe in
yourself, got to have faith.

00:02:52.106 --> 00:02:53.416
So, and if you just believe

00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:54.916
in yourself anything
can be possible.

00:02:56.246 --> 00:03:00.226
&gt;&gt; We just started not too long
ago and we actually started off

00:03:00.306 --> 00:03:04.106
with just getting to know each
other, icebreakers, and I help,

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:07.736
like, get the games started, and
just get the conversation going.

00:03:08.346 --> 00:03:11.256
We actually started My
Promise, My Faith and that's

00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:14.596
where we did the
diagram of how religion

00:03:14.596 --> 00:03:16.496
and the Girl Scout law overlaps.

00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:22.276
When I see them, I actually see,
like, myself as a younger girl.

00:03:22.276 --> 00:03:24.986
I was actually a lot like
a lot of them, really shy,

00:03:24.986 --> 00:03:27.986
I didn't like answering
questions.

00:03:28.056 --> 00:03:31.186
Girl scouts has actually gotten
me out of little shy shell

00:03:31.186 --> 00:03:34.276
and I've been able to, like, do
a lot of things with my life,

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:36.896
and with my high school
career, and just, everything.

00:03:37.286 --> 00:03:39.066
&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter
if we're little girls,

00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:40.516
we can still do anything.

00:03:40.516 --> 00:03:43.406
We can still, like, -- We
can still climb a mountain.

00:03:43.406 --> 00:03:47.036
We're unstoppable,
that's how we are.
