00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.460
(clears throat)

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:02.960
Um, Burnie?

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:03.860
Yup?

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.380
Um, we're having some issues with the restaurant downstairs...

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.880
Downstairs?

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.760
Why, what're they complaining about the noise again?

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.740
Uh, no...no...

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.700
Not the noise...

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.740
It's the stomping, isn't it?

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.700
I told them, I stomp when I walk!

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.240
I can't help it!

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.100
No...the stomping?

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.600
I explained that!

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.920
It's genetic!

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.780
My father was in marching band, I can't help that.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.460
N-no...

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.780
Mom was kinda slutty.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.580
Yeah...that's not really what I'm talking about--

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.080
Wait a minute

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.900
Is it the water pipe?

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.660
Are we leaking water on them again?

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.580
Uh, no... no water pipe issue... uh --

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.120
Are we leaking something else on them?

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.760
Because if we're leaking something besides water, that could mean you're in trouble.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.280
...Urine trouble?

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.340
Definitely!

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.740
Ok, no, no it's no liquid --

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.380
Definitely.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.040
Definitely.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.540
It's not a liquid.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.400
There's no -- its not a liquid --

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.240
Joel, you know what?

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.480
I can't sit here all day and figure out what's wrong with the people downstairs --

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.720
It's because of the trapdoor!

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.220
...Excuse me?

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.100
The trapdoor.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.340
You have a trapdoor.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.440
And you keep sending people through the trapdoor into the restaurant below.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.400
(Scream)

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.200
(nervous laughter)

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.080
That sounds ridiculous!

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.880
Yeah, ok...

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.040
And if you're gonna get a trapdoor,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.580
if you're gonna buy and install a trapdoor, y'know,

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.780
it might be helpful if you get, like, some sorta, like, like a furnace, maybe?

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.620
Or like, some metal claws?

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.620
Or whatever,  or like a fence?

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.020
Right? Because people are just falling through the trapdoor, and they're landing on the salad bar.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.660
Ok, Joel.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.160
Right?

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.280
Ok, Gus is covered in sprouts.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.080
Joel, Joel!

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.980
Maybe a furnace, AND metal jaws!

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.240
Because that way you burn 'em up, you chop 'em --

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.740
Ok, Joel --

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.800
I don't know who told you this story, but listen to yourself, ok?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.680
Listen to how farfetched it is!

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.640
Why would I even want a Henckman Brothers Model 607 trapdoor?

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.840
Ok, you know what?

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.360
I understand, y'know, you can be stressed

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.480
Y'know, you have, like, evil plans?

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.440
Maybe have a henchman that's going astray?

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.920
I can understand, maybe I get one myself

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.260
You're reaching for a switch right now, aren't you?

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.020
...No.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.620
...I'm not.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.580
Burnie, I'm looking at you reaching for the

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.940
(silently) just...

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.240
I'm not mov-- what are you doing?

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.320
I'm not moving over.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.020
Ok, you know what?

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.520
(silently) Your left, my right!

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.600
This is... getting a little ridiculous.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.560
Um...

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.960
I'm not moving over.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.000
Ok, I can see you reaching for the switch.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.700
No you can't.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.420
Can you just...

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.980
Ok, that doesn't...

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.980
I can see -- I can see your hand!

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.060
You can't see it, nope.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.180
No, see your hand covering your face isn't

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.720
See, that's not gonna stop me from seeing what you're doing with your hand

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.500
You're -- you're putting your hand --

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.720
Ok, Joel, listen.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.780
Alright?

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.780
I am not gonna flip this switch.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.800
And drop you through a trapdoor.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.300
Ok?

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.340
I promise.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.200
Ok, you're smiling.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.980
Right now, right?

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.020
You're smiling and you're picturing me falling through a trapdoor, right now.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.880
I'm just really happy about the promise.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.920
Oh, I see, that's probably a switch to some...

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.900
other trapdoor, right?

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.080
That's somewhere else, right?

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.920
Joel? Don't be silly.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.760
(loud click)

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.700
Agh!

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.100
(laughing)

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.680
Hey, right?

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.860
No big deal!

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.680
Ok, I see.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.740
That's... that's really...

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.340
that's funny.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.660
(loud crash)

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.900
Bet they heard that downstairs!

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.940
Can't believe I survived that!

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.020
(loud crash)
