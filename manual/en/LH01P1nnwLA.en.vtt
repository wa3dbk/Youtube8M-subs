CASEY CORMIER: Okay. So we just learned the
slapping and popping style, and we have just

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.610
been alternating slap, pop, slap, pop right?
This structure with our hands, our finger

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:18.270
underneath looped [PLAYS SLAP AND POP] try
to make our lines like staccato as opposed

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:27.870
to legato [PLAYS SLAP AND POP]. Now let us
try to create some pattern. This is not the

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.159
reason that this was created; it is supposed
to be a rhythmic function. This is a very

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:42.160
popular one-and, two, one-and, two, one-and,
two, one-and, two, slap-slap, pop-slap, slap-slap,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:52.429
pop-slap. Now let us apply that to some changes.
This is a funk line that you might have heard

00:00:52.429 --> 00:01:02.879
before but is a very popular way of slapping
and popping. So we are going to go slap-slap-pop-slap,

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:13.100
slap-slap-pop-slap just once and then [PLAYS
AND SINGS SLAP AND POP BASS LINE] and I am

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:25.710
going to G, slap-slap, pop, slap-slap, pop
[PLAYS BASS LINE]. Now try speeding that up.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:35.540
Here is with the metronome how it would sound
like [PLAYS BASS LINE]. One, two, three, four,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.150
slap-slap, pop-slap, slap-slap-pop, slap-slap-pop,
slap-slap, pop-slap, slap-slap-pop, slap-slap-pop.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:51.660
Now you might have to switch from there, from
popping and slapping to regular plucking [PLAYS

00:01:51.660 --> 00:02:05.491
BASS LINE]. So be always ready to change.
Remember, when you are popping and slapping,

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:11.690
your hand is like this basically going along
the neck but moving, you have to move it back

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:20.220
up to pluck.
So try not to alternate them too much until

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.000
you get used to it.
