00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.930
In 1898 Voges and Proskauer characterized
the fermentation of sugars by various bacterial

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.570
isolates. This method was suggested for differentiation
between bacterial isolates that produced coloration

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.930
and those that did not. Both the methyl red
and Voges-Proskauer tests are commonly used

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.989
in conjunction with the indole and citrate
tests, to form a group of tests known as IMViC

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.079
which aid in the differentiation of Enterobacteria

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.299
The Voges-Proskauer test determines the capability
of some organisms to produce non acidic or

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:51.510
neutral end products, such as acetyl methyl
carbinol, from the organic acids that result

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.490
from glucose metabolism. This test differentiates
among the enteric organisms such as Escherichia

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.339
coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella
pneumonia .

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:08.100
The reagent used in this test is Barrittâ€™s
reagent, consists of a mixture of alcoholic

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.930
a-naphthol and 40% potassium hydroxide solution.
Detection of acetyl methyl carbinol requires

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.210
this end product to be oxidized to a diacetyl
compound. This reaction will occur in the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.110
presence of the a-naphthol catalyst and a
guanidine group that is present in the peptone

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:34.600
of the MR-VP medium. As a result, a pink complex
is formed, imparting a rose color to the medium.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.979
Petri plate containing culture
Barrittâ€™s reagents A and B.

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.640
Sterile MR-VP broth tubes
Bunsen burner

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.510
Inoculating loop

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.370
Arrange all the materials in LAF
Sterilize the loop vertically in the blue

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.940
flame of the Bunsen burner till red hot.
Take the petri plate containing the colony.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.190
Now open the petri plate in presence of flame
and take an isolated colony using the inoculation

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.619
loop.
Take a sterile MR-VP broth tube, remove the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.670
cap and flame the neck of the tube.
Inoculate the MR-VP broth with the inoculation

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.260
loop containing isolated colony from the Petri
plate

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.319
Again flame the neck of the tube and place
it in the test tube rack.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.760
Incubate the tube for 24 to 48 hours at 37
Â°C in a shaking incubator

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.040
After 24 hours, take the tube out, remove
the cap and add 10 drops each of Barritt's

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.480
A and Barritt's B reagent s respectively
Shake gently for several minutes.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.920
A red color within the first 15 to 20 minutes
is a positive result. No red color formation

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.440
after 15 to 20 minutes is a negative result.
