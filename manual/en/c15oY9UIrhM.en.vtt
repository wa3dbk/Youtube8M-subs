00:00:00.857 --> 00:00:02.690
Today I'm going to show
you a couple of ways

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.740
to help avoid shaving irritation
if you have acne or oily skin.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.720
Please note, if you have severe acne
that's heavily inflamed or infected you

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.310
should consult a dermatologist.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.090
Many pimples and
inflammations are caused

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.000
by sebum, a natural oil
produced by your skin.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.330
Problems develop when the oils on
your skin combine with dead skin cells

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.540
and clog your pores.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.170
This can lead to infections that swell
and then get nicked when you shave.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.860
So to get the most comfortable shave
you got to control these excess oils.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.010
And that starts with
properly washing the area

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.790
to be shaved, in this
case your face and neck.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.680
The key to a good wash
is a facial wash or scrub

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.500
that will not only clean
but also exfoliate,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.220
getting rid of the dead skin
and oils that clog your pores.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.790
Apply the product to your hands and
work it gently into your face and neck.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.020
As you do your hair's will
soften, making them easier to cut

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.430
and less prone to uncomfortable
tugging when you share.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.640
After rinsing off your face you may
want to further hydrate your hair

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.324
by splashing your face
and neck with warm water,

00:00:57.324 --> 00:00:59.490
or by soaking a towel with
warm water and holding it

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.930
against your skin for
up to three minutes.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.400
Now that your face is clean and well
hydrated it's time to apply shave gel.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.320
But not just any shaving cream will do.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.970
Choosing the shave gel
that's right for you is key.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.350
If your combating oily
skin or acne you'll

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.060
want to use a shave gel designed
specifically to remove dirt and oil.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.690
Take a moment to check the
pimple prone areas of your skin.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.504
Rub the shave gel into an even
lather over your beard and neck.

00:01:23.504 --> 00:01:24.920
Now you're ready to start shaving.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.510
When shaving over the temple
prone areas of your skin

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.250
use a multi-blade razor like
this one that has blades

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.640
spaced closely together.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.670
The closer the blades,
the less opportunity

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.670
for skin to get caught
between the blades.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.380
Use light strokes and avoid going
over pimples more than once or twice.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.630
Make sure that your
blade's good and sharp.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.190
A dull blade is more
likely to nick pimples.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.170
So if you feel tugging or discomfort
consider swapping your blade out

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.770
for a new one.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.370
Or if you have an indicator strip
on the back of your razor check

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.140
to see if it's faded to white.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.450
A white strip means that your blade
has dulled and may need replacing.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.990
Shave in the direction that
you're most comfortable with.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.852
Many guys feel that first shaving
with the grain of your hair, that

00:02:02.852 --> 00:02:04.560
is in the direction
that your hair grows,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.070
and then following up with
strokes in the opposite direction

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.460
provides the closest, smoothest shave.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.450
However, since facial hair tends
to grow in different directions

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.497
you'll almost always be shaving
both with and against the grain.

00:02:15.497 --> 00:02:17.330
An advanced razor like
this one will deliver

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.510
a close shave even against the grain.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.750
Finish by rinsing your face with water.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.090
Try finishing off your shave
with a light moisturizer

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.180
or aftershave product to
calm and comfort skin.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.970
A good moisturizer will
leave skin soft and smooth

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.504
and help maintain the skin's
natural moisture barrier.

00:02:34.504 --> 00:02:35.420
And there you have it.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.230
No cuts.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.540
No nicks.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.070
Feels good, doesn't it?

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.800
So let's recap.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.110
Wash and hydrate your hair.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.930
Use the right shave gel.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.684
Use a multi-blade razor.

00:02:47.684 --> 00:02:48.600
And apply moisturizer.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.880
Thanks for watching.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.730
