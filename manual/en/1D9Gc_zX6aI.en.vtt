00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.120
I got into yoga actually after basic training in 2002. I joined the Army in 2002.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.380
And then when I went to what is called
advanced individual training

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.869
or the Armed Forces School of Music --

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.390
I saw an advertisement for yoga classes

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.949
at the local gym. And I thought I would check it out and --

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.540
it was a healthy yoga class and I was instantly hooked after that class.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.500
I'm studying yoga,

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.649
Tai Chi and music. I came here

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.020
with the intention of starting

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.640
a student group for partner dancing or ballroom dancing and social dancing.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.720
I have the goal of being a dance instructor

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.130
and incorporating Tai Chi and yoga

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.929
into my teaching cuz

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.030
I think they go along very well -- specifically Tai Chi has helped my

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.979
social dancing immensely. I've had some of my dance partners

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.280
say how much I'm easier to follow.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.880
They enjoy dancing with me more.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.620
And that was just since taking Tai Chi

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.460
and I only took Tai Chi this school year.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.800
So that has helped out a lot there and 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.060
it's helped me to be more grounded and just going through different

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.830
personal issues that I may be going
through. I'm able to stay with them

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.380
more and not try to avoid any issues

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.940
and really work through it in a relaxed way.  So that's helped a lot.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.380
And in the Writing I class we have been

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.770
writing a lot of narratives and personal
creative

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.970
reflection pieces that deal with

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.110
our own story in one way or another. Whether it's about

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.050
an experience we had in life.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.880
Or it's writing in a specific literary style. So we have workshops

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.990
with each of the assignments that we turn in each week.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.850
That involves a small group

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.090
or the whole class and we share each
other's

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.230
writing that we did for the week and then we have -- we get input from our

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.530
peers as well we will go over the readings

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.950
each week in class and discuss them.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.290
We each get the chance to share what we think about it whether we like it or not

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.340
or whether it works for us. So its very -- much more --

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.280
it's much more interactive. It's an
experience you won't really get anywhere else --

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.580
You'll have the best support that you could 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.069
possibly have from teachers, from faculty,

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.079
from students, from the academic support, from uh --

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.269
a random Naropa person you may see. Everyone is very much approachable

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.920
and so you can have that safety net -- that support to

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.859
work through whatever it is you may be working through - it's been a good experience.

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.439
As well on campus uh anywhere -- just walk by and say hi.

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.139
Stop and chat with pretty much anybody. 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.420
I would say first off definitely go to Naropa because it's an experience you won't really get anywhere else.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.540
Because I ca be quite self-critical as I am sure a lot of us can be.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.720
And...well especially with Tai Chi I have

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.530
been able to relax with whatever's
happening.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.159
And stay with it. Don't back off or don't
just

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.859
fly off the handle but to

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.560
let the experience be that experience and then observe what's happening --

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:43.540
it was kind of an observer's perspective rather than being caught up in whatever situation is happening.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.920
And then - so that has helped me just to be more peaceful with myself

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.600
