Hello everyone this is Breanna Rutter from
howtoblackhair.com and in this video I will

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.240
be talking about why your natural hair is
naturally changing colors so I will help address

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.909
those and 4 reasons as to why its happening
and even these tips can also apply to those

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:24.699
who color their hair as well so my first reason
as to why your hair is changing colors in

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.079
this a prominent reason as to what to fix
your hair whether you color your hair with

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.920
your natural hair color is that you want free
your hair from minerals if you use hard water

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.320
so use that place that has hard water you
will see traces of things like some metals

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.670
calcium and even sulfur in your water and
when you run this water on your hair the minerals

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.050
in the water to sit on top of your hair shaft
the molecules are too big to be of your hair

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.570
so they are not helpful at all and it makes
it harder for moisture to penetrate your hair

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.140
at its best it's so sometimes you may color
your hair and notice that you color is getting

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.220
brassy or your color just looks really dull
and even washing your hair with hard water

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.330
leads to unmanageable so what you want to
do is make sure you use filtered water to

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.610
wash her hair you can do this by even using
a filtered showerhead to wash your hair with

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.670
a shower head on your shower or you can use
one that plugs onto your sink or simply just

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.390
buy a gallon of filtered water and wash your
hair with that in the description box I have

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.130
a link to my website that gives a lot of my
recommendations is what you should use to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.310
help filter your water if that's what you
need to do so the second tip that will help

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.090
you understand why your hair is changing colors
is that the ends of your hair all color best

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.090
in you colored your hair so it's hard to make
sense of this and say okay I don't color my

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.130
hair with the ends of my hair look a little
bit lighter in it for those of you do color

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.040
your hair you know is that the color seems
to stay on the in the reason why is because

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.170
the ends of your hair is most porous so if
you are coloring your hair you will notice

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.090
that the ends always take best to color before
it does at the root the reason why is because

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.680
as your hair gets older and go down nearly
the ends are missing some of the scales this

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.860
is just a natural wear and tear on your hair
over time the scales on the outside of the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.920
hair will either break off or not be as healthy
as possible because its the oldest part of

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.420
your hair so when you're coloring your hair
is very easy to deposit color into it because

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.350
you don't have the scales on the outside of
the hair trapping moisture out from getting

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.069
inside also if you don't color your hair naturally
it will lose color because it loses the pigment

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.510
as the hair gets older that's why as you get
older in age you will notice that your hair

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.630
will look white or black or even shades of
gray because is starting to lose that pigment

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.990
color that you always so that's why the ends
of your hair will naturally look a different

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.569
color because is the oldest part of your hair
and if you color your hair the ends hold color

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.960
best rather than the roots of your hair the
third reason as to why it may seem as if your

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.709
hair is changing colors is because it's just
pure genetics sometimes there's things with

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.990
my hair that I don't notice I think it was
maybe last week or two weeks ago I noticed

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.150
my first gray hair and you don't really notice
your hair as much a really see everything

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.520
in detail sometimes you may not realize that
you have a couple of strands of red hair or

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.910
even brown hair so what you want to do is
just check your hair out because you have

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.990
probably always had these different shades
of colors when you were a kid it's hard to

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.570
find someone who has all of their hair the
true shade of jet black but you will see different

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.000
kinds shades of color because our hair will
give a natural highlight and lowlight so really

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.190
don't worry about it this is why because it's
just purely genetics so my last reason as

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.770
to why your hair may be naturally changing
colors is because your hair has went through

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.950
sun damage so of course you have to battle
against manipulation damage and product damage

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.880
and then on top of it all even sun damage
with your hair sun lets on UV rays that can

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.550
be very harming to your skin as well as to
your hair that’s why it’s very important

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.699
that if you are going to be out on sunny days
that you were some type of sunscreen and the

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.400
same thing applies to your hair your hair
is a part of you so if your skin can't take

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.229
UV rays beating down on a hot sunny day then
your hair is going to suffer as well you want

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:45.759
to use some type of serum that will help protect
almost like a sunscreen for your hair in my

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.059
description box I have a link to my website
were actually talking about different products

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:54.939
you can use and I give a lot of different
recommendations of what to do for your hair

00:04:54.939 --> 00:05:01.240
stop sun damage from happening so those are
4 my tips that I gave to help you to understand

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.870
whether or not your hair is really changing
colors if anything is affecting your hair

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.639
and this can even apply to those who color
their hair as well so if this was helpful
