00:00:01.692 --> 00:00:10.764
We are in Slovenia today to meet the new Mercedes-Benz A-class. We could just make a video about this new car, but...

00:00:10.764 --> 00:00:20.733
we think this A-class will play such an important role the coming years, that we decided to bring his number one competitor right away.

00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:33.645
Mercedes-Benz is changing dramatically with the new A. Just look at it!

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:47.512
The last one was a bit of a strange car with the high roof, but this one is a low sporty hatchback that wants to appeal to young accountmanagers with shining sunglasses. 

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:51.590
Exactly, right in the area of the BMW 1-Series.

00:01:01.808 --> 00:01:08.644
Right, inside the new A. This car has a big task. It needs to bring young, new customers to Mercedes and...

00:01:08.644 --> 00:01:17.301
it has to compete with the new Audi A3, the Volvo V40 and that 1-Series. Its looks are great to start with.

00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:26.486
You have very big bumpers, an big logo in the nose, those dynamic lines along the sides, I must admit I like it.

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:37.157
It's obvious that Mercedes wants to enter the market with a bang. It's a different car. Look at the interior too, it's just that little bit more special.

00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:50.210
You might find it a big too much bling-bling, but this car is well made on the inside. The dash looks good with those SLS-type vents and the elevated navigation screen.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.055
But it feels good too and the ergonomics are pretty good as well.

00:01:54.734 --> 00:02:02.796
The 1-Series is even better though, iDrive works more simple than Comand in the A-class.

00:02:02.796 --> 00:02:06.748
It's a matter of taste naturally, but this BMW has a more relaxed atmosphere.

00:02:09.724 --> 00:02:17.854
I have to say, Mercedes has done a good job on this gear shifter: it's on the steering column so it saves loads of pratical space in the middle.

00:02:19.212 --> 00:02:25.149
Talking about the automatic. It's fitted as standard on this A250 and I'm not a big fan of the thing.

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:33.005
It's a double clutch gearbox, but it doesn't really feel like one. The reactions are a bit too late...

00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:43.500
You hear that complaint often with Mercedes cars, and this has the same problem. When you shift it manually, it doesn't react as quickly as you'd like.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:55.580
The engine is good though, you get a two litre turbocharged engine with 211 ps and that is grunty enough for this A-class.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:09.371
You just don't get the reactions you'd expect from the high-end engine in an A250.

00:03:18.108 --> 00:03:25.468
And then, the way it drives. That's a plus on this car. It's agile. That's new for a Mercedes...

00:03:25.468 --> 00:03:40.091
No but really, it reacts smooth to the steering, which feels good. The car feels small. In quicker corners it's a bit understeered but when you lift the throttle, the backside gets loose. The balance, in other words, is not bad!

00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:46.284
The ride is a bit less nice, though. It's a bit stiff, I had expected it to be better, coming from Mercedes.

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:05.680
And then the 1-Series. The main difference is this one has rear wheel drive, where the A-class is front wheel driven. 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:20.687
What do you notice in daily use? Not too much. One thing is worse on this car, those 19-inch wheels! It looks great but it makes this car less good.

00:04:20.687 --> 00:04:33.103
While the rest of the chassis is pretty damn good! This one has adjustable dampers, it gets firmer in Sport, but the standard setting is just how you want it.

00:04:34.638 --> 00:04:56.365
And then some, the steering in this BMW is unparalleled. The A-class steers fine, but this has more feel to it, it reacts more direct, stays better on course. It's a more playful machine.

00:05:00.142 --> 00:05:21.038
The comparison is made difficult by this car having a manual gearbox. But this is the way to go, you can choose how much grunt you want from the engine. 

00:05:21.038 --> 00:05:30.286
The engine delivers its power in a comparible way to the Mercedes, and it's very, very quick.

00:05:32.142 --> 00:05:43.614
And then the space. Both aren't champions in this field. The 125i is small in the back, but the A-class isn't better.

00:05:43.614 --> 00:05:52.557
First of all, the opening is pretty small and inside there's enough space for people around 1.80 metres. Are you taller? Make sure you sit in the front!

00:05:52.557 --> 00:06:02.045
The boot then. Don't expect huge spaces, but a 1-Series has pretty good capacity here.  

00:06:02.045 --> 00:06:19.820
The A-class is smaller again. The opening is tighter and the space is cramped. You'll have to take that into account when you want an A-class.

00:06:26.141 --> 00:06:34.653
One more thing: the price. A basic A-Class costs about 29.000 euro's in Holland. That makes it about 3.000 Euro more expensive than comparable rivals.

00:06:34.653 --> 00:06:44.924
Sure they've made a good car, but I wonder if that pricing is the right way to go in a market with these types of competitors.

00:06:45.277 --> 00:06:51.438
+ It's stands out in the crowd.  + Agile and dynamic.   - Slow reactions transmission  - Bad riding 18-inch wheels.
