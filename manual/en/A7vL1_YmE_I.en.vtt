00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:04.900
it's called the Book of Common Prayer

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.950
looks normal.. right.. common..

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.120
now you may have heard of it

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.919
but you're just not quite sure what it is.
I mean, where did it come from

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.239
and uh... what's the difference between a
common prayer and, uh, [deep voice] uncommon prayer

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:18.470
besides that silly

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.539
British accent

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.569
well, you on the right place to find out
because we're talking about the Book of

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:29.759
Common Prayer on this episode of Chuck Knows Church

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.819
Where did you find this anyway?

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:33.350
Was this here?

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.350
Did you have to go to an Episcopal Church to find this? [ fun intro music ]

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.380
prayer books unlike books of
prayers contain structured or liturgical

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.940
services of worship

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.840
now the Book of Common Prayer is just that,
a collection of all the written elements

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.140
used in different worship services. What
are you doing? [whisper offscreen "That's the bible"] Oh

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.130
the Book of Common Prayer

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.400
[ clearing throat, moving on now ]

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.550
uh... it was originally published for
the Church of England in fifteen forty

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.219
nine.

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.959
coming out of the protestant reformation
which was the break from the authority

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.140
of the Pope in the Roman Catholic church.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.329
Now, it was the first prayer book written
in English to include all of the

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.049
components daily and Sunday worship
services may contain morning prayer,

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.720
evening prayer, a Holy Communion a full
order of services for baptisms, a

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.479
confirmation, marriages and funerals. It
did not however include the classic

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.420
prayer, uh,  "God is great,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.130
God is good, let us thank him for our

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.700
fuud. Amen"

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.829
Now the book, not the children's prayer was compiled and written by Thomas Cranmer the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.920
Archbishop of Canterbury who wanted a
prayer book that could be understood by

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.170
ordinary people

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.390
in English

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.090
even if they couldn't read.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.040
So in the ecumenical spirit

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.099
there's that work again, [whisper] ecumenical

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.169
uh... in the ecumenical spirit intended

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.979
for the Book of Common Prayer Archbishop
Cranmer borrowed elements from many

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:21.079
religious sources and wrote dozens of
new prayers that were simple and direct.

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:27.300
It characterized the worship handbook as
one for the people not just for the priests.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.800
Now although the use of the Book of
Common Prayer in the United Methodist

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.919
Church is actually

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:36.699
pretty uncommon, it's rather common in
the Episcopal church and it's been used

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:39.759
in writing other prayer books and
variations of this book have found their

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.349
way into many other denominations

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.320
used in countries all over the world

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.349
in over a hundred and fifty different.
languages

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.469
Now, to learn more

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.429
be sure to ask your pastor

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:53.639
and tell them Chuck sent ya.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.129
[ whisper ] got it, we're not doing the bible yet.

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.950
This is a good book too.
