00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.210
Hi I'm Mike Corliss from Tormach and today Im going to...

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.089
...use a dial indicator to sweep a hole for my X, Y Zero on this part.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.560
Here's my dial indicator and the...

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.449
...swing arm.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:36.449
Put that in the spindle then we'll sweep the hole.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:50.330
Jog it over the part then roughly eyeball the swing of the indicator to the hole.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.360
I'm just eyeballing the...

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.570
...indicator switch with the..

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.480
...sides of the hole. I'm just trying to get it
fairly closely before I stick the indicator down in there.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:18.480
That doesn't look too bad.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.990
When i started I preloaded the indicator a little bit just for a starting point.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.400
Now I'll swing it in X. I've got that fairly close.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.259
And now I'll jog my...

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.259
...Y over so it's about what I was swinging in X.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.970
And when I sweep the indicator around

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.450
I never want to touch the arm, I always want to hold up above on the spindle...

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.470
...nose itself.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.900
that way you aren't jostling the indicator around.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.900
X is good.

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:26.149
There. That's centered. The indicator isn't moving around from zero.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.039
Once I have the indicator reading zero all the way around the hole.

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.569
Then I'll come over to my readout...

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.229
...then I'll zero out my X and Y because that's...

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.819
...my zero on this part. The center of that hole.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.599
I've got my readout zeroed.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.819
I picked my indicator out of the hole.

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.509
And that's how you use a dial indicator to sweep a hole for your X, Y, zero.
