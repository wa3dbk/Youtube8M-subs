00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.920
We want to divide these two numbers written in scientific notation

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.900
without the use of the calculator. To do this we can think of dividing this up

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.820
into two different fractions

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.300
connected by multiplication. So this is
equivalent to seven divided by two

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.859
times ten to the twelfth, divided by

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:25.939
ten to the seventh. So now we determine this quotient, and then we'll determine this quotient.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.800
Well seven divided by two, the decimal point would be here,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.120
so there's three twos in seven. Three times two is six,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.899
we subtract, that would be one. We're going to have to add extra zeros to

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.539
the right of this decimal point. So let's go ahead and move this up into our quotient.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.060
And now we can bring this zero down and we have ten.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.960
And we can ask, how many twos are in ten, that would be five.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.400
Five times two is ten. Find the difference here, which is zero, so we're done.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.340
So this quotient here is equal to three point five

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.560
times,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.240
now to determine the quotient here, since the bases are the same,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.260
we subtract our exponents. Twelve minus seven is equal to five,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.560
so we have ten to the power of five. So this quotient is equal to three point five times ten to the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.520
fifth.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.780
And notice how it is in the correct form for scientific notation.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.420
Remember this number here has to be
greater than or equal to one, and less than ten.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.800
Let's go and take a look at one more
example.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.400
We're going to start by doing the same thing.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.440
We'll divide this in half, and write it as a product of two different fractions.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.060
So we'll have two point four divided by four point eight,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.560
this will be ten to the seventh divided by ten to the second.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.820
So now we'll determine this quotient here, and then this quotient here.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.640
We should recognize this as one-half or zero point five,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.980
but let's go ahead and verify it. We have two point four

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.060
divided by four point eight,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.860
so we'd move the decimal point

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.860
to the right once here, and then to the right once here,

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.000
and then move the decimal point straight up. No matter where, we're going to have to add a zero here,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.380
so we can determine how many forty-eights are in two hundred forty,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.740
that happens to be five. Five times forty-eight is two hundred forty,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.560
so this differences is zero. So this quotient is zero point five, or point five

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.480
times, and then this quotient here since we're dividing, we subtract our

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.800
exponents,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.980
and seven minus two is equal to five, so this is ten to the fifth.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.300
So while this is the quotient,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.080
we need to recognize that the significant, or mantissa here is not

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.380
in the correct form.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.040
This number here has to be greater than, or equal to one,

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.940
and less than ten, so it's too small. So what we'll do is write

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.800
zero point five in scientific notation, then multiply it by ten to the fifth.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.560
So here we have to move the decimal to the right one place,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.080
giving as five times

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.440
ten to the negative one, and then we have to multiply this

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.800
by ten to the fifth. So our final answer is going to be five times ten to the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.580
negative one, plus five would be positive four.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.140
So we have five times ten to the fourth as our quotient

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.520
in the correct form for scientific notation. So sometimes when we divide,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.360
we have this extra step where the
significant, or mantissa is not

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.030
in the correct form for scientific
notation.
