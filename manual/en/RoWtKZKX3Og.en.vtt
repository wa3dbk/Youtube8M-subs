00:00:02.664 --> 00:00:05.580
You know, some of the work you do
around the house gets kind of messy.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.913
So how about a workbench you
can do whatever you want on

00:00:07.913 --> 00:00:09.616
and not worry about mess?

00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:11.680
Hey, I'm Rob North, Master Craftsman.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.940
And today I'm going to show you how
to build this functional workbench.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.400
So here's everything you're going
to need to pull this thing off.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.830
First off, going to need
some 2 and 1/2 inch screws.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.360
Got to hold the thing together
with something, right?

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.980
You're going to need a good screw
gun with a standard drive on it.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.860
You're going to need and impact gun
with a good sharp countersink, that's

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.360
important.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.220
An orbital sander to clean it
up when it's all said and done.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.456
Pencil, of course.

00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:33.580
Got to have a tape measure.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.490
A combination square.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.670
And I'll show you why
this tool in just a bit.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.030
Now you've got to have
your safety glasses.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.360
You only get one set of these.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.760
Make sure you're wearing these.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.860
And you've got to have a good mitre saw.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.594
If you want to follow along with us,
here's a link to the plans online.

00:00:48.594 --> 00:00:51.260
All right, now when it comes down
to the size of your workbench,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.590
the sky is the limit.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.060
We're going to make ours two
feet wide by eight feet long,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.768
but you can make yours
whatever you want.

00:00:56.768 --> 00:00:59.609
So start by ripping your particle
board down for the tabletop.

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.150
Now go ahead and cut some two
by four s that'll make a frame,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.640
or as we call it an apron, along
the edges under the table top.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.100
For our two by eight workbench,
cut two 2 by 4s at eight feet long

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.120
and two at 21 inches long, and then
screw them flush with the edge.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.340
Now, to make the legs of
this thing, cut eight 2

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.160
by 4s to 36 inches tall, and screw
them together into four pairs.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.825
They should make and L shape
when they come together.

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:29.700
All right, now once all of your legs
are cut up and screwed together,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.350
it's time to attach them to the bench.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.641
So just make sure your apron
is attached, flip it over.

00:01:35.475 --> 00:01:37.850
Now at this point you want to
go ahead and screw the legs

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.224
into to the corners of the apron.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.270
See that?

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.760
That's called a quarter brace.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.718
And we're going to put one between
the leg and the bottom of each table

00:01:50.718 --> 00:01:52.080
at every intersection.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.034
The trick is getting the one
that goes between here and there.

00:01:55.034 --> 00:01:58.200
That's a really tight space, and you
need to do the math to figure that out.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.124
Measure between these two legs.

00:02:00.124 --> 00:02:02.790
Figure out whatever that is, in
this case it's 11 and an eighth.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.498
Cut that in half.

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:06.140
That comes down to 5 and 9/16.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.880
Mark it on the apron.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.039
Transfer that mark up
to the top of apron.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.410
And then you take one of the braces
you already cut, put it in position,

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.342
and then mark against the leg.

00:02:16.342 --> 00:02:18.800
And that'll give you the exact
length that this brace needs

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.700
to be to fall within those two legs.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.100
Easy, I know.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.270
Now with all eight ankle braces
cut, it's time to put them in.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.490
All you have to do is screw one side
to the table leg and the other side

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.630
to the apron.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.496
Make sure that it's tight to the
leg and to the bottom of the table.

00:02:33.496 --> 00:02:35.995
If there are no gaps, then that
means everything is squared.

00:02:35.995 --> 00:02:37.870
Now, I believe in having
as much space as you

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.760
can when it comes to
storage, so we're going

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.520
to add a lower shelf to this thing.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.710
To do that, measure the inside
space between all the legs.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.655
All right, so with our
shelf dimensions taken,

00:02:47.655 --> 00:02:50.750
I went ahead and cut down
some more 3/4 particle board.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.400
And then took some more 2 by 4s ripped
that in half to make 2 by 2 stock.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.590
Now go ahead and screw that stock to
the lower shelf for reinforcement.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.130
Now one last thing to do
before you slam this thing in.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.190
Grab some scrap pieces
of ply and cut them

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.520
to fit between the bottom
of the table and those marks

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.010
you made for your shelf.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.539
That way, when you go to put
them in they'll act as spacers

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:12.330
and they'll keep
everything nice and level.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.740
Otherwise, you got to get
some help, and that ain't fun.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.910
With your shelf resting on the spacers,
go ahead and screw them to the legs

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.190
and then flip the whole thing back over.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.275
All right, the only thing left to do
now is to put a sander on this thing

00:03:23.275 --> 00:03:25.260
and get it all nice and smooth.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.450
I'm a real man.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.550
I don't need my bench to be smooth.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.970
I'm Rob North, and that
is how you get it done.
