Hey guys!

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.960
I'm in Kabukicho right now, in Shinjuku

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.700
and we are headed to the Robot Restaurant

00:00:13.043 --> 00:00:15.263
Probably lots of you guys know what that is

00:00:15.263 --> 00:00:16.683
You've probably seen videos on YouTube

00:00:16.702 --> 00:00:21.502
But I felt that every channel about Japan needs a Robot Restaurant video

00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:25.682
Chris is in Tokyo right now! Hey Chris, say hi~

00:00:25.682 --> 00:00:27.462
How are you doing

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:29.431
So I figured it was the perfect time to go

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:31.305
Are we here? This must be it

00:00:31.647 --> 00:00:34.047
Is this it? Yeah... this would be it.

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:40.624
Well it's easy to find!

00:00:41.753 --> 00:00:43.673
Here we go~ Are you excited!?

00:00:43.673 --> 00:00:45.193
Can barely contain myself!

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.430
Epic waiting room

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.940
You can't enjoy the Robot Restaurant without some Chuhi

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.780
Chuhi is a popular carbonated alcoholic drink

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.180
...and the show begins!

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.800
Their costumes used to be a lot more "risquÃ©"

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.700
But now they've toned them down so it's relatively kid friendly

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.600
It just got weirder and weirder as the night went on...

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.920
In the name of the moon, I'll punish you!

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.960
I feel like I've heard that line somewhere &gt;_&gt;

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.140
Oh just a dragonfly carrying a gorilla. Nothing to see here.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.860
ROBOT SHARK FTW

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.900
The snake robots were probably my fave

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.640
DINOSAURS

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.320
We all have to duck to avoid getting hit in the face

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.580
Isn't it beautiful?

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.160
WTF IS GOING ON

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.200
Robot dancing :D

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.620
Alright, so that was the Robot Restaurant!

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.740
Pretty awesome!

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.940
That was pretty cool

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.821
It was better than I was expecting actually

00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:39.004
Everyone was awesomely talented

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.880
Yeah, it was fun!

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.300
It's pretty pricey

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.207
I think it's 7000 yen if you buy tickets at the door

00:05:45.501 --> 00:05:49.421
But apparently if you order them online, they are cheaper!

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.240
5500 yen online!

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.140
You can save a bit of money

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.220
Japanican.com

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.840
I'll find the link and put it down below

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.920
Thanks for watching guys! Bye!
