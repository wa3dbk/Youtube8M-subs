Back in my day, my squad mates and

00:00:45.557 --> 00:00:48.609

She'll need strength earned by retrieving
the golden apples of Adur, battling giant

00:01:21.256 --> 00:01:25.540
spiders after evading Heimdall,
seeking the scale of the dragon harkuiii.

&gt;&gt; Jessica Jones: Well he's about to
observe us losing our table at Raul's.

00:01:58.155 --> 00:02:00.668

00:02:06.103 --> 00:02:10.830
I was busy watching Scarlet Witch and
the She Hulk play tennis.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.562
