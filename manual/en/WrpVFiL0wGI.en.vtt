00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.300
Hi guys and girls, my name is SilverHunter
from Dota 2 Portal.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.120
Welcome to the 5th episode of our Learn Your
Role show, aimed towards the beginners to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.230
understand the basic things about each and
every Hero role.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.600
After covering the Support, Carry, Jungle
and Offlane role, it's time to cover the Initiators

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.610
role.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.640
So grab some popcorn, make yourself comfortable
and enjoy!

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.080
From the name of the role, you can conclude
that its goal in the game is to initiate something.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.310
We are not talking about initiating the flaming
and raging within the team, we are talking

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.390
about wining the games with the perfect positioning
and surprising the enemy with a massive ult

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.410
like Black Hole or Reverse Polarity.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.550
Because your goal in the game is just that;
since you have some pretty excellent spells

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.000
and ultimates for AoE CC (Crowd Control),
you have to be present in almost every single

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.340
team fight.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.350
If you fail to show up on time, and fail to
use your combo, the loss of the game is almost

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.490
certain.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.810
Even if you ARE in the team fight, you have
to watch over your positioning in order to

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.930
plant your combo on as many enemy heroes as
possible.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.549
There are so many IF-s in the life of the
Initiators, that many of us agree that this

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.880
particular role is certainly one of the hardest,
if not the hardest role to master.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.230
However, this role is not the main Hero role.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.230
It's a sub-role, since initiators can be the
great junglers, like Enigma, or great mid

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.150
Heroes, like Magnus, or great offlaners, like
Batrider, or great supports, like Warlock.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.340
With that being said, it's important that
you understand that your main role comes at

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.730
the first place.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.030
Junglers need to get the first core item as
soon as possible or gank from the jungle,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.630
mid Heroes have to watch over the runes and
use them to gank if they can, offlaners have

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.500
to be defensive and do their best not to die,
while supports...

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.250
Well, just buy wards and you are fine.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.480
However, these Heroes turn into a deadly and
powerful tool as soon as they hit their 6th

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.060
level, and their role as Initiators become
much more important.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.370
So, in order to be a great initiator, you
have to have some big AoE spells for locking

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.420
down?

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.120
Well, that's not completely right.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.650
With more experience, you will see that there
is a sub-sub role, called semi-initiators,

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.140
though not listed as the official role.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.430
Great examples of such Heroes are Spirit Breaker
or Clockwerk.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.640
They have the ability to initiate on single
targets, and have the HP to survive the incoming

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.870
enemy hate.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.610
These semi-initiators are here to drove away
the attention from the main initiator in their

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.000
team.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.819
By doing that, more often than not, the enemy
team will focus their hate towards the semi-initiator

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.960
to bring him down and forget about their positioning.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.950
Take a look at the following example:

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.990
Spirit Breaker charges into the enemy team,
initiating the fight.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.850
He immediately gets focused down by the enemy
Heroes, who cluster in the narrow space around

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.850
him.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.489
They've forgoten about the Spirits' backup,
called Enigma, who is on its way to land a

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.010
perfect 5 man black hole.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.220
Another example can be seen here: Dire decides
to initate the team fight by sending the Tiny

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.440
in the river.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.170
Radiant tries to take him down and punish
him for his â€žbad" positioning, but one of

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.840
the Dire supports uses a Force Staff to bring
him back.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:29.810
In that moment, Magnus rams into the clustered
enemy team and lands a great 4 man RP.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.030
Of course, there will be cases where real
initiators will start the fight first, without

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.490
sending in the semi-initiator.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.810
That situation is ideal, since you don't risk
your semi-initiator dying in the process.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.360
If playing as the real Initiator, you should
always keep an eye on the enemy positioning

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.780
and react in a split second to punish them.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.370
But, if you end up having the problems with
landing your combo, then your mid Hero, or

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.220
other Hero with a lot of HP or some great
semi-initiating ability should initiate first

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.010
and make room for you.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.860
Great semi initiators, and fairly easy for
beginners are Vengeful Spirit with her Swap

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:15.450
ability, Beastmaster with his Roar, Tusk with
his Snowball, Alchemist with his Stun, Huskar

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.780
with his ultimate, Night Stalker during the
night, Spirit Breaker with his Charge, Undying

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.760
with his Toombstone, Treant with his overgrowth
and others.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.462
But the real initiators are the following,
though some of them could not be the great

00:05:30.462 --> 00:05:39.410
for beginners: Earthshaker, Magnus, Batrider,
Dark Seer, Enigma, Lich, Outworld Devourer,

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.710
Puck, Warlock and others.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.169
So what's the conclusion?

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:50.479
First of all, you have to understand whether
you are a semi-initiator or a full initiator.

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.169
If you are a semi-initiator, then I am sorry
to say that you will be the one who should

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.800
initiate most of the fights and probably die
in the process.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.039
If you end up playing as the real initiator,
then it's way too important to land your combo

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:07.580
on at least 3 people, or 2 key heroes in the
late game (like Carries).

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.520
Don't be impatient, coordinate with your team,
make sure to notify them if your ult is still

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.179
on cooldown and practice, practice and practice.
