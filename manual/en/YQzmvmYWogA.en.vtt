00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.001
- Originally I'm from Tamworth
in New South Wales.

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:04.017
I've always been into my sport.

00:00:04.017 --> 00:00:08.006
Unfortunately, when I was 14 years old,
I had a major knee injury

00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:11.002
which stopped me from being able to play
contact sport for quite a while.

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:13.013
But that was the only way I could
spend time with my friends at school,

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:16.002
so I did my best to stay involved

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.005
and ended up volunteering
as a sports trainer.

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:21.011
That led on to getting
a paid position at the school

00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:24.015
whilst still being a student,
which showed me that there was going to  be

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:27.008
a career somewhere for me
in exercise science.

00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:30.009
Moving away from family and friends, you
put a little bit of pressure on yourself

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.017
to do what you've come here to do

00:00:32.017 --> 00:00:34.009
and not let people down
that you leave behind.

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.001
UniSA has a lot of social events.

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:40.010
You get put in an environment where
it's hard not to make friends.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.012
At UniSA,
we're lucky to have great facilities.

00:00:43.012 --> 00:00:46.006
We've got a physiotherapy clinic,
a podiatry clinic,

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:49.005
a high-performance and exercise
physiology clinic,

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:52.016
which are all great
for getting real-world experience.

00:00:52.016 --> 00:00:55.008
The University of South Australia
is great

00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:57.012
in terms of how they nurture students.

00:00:57.012 --> 00:01:01.009
They often have careers expos
and careers nights

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:04.010
where they bring in external employers
and possible employers

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.002
to come in and talk
and give real-world experience.

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.012
I was able to get a volunteer internship

00:01:09.012 --> 00:01:12.010
with the South Australian Cricket
Association through a careers night.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.002
That was lucky enough
to lead to a position

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.002
with the West Adelaide Football Club

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:19.010
as a head trainer
at their Centre of Excellence program.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.018
And from that, I got offered a job
with the Port Adelaide Football Club

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:23.014
in the AFL as a Sports Trainer.

00:01:23.014 --> 00:01:26.003
As a third year university student,

00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:29.014
I can't believe that I was able
to get that sort of role.

00:01:29.014 --> 00:01:32.005
At Port Adelaide, I'm lucky enough
to work with the head trainer

00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:35.015
for the Australian Rules series
between Ireland and Australia,

00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:38.007
the team doctor for
the Australian cycling team.

00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:42.006
You work with people like Elite High
Performance Managers, Sports Scientists.

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:44.017
Just to be able to feed off
what they know

00:01:44.017 --> 00:01:47.005
or just follow them around
for five minutes a day

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:50.007
can increase your chances
of getting a job anywhere in the world.

00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.014
- We do encourage students
to get involved as much as possible,

00:01:53.014 --> 00:01:55.015
using these skills, building networks,

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:58.014
and this has allowed a lot of
our students to set themselves apart

00:01:58.014 --> 00:02:01.012
and show what it means
to be a UniSA graduate.

00:02:01.012 --> 00:02:05.010
Studying a program
such as Clinical Exercise Physiology

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.003
gets you into working with

00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:10.002
apparently healthy populations
or more clinical populations.

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:12.013
Human movement
is very inter-disciplinary,

00:02:12.013 --> 00:02:14.017
combining elements of physiology,

00:02:14.017 --> 00:02:17.017
biomechanics, sociology, psychology,

00:02:17.017 --> 00:02:20.012
helping people get active
and stay active.

00:02:20.012 --> 00:02:25.002
The research at UniSA in the Human
Movement and Sports Sciences area

00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:28.006
is rated above world standard
and we're really proud of that.

00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:30.014
UniSA has a long-standing tradition

00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:34.019
of working with a variety of
sporting bodies in South Australia.

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.013
Formal cadetships with the AFL,
A-League Soccer,

00:02:38.013 --> 00:02:42.002
as well as research collaborations
with Netball SA.

00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:46.002
- Doing a degree at the University
of South Australia opens doors,

00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:47.020
not only locally, but internationally.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.012
You've got exchange programs
within the University

00:02:50.012 --> 00:02:54.002
that you can go [for] a season,
study in different organisations

00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:56.007
One piece of advice I'd give anyone

00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:58.018
studying anything,
but especially exercise sciences,

00:02:58.018 --> 00:03:04.002
to volunteer, persistence,
100 percent, never give up.

00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:07.010
And always do your best.
That's all anyone can ask.
