00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.589
We're over halfway therough the Tour de France now. We've looked at team chefs, we've looked at

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.310
team mechanics, team soigneurs, team buses

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.200
but one thing we haven't looked at yet
is perhaps the most important people on

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.889
this race

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.059
after the riders, and that's the fans. So we've come here,

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.160
to a nondescript road side in the middle of France,
to find out just how

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.160
the French celebrate the Tour de France.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.430
What better way...

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.340
Surely? It's beautiful, beautiful! Anglais ou en français? Non, français.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.840
It's the Tour de France, m*rde! You guys go home!
