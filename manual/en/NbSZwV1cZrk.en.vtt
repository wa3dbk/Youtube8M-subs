00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.279
Bicycle head badges are another small item
that are that's very easy to collect, and

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.290
some of them can be worth a significant amount
of money. Head badge is this item at the front

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.670
of a bicycle. Today, bicycles still have these,
but usually they're just stenciled on, or

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.900
as a a decal, but generally, on the older
bikes, your head badge is going to be made

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.100
either of brass or aluminum. Here are some
Schwinn head badges. People try to get one

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.230
of each style, and there are several variations
of it. It's always important that it says

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:40.140
Chicago on the bottom. If you have one that's
has Chicago and a zip code, then it's a later

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.050
badge, and generally, the cleaner and the
older they are, the better they are. There

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.600
are a lot of bicycles built by companies that
you don't associate with bicycles. This is

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.640
a Goodyear, this was from a Goodyear bicycle.
You'll find a lot of value in head badges

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.969
like this. There are Cadillac bicycles, there
were Lincoln bicycles. Any brand name that

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.350
is transferred can be transferred to cars
or motorcycles makes them more valuable. There

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.040
were Triumph head badges. Standard English
head badges; these are three different styles

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.430
of a Raleigh head badge; all have different
type of value. If you just like them for the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.800
color, then these Robin Hood badges are really
cool, and now this one's kind of butchered.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.170
What happens a lot is is people take them
off of a bike, they damage the thing, and

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.750
that's one less good head badge out there,
which increases the value of the others. Here's

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.410
a nice old brass Rollfast head badge. It's
in fair shape, but it's very good. A couple

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.821
of Roadmaster head badges, both for the same
bike; one is reversed from the other. And

00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:49.210
then a really classic head badge over here
is on this bike. This was from the late 1800's.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.280
It's an Iver Johnson bicycle. They also made
weapons. They made guns, and this head badge

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.640
even has porcelain in it which increases its
value, even though it's badly chipped.
