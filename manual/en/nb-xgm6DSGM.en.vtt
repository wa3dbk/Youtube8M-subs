Hi, I’m Kate I’m here with Zoar Outdoor
on behalf of Expert Village and we’re going

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.850
to talk about hiking today. We’re going
to talk about backpacks for extended trips.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.709
There are several options, the first thing
you need to do is determine how many nights

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.291
you’re going to be in the back country.
If you’re going to be out in the back country

00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:21.800
for more than 10 days, you should seriously
consider getting a backpack that’s at least

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.870
6,000 cubic inches, it’s a pretty big backpack.
The backpack I have here is about 3,500 cubic

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:34.750
inches, this is good for several nights in
the back country. I like backpacks that have

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.850
several different spots in the outside to
put stuff. Most backpack will have brain,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.170
which is this top section and backpacks can
have a sleeping bag compartment on the bottom.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.690
This is just another way to get into your
backpack. Same thing applies for bigger backpacks,

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.870
when you put a backpack on you’re going
to be doing your hip belt up first. When you

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.520
pack your backpack you’re going to have
your sleeping bag down here where you’re

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.600
going to have most of your weight in the bottom.
This allows it to sit on your hips a little

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.159
bit easier. You can have backpacks that don’t
have the sleeping bag compartment and just

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.770
have one huge compartment, which is just like
this backpack. Some people like these and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.439
then your just shove all your stuff inside
of it, getting all the knick and crannies

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.710
completely filled. You can also if you’re
a minimalist and you think you can get out

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.869
in the back country for a couple of nights,
you can go for the smaller backpacks. All

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:42.650
of them should have a brain to keep some important
stuff in and just extra compartments on the

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.380
outside. These are really good for fuel bottles,
water bottles, anything that you don’t want

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:56.060
a leak on all you good stuff inside. My preference
is to have straps on the bottom to put your

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.509
sleeping bag, your crazy creek or anything
else that doesn’t really fit inside your

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.320
backpack too well. Having options to attach
stuff to the outside works, you don’t want

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.170
anything too heavy though on the outside of
your backpack. If you go to any of your local

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.080
stores, they’ll help size you up for a good
backpack and getting you what you need for

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.190
what you plan on doing.
