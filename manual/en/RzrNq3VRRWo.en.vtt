Hi my name is Pastor Brian Redfearn . We began
our journey as far as wanting to increase

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:33.660
our income; not only for our family but for
the ministry we belong to, CrossStreetMinistries.org.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.170
The exceptionalism and the professionalism
of what rightlook.com has showed me and my

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:49.120
wife has been incredible. I did some research
online and you can look at the details they

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.420
put it into it. I really believe that when
you take pride in what you do, the attention

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.420
is in the detail.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:03.450
I have to say this that they are very competitive
as far as cost but I believe you pay for what

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.869
you get and by looking at what’s here and
presented… not only does it give the right

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:17.531
look (there you go, free advertising… rightlook.com).
You know, I was in the Marine Corps for a

00:01:17.531 --> 00:01:22.770
few years and attention to detail again and
order, and it just looks good.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.229
Let me say again, if you’re looking to start
your own mobile detailing company or pressure

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.940
washing company, you need to come to rightlook.com
because they just have all the right looks.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:44.369
This company really exudes all those qualities
and characteristics of what it means to be

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:53.330
a professional company. And im really satisfied
in what we feel (I don’t know if you’re

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.830
going to edit this out) for what god showed
us and this company. It’s been such a blessing

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.061
to us and again we want to say to Daniel and
the rest of the staff, they have just been

00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:06.849
so professional, extraordinary, and going
above and beyond.

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:10.190
I’ll be proud to be able to say when they
come up and ask, ‘Where’d you get it?’

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.840
and I’ll say, ‘Right there on the side,
rightlook.com.’ so, we’re forever in debt,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.680
thank you so much.
