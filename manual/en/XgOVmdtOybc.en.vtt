00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.100
What's going on everybody? Welcome to today's

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.140
tutorial on elementary number theory. 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.140
My name is Jack Jenkins and this is Academy 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.230
of One. Today I'm gonna be talking about 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.240
elements and there inverses. In

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.250
this video, I'm gonna be talking about

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.320
the additive and the multiplicative 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.320
inverse. Then I'm gonna be talking about

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.320
the well ordering principle and

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.360
lastly, the pigeonhole 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.490
principle [Music]

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.570
[Music]. The additive

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.760
inverse states that for any elements

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.880
in special set z, there is a number 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.930
that fits alpha + 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.070
the inverse of alpha equals zero.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.160
and this is true. Let's take a look.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.190
Three plus negative three equals

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.320
zero. Now I should state, it's 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.390
important to remember these for when you start proving your own

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.550
theorems. And we'll be... again, we'll be talking

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.610
more about proofs in geometry. The 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.760
multiplicative inverse states that for any

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.760
element alpha in z, there is a

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.780
number that fits alpha times the inverse of 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.890
alpha equals one. For

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.910
instance, three times the inverse of three

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.070
which is one-third, will equal one. 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.170
And if you check that you'll find that this

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.190
is true for all numbers. 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.300
[Music]

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.370
[Music]

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.490
Next, let's move into the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.490
principles. And remember these principles for they will help 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.640
you in your future journey to number theory. The

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.730
well ordering principle states that a smallest

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.750
element exist in any non zero

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.770
set. For instance, in special

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.840
set n, which is the natural numbers. 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.850
The smallest element is one. 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.950
[Music]

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.020
[Music]

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.110
[Music]. The pigeonhole principle

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.120
states that for s is 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.240
greater than k, then there will be more

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.310
than one s in K. 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.460
Now let me tell you the story on why it's called the pigeon hole 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.550
principle. Think about it like this, let's say you have

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.590
an S number of pigeons

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.720
for a k number of cages.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.790
If this is true, and it is,

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.800
then there will be more pigeons, or theres

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.890
gonna more than one pigeon in a cage. So if we have

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.940
5 pigeons and 4 cages

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.090
then one of those cages will have two 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.090
pigeons. Of course this will always be true

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.100
and it just helps reinforce the knowledge of an

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.190
inequality. That's it for today's

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.360
video on elementary number theory.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.490
Tune in next time for when we are 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.540
going to be talking about the cultz

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.550
conjecture. Now it's time

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.640

For when I will be answering your questions on either

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.020
the conclusion video, or I'll be answering your

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.110
questions on the Q&amp;A tuesday or a

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.170
hangout thursdays. There called hangout thursdays now. 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.310
Or I'll be doing a podcast soon, so you'll

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.390
maybe get your answer done on the 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.400
podcast if you're nice enough. And

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.510
lastly, you can go ahead and donate.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.570
And also subscribe to our youtube channel. 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.720
It will make us look better. Have a great day.
