Hi, I'm Jim Harmon with California Pest Management
here in sunny southern California. We're going

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.099
to talk a little bit about how do you keep
snakes away from your house. Now in southern

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.019
California, a lot of our snake issues are
going to be predatory snakes, they're going

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:21.810
after crickets, smaller insects and also going
after rodents. So the first thing is keep

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.460
the rats and mice out and away from your house
and off your property whenever possible. In

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.800
other words, limit food sources, engage a
good pest control company to do a good preventative

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.660
program for you. Eliminate the food source
you won't have the problem. Second, habitat.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.280
This right here behind us is a wonderful habitat.
The snakes can get inside and have a nice

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.100
place to hide and stay away from everybody.
They like a nice warm spot after they've eaten,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.610
that way they can digest their food. A lot
of this overgrowth we see here on this hedge,

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.110
that's great for snakes because they have
lots of places to hide. This needs to be trimmed

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.940
back and thinned and kept in good shape. The
next area we got to be concerned about it,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.140
these tall berries, again, keep them cleaned
up, especially around the base of them, but

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.100
when you go into the pool areas, everybody
has a pool also has all their pool equipment.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.640
That is a neglected area. These are all quiet
zones. Not only can rats and mice develop

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.690
in there but snakes love them. OK now one
of the other areas, we have a nice garage

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.660
here and a tool shed next to it. We don't
normally go into these everyday, usually on

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.330
the weekends but you can see we've got little
cracks and holes in the corners and a lot

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.240
of times you might even have this left open.
Next to it I've also got a lot of pots stored.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.299
Now these pots when you have them all stored
and jumbled over, that's a great place for

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.400
the snakes to hide too. So we have a lot of
hiding spots for them and we really need to

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.350
make sure that they don't have any place to
go. That needs to be cleaned up and sealed

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.892
up. And these ponds especially above ground,
there's a lot of areas around it for a snake

00:02:01.892 --> 00:02:07.070
to hide. Now unfortunately this particular
aquascape, this little pond here, is right

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.370
next to the back door. So if you happen to
come out to your backyard and you leave the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.421
door a little bit open, the snake's right
here, they can scoot straight on inside and

00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:18.780
they feel the cold air, they're going to go
on in and hide.
