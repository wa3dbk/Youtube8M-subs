[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.240
- I'm Curtis Smith.

00:00:11.254 --> 00:00:13.670
We're at Osuna Nursery, where
we've been looking at trees.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.260
We looked at some
shade trees that

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.420
are really well-adapted
for Northern New Mexico.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.890
Now, we're in the
conifers, trees

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.590
which make you feel like you're
walking through the forest.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.780
These are excellent
plants for Northern New

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.500
Mexico for the most part.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.490
But they're good for the
whole state of New Mexico.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.960
Rick, what do we
have right here?

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.700
- Curtis, we've
got a Bosnian pine.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.860
It gets about 40 feet tall.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.200
And it will take minimum
temperatures down

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.976
to 30 degrees.

00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:39.600
- So it takes pretty
cold temperatures.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.150
So it'd be good way up
in Northern New Mexico,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.983
up on the mountains.

00:00:41.983 --> 00:00:44.200
So that's a good
one, 10 feet tall.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.990
- 30.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.716
- 30 feet tall.

00:00:45.716 --> 00:00:46.340
- 30 feet tall.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.964
- That's right.

00:00:46.964 --> 00:00:49.280
So that's a pretty nice
sized tree, not a giant

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.650
tree, but really
well-proportioned to a lot

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.430
of landscapes.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.220
And over here, we've got
some Upright Juniper.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.160
These are some that are
useful throughout the state.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.410
This is good, hardy in the
northern part of the state,

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.280
And upright form is useful for
many purposes in the landscape.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.470
Now, this is what I expect
from an Upright Juniper.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.780
Over here, however, is something
that is unusual for an upright.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.880
I noticed it has a spiral form.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.260
- Yeah, we get these in.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.000
And they come in like this.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.190
And an expert has gone
with a small chainsaw

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.890
and taken out everything
that isn't spiral.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.380
And the homeowner can
take a pair of clippers

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.574
and just clip these, so
to keep them like this.

00:01:26.574 --> 00:01:27.740
- So they can maintain that.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.615
As it gets bigger,
they'll let it get bigger.

00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:32.060
But they still maintain
that form to it.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.340
That is interesting and
useful in some settings

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.510
in the landscape.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.450
And I see you have others, some
that aren't spiral and some

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.300
that are trimmed to be spiral.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.210
And I see over here the
Austrian Black Pine.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.460
It's a good well-adapted tree,
especially for lower-land-type

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.850
of settings where the
Ponderosa doesn't do well.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.000
The Ponderosa does
good in the mountains.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.100
This has a lot of the
appearance of a Ponderosa.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.050
But it's better adapted
to lowland soils.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.234
It's a good tree.

00:01:55.234 --> 00:01:56.150
- That's a great tree.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.370
- And a good windbreak
tree in many cases.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.510
This one is different.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.220
- This is a Tanyosho Pine.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.350
- Tanyosho.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.800
- Right, well, they grow them
in Japan, I know in Kyoto.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.039
And this one has a single trunk.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.110
And we've also got another
one over here that's

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.390
a little more natural looking.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.320
- OK, So they're both nice.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.120
How big does this get?

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.085
- These get about 10
feet, 12 feet tall.

00:02:19.085 --> 00:02:21.080
- So it's appropriate
for a lot of landscapes.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.420
So that looks like an
interesting tree to have.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.120
Then in here, I see the
Japanese Black Pine.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.950
And that's a
fast-growing pine tree.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.250
- Yeah, you can see the
candles on these guys

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.300
are already a
couple of feet tall.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.050
- Growing fast.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.061
And this grows with a
very irregular and kind

00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:37.310
of twisting form, which is
interesting in a landscape.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.935
- That's right.

00:02:37.935 --> 00:02:41.480
- So this is a good tree to have
as well, and well-adapted here.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.479
Lots of forest, it's
really pretty in here

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:44.270
with all the trees.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.060
But I see we're getting close
to some of my favorites.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.910
The Deodar Cedars, one
of the true cedars,

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.270
native to the Middle East.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.530
And so it's fairly
well-adapted to our conditions.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.569
It's hardiness though is
not for Northern New Mexico.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.360
It will make it up to
Albuquerque and maybe

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.310
a little further north.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.935
- That's right.

00:03:00.935 --> 00:03:02.720
Yeah, about 0
degrees it'll take.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.230
- OK, but this is a tree where
the spruce doesn't do well,

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.220
this will do better.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.990
And it has the form
of a very elegant

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.870
looking spruce, very
graceful, weeping form.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.750
The tip at the top is usually
bent over a little bit.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.640
So it's a very attractive tree.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.125
And I noticed on the tag that
it says it's deer-resistant.

00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:20.750
- That's right.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.780
- And that's a nice thing
to know for New Mexico.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.640
So we need to know
that's good if you're

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.870
going to have deer problems.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.244
But it's still an
attractive tree

00:03:28.244 --> 00:03:29.880
if you don't have
to worry about that.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.671
- I really like it.

00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:34.705
- And there are other
types of true cedar.

00:03:34.705 --> 00:03:35.330
Look over here.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.390
This is a Leyland Cypress.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.040
- Yeah, the Leyland Cypress.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.260
People use these as
windbreaks a lot.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.330
They plant them in groupings.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.400
- Fairly fast growing,
very attractive,

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.900
makes a good windbreak.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.120
But it's also an
attractive landscape plant.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.379
Now, right over here,
I see one that looks--

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.920
maybe somebody would
think it's sick.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.840
But it's variegated.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.339
- Right.

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:59.174
- It has a natural
yellow color in it.

00:03:59.174 --> 00:03:59.840
It's attractive.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.430
Nice to have.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.990
And it fits in certain places
where the Leyland might not

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.580
be just exactly the
right plant to have.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.670
And around the corner
here, the little guys.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.320
- We have the Mugo Pines.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.640
- Mugo is a nice plant.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.819
It's a tree.

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:12.860
But it doesn't grow tall.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.820
These are dwarf and are good for
planting around the foundation,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.863
for putting along a sidewalk
in situations like that.

00:04:19.863 --> 00:04:21.279
So a good one to
have, but they do

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.510
have a little bit of a
problem with the pine tip

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.730
moth, actually a big problem.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.480
So this is one that
takes some maintenance

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.270
to protect it from being
damaged by pine tip moths.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.645
It may require some
spraying if it's used.

00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:33.020
But one of our
extension services

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.840
entomologists is releasing
a wasp, a parasitic wasp,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.034
that doesn't hurt people,
but it kills pine tip moths.

00:04:39.034 --> 00:04:40.700
So we're hoping that
will take root here

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.590
and it will solve
the problem here.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.590
And behind it, I see the
spruce, the Black Hills

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.210
Spruce, the Colorado Spruce.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.460
And over here, you've got
the Blue Colorado Spruce.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.544
Now, these are good trees.

00:04:50.544 --> 00:04:52.584
When you get into the
northern part of the state,

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:53.900
these are really good trees.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.820
And of course, people
really like the blue

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.365
of the Blue Colorado Spruce.

00:04:57.365 --> 00:04:59.270
And you've got some
other little guys here.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.740
These are not
dwarf, but these are

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.060
dwarfed by the work of
people keeping them dwarfed.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.540
These are bonsai.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.690
- Yeah, these are bonsai that
we have here at the nursery.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.550
There must be a good
10 trees in here.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.920
And we've got some Trident
Maples back here, maybe

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.097
about a dozen of them.

00:05:16.097 --> 00:05:16.930
- Interesting grove.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.555
And we're going to
come back, and we're

00:05:18.555 --> 00:05:20.950
going to do a show here
on bonsai in the future.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.320
That's something
I'm looking forward

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.575
to because that's a talent.

00:05:23.575 --> 00:05:25.870
It's an art that a lot of
people are interested in

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.900
and don't think they can do it.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.800
And I think they can.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.385
I appreciate the tour.

00:05:30.385 --> 00:05:32.030
I like the trees.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.900
And I need people in New
Mexico to know that this

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.250
is something they can do.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.849
So thank you.

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:37.890
- Curtis, you're welcome.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.640
