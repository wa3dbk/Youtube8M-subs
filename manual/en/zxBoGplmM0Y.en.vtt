00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:03.059
- We made it
through the small intestine,

00:00:03.083 --> 00:00:05.975
where most of our chemical
digestion has happened

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:08.976
and most of
our absorption has happened.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.975
And now we enter a structure

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:13.976
that is structurally
much different.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.477
If you look at it,
there is no question.

00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:18.185
We are somewhere new.

00:00:18.209 --> 00:00:21.518
We are no longer
in Kansas anymore,

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:26.477
because we exit the ileum and we
enter this giant green thing,

00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:29.894
which is the large intestine.

00:00:29.918 --> 00:00:32.643
Another name
for the large intestine,

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:36.393
that's the intestine,
is the colon.

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:39.101
And just like the small
intestine has multiple parts,

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:42.975
the large
intestine has multiple parts.

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:47.226
Food travels from the ileum
into the first part

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.975
of the large intestine,
which is the cecum.

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:52.393
So from the large intest--

00:00:52.417 --> 00:01:00.143
no, from the ileum
we go into the cecum.

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:03.101
The cecum is
like this little pouch.

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:09.975
And because the ileum is so long
and the jejunum is so long,

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:11.852
basically, if I'm going to--

00:01:11.876 --> 00:01:13.975
if we are going
to expect that you know

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:15.975
from a gross anatomy perspective

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:19.143
what part of the small
intestine are we in,

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:21.018
if you are close
to the large intestine,

00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:22.935
if you are close to the cecum,

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:25.852
then you know that you
are in the ileum.

00:01:25.876 --> 00:01:28.226
The cecum, this little pouch,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.975
the appendix actually
hangs off of the cecum.

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:34.435
And the appendix is literally

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.643
this little wormy thing
that hangs off of the pouch.

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:44.143
Now, this is awesome
because the cecum,

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:45.685
food in the cecum,

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:52.975
travels upward
in the ascending colon.

00:01:52.999 --> 00:02:02.894
And then it travels across,
in the transverse colon,

00:02:02.918 --> 00:02:13.185
and then it travels down
in the descending colon.

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.975
What?
How nice is that?

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:21.975
And then it travels through kind
of an S-shaped space,

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:28.185
no, tube, and that S-shaped
tube is called the sigmoid.

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.975
Doesn't that sound
like a curly word?

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:33.727
The sigmoid colon.

00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:37.852
And then rectum means straight.

00:02:37.876 --> 00:02:42.685
So, the tube sigmoids,
and then it straightens out,

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.518
and that is your rectum.
The rectum is straight.

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:50.768
And the rectum is where, dude,
we're on our way out.

00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:52.975
The only thing that is found
in the rectum is stuff

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:56.975
that is going
to be gone shortly.

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:59.185
And you pass through the anus,
you do?

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.268
No, goodness.
Holy cow.

00:03:02.292 --> 00:03:05.018
Food passes from the rectum out.

00:03:05.042 --> 00:03:06.727
It's not even food anymore.
What is it?

00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:07.975
It's leftovers
that your body is,

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:11.685
like, dude, I don't even
want that stuff anymore,

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.975
and it passes through your anus
and out into your toilet.

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:20.975
Now, what happened to this food?
It really is food.

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:22.685
It is what you just ate.

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.143
That is your meal.

00:03:25.167 --> 00:03:29.602
The feces that you
produced is stuff

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.975
that was literally never
inside your body.

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:36.185
It never--you took everything
you want out of it,

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.560
and whatever is left over
is going in the toilet.

00:03:40.584 --> 00:03:42.018
And it must pass
through your anus.

00:03:42.042 --> 00:03:44.768
Now, most of the absorption

00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:46.852
of nutrients happens
in the small intestine.

00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:48.976
There is some nutrient
absorption

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.560
that happens in the large
intestine,

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:53.101
but most of it
is water absorption.

00:03:53.125 --> 00:03:55.935
So the function
of the large intestine

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.852
really is to absorb water.

00:03:57.876 --> 00:03:59.560
We've got
some important nutrients

00:03:59.584 --> 00:04:02.101
that are produced by bacteria.

00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:04.810
What?
Bacteria make vitamin K

00:04:04.834 --> 00:04:08.018
in your large intestine,
and then you absorb that,

00:04:08.042 --> 00:04:10.643
which, that's awesome.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:12.935
So, there is some absorption
of important stuff

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.852
that's happening
in your large intestine,

00:04:14.876 --> 00:04:16.975
but for the most
part it is water.

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:20.560
And then you can pack down
your little poopies,

00:04:20.584 --> 00:04:25.351
and then they
come out your anus.

00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:26.975
That's it.

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.602
Dude, we're done
with the large intestine.

00:04:29.626 --> 00:04:31.226
Let's talk about our
accessory structures

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.918
because those guys are cool.
