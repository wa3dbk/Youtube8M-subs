00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:05.135
the tabbit is a traditional model

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.666
I recommend using dual color paper

00:00:07.714 --> 00:00:09.706
but any paper will do the job

00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:11.107
it is low intermediate

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:15.528
because there are swivel folds and other advanced folds

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.974
fold diangonally color side down

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.387
this color will be the color of the rabbit

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.646
we get this brown-ish color

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.646
okay

00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:30.757
now we've done that

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.477
fold the lower corners upwards

00:00:34.953 --> 00:00:36.818
to the corner in the middle

00:00:37.211 --> 00:00:40.751
(also see diagram)

00:00:45.132 --> 00:00:47.933
make sure that the open part

00:00:49.306 --> 00:00:51.298
points downwards

00:00:52.076 --> 00:00:55.322
and fold the edges to the centre

00:00:55.442 --> 00:00:56.537
this way

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:00.291
both sides

00:01:01.418 --> 00:01:02.664
open part here

00:01:03.808 --> 00:01:04.776
and fold there

00:01:06.078 --> 00:01:09.205
and repeat

00:01:21.377 --> 00:01:24.520
now we'll do a squash fold

00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:31.297
the fold is prepared by folding this angle bisector here

00:01:31.794 --> 00:01:33.794
open again

00:01:34.598 --> 00:01:37.272
seperate the 4 layers

00:01:37.312 --> 00:01:38.669
2 on each side

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.161
and push down

00:01:42.923 --> 00:01:45.319
as you see I...

00:01:46.954 --> 00:01:49.470
did not arrange the layers right

00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:51.690
that one has to ho to the right

00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:53.269
there we go

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.846
same on the other side

00:01:58.155 --> 00:02:02.806
the precrease is optional but makes the squash easier

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.216
open

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.597
push down and crease again

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:12.909
now we have 2 big pockets

00:02:12.957 --> 00:02:15.298
fold the model in half

00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:20.518
you can see those ears

00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:25.079
grab the ear and swivel it around

00:02:25.341 --> 00:02:26.801
that way

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:31.577
turn the paper

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:33.299
inside of the model

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.061
flaten everything

00:02:40.504 --> 00:02:44.218
also swivel the other ear

00:02:44.723 --> 00:02:50.001
that is what the black arrow in the diagram means

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:54.688
repeat on the other side

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.619
there we go

00:03:03.361 --> 00:03:06.115
make it look nice

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:10.734
now we fold the ears

00:03:16.242 --> 00:03:17.266
in this way

00:03:17.401 --> 00:03:18.591
here goes the crease

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.919
fold to that corner

00:03:22.046 --> 00:03:23.070
from here

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:24.443
to that point

00:03:24.506 --> 00:03:25.800
the edges align

00:03:26.145 --> 00:03:28.248
with that 90Â°-angle

00:03:29.296 --> 00:03:32.439
repeat for other ear

00:03:33.625 --> 00:03:34.681
crease

00:03:35.675 --> 00:03:37.532
done

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.186
the edge is vertilcal

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:46.726
seperate the layers

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.440
and wrap them around here

00:03:48.617 --> 00:03:50.189
creating a crease here

00:03:50.268 --> 00:03:51.808
and on the back

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.094
also crease here

00:03:55.951 --> 00:03:57.681
pull them back

00:03:58.064 --> 00:04:00.921
and the front will move downwards

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:03.865
creating the head of the rabbit

00:04:05.215 --> 00:04:07.279
that could be a little tricky

00:04:07.284 --> 00:04:09.379
so take your time for that

00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:11.466
optinally shape the ears

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.688
as you see that can easly rip the paper

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:22.284
I chosse the inside of the ear to be white

00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:25.927
but you can also have them colored, if you want

00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:28.559
inside-reverse-fold the nose

00:04:30.354 --> 00:04:38.906
two more reverse folds for the back and tail of the rabbit

00:04:41.292 --> 00:04:42.832
number one

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:45.665
and number two

00:04:48.515 --> 00:04:50.967
to make the tail white

00:04:51.162 --> 00:04:55.654
you can insidereversfold a part if the paper if you want to

00:04:56.477 --> 00:05:00.929
that is a little difficult so don't feel the need to do it

00:05:01.077 --> 00:05:02.887
it is not in the diagram

00:05:03.907 --> 00:05:05.676
seperate the two layers

00:05:05.726 --> 00:05:07.639
inside reversefold that part

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.877
finally but them back together

00:05:10.207 --> 00:05:13.937
and repeat the two reversefolds

00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:18.613
the folding is done

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.867
you can bend and shape the body a little

00:05:22.981 --> 00:05:25.235
to make the rabbit stand

00:05:25.354 --> 00:05:26.783
finished!

00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:28.355
I hope you enjoyed that
