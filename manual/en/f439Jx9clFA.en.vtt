00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.800
Donut: What happened?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.720
Grif: BIG...

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.040
TANK...

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.140
SHOOT...

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.440
WhOOO!

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.980
Simmons: Damn, man. We only ran, like, 300 feet. You are REALLY out of shape.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.780
GRIF: FUCK...

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.020
YOU.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.540
Donut: Where's your car?

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.040
Simmons: General Patton here had a great strategy to leave it behind.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.560
Grif: Hey, it would've worked if that tank hadn't shown up.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.360
Donut: You lost the jeep? Oh, man, Lopez is gonna be pissed.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.500
Where is it?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.000
[explosion]

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
[crash]

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.220
Grif: What the hell?

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.740
[explosion]

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.860
[explosion]
SON OF A BITCH!

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.300
Donut: Oh crap! What the hell is that thing?

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.000
Grif: That's the tank!

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.700
Donut: Hey, uh... Grif, uh, you wanna hold the flag for a little bit?

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.380
Grif: No! Get that away from me!

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.080
[explosion]

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.720
Tucker: Why do you keep firing at the jeep?

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.940
Caboose: Because it's locked on.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.980
Sheila: Target locked.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.900
Tucker: Well, unlock it!

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.780
Caboose: Last time I unlocked it, I killed Church!

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.980
Tucker: Oh, right.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.600
Keep shooting the jeep, then.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.080
Donut: I hate to be the one to point this out, guys.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.200
But I think we're screwed.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.340
[explosion]
Simmons: Yeah, I have to agree with the rookie on this one.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.440
Simmons: Yeah, I have to agree with the rookie on this one.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.400
[radio noise]

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.240
Sarge: Blood Gulch Outpost Number One.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.880
Come in Blood Gulch Outpost, come in.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.320
Do you read me? This is Sergeant-

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.540
Grif: Oh my God, Sarge! Is that you?

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.360
Sarge: Roger that, Private. I am currently inbound to your position from Command.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.100
Simmons: Sir, this is Simmons!

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.160
[explosion]
Simmons: Sir, this is Simmons!

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.880
Sarge: Hello, Simmons. I hope everything has gone alright while I've been gone.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.540
Grif: Actually, sir, things are kind of hectic right now.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.000
The new rookie arrived, and somehow he managed to infiltrate the Blue base.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.700
And now we have their flag, the warthog is damaged,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.140
one of their guys is dead, and there's this huge fucking tank about to destroy our base.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.280
Sarge: Am I talking to the right base?

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.800
Grif: Sarge, we are going to die here.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.760
Sarge: Well then, hold tight, boys. I think I've got a solution to your little tank problem.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.340
Tucker: Uh oh.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.000
[zoom]

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.920
Tucker: H-hey, Caboose? You might want to get out of the tank. Like, right now.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.260
Caboose: I can't figure out how to get this thing open!

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.880
Sheila: Night vision engaged.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.400
Tucker: Rookie, get out now!

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.760
[explosions]
Caboose: Okay, open the do- okay, alright, Sheila, would you please open the door?

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.140
Sheila: Driver canopy opened.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.180
Thank you for using the M808V Main Battle Ta-

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.680
[explosion]

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.060
[explosion]
Caboose: Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, running, running, running!

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.220
Caboose: Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, running, running, running!

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.160
Man, that was close.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.740
Tucker: Look at your tank, though.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.460
Sheila: I'm scared, Dave. Will I dream?

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.660
Daaaai-sy...

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.780
Daaaai-sy...

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.900
Caboose: SHEEEEEILAAAAA! NOOOO!

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.180
Tucker: What? No! Sheila! Sheila!

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.480
Wait...

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.680
Who's Sheila?

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.220
Caboose: Sheila's the lady in the tank.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.800
She was my friend.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.340
Tucker: Oh, dude! I knew you could pick up chicks in a tank.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.800
Grif: What's up, forever alone?

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.400
So, uh, you wanna do something with your life, or do you just wanna sit around on your ass all day like a loser?

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.200
Yeah! Me too!

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.800
So, uh, just subscribe and keep watching YouTube. It's way easier!
