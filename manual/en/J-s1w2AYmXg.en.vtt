00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.100
Bugs: Eeh! You scared me to death.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.420
Daffy: That's precisely what I wanted to talk to you about.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.640
Choking on that pizza has really made me think about things,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.100
specifically the arrangements in the the event of my...

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.120
passing...

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.740
Bugs: What?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.400
Daffy: Lay me to rest inside a Corvette

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.280
With a trunk full of yogurt for the afterlife.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.000
Pull the Corvette with a team of Clydesdales.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.660
Make sure that Tina is there by my side.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.440
Bugs: What if she's not dead?

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.500
Daffy: Just make it work!

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.520
For my eulogy get Neil Diamond to sing.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.320
And use lots of quotes from "Lord of the Rings".

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.320
In lieu of flowers buy some raw meat.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.840
Then pay some pirates to dance in the street.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.080
Bugs: What?!

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.560
Daffy: And the party will rage for 900 days

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.420
With bonfires and swearing and random gun play.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.040
And plaster the town with photos of me.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.200
This is my decree. It's my legacy.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.700
Cryogenically freeze my brain

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.520
So the scientists can tinker.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.360
Think of the knowledge that they'd retain

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.420
From one of the world's great thinkers.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.800
It's a trifecta can't you see.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.520
It's me, da Vinci, and Socrates.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.220
Bugs: Are we still talking about your memorial?

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.180
Daffy: Yup.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.340
All the kids must attend

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.260
Daffy Duck High

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.100
And train as brick masons

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.160
And twirlers and spies.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.960
Though some should be ninjas

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.840
That do awesome stunts.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.800
They'd all wear black robes

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.440
With my face on the front.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.460
The 50 yard line at the Rose Bowl works great

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.020
For my huge marble statue with a big gold name plate.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.960
Or under the Sphinx or a pyramid

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.360
But right at the top just open the lid.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.640
And the party will rage for 900 days

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.200
With bonfires and swearing and random gun play.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.860
And plaster the town with photos of me.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.480
This is my decree! It's my legacy.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:48.040
This is my decree! It's my legacy.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.020
Daffy: So, what do you say?

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.760
Bugs: Why wait?

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.000
Daffy: What are you doing?

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.020
Not now.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.360
The future.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.280
Way off in the future!
