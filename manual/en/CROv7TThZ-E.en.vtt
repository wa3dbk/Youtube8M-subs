00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.080
Now we will talk about changing or replacing
the blade on a table saw. As you can see there

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:16.750
is a little insert which has a little finger
hole. You remove the insert; you bring your

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:30.180
blade all the way up and with two wrenches
provided with one you lock the pin in place,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:49.600
with the second one you undo the bolt from
the shaft. You also remove the little anti-vibration

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:59.530
collar. Take the blade off, you replace it
with the new one. You gently slide it into

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:07.840
place, making sure the blade is firmly against
the guard inside the saw, you replace the

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:25.380
vibration collar, you replace the bolt.
Sometimes folks you have to be a bit patient

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:37.240
because those things are tight, and the procedure
you reverse. You gently do not over tighten

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:50.799
the screw or the bolt, I'm sorry. You lower
the blade

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:57.140
and you replace the inset plate. One thing
I forgot to tell you and it's very important;

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.569
you obviously unplug the tool before you do
any of this type of maintenance. This is for

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:10.039
your safety just in case any accidental switch
on may happen. Thank You.
