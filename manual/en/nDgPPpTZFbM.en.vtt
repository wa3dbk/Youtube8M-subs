Hi, this is Yolanda Vanveen, and in this segment,
we're going to talk about how to grow the

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:11.890
common sunflower, also known as helianthus
annuus. It's a beautiful, just the common

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.960
sunflower, that you see all over the world.
Now, the sunflowers have been around, for

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.630
as long as man has been around, and the earliest
records of sunflowers, were produced by the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.890
Incas of Peru, so they called the sunflower
the flower of the gods. They believed that

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.910
the gods had brought them the sunflower, and
most sunflower oils come from the common sunflower,

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.929
so that helianthus annuus, is really important
to the human population, and the human civilization,

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:48.059
because we've used it since the beginning
of time, but they're a great garden flower

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.199
too, and there's just a few rules when you
grow them that you should follow, so it's

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.969
already November, and this sunflower is totally,
it's dying, it's done its time. It was planted

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.320
late in the summer. That's the great part.
You can put the seeds out, as late as even

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.020
July, and if you live in a milder climate
like the northwest, you can get blooms into

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.140
October and November, and as soon as they
die, I just let them die back, and it's starting

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.290
to freeze too, but I like to let the plant
go to seed, but saying that, even as they

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.280
die back, each one of these little seeds,
these are actually seeds. They haven't dried

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.840
up, they haven't turned black yet, but they're
still going to create another plant, so I

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.890
will let the plant just go to seed, and that's
the best thing that you can do, is just to

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.250
leave it in your garden, and it will drop
the seeds for the next year, so they are an

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.110
annual, in the fact that they'll come back
every year from the seeds, and they're hardy.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.200
They're hardy to zones four to zone nine,
so they can handle a lot of cold, cold temperatures.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.750
They can reach up to twelve feet tall too,
on certain different varieties, so you have

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.750
to be careful, and sometimes they need to
be staked, or they'll fall over, if there

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.040
is too much sun hitting them. Sunflowers need
full, hot sun all day. They don't like any

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.190
shade at all, and the best way to start them
is by seed in the summer, or in the spring,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.440
and then they'll come right up, and they'll
bloom quite quickly. They're really an amazing

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.560
plant, and they'll grow from zones four to
nine, so wherever you grow, they'll do really

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.970
well. If you live in a really windy, windy
area, sometimes you have to stake them, or

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.550
put them to the side of the house, where the
wind is a little bit more moderate, because

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.780
it's being protected by the house, but other
than that, they'll grow on their own. They

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.980
really don't need you, and they're a great
garden addition.
