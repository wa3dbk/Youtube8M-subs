00:00:09.317 --> 00:00:10.360
November 30th.

00:00:10.526 --> 00:00:11.653
10:43.

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:13.113
Bright sunny day.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.621
Innocent people.

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:16.825
Truck approaches
from the west entrance.

00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:18.541
No! No!
You can't park here!

00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:20.325
10:45...

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.917
No time to do anything about it.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.754
This is the most
high profile murder case

00:00:29.527 --> 00:00:30.967
in British history.

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:34.301
You and Ms. Hall are defending the
accused terrorist from the government.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:37.179
And you're from the New York Times.
I don't speak to journalists

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:39.848
about trials relating to matters
of national security.

00:00:40.014 --> 00:00:42.601
Do you know of any reason
which would prejudice your ability

00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:44.436
to carry out this case?

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:46.563
No, my Lord.

00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:48.732
No my Lord, I know of no reason.

00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:54.071
There is some evidence against you

00:00:54.237 --> 00:00:56.740
which the prosecution believes
should be kept secret

00:00:56.906 --> 00:00:58.898
from the public and from you.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.245
You broke into my chambers.

00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:03.038
I think you're mistaken.

00:01:03.498 --> 00:01:04.289
Claudia.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:05.666
We're being managed.

00:01:06.977 --> 00:01:09.253
Within six month our client
goes from driving a taxi

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.430
to driving a brand new Mercedes.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.758
Spending two grand a week.
Where did all the money come from?

00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:17.344
British intelligence
brought him in as a double agent.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.180
He was supposed to lead them
to the terrorist cell before the attack.

00:01:21.654 --> 00:01:23.225
And that's where it all went wrong.

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:26.228
Prior to the bombing
there was no contact

00:01:26.673 --> 00:01:29.022
between MI5 and the defendant?

00:01:30.127 --> 00:01:32.925
Defense lawyers who ask
the wrong sorts of questions,

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:34.903
they are expendable.

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:39.491
There are over half a million
closed circuit cameras in London.

00:01:39.657 --> 00:01:42.619
I'm sure there are at least half a dozen
watching right now.

00:01:43.526 --> 00:01:46.164
There are people
who really want a conviction here.

00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:50.502
You should have kept
your mouth shut.

00:01:50.668 --> 00:01:53.396
MI5 do not kill people
on the main land.

00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:55.276
What the hell
have you got yourself into?

00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:57.259
We're simply trying
to defend our client.

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:01.179
Dump your bag, dump everything.

00:02:01.345 --> 00:02:02.598
Get out of there. Now!

00:02:07.905 --> 00:02:09.313
There are powers at play

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.650
that neither you nor I
may even hope to control.
