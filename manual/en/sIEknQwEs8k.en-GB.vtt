To make Kashmiri pulao, first we’ll
cut the almonds and cashews.

Cut each almond into 6 or 7 pieces.

00:01:36.342 --> 00:01:42.795

We've cut the dry fruits.

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:06.187
Now let's prepare the pulao.

00:02:06.522 --> 00:02:11.279
Heat a pan and add ghee to it.

00:02:12.436 --> 00:02:14.014
Let it melt.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.154

00:02:26.092 --> 00:02:30.020
Peel off the black cardamom and add it to the pan.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.225
Now add tej pata to it and roast a little.

00:02:37.944 --> 00:02:59.334
Add ginger, ginger paste, green chilli and dry fruits to it.

00:02:59.905 --> 00:03:02.967
Roast everything on low flame.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:27.224
You can add dry fruits of your choice.

00:03:28.701 --> 00:03:29.903
Add dry currants as well.

00:03:30.216 --> 00:03:34.872
Leave a few dry fruits to be used later for garnishing.

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:40.067
Our masala is now roasted.
We get a fragrance from it.

00:03:40.568 --> 00:03:45.880
Add saunf powder and rice.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:54.347
Now add salt and red chilly powder.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:04.845
If you prefer eating spicy food, then you can
increase the quantity of red chilly powder.

00:04:06.196 --> 00:04:12.415
Roast the rice this way for 2 minutes.

00:04:16.251 --> 00:04:19.587
We have cooked the rice properly,
so now we'll add water to it.

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:26.766
Now add 2 cups of water in 1 cup rice.

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.196
Mix it properly.

00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:42.782
Cover the rice and cook for 5
minutes on low flame. Then check.

00:04:43.103 --> 00:04:55.530
We are cooking rice in a utensil, you can
even make it in a cooker or a microwave.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.796
Now let’s check the rice.

00:04:58.132 --> 00:05:01.194
We cooked the rice for 10 minutes in total.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:06.929
First we cooked the rice for 5
minutes, they were not fully cooked.

00:05:07.351 --> 00:05:12.975
Then we cooked them for another 5 minutes.

00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:14.310
Mix it thoroughly.

00:05:14.542 --> 00:05:19.844
We cooked the rice on low flame.

00:05:20.211 --> 00:05:32.467
Make sure you cook it on low flame
so that the water does not dry.

00:05:32.815 --> 00:05:41.795
We will cook rice on low flame so that the steam remains
inside the utensil only and the water does not dry.

00:05:42.055 --> 00:05:44.640
Cook the rice for another 2-3 minutes.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.320
After this check.

00:05:49.047 --> 00:05:54.094
We have cooked the rice for
another 3 minutes on low flame.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.506
The water is now completely absorbed.

00:05:58.077 --> 00:06:01.568
Mix it properly.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:10.795
Our rice are now cooked.
But leave the rice as it is for 10-15 minutes.

00:06:11.021 --> 00:06:12.684
Turn off the flame.

00:06:12.943 --> 00:06:19.270
The rice will absorb the remaining water and will get fluffy.

00:06:24.786 --> 00:06:31.005
15 minutes are over and our rice is quite fluffy.

00:06:31.441 --> 00:06:40.597
We can now remove the tej patta and
cinnamon sticks from it if we want.

00:06:41.122 --> 00:06:44.958
Mix everything once again.

00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:46.965
Serve the rice on a plate.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.903
Garnish the rice with coriander leaves and dry fruits.

00:07:02.427 --> 00:07:05.239
Our kashmiri pulao is now ready.

00:07:05.693 --> 00:07:12.333
We have cooked rice along with dry fruits and masala.

00:07:12.575 --> 00:07:30.239
You can even cook the rice first and then add
roasted dry fruits and masala to it later.
