00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.490
there's legislation has been uh...
proposed by arrives at paul brown

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.070
republican of georgia

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.199
to make that two thousand

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.380
ten that year

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.510
of the bible

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.150
all thank god because we really need a
year by the allies bible to fall apart

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.199
they said well i i don't hear as a sport

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.060
uh... evil i think a lot about biting
barney frank and the best job

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.100
uh... the use of the schools courses
democrat from

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.149
last uses is that the seventeen thousand
i'd

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.930
is not the revival

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.570
if you do that in tennis

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.250
he said uh... was two thousand twelve
the year of the crime

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.940
civilian air

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.600
waited in the business of passing around
solution

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.030
say no to really the bible rocks

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.450
and this year pulpits all about the
bible

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.850
of course republicans disagree with this

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.300
and this is not the first time they
tried that he did try to thousand i'd

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.560
he didn't get enough support so i guess
that doesn't mind

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.510
was not the year of the bible

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.360
and observers along the or the city
bipartisan i wanna get as many democrats

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.810
as we can on board

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.830
surprisingly had no democrats have gone
on board

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.880
because it's a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.910
that the middle of the bible

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.430
but we don't need a resolution for let
alone the questionable constitutionality

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.189
of that resolution which by the way
would also college absolutely nothing

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.689
we're trying to fix the economy here
there were about people's health care

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.780
here passing through the resolution of
the year the bible please

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.350

in nineteen eighty-three ronald reagan

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.790
the year the bottle pastor

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.340

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.890
yet about life how do you think he's
really rebuild go back to that well

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.179
