00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.799
Who should play the new Spider-Man?

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.519
A question that has been floating around ever
since the Marvel Sony deal happened about

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:11.519
a month ago.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.290
Many people have offered the choices, and
so today I’m going through the actors that

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.850
have been rumored and deciding if they’re
Spidey worthy.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.000
Alright, let’s do this.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.950
The first one and the one that will probably
happen is Logan Lerman.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.770
If you don’t know him, he’s probably most
famous for playing Percy Jackson, but he was

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.270
also in Fury, which I haven’t seen, and
Noah, which I also haven’t seen.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.521
Now, I like Logan Lerman as an actor, and
he seems like an all around cool dude, but

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:32.910
I don’t really see him as Spider-Man.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.910
I think he’d make a pretty great Peter Parker,
but Spider-Man.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.070
Here’s how I see it.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.750
Tobey Maguire: great Peter Parker, not that
great of a Spider-Man.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.780
Andrew Garfield: great Spider-Man, not that
great of a Peter Parker.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.960
If we could get someone who takes the best
of those worlds, then that would be great.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.340
And who knows, maybe Lerman is the guy who
can do it.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.420
But I have my doubts.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.610
Maybe he will surprise me.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.440
Those Percy Jackson movies by the way, they
get way more hate than they deserve.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.520
Even though they do deserve quite a bit of
hate.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.520
Next is Dylan O’Brien.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.860
He’s most famous for being the star of the
Maze Runner movie, which has received lukewarm

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.340
enthusiasm from general audiences.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.710
I do have a few friends who really like the
Maze Runner, so I don’t want to say too

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.750
many bad things about it.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.750
It’s, you know, it’s fine.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.750
And he’s fine in it.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.670
It’s just your standard dystopian young
adult thing and he’s your standard dystopian

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.670
young adult movie actor.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.119
He just seems kind of bland.

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.200
So, I’m optimistic, but I’m leaning towards
no.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.280
Next is Ansel Elgort.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.049
He was in the Carrie remake, Men, Women, and
Children, Divergent, but he’s debatable

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.130
most famous for playing Augustus Waters in
The Fault in Our Stars.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.240
And he’s great in that.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.619
The Fault in Our Stars is a big step above
most teen drama romance type things, and one

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.789
of the reasons is the great performances from
the two main leads.

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.040
Elgort has a lot of range in it, he’s funny,
he’s kind, at points towards the end he’s

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.969
pathetic and you feel bad for him, but most
of all, he’s really, really likeable.

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:41.219
And that would fit for Spider-Man.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.729
He doesn’t exactly look like Peter Parker
that much, but that doesn’t really matter.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.079
So overall, Ansel Elgort is a pretty good
choice.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.079
Brenton Thwaites.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.789
He’s been in Oculus, among other things,
but the only thing I could really remember

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.130
him from was Maleficent.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.930
He plays generic prince with Harry Style’s
haircut.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.369
In Maleficent, he isn’t very good, but he
does seem like he has potential.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.229
And since I haven’t seen him in anything
else, I won’t judge him too harshly.

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.429
But he also does look a little bit too old
to play Spidey.

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:04.429
So this one.

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:05.429
Meh.

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:06.429
Taron Egerton.

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:07.710
Obviously most famous for his recent starring
role in Kingsman: The Secret Service, which,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.180
if you’ve seen my review of the movie, you
know I loved it.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.520
And, Egerton as Eggsy was in my opinion the
best performance in the film.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.210
Which is impressive, considering the movie
is starring Colin Firth, Sam Jackson, and

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.210
Michael Caine.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.319
If he can pull off an American accent, then
this is great.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.319
Make it happen.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.970
I might be a little biased towards this because
I loved Kingsman so much, but he would be

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.540
pretty good, no?

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.540
Josh Hutcherson.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.290
*baba noise* I don’t know.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.290
Is he good as Peeta?

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.290
Yes.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.290
Would he make a good Spider-Man?

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.290
Mmmm...no.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.950
He’s just a little bit too one dimensional.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.450
He isn’t fun, he isn’t very exciting,
and I can’t imagine him pulling off some

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.450
cool action scenes.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.090
I like the guy, but he isn’t Spider-Man.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.219
Grant Gustin.

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:42.219
This is pretty great.

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.920
He’s funny, he’s really likeable, he looks
the part, he’d all around be a good Spidey.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.719
However, there is one big problem.

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.079
He already plays the Flash.

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.280
So, you know, there’s that.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.841
I do realize actors can play more than one
comic book characters, but this one would

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.090
be a little weird and distracting.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.799
So, I guess it’s a kind of yes kind of no.

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.030
And this last one is if they go with the Miles
Morales version of the character.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.129
I’ve only picked one because of the actors
rumored for this, this was the only one I’d

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.120
heard of and/or I wanted to talk about.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120
Donald Glover.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.543
He’s been in the 2011 Muppets, The To Do
List, and the recent horror-ish movie the

00:03:11.543 --> 00:03:12.543
Lazarus Effect.

00:03:12.543 --> 00:03:14.799
But he’s arguably most famous for his work
on the show Community.

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.650
And yeah, he’s great and pretty much a perfect
fit for Miles Morales.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.000
He’s funny, he can pull off drama, he’s
interesting, and he looks the part.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.129
The only problem is, he might be a bit too
old to do it, but besides that this is great.

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.609
Oh, and a quick honorable mention: for Miles
Morales, a while back I would have said, Oh

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.910
yeah, Jaden Smith would be great.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.959
Then After Earth happened.

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:32.959
Nuff said.

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.959
So, who do you want to play Marvel’s Spider-Man?

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.560
And do you want it to be Peter Parker or Miles
Morales?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.879
