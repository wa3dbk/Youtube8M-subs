What makes you... #BUProud

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.200
We love... Opportunities!

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.369
I'm really proud of BU because I feel like,
for the first time in my life I really am

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.270
open to a lot of amazing opportunities with
the support of Bournemouth University and

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.730
the Students' Union. For example, I'm
going to Malaysia in January -- Malaysia!

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.480
For six months, as part of a study exchange
programme.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.720
Hi, my name is Mandakh, I'm from Mongolia
and I'm a second year student. What I really

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.670
like about Bournemouth is how the staff help
with our placement -- they really do focus

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.670
on what our interests are and what new jobs
there are so they can really make a big bridge

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.300
between employer and us. And that is
amazing.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.610
The SABBS!

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.039
I'm proud of everything BU gives us -- so
we have a great career service, a great Students'

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.000
Union, all the opportunities -- such as the
Shrievalty Award, the Student Development Award,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.200
SUBU rep -- just many, many things.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.280
What makes me proud of Bournemouth University?

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.330
It has to be the people. Our staff and students, they are amazing and they do amazing things.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.700
Networking!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.610
I'm really proud of working at Bournemouth
University because we are really good at developing

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.500
employability skills in our students. My students
work with the local community, with organisations,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.240
with businesses, doing real projects that
make a real difference.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.470
I'm mainly proud because of the links we
have with industry. Whenever I've gone for

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.259
interviews at Media Production companies,
they've always been very proud of their

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.220
large Bournemouth student community.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.220
I'm BU Proud -- I'm quite a new member
of the team here, and I think that BU are

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.630
very supportive -- especially as a new member
of staff -- and my colleagues have made me

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.800
feel very, very welcome.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.899
Education!

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.280
My course is not only accredited by loads
of external boards, which makes it really

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.700
stand out, but also the lecturers on the course
are world-class really.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.700
I'm proud of BU because it is such a dynamic
place, it's forward-looking, its research

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.650
teaching is about what happens in the real world.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.310
Student Experience!

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.570
I'm proud to be at BU because of my lecturers'
support that they have for everyone on the

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:25.109
courses. They are always willing to give time
for tutorials or meet up to talk about assignments,

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.500
and if it's any personal issues they always
point me in the right direction, so that's

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.250
a really good support network here.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.250
I genuinely believe we make things happen.
It's no better feeling than following through

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.480
and making a difference. We also, I believe,
give students the opportunity to make things

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.639
happen and also believe in their capabilities.

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:53.540
The tutors are very good on the course that
I'm on -- they seem very helpful and supportive

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.530
and they really look after you. And that's
what being proud of BU is -- that you're

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.510
part of more of a family than just a university
and a name in a room. You are a big family

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.200
and that you are an essential member of that
family as well . So that's what makes me proud of BU.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.500
