00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:05.520
Okay we are back to showing you how to get
into lobster claws. We've already broken the

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.699
front legs and cracked those and we got a
small portion of lobster meat there to start

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:22.400
with. Now I've actually cracked this guy first
with a lobster cracker and I usually try to

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:31.630
start on the back ends, the sturdier part
of the claw and press up against this guy

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:42.800
so that it will hold still for you. Sometimes
they will get a little stubborn. You just

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.000
want to break this shell and it is quite thick
as you can tell because the meat itself is

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.260
loose inside there. It's just that we have
to get to it. Once we've cracked this this

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:07.999
way, all we really need to do is trim this
up,

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:13.759
so just pull gently and this is going to come
out of there. Instead of smashing all this

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.179
and risking to ruin the meat and smash the
meat as well, just open this back end and

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:25.579
that way the meat itself will pull just straight
back like that. So that is a good indication

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.240
that you steam the lobster as long as you
need it when the meat stays solid like this

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.590
after it is chilled. So there's one claw there.
That's the easiest way as far as that goes

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.729
and now this guy had a little bit bigger claw
than he did from one side of the other so

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.719
we may need to crack this a little bit. First
and foremost, I am going to take this lower

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.352
claw out and just pull back. See there is
a whole lot of residual moisture there that

00:01:49.352 --> 00:01:56.149
comes out of there. Some folks like to just
try and cut which we can do with these. Others

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.039
like to tray and smash it and that is fine
too. If you do, I would put a towel over it

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:08.880
as far as that goes. I'm a big fan of just
the shears. Keeps everything looking nice.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:19.360
You still are not safe from the splash at
times. I made the one cut. It is still quite

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:28.200
a bit thick and it is going to need to be
broken out a little bit. So we'll pop this

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.960
out of here in just a second. I'm going to
make a bad cut along the backside of this

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:41.510
claw so we can get that out of there. I'm
really just following the curvature of the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:55.150
claw itself. Now we get some leverage. Pop
that and there is our other claw meat. We

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.600
have to use a little bit more force because
it was a thicker claw. We will come back and

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.980
show you how to get the tail off and take
the head from the tail and finish breaking

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.850
this guy down for you.
