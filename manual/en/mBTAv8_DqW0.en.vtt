00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.860
Cruising with babies &amp; toddlers:

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.420
Hey cruisers, it’s Sheri with Cruise tips
TV!

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.550
Cruising with infants and toddlers can be
a great adventure, and a little preparation

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.710
can go a long way.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.509
We’ve surveyed cruise-savvy parents and
dug into our personal experiences to share

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.230
a few tips:

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.860
Tip #1: If possible, choose your Cruise Line
carefully.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.070
This is likely the most important advice we
can offer.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.750
While most mainstream cruiselines cater to
kids, there’s wide variance in the services

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.640
they provide.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.060
Most will provide cribs or pack n plays for
your bundle of joy, but some lines really

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.489
knock it out of the park and offer free baby
food, incredible childcare programs, and even

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.240
special dining programs geared toward little
ones.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.100
If having baby and toddler Childcare is important
to you- you may want to choose a line like

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.790
Royal Caribbean or Disney.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.080
They are among the few lines that provide
child care options for babies under the age

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.560
of 2.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.070
Disney also offers cabins with more space,
and in many cases, and extra half bathroom.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.750
We recommend using resources like the family
forums at Cruisecritic.com to research what

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.830
line is best for you.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.580
One topic that we often hear a lot of complaints
about is cruise ship swimming pool rules.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.479
Here’s the deal – the great majority of
cruise lines will not allow babies and toddlers

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.180
in diapers in the pools.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.250
AT ALL.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.240
Not even when they are wearing a swim diaper.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.020
Yes, there are baby pools on some ships, but
they can be tiny and sometimes, very cold.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.261
There are exceptions to this, so again, if
swimming or even wading in the onboard pool

00:01:48.261 --> 00:01:56.780
with your baby is important - jump online
before you book and find out your ships policy.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.311
Tip #2:
You’ll want to pack plenty of diapers and

00:02:00.311 --> 00:02:05.369
basic medications for your baby – such as
fever reducer and teething aids.

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.560
Most lines don't carry these items in their
onboard stores and it's better to play it

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.540
safe and pack anything your child may need
to be comfortable if they become sick.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.010
We learned the hard way….

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.420
If your baby gets a fever onboard, even the
ship’s infirmary may not carry medication

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.470
suitable for infants.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.849
Tip #3:
If your cruiseline offers set dining times,

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.470
You’ll probably want to Choose an early
dining time.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.160
Most kids are tuckered out from all the excitement
of the day.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.410
Remember, room service and the buffet are
a great backup option if you have little ones.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.950
Oh, and While we’re on the topic of dining,
we’ve found that packing disposable bibs

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.160
is a life saver on cruises.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:57.980
Who wants to add to the already mounting pile
of laundry while you’re on vacation!

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.270
Tip #4:
Pack light and pack smart.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.040
You won’t need a mountain of toys, books
and gadgets on a cruise.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.010
Stick to the essentials, and rest easy knowing
that your little one will be making new friends,

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.290
exploring the ship and enjoying precious time
with YOU.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.680
Stick to a few things- like their favorite
stuffed animal, book or blanket.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.090
You might consider packing a small umbrella
stroller for your baby, since cruise ships

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.510
are giant these days.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.340
Changing mats are also a good idea on most
ships, as you won’t find changing rooms

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.470
or changing tables in most cases.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.180
Our little man also liked to use his own baby
food spoon on board.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.540
To sum it up, pack light, and Remember, its
relatively easy to do a load or two of laundry

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.150
on board most ships.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.629
Tip #5: Set sail with realistic expectations:
No doubt, you may have those moments on any

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.790
vacation with your baby where you ask yourself
“what was I thinking??”

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.409
But family cruises can be some of the most
memorable.

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.349
So, get out there, take lots of photos and
cast your expectations aside.

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.340
That’s it for this episode.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.060
