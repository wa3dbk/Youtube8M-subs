00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.900
Welcome to our garden – our most beautiful
garden, and this is Claudia. Do you know what?

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.720
There is flowers everywhere Claudia and there
is birds everywhere but also lots of…….

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.720
bees!

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.640
Oh yes absolutely, do you like bees?

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.100
Yeah, they are cool!

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.100
What do they do to you?

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.900
Well they make honey.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.620
Oh yes absolutely. And good stuff to eat aye!

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.620
Yeah.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.620
Oh brilliant.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.680
But I think one thing they do is more important
 – its pollination. Do you know what that

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.680
is?

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.540
I think it’s when the bees take pollen from
one flower to another.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:48.370
Bingo - absolutely right! Now to show us we
are going to borrow something from Aunty Julie.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.850
Let’s go.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.829
These are lilies, and these are the red orangey
sticky pollen of the lilies which have to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.340
be transferred to the female of another flower
of the lilies. And that is pollination. It’s

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.650
quite simple really, without pollination there
wouldn’t be any apples.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.799
That’s right.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.940
There wouldn’t be any lemons and there wouldn’t
be any pears.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.350
Without pollination, there won’t be any
little beans whatsoever.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.479
Without bumble bees, we wouldn’t have any
tomatoes to eat.

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.150
So pollination is very important to plants
because it gives them fruits and seeds and

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.100
nuts and basically baby plants. Oh yes its
all about reproduction. But have you ever

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.630
wondered what pollen actually look like when
you put it under a microscope? They are beautiful.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.290
They are so pretty and well adapted. You see
some pollen go through the air. They disperse

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.530
by winds, others are dispersed by birds.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:03.000
They have little barbs on them that stick
to the feathers of the birds. Some pollen

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.939
are licked up by geckos. Yep they lick the
plants, they lick the nectar and they take

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:16.220
the pollen from flower to flower. There are
even flowers that are pollinated by bats.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.240
Now get that, bats, in the middle of the night.
But most pollination of course is done by

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.240
insects.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.050
Now let’s take a look at what insects pollinate.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:33.560
There are flies, oh yes flies. There are beetles,
sometimes really small tiny beetles that go

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.160
from flower to flower. Of course there are
also native bees that live in holes in the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.390
ground but they pollinate, for instance, tee
tree, mänuka, all sorts of native plants.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.630
They do a fantastic job. So why are all these
insects and birds, gecko and bats for that

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:59.610
matter, attracted to pollinate the flowers?
Well they get a reward. Nectar – that’s

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.370
the reward!

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.730
I bet you’ve never seen this before aye?
Here is a flax flower and when you squeeze

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:14.730
it, look, you can see the moisture coming
out now. That is nectar. That’s what all

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.050
these pollinators are after – neat aye!
And by the way, can you see this lovely orange

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:31.010
pollen? They are so bright they really stand
out staying “eat me”.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.750
So all of these insects Claudia take the nectar
 – and what do bees do with it?

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.750
They take it to their hives.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.750
Yeah and what then?

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.790
They make honey.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.190
That’s right. They do, do you like honey?

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.190
Yeah.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.300
Do you when the bees get into the hive do
you know how they put the nectar out of their

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.560
system and into the hive? You know how they
do that? Bluuuurrrrrr.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.720
You still like honey?

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.720
Yep.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.629
Alright! You know that honey is really good
for you for you don’t you?

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:04.629
Yep.

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.959
Ok, have you ever wondered why honey is so
good as a medicine?

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:09.959
Yeah I have.

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:10.959
Well what is it?

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.330
I don’t know. Can you tell me why?

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.680
If you are a plant and you want pollinators
to come to give you seeds and fruits and to

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.240
do your reproduction for you and you give
them a reward called nectar, you’ve got

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.910
to make sure the nectar is in perfect condition
 – no fungi, no germs, no bacteria. So when

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:40.599
the bees then take the nectar to the nest
and make it into honey, it is chock full of

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:50.150
goodies! And that’s why honey is so good
for you!

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.909
Mmmmm, delicious!
