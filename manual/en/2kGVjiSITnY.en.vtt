00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.540
The owners of Oak Lane wanted to expand their
living space.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.920
In order to do this, they had to make some
major architectural changes.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.050
Their decision to add a new master bedroom
suite on top of the existing garage, served

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.570
to expand the first floor, increase square
footage and give the main part of the home

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.380
a new “ranch house look and feel”.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.430
But nothing is ever easy…

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.370
Building that new bedroom above an existing
structure demanded changes to that room as

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.460
well.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.980
The garage required reinforcement and additional
alterations in order to support the additional

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.540
room above.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.159
To start, we converted the single garage door
to a double-door.

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.350
This allowed for a center steel post as well
as another steel beam for placement across

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.150
the ceiling, providing support for the subfloor
above.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.930
With the addition of the new living space
above the garage, came new fire code requirements,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.640
making it necessary to insulate the garage
and dry wall.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.580
Spray foam was used on the ceiling in order
to deliver the tightest seal possible and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.300
keep the bedroom airtight.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.600
With the master bedroom suite a distance away
from the main rooms and systems, a decision

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.060
was made to add a separate 90% efficient furnace
and air-conditioning system specifically for

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.260
the suite.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.940
The walls used 2x6 wall construction for extra
insulation.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.490
The home owners are able to control the temperature
in the bedroom comfortable, while saving on

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.130
heating and cooling costs in the rest of the
house.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.320
The roof of the garage was removed to make
room for the new walls.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.180
The plywood and rafters from the original
roof were in excellent condition, and were

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.690
able to be used again to create the exterior
walls, and lift up the sunken 70’s style

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:54.370
living room, making the main floor one continuous
level space.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.210
Once the garage was insulated and structurally
sound, we began building out the master bedroom

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:11.510
suite.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.870
As in every project, something invariably
goes wrong…

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.400
This time – one of the bedroom windows was
built in the wrong location.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.260
Looks like somebody didn’t follow the blue
prints.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.290
Whoops!

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.090
It became a three day set back, but now you
can’t tell it was ever in the wrong spot.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:36.290
A reminder to measure twice and cut once – or
maybe measure three times!

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.491
To create the entryway to the master suite,
we used the original shower location in the

00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:42.060
old guest powder room.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.260
The bathroom was then reconfigured, and the
shower kept for guests to use after swimming.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.060
The master suite walk-in closet is a wonderful
example of reuse and recycled materials, using

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.510
both pre-owned and new pieces of do-it-yourself
closet units.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.450
The unique barn door is a real conversation
piece.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.419
This sliding barn door was used, instead of
a conventional door for easy, space saving

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:06.480
access.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.879
No swinging door blocking the walkway here!

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.659
The master bathroom is a nice size with all
the necessary luxuries; a shower stall tiled

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:21.549
to the ceiling with a built-in bench, rain
water shower head, glass sinks, custom dark

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.680
oak cabinets, whisper quiet fan, and dual-flush
toilet.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.609
The dual-flush toilet helps save on the water
bill.

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:38.299
Push one, for liquid waste with .8 gallons
a flush.

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.829
And push two, for solid waste with 1.6 gallons
a flush.

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.670
The new bedroom ceiling created significant
changes both inside and out.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.319
Inside, a large raised ceiling runs the full
length of the bedroom with a smaller raised

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.529
ceiling in the walk-in closet, both helping
to create an expansive and open air feel.

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:01.730
Outside, an obvious change to the roof design
was done to bring balance to the look of the

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.059
entire home.

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:07.430
This in turn created a need to balance the
new addition with a raised ceiling on the

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.089
porch entrance.

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:13.980
The result – a pleasing look and feel with
curb appeal.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.570
The completed bedroom suite is around 515
square feet, with plenty of room for a king

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.349
size bed as well as a sunny nook for reading
and relaxation.
