00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.730
bjbjVwVw JEFFREY BROWN: Next: a story of the
arts and community.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.450
It's about a group in Minnesota that aims
to take dance to new places.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.380
Its name is TU Dance.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.719
Special correspondent Fred de Sam Lazaro tells
its story.

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.390
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: TU Dance's location, a
rusty but recovering urban neighborhood, fits

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.710
with its founders' goal to put a new face
on dance.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.619
For Uri Sands and Toni Pierce-Sands, it's
been an unusual journey to get to this corner

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:42.100
of Saint Paul.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.890
Each rose to prominence in the '90s, seeming
to reach the pinnacle of storybook careers

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.789
with New York's Alvin Ailey Dance company.

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.449
Uri Sands grew up break dancing on Miami's
streets, took ballet as an elective in public

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.980
school, and at 20 was invited to join Ailey's
troupe.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.720
Toni Pierce grew up in Minnesota, where her
mother enrolled her in dance school at 6,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.060
was eventually hired by Ailey, moved to Europe,
was married for a time and had a son, then

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.460
returned again to Ailey.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.560
BEN JOHNSON, Northrop Dance Center, University
of Minnesota: I remember seeing Toni and Uri

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.290
both as dancers.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.120
And they are two of the nation's best dancers.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.830
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Ben Johnson, director
of Northrop Dance Center at the University

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.250
of Minnesota, says the pair stands out for
their wide repertoire.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.240
Johnson specifically recalls Toni Pierce-Sands
performing a piece called "Cry" by Alvin Ailey,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.120
one of the 20th century's giants of modern
dance.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.400
BEN JOHNSON: He created this piece to celebrate
all mothers and women around the world.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.630
And only a very elite few dancers are allowed
to perform this particular solo.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.380
And that's the piece that I first saw Toni
Pierce perform.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.890
And Uri in the same way, I remember exactly
the first time I ever saw him perform, again

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.760
with Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.390
He's considered one of the most exquisite
movers and one of the most beautiful dancers.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.990
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Toni Pierce returned home
from New York again in 1999 for what she intended

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.990
to be a short visit.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.140
TONI PIERCE-SANDS, TU Dance: My family was
helping take care of my son at the time.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.590
So I came back to Minnesota with all intentions
to rebound with my family and then go back

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.770
to New York, where Uri then shows up at the
door and says, let's stay in Minnesota.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.180
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It may have seemed counterintuitive
at first, but the Twin Cities, known for a

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.770
thriving art scene and enjoying a renaissance
in dance, offered new opportunities to carve

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.770
out a niche.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.660
URI SANDS, TU Dance: There had been a lot
of work already done in the dance world, as

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:44.300
well as room and space to welcome in new ideas
and new visions for dance here in the Twin

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.300
Cities.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.040
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In 2004, the couple began
TU Dance, named after Toni and Uri's first

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.100
initials.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.720
The company has regularly sold out larger
and larger venues.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.630
What makes them stand apart is how many styles
they incorporate into their programs.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.540
BEN JOHNSON: What I have noticed over the
past five years as a company is the evolution

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.690
of the range of their work and how and they're
one of the few companies that within their

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.150
own work spans so many different kinds of
styles, from classical ballet to modern dance

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.520
to contemporary performance to urban dance.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:30.040
URI SANDS: One thing that is important for
the diversity of the work that we do is for

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.240
the dancers that work with the company to
actually bring their experiences, their own

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.530
personal experiences, because it's all of
these different components that ultimately

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.330
help us create this sort of unique synergy,
the uniqueness of the work that defines TU

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.460
Dance.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.080
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Uri Sands choreographs
most of the company's works.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:06.600
His first evening-long piece was called "Sense(ability),"
an exploration of all five senses and the

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.600
elements.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.209
He described it to the local PBS program "Minnesota
Original."

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:18.320
URI SANDS: For instance, there's air and touch,
there's water taste, fire sight, earth and

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.700
smell, sound, ether.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.380
Toni and Marciano are doing a duet.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.130
And that's air and touch.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.990
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: For those of the 11-member
company, like David Rue and Eva Mohn, working

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.780
here is a departure in both style and mind-set.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.130
They say TU Dance is not about competition,
not just geared to a glorious performance.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.600
EVA MOHN, dancer: For me, performance is such
a small part of why I dance, and actually

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.830
probably the least significant.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.720
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Really?

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.850
EVA MOHN: Yes.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.840
And I feel -- I wouldn't have said that a
few years ago.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.030
DAVID RUE, dancer: I love the process of creating
and the process of rehearsing work, the process

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.130
of taking class, and then the performance
is just another part of that process, instead

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.420
of this Mount Olympus that we're all trying
to climb up to.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.160
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: TU Dance's founders say
they want to give opportunities to a wider

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.740
diversity of students.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.570
TONI PIERCE-SANDS: My sister and I danced
at Minnesota Dance Theatre, and at that point,

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.180
we were kind of the only two young dancers
of color.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:29.270
And after leaving and coming back, I -- so
much had grown here in the Twin Cities and

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.490
in Saint Paul in terms of dance and the community
and the dancers, but there was something that

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.850
didn't change, which was dancers of color.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.400
URI SANDS: However, it doesn't mean that we're
trying to do some social service or make sure

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.320
that like everybody can just kind of like
dance and we're going to -- excuse the phrase

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.680
-- kind of like dumb it down.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:55.280
That's not what we're doing.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:04.169
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: To give them that access,
TU Dance works closely with local schools.

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:09.340
Those who are invited, like 17-year-old Dominick
Dates, face a mixture of grueling practice

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.500
and tolerance, technical proficiency and individuality.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.650
DOMINICK DATES, dance student: They teach
you what they want you to do, but you do it

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.610
how you want to do it.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.410
So, you can make whatever they teach you yours.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.530
TONI PIERCE-SANDS: Yes, you got to put your
own flavor.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.680
DOMINICK DATES: Yes, your own flavor.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.350
(LAUGHTER) FRED DE SAM LAZARO: High school
senior Immanuelle Thomas joined TU Dance from

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.350
another dance school.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.490
IMMANUELLE THOMAS, student: I come to TU and
my teachers, I'm like, oh, wow, she has curves

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.490
like me.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:42.270
Somebody in the company, she has a curve where
I have a curve, and their skin is like mine.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.760
And I really understood, like, if they can
make it, then there's no excuse for me.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:57.060
TONI PIERCE-SANDS: The idea is that, as performers,
as artists, as students, that we are representing

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.930
our audience, our community, the people, the
watchers.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:08.150
And, my gosh, it's just -- it's deep, but
it's kind of simple for us, you know?

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.650
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Less simple is raising
the money to run a nonprofit dance company

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.460
and school, to offer scholarships so students
can study there for years.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.930
TU Dance's annual budget is just $450,000.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:27.710
Still, Toni Pierce-Sands at 50 and Uri Sands
at 38 say they are looking forward to the

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:33.690
legacy phase of their careers, sharing and
giving back to an art form that transformed

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.690
their lives.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:35.690
RAY SUAREZ: Fred's reporting is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories Project at Saint

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.690
Mary's University in Minnesota.
