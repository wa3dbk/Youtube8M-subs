Hey friends!
On today's show we have some surprise eggs

00:00:03.577 --> 00:00:10.577
So I am going to start unboxing these
We have two for girls and two for boys

00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:14.847
So here I have the girl one
Okay

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:19.867
Let me just keep these ones aside
So that I can show you guys

00:00:19.867 --> 00:00:26.867
And now this is a kinder joy surprise egg
So I am just going to rip it open

00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:34.576
So we all know, this side we have our chocolate
Yummy!

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:41.286
I am going to leave that aside
And here is our first surprise

00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:48.286
Let's check it out
And here we go

00:00:56.146 --> 00:01:01.686
Looks interesting
I don't know what it is

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:05.147
Let's see
So we have a little instruction manual here

00:01:05.147 --> 00:01:12.147
Which will show us how to fix this
So this goes onto the top

00:01:13.557 --> 00:01:20.557
Like this
Yay! It is fixed

00:01:21.727 --> 00:01:26.567
This is really cute
So this is a paint brush

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:31.117
So you dip it into paint
And paint your drawings with this

00:01:31.117 --> 00:01:34.907
Wow! I like this one
So here we go

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:41.117
Let's open the second
Next we have our yellow playdoh surprise egg

00:01:41.117 --> 00:01:44.517
I am unboxing it
Any guesses?

00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:51.517
It's for a girl or a boy?
It's for a girl again

00:01:52.317 --> 00:01:56.807
Put this playdoh aside and
Let's open

00:01:56.807 --> 00:01:59.797
I am just hoping
I don't get the same toy

00:01:59.797 --> 00:02:06.797
This is my chocolate
So I am going to keep that away

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:15.067
And here is the surprise
Something like this

00:02:15.897 --> 00:02:21.356
There are some four bows
With a heart

00:02:21.356 --> 00:02:26.177
And I have my instruction manual here
Let me check this out

00:02:26.177 --> 00:02:33.177
So I have to fix this
And here is the second one

00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:45.766
So what are these
Let me read

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:51.246
So these are buckles, clips
I can put this on my shoe lace

00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:55.976
Or I can put it on my hood string
Really cute, ah?

00:02:55.976 --> 00:03:00.757
Girls are gonna like these things
Okay so that was for the second surprise
