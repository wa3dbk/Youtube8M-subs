00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:19.340
You will need Moisturizer with SPF Foundation
Makeup sponges Concealer Makeup brushes Blush

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:27.910

Eye shadow Eyeliner Eyelash curler Mascara

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.980
Lip color Loose powder Anti-wetness eye drops
(optional) and clear, silver, or gold lip

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.070
gloss (optional).

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.220
Step 1.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.520
Apply a moisturizer with an SPF of at least
15 on your face and neck.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.899
Step 2.

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.040
Dab foundation along your forehead, nose,
chin, and across each cheek.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.520
Blend from the middle of your face outward,
using a slightly damp makeup sponge.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.520
Step 3.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.859
Dab some concealer -- one shade lighter than
your foundation -- on any blemishes or under-eye

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.600
circles, using a makeup sponge or your ring
finger.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.600
Step 4.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.739
Find your apples -- the part of your cheeks
that gets round when you smile -- and brush

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.720
some blush or bronzer from the center of each
apple up to your hairline.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.270
Dust some blush down from the tip of your
chin to the center of your throat to minimize

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.750
a double chin.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.880
Step 5.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.360
Shape your brows with eyebrow powder, using
a thin brush; a pencil-drawn brow looks too

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.360
harsh.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.650
If you're in a rush, smooth a little petroleum
jelly over them with your fingertip instead.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.970
Step 6.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.390
Apply three different shades of one eye shadow
color: Brush the darkest color in your eyelid

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.649
creases, swipe the medium shade below the
crease, and put the lightest shade under your

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:36.920
brows.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.030
Step 7.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.970
Apply eyeliner as close to the lash lines
as possible, working from the inside out on

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.560
the top lashes and from the outside in on
the bottom ones, then trace over it with a

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.950
matching powder shadow.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.880
Skip the liner on the bottom lash line if
you have small eyes; it will make them look

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.670
smaller.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.610
Make liner last longer by wetting your eye-shadow
brush with anti-redness eye drops.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.740
Step 8.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.610
Curl your lashes before applying mascara to
the top and bottom lashes.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.229
Give the top lashes a second coat, focusing
on the outer lashes for a more dramatic look.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.860
For really lush-looking lashes, use a volumizing
mascara for the first coat and a lengthening

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.890
one for the second Step 9.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.890
Apply your lip color.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.800
For long-lasting color, fill in your lips
with a pencil liner before putting on lipstick

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.990
in the same shade.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.140
Dab a little clear, silver, or gold lip gloss
down the middle of your lower lip to create

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.540
the illusion of fuller lips.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.540
Step 10.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.080
Set your face with a light dusting of loose
face powder using a large makeup brush.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.080
There!

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.080
You're good to go.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.940
Did you know Nearly half of U.S. women surveyed
believe wearing makeup gives them an advantage

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.780
at work and makes them feel more in control.
