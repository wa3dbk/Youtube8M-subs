00:00:11.414 --> 00:00:14.400
Welcome aboard this Air Middle Earth flight.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.500
Before we set out on our journey I would like to impart a story of safety.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.980
[whistles loudly]

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.700
Even if you fly with us often, be sure to keep a sharp eye on the briefing.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.260
Make sure your belongings are hidden away in the compartments above or under the seat before you.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.540
All travellers must keep a watchful eye on the lighted signs, and follow crew instructions.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.296
If the seatbelt sign is on, sit yourself down and fasten your seatbelt quick smart.

00:00:43.296 --> 00:00:47.236
Be sure that it's snug across your hips, though not so tight as to lose the feeling in your legs.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.360
If you're in a SkyCouch row, there are special seatbelt instructions in your seat pocket.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.880
We recommend keeping your seatbelt fastened throughout the journey.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.960
Should you need to explore, it can always be undone.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.554
If an oxygen mask should fall before you, simply pull down on the mask, place over your nose and mouth

00:01:09.554 --> 00:01:14.964
and tighten by pulling the elastics on both sides.  Oxygen will flow through the mask automatically.

00:01:14.964 --> 00:01:18.600
If there are young ones around you, be sure to put your mask on before helping them.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.080
Keep a sharp eye, as there may be others who need your help.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.980
[over-enunciating] Mordor!

00:01:21.984 --> 00:01:22.644
Mordor!

00:01:22.644 --> 00:01:24.644
No, Mordor!

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.400
Should an emergency occur during take-off or landing, place your hands on your head

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.480
with your elbows on the outside of your thighs, whilst keeping your feet flat on the floor.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.460
You can also brace yourself on the seat in front of you.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
My precious...

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.540
In Business Premier sit upright, put your hands on your knees with your knees together against the wall

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.180
and your feet on the edge of the ottoman.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.960
If you're seated in Economy and Premium Economy you'll find your lifejacket under your seat.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.100
The SkyCouch has it in the top of the leg rest,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.980
and if you're seated in Business Premier you'll find your lifejacket here beside you.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.940
Life jackets are simple to master: take a firm hold and rip it from the bag then place it over your head like so.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.420
Clip the straps together and tighten.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.160
This red tab inflates the life jacket so only pull it once you leave the aircraft.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.120
Oh, sorry!

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.060
If you need a little more inflation...  Simply blow into the mouth-piece.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.180
We shall provide life jackets for the very young, should the need arise.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.120
There's no smoking allowed anywhere of any kind on this aircraft as it's a fire hazard. 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.880
Should you need a light in darkness to help you find your way,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.520
the escape path lighting will lead you to an exit.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.360
If ever there were a need to evacuate, support fellow passengers who might require help.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.400
Your noble crew are now pointing out the exits.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.080
You would be wise to note your nearest exit could be behind you, so cast your eyes about

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.960
and count the number of rows to your nearest exit.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.740
You'll find more information on the safety card in your seat pocket.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.940
Please power off all electronic devices during take-off and landing.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.140
Electronic devices such as mobile phones can interfere with aircraft systems and must not be used in flight

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:21.300
unless you switch them to flight mode and ensure that all cellular, wi-fi and bluetooth capability is turned off.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.380
Once switched to flight mode all electronic devices must be turned off for take-off and landing.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.980
And finally, for take-off we ask that you place your tray table back, your leg rest down, and ensure your

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.720
seat back is upright, unless you're in Business Premier, where you choose your own seat back position.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.614
Check to see that your window shades are open and your arm rests are lowered,

00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:41.914
and be sure to fasten your seatbelt. Once this story has concluded

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.420
your entertainment screen and remote control need to be put away for take-off.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.240
Now sit back, relax, and enjoy your journey.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.760
May the road rise up to meet you and your beard grow ever longer.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.420
May the sun shine warm upon your -

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.360
Fly, you fools!

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.660
[laughter]
