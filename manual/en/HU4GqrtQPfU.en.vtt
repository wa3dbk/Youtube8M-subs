00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:15.159
Jaystephere here with another update on the school, and as you can see,

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:19.580
the bottom story is 90 percent complete.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.799
And I still have

00:00:23.799 --> 00:00:26.039
well a good selection of tan bricks.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.199
well a good selection of tan bricks.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.439
I might be able to pull this off.

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.880
So let's take a look here. As you can see the front

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.580
So let's take a look here. As you can see the front,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.330
the last one didn't really change much except I got all this crowned of with smooth tiles.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.000
the last one didn't really change much except I got all this crowned of with smooth tiles.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.880
And if we open up the doors,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.720
And if we open up the doors,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.210
other than the stairs,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.560
everything in here is tiled down.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.310
So I have the floor in here tiled. You guys were saying I should put a design here.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:00.310
With the lack of pieces I have, this is best as I can do but it looks good.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.950
So that's very creative.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.070
Let's take a look at the top part of it so far.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.460
There's Jayden McBrick.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.670
And as you can see I didn't really tile anything or put furniture in here yet.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.730
It's starting to come along pretty good.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.020
I actually  have enough stuff to make lots of these windows.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.840
I've made four of them here for the second story.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.830
So those have been pre-built.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.590
And I got some other white windows. I still got plenty of white windows.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.330
Some arches, some plates. I still got enough here to make

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.680
looks like three more thresholds.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.690
looks like three more thresholds.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.650
So I think I can get away with this.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.910
So I think I can get away with this.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.190
So I think I can get away with this.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.270
So I put some fancy windows on this side here.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.570
So I put some fancy windows on this side here.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.040
Just almost the same design,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.409
and

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.150
turn it around here and I'll show you I got some over here.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.089
Two more for the administrative office and one for the principal's office.

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:13.489
Now the back part I really don't care what it looks like.

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.519
So it looks lore like a

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.699
So it looks lore like a

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.769
modern business in the back.

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.519
I put a little awning patio cover. Whatever you want to call it over the top of the door.

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.369
I put a little awning patio cover. Whatever you want to call it over the top of the door.

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:28.749
So I actually got modern doors in here.

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.629
So I actually got modern doors in here.

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.149
I took out that one door because it didn't look right.

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.259
So I decided to put windows in here.

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:42.459
There's the steps.

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.409
Some of you guys were asking me to put a bathroom in here.

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.229
I'm going to put a boys and girls bathroom on the top story.

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:53.199
I'm going to put a boys and girls bathroom on the top story.

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:56.549
So I finished up the principal's office. It's pretty narrow in there but that's fine.

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.450
He doesn't need a big office anyways.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.319
There's the administrative building.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.069
Lots of light in here for just a Lego building.

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.569
Here is the mess haul, and I haven't put any kitchen stuff in here yet.

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:08.279
There's the windows but you can see I have some dark tan tiles sitting upside down.

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:12.679
There's the windows but you can see I have some dark tan tiles sitting upside down.

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:14.319
I wanted to see if I had enough and I don't so

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.790
I'm going to probably put a design somewhere in the middle of that

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.589
or on the sides and stick those in the middle so I'll have some tile in there.

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:26.139
Or just take these tiles and put them in here. I haven't made my mind up yet.

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.889
And stick some grey tile in there.

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.919
Here's the steps. I put a landing. Some of you guys were asking about  tutorial

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:34.809
on how to build stairs with a landing. I'll show you how to build those.

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:38.059
on how to build stairs with a landing. I'll show you how to build those.

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:42.139
But all-in-all, this looks really good. This thing looks really classy.

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.049
It's actually turning out better than I thought.

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.459
The floor system will be the same.

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.549
I'm hoping I'll have enough

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.839
plates to go around this that are tan.

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:55.389
plates to go around this that are tan.

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.119
I don't know yet.

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:59.039
I'm hoping I do.

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.369
If not, then I'll think of something to hide them.

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:05.579
If not, then I'll think of something to hide them.

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.219
In all-in-all, it's turning out really good.

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:11.669
So I just like the fact that I can make tons of these windows now.

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.489
So I just like the fact that I can make tons of these windows now.

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.329
I didn't have enough of these white jumper plates

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:23.329
so I started using tan up here and still looks okay. I'm not going to complain about it.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.590
Well there is the update on the school.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.229
If I keep cushioning it up with windows,

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:39.760
that box of tan will still be around.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.729
So it's a mess up here,

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.099
So it's a mess up here,

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:45.550
but I'm hoping to ...

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.550
I'm shooting to get this thing done within ...

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.580
by the 20th of April.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.960
So let's just see how it goes.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.449
So let's just see how it goes.

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.949
I'm still going to tile this.

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.429
I might put a brick type thing on here to make this look fancier. I don't know how I'm going to deal with this yet.

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:10.039
But the second story, I'm going to deferentially put two classrooms up here,

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.460
and a bathroom here

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.479
and a bathroom here.

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.069
I don't know how this is going to come out yet. I really don't.

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:26.399
I might even put ... if I do decide to put a third story, it might be an attic,

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:30.429
and I'll bring some stairs up off of here. I was hoping to leave this open all the way down

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:32.110
and I'll bring some stairs up off of here. I was hoping to leave this open all the way down

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.099
but I don't think it's going to happen.

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.769
You know, it's just probably not.

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.229
But you know,

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.210
who cares.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.339
There's all the tile work.

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:46.729
I'm hoping the next update, this story should be done,

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:48.490
but I won't show you the inside of it

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:55.090
because I want to leave some stuff as a surprise.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.439
So I'll keep you guys posted.

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:59.129
Thank you for watching!
