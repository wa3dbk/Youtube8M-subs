00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:13.530
Let's try another knot. How about the
bowline? Here, we'll use the stanchion. I'm

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.539
going to pull the long and tight, going
to hold it there while I make a loop by

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.750
pulling part of it back and under. Then
I'm going to take the short end and

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.810
bring it through the loop and I'll have the
two sides parallel there. Then I'll wrap

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.880
the short end behind the long end and
bring it back through the loop and pull

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:47.300
it tight. That's a bowline! 
Would you like to try it? 
MAN: Sure. 
WOMAN: All right let me

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.300
untie it. There you go. 
MAN: Thanks, let me see
if I got this. I take the long end, push

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.850
it forward and under to make a loop like
this. Take the short end, bring it up and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:08.970
under, down, around, and back through, pull it tight and there's my bullet.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.409
WOMAN: You've got it! 
Sailors use a bowline when they're tying a jib sheet to the jib. It

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.700
needs to withstand several thousand
pounds of pressure. The nice thing about

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.720
it is, even though it can do that, it's
very easy to untie, simply by

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:33.659
loosening the back loop and pulling this
through. Another use of a bowline is for

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.340
making a big loop in a line. For example,
when you're coming into a gas dock and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.689
you need to throw the loop over a piling.
Can you do a bowline that way? 
MAN: I think

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.340
so, let me try. Okay well first I need
some more line to make the loop. That

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.049
should do. I'm going to take the long end,
push it forward and under to make a loop

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.880
like this. Take the short end, bring it up,
down, around the long end, back up, and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.850
through the loop. Now, I'm just going to
pull it tight. That's my bowline. Is this big

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.380
enough?
WOMAN: That looks great!
