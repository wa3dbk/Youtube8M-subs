00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.120
Hey what's up?

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.120
I'm Dan Brisse.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.769
I'm a GoPro Athlete and professional snowboarder.

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.280
I like to use the Jaws: Flex Clamp and the
Gooseneck when I'm filming in the streets

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.780
or in the park.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.360
It's really awesome, you can pretty much put
it wherever you need to with the clamp here.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.380
And you can disconnect the clamp from the
Gooseneck and put the camera directly on the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.380
clamp.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.689
Or you can take the clamp off and just use
the gooseneck to do follow cams and we're

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.520
going to go to the park right now and I'm
going to show you how to use it firsthand

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.329
and be a self-producer.

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:42.329
We're at the top of the park.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.390
I've got my Jaws clamp, my Gooseneck, and
my wireless remote.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.280
Today I'm trying to get a still photo, 30
photos in 3 seconds.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.650
First step to do that is turn on the GoPro.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:01.109
Let the GoPro fire up and then hit the Wi-Fi
button here on the side just to get the blue

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.449
light flashing.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.670
Once the blue light is flashing, push it again
to get into the menu.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.690
Then scroll it down to Wi-Fi RC.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.860
Select that, and then you're going to select
it down to New.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.280
Select that, and then you have got to power
up the remote.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.660
Push that and right away hold the red button
and it will start to pair the GoPro and the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:34.200
remote together.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.640
Now that we have the camera paired to the
remote, we're going to use this clamp and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.740
Gooseneck to get it connected to the rail
so we can get the photo we're looking for.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.440
I'm going to put the camera how I want it
on the rail and use the adjustments to get

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.440
it right.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.940
And then just do a little test to make sure
the burst mode is working properly.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:58.480
You're going to push the red button, hear
the 30 photos in 3 seconds and remember to

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.860
just give yourself a little bit of time because
there's that little bit of a delay.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.480
So when you're coming in, maybe a second or
just a little ways early before you get on

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:18.280
the rail, just push the button and you should
be good to go.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.610
I'm Dan Brisse, that's all I've got for you
today for GoPro's Tips and Tricks.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.920
Today we went over the Jaws clamp, we went
over how to pair your remote to your camera,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.709
and also the burst photo.

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.609
We're all set up here, I've got my remote
in hand.

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.109
I'm going to go hit this thing, shoot some
photos of my own, you do the same.
