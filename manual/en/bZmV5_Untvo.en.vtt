Hi this is Gary with MacMost Now.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:10.280
On today's episode let me show you how to
make a recovery drive for your Mac.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.440
Now starting with Lion, and continuing with
Mountain Lion, we've all got a recovery partition

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.130
on our Mac, at least if you have a fairly
recent model Mac and we haven't set anything

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.999
to something not standard like using a different
type format for the hard drive.

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.960
So what this means there is a small partition
on your Mac that you can boot into if you

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.960
run into trouble.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.309
So if somehow your installed Mac OS X gets
corrupted or something you can boot holding

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.309
down Command R on the keyboard and it will
boot the recovery mode.

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.150
You can use that to fix the main partition,
the main drive, to reinstall OS X, do all

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.150
sorts of things.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.150
You don't need another drive.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.670
You don't need to insert say a DVD that came
with your Mac or anything like that to do

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.089
it because this recovery partition take care
of it for you.

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:54.980
However it doesn't cover one case.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.339
What happens if the drive itself goes bad.

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:03.399
If it physically is damaged or can't boot
and you can neither access the regular partition

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.729
or the recovery partition and say you are
adding a new drive to it to replace that one

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.640
or some other circumstance comes up.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.311
Then it is handy to have a recovery partition
stored on a little USB drive that you can

00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:17.311
boot from.

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:21.790
So the first thing you need to do is to get
an App from Apple called the Recovery Disk

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.820
Assistant.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.030
You get it by going here - support.apple.com/kb/DL1433.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.630
I will put a link to it in the post in MacMost.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.070
So you go here and you can download this tiny
little utility.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.740
It downloads as a disk image and then you
drag the actual utility out of the disk image

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.860
into say your Applications/Utilities folder.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.200
Now you've got it and you can use it.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.189
Before I run it I've got this little USB drive
here.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.049
It is only a 1G drive so it is fairly cheap.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.090
It is an old one and I don't even know if
you get them that small anymore.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.140
I'm going to plug that into my Mac.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.970
It is going to completely reformat it during
this process so I don't care about what is

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.970
on it right now.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.689
It is going to be erased and reformatted when
I run the Assistant.

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.800
So like I said before I am going to put it
in my Utilities folder.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.800
There it is.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.800
I'm going to run it right now.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.760
It is going to ask me to agree to the licensing
agreement there.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.860
Then it is going to quickly find this USB
flash drive that I have installed.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.819
If I had multiple ones it would give me an
option here.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.380
I know it is called untitled and this is the
one I want.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.620
So I am going to select it and hit continue.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:35.090
Then it is going to ask me to authenticate
and then it will just take a few minutes and

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.090
it will basically create the entire disk.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.680
There is really no other steps to be done.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.120
While it is doing this I want you to notice
one thing.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.030
It has a picture of Lion here, the Lion icon.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.600
It even says Mac OS X Lion here in the text.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.060
So the deal is this was created while OS X
Lion was the main operating system and before

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.190
Mountain Lion came out and they just never
updated it since.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.190
But it works either way.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.080
It works for Lion and for Mountain Lion.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.390
As a matter of fact you can see it on the
web page we visited before it showed a Mountain

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.709
Lion icon.

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.840
So don't worry about the image not being quite
correct.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.150
So when it is done it renames the drive Recovery
HD and you won't actually see it appear in

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.150
the Finder.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.060
It is not something it typically mounts.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.879
It is something you would only use in case
of an emergency.

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.990
If I wanted now to boot with this in an emergency
what I would do is to plug it into a USB port

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.990
on the Mac.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.379
Restart the Mac with the Options key held
down.

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.019
Then I should get the option to boot with
the regular hard drive if it is a bootable

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.120
drive at this point or this one.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.850
I can select this one and then I get all sorts
of options like the ability to run disk utility,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.379
the ability to reinstall or repair Mac OS
X on the main hard drive.

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.640
I also noticed on my test that this is a universal
recovery drive now.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.010
I was able to actually create this on my 2008
MacPro and then I used it on my MacBook Air

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.860
2011 and it booted just fine.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.190
So unlike in the past where you had DVDs that
were specific to a model of Mac this seems

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.739
to be something that will be able to work
on just about any modern Mac.

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.220
I'm not 100% sure of that but at least in
my test that is what it showed.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.220
Now one footnote here.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.810
I believe what this actually does is that
it copies the data from your recovery partition

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.920
on your drive to this external drive.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.320
So if you don't have Recovery Partition on
your drive either because your Mac is too

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.480
old or because of a special format that you
are using, or some other circumstance about

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.580
how you've upgraded to Lion and then to Mountain
Lion then you can't create a USB recovery

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.480
drive in this manner.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.480
So I hope you found this useful.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.310
If you have an old drive, a 1G or more drive
that you are not using you may just want to

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.700
go and create a recovery disk and just put
it in a drawer.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.380
It could come in handy some day.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:05:07.350
Until next time this is Gary with MacMost
Now.
