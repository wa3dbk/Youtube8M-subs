Hello and welcome everyone.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.980
In this video I will show you how The Sims 4 runs on an early 2015 Macbook Pro under OSX.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.680
Let's see how the game runs on low settings.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:19.840
As you can see only the retina resolutions available in the settings, but most probably the game renders in a lower resolution and then upscales.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.600
Anyway, it's doing it right, the game looks sharp, and the framerate is perfectly fine.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:34.120
It runs between 35-45 frames per second, so we definitely have room for higher graphics settings.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:45.580
Sims 4 was designed to be a multiplatform title and therefore it's a native OSX game and runs just as well on OSX as on Windows.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.220
The fan is spinning up a bit during game, 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.300
so if you play without sound and you are in a silent room then you can hear it,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.640
but normally it's not disturbing because of the game music.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:11.360
Obviously the Macbook pro gets a bit warm but not hot, so it's still okay.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:26.920
On medium and with the laptop mode on the game looks much much better and the Iris 6100 IGP can still handle pretty well.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:38.120
We get around 28-35 frames per second, which is enough for this kind of game. I recommend this setting.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:46.760
It looks good and runs smooth even if you zoom out or speed up time or have several sims on the screen.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:02:06.560
Also, the game interface feels smooth, it's not lagging like it did in Sims 3.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:20.480
Keeping the medium settings, but turning off the laptop mode causes the framerate to drop a lot. 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.680
We get 14-15 frames per second, which is pretty much unplayable.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:37.280
If you are watching in 720p 60fps mode then you can see how smooth the mouse cursor movment is.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.720
But how jerky the scrolling and game is.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:59.360
On high settings without laptop mode the game looks pretty much the same as on medium for me.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:09.680
Okay, you have sharper textures and smoother edges and finer shadows, but it doesn't add that much to the game experience and the framerate gets really low.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.200
We get 7-8 frames per second.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:23.040
The interface lags the scrolling is jerky and sometimes it doesn't always register mouse dragging so it's not easy to rotate the camera.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.880
However the mouse cursor is perfectly smooth which is a very good thing

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:37.280
 and it really helps to have a nice gaming experience because you don't feel when your average 25 frames per sec drops to 15 for a second

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.840
because the mouse remains perfectly smooth.
