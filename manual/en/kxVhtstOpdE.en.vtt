00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.350
Today's show is all about stringing and
one of the great things you can do with

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.380
stringing is you can make some fantastic
watches like you see here. Arbel Shemesh

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.070
from Fire Mountain
Gems and Beads

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.689
is here to show us that
in addition to stringing

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:14.589
you can do some other fun
things to get creative

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.830
when making watches. Hi Arbel. What
are you going to be showing us today?

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.800
I'm going to be showing you how
to make this watch bracelet.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.289
As you know, it used to be

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.429
in olden days that if you wanted to
wear a watch, you got your choice

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.020
between leather and metal and that was it.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.020
That's right.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.079
Today it's a whole new world.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.060
Watches are really a fashion accessory.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.750
To start making this watch, what we're
going to do is figure out how to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.170
measure these pieces. How do you
know how long to make your pieces?

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.429
You really want to make it
individually to your hand.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.100
Because it's a bracelet watch,
you want it a little loose but

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.410
not so loose that it falls off or slides
around. It has to be functional.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.940
Yes, exactly.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.280
What you want to do is
measure around your wrist.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.720
Kind of loosely. Then measure the length
of your watch face and the clasp.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.479
Subtract that from the
length of your bracelet

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.210
and then cut a piece of
chain to that length.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.300
Then, you just cut that piece of chain in
half because you're making two pieces.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.820
And, the face is going to
be in the center. Exactly.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.170
So then I've made a hook.

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.490
on the other end of the head pin

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.110
and hooked it through the
middle of the chain.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.850
You can see where the links intersect.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.760
Once it's hooked in there, you
can pick the whole thing up and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.770
you won't lose your place.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.990
So it makes it easier to work on.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.040
Here I've twisted the wire around

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.740
and made a loop. Some people might
consider themselves finished, but

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.819
I like to make a really secure loop.

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.320
So what I do is

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.090
I keep turning it and

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.040
at the point where the two wires touch,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.800
I position my pliers so I'm holding on to
the two wires and just keep turning.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.060
That makes it even more secure. Yes.
What I'm making is really kind of a

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.859
split key chain ring and

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:19.719
when it's finished, it's never

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:24.659
coming off of there. Very secure.
Like this one you see right here.

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.599
That's terrific.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.009
And, I like the different sizes in the
beads you are using too. So pretty.

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.019
You can see

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.439
here on this board that

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.400
I have the beads in small, medium and
large and by alternating those

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.939
back-and-forth, it gives kind of a
different dimension to the bracelet.

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:45.249
Yes, it makes it more fun.

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.049
Once I have put all

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.589
of the pieces in the middle here, it
looks like this and I flip this one over

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:57.919
so that you're looking at
the underside of the chain.

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:02.639
The reason for this is that now
you're going to add the beads

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.489
on either side of the chain. You're
just going to hook into this side

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.029
of the chain and this side of the chain
all the way down. To make it even fuller.

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:11.629
Exactly.

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.640
By the time you have hooked all of those on

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.810
your piece is going to look like this,
which is really full. Do you have to

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.500
leave some length at the end for the
toggle clasp? Yes, you do. You really do.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.879
Just leave a couple of loops
here at the end because

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.779
that'll make it easier to pull your
toggle all the way through the clasp.

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:33.790
That is so commonly forgotten. And, if
you do forget, you can always just add

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.110
more jumprings on the end to add length.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.189
That's a good point.

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.459
Now you want to attach your watch face

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.479
and the clasp. You see
the clasp has a big ring

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.010
to attach to and the watch
face as well has a ring.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.199
The marcasite is beautiful.

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.049
Yes, the marcasite is really wonderful.

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.309
To attach them what you are going
to do is use the jump ring. The way

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.289
to work with the jumpring

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:10.609
is you hold onto it with
two chain or flatnose pliers.

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.060
You open it like this, always sideways.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.909
You add your pieces on

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:21.359
and then when your closing it, before you
close it all the way, you want to press

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.810
in on the sides of the jumpring.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.810
The reason for that is when
you close it all the way

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.220
it has a strong bond in the middle here.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.439
Yes, it's a good way to do that.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.399
I love that the toggle is a heart

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:43.349
which blends in perfectly with the shape
the beads which you have chosen.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.039
Also, if we look at the face of the watch,
as you pointed out a moment ago,

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.309
it has a really nice size

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:49.629
bail on that

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.990
so you can have a nice
jumpring with that too.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.150
And, there's our finished project.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.050
Yes, it's terriffic.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.020
Look this is a very similar one to that.
You can add color, you can do it a

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.259
little bit differently.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.300
You've brought some other examples.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.970
You are able to find so many different
shapes and sizes of the watch faces and

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.680
beads, which is great.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.069
Look at these that you've brought.

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.350
Yes, there's quite a variety.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.729
The ones on the last pad there are

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.999
actually kits as well so you can find
kits. That's good for a beginner.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.590
Thank you so much Arbel. Now
watches can be fun too!
