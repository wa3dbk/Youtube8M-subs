00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.270
Okay, I am doing another test
recording here with Screencast --

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.169
this time with the...

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:12.999
my Galaxy S3 in

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.129
landscape mode

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.140
This will be a shorter recording

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.400
but again i just wanted to mention
that

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.019
when I first tried this

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.369
program out, which is called

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.410
Screencast Video Recorder by Media Solutions,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.410
again as we can see

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.460
there...

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.650
it was choppy, so

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.430
somebody on the

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.600
forum

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.520
mentioned that they had to go to the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.280
settings and the developer options

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.240
and they disabled the hardware overlays... somewhere

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.840
by checking this box right here.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.880
So,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.880
I kinda wanted to see...

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.270
Let's see... I wonder... whether the screen will dim

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.270
when I'm recording also, so let's change that to high.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.270
What did I want to see?  I want to see...

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.409
How do I get to my [SD card]?

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:15.049
That's the end of this test.  All right!  I just wanted to test this in

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.379
landscape mode, basically.
