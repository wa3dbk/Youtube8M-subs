00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.240
In the game destiny the traveler is a mysterious
alien sphere that’s protecting the last

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.950
city, but what if the traveler were real?

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.340
The actual dimensions of the traveler are
a lot harder to find than you might think

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.270
and from some promotional art it is depicted
at varying sizes.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.470
Anything from 300 km diameter to 30 km diameter.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.840
From some promotional information, the traveler
is described as a “city sized entity”

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.960
and looking at the top largest cities across
the world, let’s say the traveler is about

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:41.499
100 km across with a mass of around 114 quadrillion
kilograms and taking up about 524 trillion

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:43.190
cubic meters.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.670
Next to the tallest mountains, deepest trenches,
and human built objects, the traveler would

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.069
be quite the sight to see.

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:53.289
Though in astronomical terms, the traveler
is rather inconsequential.

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:59.179
In fact, seeing the traveler so close, it
helps put a scale on the solar system in a

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.660
way humans traditionally have a hard time
doing.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.750
So how does an object this big simply hover
above earth?

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.470
With a mass of 114 quadrillion kilograms you
could imagine it can get pretty difficult

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.470
to manage.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.580
You would need about 63 million SpaceX Falcon
9 heavy rocket systems, each with a lift off

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.360
thrust of 4 million lbs.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.310
Considering the exhaust would exit at a velocity
between 2250 and 4500 meter per second with

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.540
a temperature of a couple thousand degrees
celsius, if the last city was directly below,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.490
it wouldn’t be a city for very much longer.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.770
***Nuclear energy, dark energy, or space magic
would be the prefered***

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.520
If there were any movement of the traveler,
it would likely be impossible to stabilize.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.130
This is because rockets are extremely difficult
to stabilize and require sophisticated algorithms

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.220
and processing for even straight vertical
paths.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.290
On Earth it would be an amazingly easy target
for really anyone who wanted to cause issues.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.460
Sitting anywhere from 600 meters to 23 km
from the earths surface, if the thrusters

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.190
were to burn out, ***neglecting drag*** it
could smash into the earth at a peak velocity

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.730
of 715 meters/second with a force of 1.2 quintillion
newtons.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.409
The scary part is that it would take just
over a minute to actually impact with 7 million

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:16.681
megatons of energy which is only about 7%
as much the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs

00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:17.681
contained.

00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:18.681
Because of the geometry of the traveler, the
force would be distributed equally around

00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:19.681
the outside ribs.

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:20.681
In space there are no drag forces, spacecraft
typically are made as light as possible and

00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:21.681
under these forces, it would likely fold up
pretty easily.

00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:22.681
If the traveler stayed relatively intact,
the Earth would prevent the traveler from

00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:23.681
sinking too much, therefore the full radius
of the traveler would not be the area of destruction.

00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:24.681
BUT, if the earth was extremely hard such
as mountainous or compacted dry desert, the

00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:25.681
object may begin to roll.

00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:26.681
It all depends on the distance the traveler
sinks into the ground, the friction between

00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:27.681
the traveler and the earth, and the inclination
of the landing area.

00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:28.681
With the traveler being so big, it’s likely
that with earths gravity acting on the body

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:29.681
alone, it wouldn't be able to sustain it’s
own weight anyway.

00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:30.681
Because alien technology is something in which
I know nothing about, it might be more important

00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:31.681
to concern ourselves with what the human impact
would be from alien life as opposed to proving,

00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:32.681
or disproving, space magic.

00:02:32.681 --> 00:02:33.681
So far, humans have not come into contact,
communicated, or even found evidence of alien

00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:34.681
life anywhere.

00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:35.681
The world of Destiny is a much different place.

00:02:35.681 --> 00:02:36.681
Humans have colonized the solar system and
were almost forced into extinction by a multitude

00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:37.681
of different alien species.

00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:38.681
For our case, that is all fantasy but the
traveler is “real”, it’s sitting on

00:02:38.681 --> 00:02:39.681
our doorstep.

00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:40.681
Humans may simply not be capable of understanding
the traveler.

00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:41.681
We would probably be able to understand what
it was made out of but it’s highly unlikely

00:02:41.681 --> 00:02:42.681
we would understand its purpose or function.

00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:44.090
We wouldn’t understand its motives or technology
any more than an ant would understand the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.090
motives of rocket ship.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.090
Is the traveler autonomous or is there life
aboard?

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.090
There would be so many questions that nobody
would know how to answer.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.090
How would this affect everyday life on earth?

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.090
Would wars continue?

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.400
If the traveler traverses the cosmos from
planet to planet, it would likely pick up

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.130
microbial life along the way.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.340
A big thing you hear about in science fiction
movies and books are the lethality of bacteria

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.959
and viruses.

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.720
Viruses evolve specifically to attack a particular
type of cell or organism.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.770
Earth born viruses know human cells very well.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.280
They know where to attach, how to attack,
and how to take over.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.460
In humans, we may not have the same cell material,
cell structure, or cell vulnerabilities alien

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.220
viruses would be accustomed to.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.490
And this is only concerning the case in which
this alien viruses attack in a similar way

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.140
native viruses attack.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.770
Life on earth formed in a very particular
way to survive in the conditions presented.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.530
On an alien planet there would be different
conditions and therefore different biological

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.530
structures.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.970
It isn’t fully known how universal life
is across the universe, but from small changes

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.720
in the types of life on Earth, we would likely
not have to worry about microbial alien life.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.720
It’s the life that has the abilities to
follow the traveler to earth that would pose

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.660
the bigger problem!
