00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.820
Everything I know about the Marvel universe,
I know because I beat it up with Mega Man,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.480
Morrigan, Tron Bonne and Phoenix Wright. That�s
my point of contact. By comparison, I came

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.250
into Injustice with only the most passing
knowledge of DC Comics (which I�m to understand

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.240
is, itself, a redundancy) and a long-since-lapsed
grasp of the mechanics of the Mortal Kombat

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.240
family. Injustice didn�t care. It sat there
in its self-confidence, knowing that it�s

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.660
a quality fighting game with an intriguing
storyline. I just had to open my mind enough

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.750
to realize it. I had to discard my deathgrip
on the StreetFighter-slash-KOF-slash-GuiltyGear

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.600
quartercirclery I know and love. I had to
care about these characters I�d only tangentially

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:06.820
heard of. And in the end, Frankly, it wasn�t
all that difficult.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.360
An act of chaotic supervillainry like, say,
the Joker detonating a nuclear weapon in Metropolis

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.830
is exactly the kind of thing every superhero
aims to stop. And, sure enough, every one

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.030
of them tried to stop it. Problem is, you
get that much awesomeness into a condensed

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.789
area, and things start to get a bit wonky.
Extradimensional chasms may be opened. A dystopian

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.530
alternate-universe might be encountered. Friends
might be enemies, enemies might be friends,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.260
and you yourself might fight you yourself
all paradox-like. Comic Books 101, really.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.899
What matters is that the action scenes - played
today by head-to-head 2D fights - are freaking

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.209
awesome. A couple things have changed, but
the basic gist is the same it�s ever been:

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.750
Beat up on your opponent until their health
bar depletes. But, as this is part of the

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.429
Mortal Kombat lineage as opposed to the Japanese
style more popular in the genre, there�s

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.240
more directional inputs and less stick-spinning
circle-fractions. And then, just for good

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.280
measure, there�s a whole extra layer of
complexity, like follow-up attacks on your

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.069
superpowers, really fleshed-out character-specific
mechanics that make Order Sol and Zappa look

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:13.520
like chumps, and crap on the ground or in
the vicinity that can be utilized in your

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.570
assault.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.790
And that�s where the game sold me. Yes,
in competitive situations you�re probably

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.250
not going to want wild shifts in terrain or
grenades popping up on the ground. But you

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.680
have the option to have those things, and
I think it makes for the kind of wild experience

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.110
that befits such heroic characters. Over-the-top,
crazy attacks make a game like Injustice that

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.370
much more entertaining, and if you can do
it while retaining some semblance of balance,

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.210
so much the better. Add in a solid roster
out of the box (with the now-obligatory DLC

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.720
fighters coming soon), an extensive mission
mode that rewards technical accomplishment,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.050
and what amounts to a bajillion or so arcade-style
challenges, and you might just get me to buy

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.459
a comic book. Despite, y�know, the fact
that print is dead.
