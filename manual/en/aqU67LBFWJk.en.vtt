00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.089
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - It's great to see you again
Darcy, but I have to tell you I didn't even

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.089
recognize you.

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:08.089
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - That's the goal.

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:13.410
I have a lot of enemies so it's really nice
because now I can walk by and smile and they

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.660
don't have a clue.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.750
It's weird right?

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.869
I get freaked out when I walk by reflective
surfaces.

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:18.869
Who's that?

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:19.869
Oh that's me.

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:29.269
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - When I first met you living
in Ladner, scruffier, hairier, heavier, and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.330
you called yourself the undercover fag.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.330
Who are you now?

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.330
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - God, I don't know.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.470
I'm adorable though.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.870
If I had known I was this cute I would have
put in an effort in years ago.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.870
&gt;&gt; I've lost 100 pounds since last year.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.300
A hundred!

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.980
Yeah, I lost you.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.590
No I did, you used to be right here, we used
to have some fun.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.780
Oh my god.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.899
It's weird though when you lose weight especially
100 pounds the first thing people saw is "How

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.510
did you do it" and fat people are like "How
did you DO IT!?

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.989
Tell me the secret."

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.850
And there's no secret it's what we've always
been told.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.320
You know, it's diet, exercise, cocaine that's
how you do it.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.190
I'm just kidding it was AIDS.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.380
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - I don't know who I am anymore,
I just know I'm not dying and I feel fantastic.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.979
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - I'm very glad to here you
are not dying.

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.150
Is that why you changed your look?

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.810
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - Well no, well I had a health
scare so I was like okay let's pay a little

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.810
more attention.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.780
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - But if you are no longer
the undercover fag

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.640
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - I have no act I know!

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.369
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - Does that mean you have
to change part of your act?

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.840
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - Well the DVD is kind of
that's all retired now.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.399
The new DVD 'One Skinny Bitch'

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.399
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - Yeah shameless plug

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.920
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - Yeah shameless plug it's
three dollars people.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.200
I wanted to record it and get it out there
because I knew the act was done.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.720
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - Ok but you are worrying
me a little about new act.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.440
When I first say the ad for your special and
I factored in your increasing success.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.530
I thought oh no, he's not toning down is he?

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.440
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - Oh god no.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.670
If anything I could care less now.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.670
Well you've seen the special.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.370
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - I loved the special, I
was so relieved.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.720
It was great.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.410
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - If anything I think I have
more freedom now then I ever did before because

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.780
my confidence is through the roof.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.530
Probably over confident if anything.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.750
But I could give a fuck.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.610
I'm having a great time and if people don't
like what I am doing then there's the door,

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.620
you don't get a refund.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.700
No one is safe, nothing is untapped anymore
in the new show.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.990
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - Is there anything you won't
touch?

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.670
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - Uhh... no.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.110
I think if it's funny it's funny.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.980
Like I talk about my cancer in the show, people
don't like that sometimes.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.960
I deal with it in a different way then you
deal with it.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.620
You don't want to sit next to me at a funeral
is what I'm saying.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.100
Because that's when I'm the funniest.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.730
My mom won't let my dad and I sit together
because he can't hold it together.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.360
Like dark hours are when I'm super funny.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.569
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - What's your favourite part
in the new special?

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.410
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - Uhh definitely the Oprah.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.130
&gt;&gt; Well I fucking jerked off after the gym
I should have called Guiness, I shot across

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.510
the fucking room.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.160
It was like Oprah cum.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.800
It was like "I'm coming!"

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.140
You get some sperm, you get some sperm, everybody
gets some sperm.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.600
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - I love it because gay guys
on stage don't talk about sex to straight

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.140
audiences very often.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.220
I don't know why I get away with it.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.739
But audiences dig it.

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.650
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - You know my favourite part
from your special is the one about adopting

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.750
the Filipino woman from Walmart.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.080
I walked around saying Okay

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.080
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - Okay.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.900
It's weird because I hesitate with jokes like
that because I don't think there's anything

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.500
racist about the joke per se.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.890
But people get very sensitive about race related
humour.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.460
I do get hesitate but I do love that joke.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.100
&gt;&gt; You're going to be our kid now.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.100
Ok.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.100
We need someone for the parade.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.100
Ok.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.350
How old are you?

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.350
Ok.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.570
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - Do you ever take any heat
for not being politically correct?

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.230
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - Not yet but I just think
the wrong people haven't seen it yet.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.190
Because I do make some pretty racy jokes.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.650
Especially in the newer stuff.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.720
Equating my weight loss to AIDS probably is
going to get me in trouble.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.740
But hey it's the glow that counts.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.530
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - How important is it that
it might get you into trouble.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.710
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - I don't care.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.600
I think anyone who when you dissect comedy
then you've clearly got too much time on your

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.600
hands.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.630
If you don't like a joke, don't laugh, move
on.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.720
That's the way I look at it.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.150
If someone says something that I find offensive.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.870
Shitty for me.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.710
Talking about comedy is like dancing about
architecture.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:09.710
There's no point.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.400
You either laughed or you didn't and then
you move on.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.060
People might not get it.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.850
I get more flak for saying fag on stage than
I do for anything else and that's from the

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.500
community.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.130
I don't care about it.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.710
Faggot is a word that I love and use and take
to the grave.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.180
I think we are at a point in society where
we are trying to sensitize all of our language.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.770
I'm adamantly against that.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.110
We have words to use that are powerful and
strong when they need to be and fun and campy

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.110
when they need to be.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.620
And if we start taking words out of our language.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.430
Then we have no way to communicate with each
other.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.990
Sometimes someone is a fucking faggot.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.270
And other times he's a faggot.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.270
You know?

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.430
It's just a good word.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.120
If people don't like it then don't come to
the show.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.949
Or come to the show I don't care, I want your
money.

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.771
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - So you are playing at Yuk,
Yuk's in Vancouver soon in time for father's

00:06:02.771 --> 00:06:03.830
day.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.610
You - a weed smoking, dick-driven, rauchy
as hell dad.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.610
How cool is that?

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.360
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - Father's day weekend is
perfect for me.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.630
There will be people coming to the show to
you know bring their dads and stuff and hey

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.010
there are other types of dads out there.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.620
Just don't bring social services.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.860
That's all I ask.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.080
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - I promise I won't tell
them.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.080
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - Please don't

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.070
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - Is it hard having a new
look after all of the years of getting yourself

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.440
known with the previously look?

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.190
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - I'm like the Madonna of
comedy.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.810
I'm just always going to switch it up.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.280
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - Just keep re-inventing
yourself.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.690
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - Two more years and I'm
going to be Asian.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.300
Although if I smoke anymore weed today I could
be Asian.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.430
&gt;&gt; ROBIN PERELLE - It is so good to see you
again

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.610
&gt;&gt; DARCY MICHAEL - It's been great thank you.�
