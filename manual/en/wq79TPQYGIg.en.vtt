00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.260
- Hey everyone, welcome to Garden Fork.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.380
Today, something really
cool I've been thinking

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.160
about all year in my head.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.060
I've finally built a
maple syrup evaporator

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.690
out of a filing cabinet.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.523
- [Woman] Dreams come true.

00:00:12.523 --> 00:00:14.240
- And it is really cool.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.200
(woman chuckles)

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.297
We did a time lapse video
about the construction of it,

00:00:18.297 --> 00:00:20.890
and so this video is more
about how the thing works.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.383
Okay, let's go take a look.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.643
- [Woman] Wow

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.980
- All your scrap lumber, pallets,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.023
this is perfect for pallet size wood.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.810
It goes in here, and making maple syrup.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.670
I learned about this from
Annie Corrigan at Earth Eats.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.283
It's a great radio show
from Indiana Public Radio.

00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:52.157
And Mike Bell at the
Hinkel-Garten Farmstead made this.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.560
They took some pictures and put it

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.210
on the Earth Eats Flickr
set, and I saw it,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.030
and I was like, I have
to build this thing.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.470
And I did, I found a, my
neighbor was throwing out

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.550
a metal filing cabinet,
a four drawer cabinet,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.700
so I grabbed that and then I kept it.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.900
And then I went to the
restaurant supply store

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.030
and bought steam table trays.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.360
These are stainless
steel steam table trays,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.310
you get them in different
sizes and different depths.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.460
This is what I opted for,
15, 20 bucks a piece.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.080
On the end here I have a little
space for like a pre-heating

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.187
some of the sap before it
gets ladled in to the trays.

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:29.360
[Woman] So it's warming up

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.380
so that it takes less time for it to boil?

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.270
- Exactly. The chimney,
this is a four inch chimney.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.870
I thought four inch might be too narrow,

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.050
I thought I might need six
but it's pulling really well.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.570
It's a work in progress
of making it stable.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.460
I used some guy wire
and some strapping here.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.670
- [Woman] Wow, what's that?

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.860
- I've been to a number
of my friends' sap houses,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.760
and they had the super
stainless steel rig,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.580
and they turbo-charge their
fires by taking a bathroom vent

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.260
and plugging it into the firebox.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.413
So I did that, and man
does it make the fire hot,

00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:06.400
to the point where this is at
is almost too hot, I thought.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.210
So I use this to initially start the fire.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.660
It's kinda like fireplace
bellows to get your fire started,

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.180
and then I discovered
that this thing burns

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.330
on its own really nicely, so
you can opt for this or not.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.830
If you're burning big logs,

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.930
you might need what I call
the fan turbo charger.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.438
- [Woman] And it heated up
really quickly too, right,

00:02:24.438 --> 00:02:25.640
even in the initial?

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.473
- Yeah.

00:02:26.473 --> 00:02:27.306
- [Woman] Yeah, it's amazing.

00:02:27.306 --> 00:02:30.570
- The door is the top
of the filing cabinet.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.670
I just cut the sides
and I put the hinges on,

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.523
and then I cut the top and
bottom and we got a door.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.400
In here is some, it's
called expanded steel,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.930
it's like steel grating.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.130
And then to hold that up off
the bottom of the file cabinet,

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.910
I used terra cotta clay garden pots.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.783
- [Woman] Oh, 'cause they're fireproof.

00:02:49.783 --> 00:02:52.610
- They're like fire brick
and we have a ton of them

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.420
in the shed, and I'm like,
what am I gonna do with these,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.840
and then I finally realized
I thought I would have

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.240
to go buy some fire brick or something.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.490
And that works perfectly.

00:03:02.187 --> 00:03:03.810
(fire crackling)

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.330
I've been collecting scrap wood,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.010
a lot of pallets.
- [Woman] Yes he has.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.190
- And stashing it in the shed.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.267
- [Woman] And the kitchen (laughs).

00:03:12.267 --> 00:03:13.810
- And I've been boiling all day

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.010
and I've barely broken
into part of the shed here.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.350
But this is kind of a,
this is a pallet length,

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.340
and it's perfect for here

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.360
because it's the same length as the trays,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.360
so this goes in here and
then I've been leaving this,

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.970
uh oh, just slightly ajar.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.670
You know you could put a vent down here,

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.630
an adjustable vent if you wanted,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.880
but I found that just
having this slightly open,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.637
it pulls really well.

00:03:41.637 --> 00:03:42.950
- [Woman] And there's
enough of a space there

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.470
so it's getting some air, right?

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.303
Right.

00:03:47.672 --> 00:03:49.755
I really like this.

00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:51.123
- [Woman] He does.

00:03:51.123 --> 00:03:52.900
- When you first get this all built,

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.830
do an initial burn with
just water in the trays,

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.950
because you're gonna have to burn off

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.990
all the paint that's on here.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.660
It just peels off, and then
you can scrape it down,

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.160
and then you can put your
syrup in there and start going.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.470
So here's my thinking on this.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.420
The sap that comes out
of storage goes first

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.630
into this pre-heating pot here.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.030
That gets put into here, and
the boiling sap that's in here

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.530
gets ladled into our finish tray.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.017
So what I do is I take
the boiling sap from here

00:04:24.017 --> 00:04:27.083
and I put it into our, I add
it to our finishing tray,

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.230
and then whatever I take out of here,

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.230
I fill it back up from our pot
that's pre-heating over here.

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:40.210
And that's what I've done all day.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.790
What we're doing with the
evaporator is we're removing water

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.320
from the sap and that
increases the sugar content.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.120
The sugar content is x and
there's a whole bunch of water.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.470
We're boiling off a lot of the water,

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.560
and by going step by step by step,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.880
I go from my pot to the first
tray to the second tray,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.863
I'm removing more and
more water each time.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.880
That's how an evaporator
works, it evaporates water.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.230
- [Woman] So at every step it gets better

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.063
and better and better.

00:05:08.063 --> 00:05:10.380
- Yeah, and this isn't
smoke, this is all steam

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.440
that's coming off the sap.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.120
- [Woman] So it take s a lot of sap

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.560
to make a little syrup, right?

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.890
- It's usually about 40 gallons of sap

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.080
to one gallon of syrup.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.790
Sometimes it's 30, just depends
on the year and the tree.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:23.920
- [Woman] That's why it's expensive.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.618
- Yep. Woo that's hot!

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.370
- [Woman] Did you just burn yourself?

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.780
- You can't stay too close
to this thing for too long.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.880
Alright, so let's talk
about actually finishing

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.713
the maple syrup.

00:05:33.713 --> 00:05:35.390
We have a video, several videos,

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.120
about making maple syrup
with a propane burner.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.186
Watch that video.

00:05:40.186 --> 00:05:42.270
But basically we're going to bring this up

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.190
to about 215 degrees, it will
bubble and get all foamy,

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.580
and then lift this whole
tray out, and we finish it

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.570
in the kitchen on the stovetop.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.670
You don't want to do, I
don't want to do a final here

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.120
because I can't control it nearly as well

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.450
as I can on the stovetop.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.410
But bring it up to, you
know, 214, 215 here,

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.103
lift it out and then
finish it on your stovetop.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.963
- [Woman] It's for your
pancakes, Charlie pup.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.803
Boring. What are we up to?

00:06:22.864 --> 00:06:23.697
- 210,

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:25.963
211
- 11, 25.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.920
Yeah so just check your temperature.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.893
When it really starts to
bubble up, act quickly.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.160
- [Woman] What if you don't act quickly?

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.844
- It'll burn.

00:06:39.844 --> 00:06:40.677
- [Woman] Ew.

00:06:40.677 --> 00:06:41.585
- Like my hand's burning.

00:06:41.585 --> 00:06:43.600
(woman laughing)

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.823
These are cool. It's smoking,
I wonder if, did I burn it?

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:49.392
Oh well.

00:06:49.392 --> 00:06:53.370
But you can tell when
the bubbles become more--

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.203
- [Woman] Bubbly

00:06:54.203 --> 00:06:55.230
- Intense, it's kind of hard to see

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.760
because of the steam coming off,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.010
but there's this point
where it starts to look

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.000
like Guinness Stout, and that's
when you should pull it off.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.787
- [Woman] We don't all know
what that looks like (laughs).

00:07:04.787 --> 00:07:06.550
- Anyone that watches
Garden Fork should know

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.100
what Guinness Stout looks like.

00:07:11.114 --> 00:07:13.864
(fire crackling)

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.760
Nice huh?

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.670
- [Woman] That's your syrup?

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.503
- Yeah.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:20.940
- [Woman] It's thick?

00:07:22.051 --> 00:07:23.251
- Yum yum, is that good.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.320
- [Woman] Are you gonna
drink that by the glass full?

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.840
- No but I'm gonna double dip.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.950
So everyone that makes a
comment about double dipping,

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.900
yeah, I'm double dipping.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.760
Alright, the link to watch
our other maple syrup videos

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.930

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.080
We put out stuff every
week, cooking, gardening,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.280
beekeeping, stuff like this.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.010
- [Woman] I like what you're
doing, can I have a sip?

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.624
- Sure you can.

00:07:49.624 --> 00:07:50.518
(woman laughing)

00:07:50.518 --> 00:07:53.018
(smooth jazz)
