00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:07.609
Hi.

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.910
I’m Lorie Marrero, creator of the Clutter
Diet book and on-line program, and today I

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.509
have for you [POP] three kitchen organizing
hacks.

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.780
I’m here in my own kitchen and I wanted
to show you a few little things maybe you

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.930
hadn’t thought of before.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.740
First, I use a hand blender all the time.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.380
I mean, multiple times a day.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.700
And so does my family.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.500
We make a lot of protein shakes and vitamin
powder shakes and things like that.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.190
So we want this to be handy by the sink where
we can easily use it and rinse it off and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.250
put it back.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.450
And we want it to be plugged in all the time
so that we’re not constantly unplugging

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.040
it and plugging it back in all day long.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.790
Now, I want to show you that this blade detaches
for us to clean it just so if you’re worried

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.690
about my safety, then please don’t worry.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.260
We do take it off to clean it.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.850
[POP] But it is plugged in.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.690
And that way we can just put it away.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.940
This is on the back of the sink cabinet door.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.579
I have a broom holder here believe it or not.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.430
This is meant for holding brooms and mops
and things like that.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.070
You can also use a simple hook or even the
mounting hardware that might have come with

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.070
your hand blender.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.240
I know some of the brands actually have that
in the package.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.160
So I just kind of loop the cord around a little
bit to keep it out of the way and I pop it

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.460
in there and it stays put.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.200
I use this clip to keep the cord, you know,
extended when we’re using it and so it doesn’t

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.850
kind of fall down too far.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.640
But anyway, that’s what I do with the hand
blender.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.590
So think about what you could put under your
kitchen sink cabinet and in the door there

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.479
and make it handy for you for whatever you
need to be more efficient every day.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.960
I also want to show you the back of my spice
cabinet door.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.420
Here I’ve used cork tiles, or actually more
accurately pieces of cork tiles.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.830
I have mounted them here with liquid nails
that you can buy at the hardware store.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.530
And they go here to just simply give me little
notes for recipes and things that I do frequently.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.630
You can see I’ve got a recipe for poached
eggs there that I want to remind myself of

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.630
frequently.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.540
And also I have a substitutions cheat sheet
so if I forget how many tablespoons are in

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.599
a quarter cup, or if I forget what to do if
I’m out of baking powder, all of those little

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.930
kitchen cheats are there for me and they are
handy right there on the spice cabinet door.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.190
So think about where you could put some cork
tile to have handy notes for yourself for

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.240
reference.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.240
And then thirdly I wanted to show you how
to use all those little extra slivers of wall

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.330
space to your best advantage.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.690
I have some really large kitchen tools, like
a potato masher and some aprons that are hanging

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.170
and they are in the narrowest of spaces in
my pantry and I simply just put a nail in

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.530
the wall and hang those things on the nail.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.030
So you can use any little sliver of space
for something that you need and just get it

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.680
out of the way, out of a drawer where it might
be cluttering up something else.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.520
So see what you think about those and add
your own tips to the comments.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:07.470
We’ll see you next time and may you always
be happy and grateful for having more than

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.850
enough.
