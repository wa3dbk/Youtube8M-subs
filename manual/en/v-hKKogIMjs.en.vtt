Hello Youtube friends¡¡

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.620
In this opportunity we are going to learn how to do the "Hard Reset" to a LG E615 L5 DUAL.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.700
As you can see it.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.080
I am going to uncover it so that you observe the model in detail.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.800
This is a dual sim LG.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.180
Look  it. E615.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.760
To do the Hard Reset of this phone we are going to do the following:

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.000
Press the volume down button.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.660
And the power button for a few moments.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.380
Until the lower tactile buttons light up.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.500
Immediately this buttons light up, release the buttons and quickly press the home button.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.880
This should be done very quickly.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.780
Then let's do it.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.220
Press the volumen down button and the power button.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.140
Release and press home button quickly.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.140
If done correctly, the android logo should appear running a process.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.740
As you can see it.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.800
The first attempt worked, many times not so, and several attempts have to be made.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.080
If it does not work on the first attempt, remove the battery or wait for the phone to turn on normally, turn it off.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.100
And then repeat everything from the beginning.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.020
Until it works.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.880
The phone automatically restarts.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.240
And when turned on completely.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.920
The phone will be to reset to factory mode.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.480
Remember to have the battery charged before doing this process.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.760
Ok

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.920
Select the language.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.600
Next

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.360

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.260
