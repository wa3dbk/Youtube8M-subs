00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:08.490
CLANCY ROSE: Now we will get into steaming
the milk. There are three processes in preparing

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:20.039
the milk for a single cappuccino. And the
first is after you have the pitcher like this

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.880
and the steam wand is in the milk and after
you turn on the steam wand and start steaming,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.019
the first process that you are going to do
is kind of hold it. I would like to hold the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.079
pitcher in this groove here and hold it at
an angle and get the milk rolling, so it is

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.670
kind of spinning inside the pitcher while
the tip of the steam wand is submerged in

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:52.700
the milk. Right when you can feel the milk
break into the same temperature as your hand,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.030
which is about a hundred degrees, right when
you can feel it warm up you will drop it down

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.920
to start stretching or introducing air and
that is where you are making the foam in the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.670
milk and that is what you are going to do.
You are not going to have to do as much for

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.160
a lighter, like, a skim milk or something
like that. More foam is created more evenly

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.920
with a lighter milk. And then the third process
is you push the pitcher back up, submerge

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.890
the steam wand once again and then get it
spinning again, and that is going to blend

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.140
your foam with your steam milk and kind of
get a nice consistency throughout the milk.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:50.979
So I will demonstrate that.
