MYA (VOICEOVER): "Full
Time Kid" with Mya.

00:00:07.476 --> 00:00:08.450
[GIGGLES]

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.950
Hello.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.910
I'm Mya, the Full Time Kid, and
I'm in my full time kitchen.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.660
And today, I'm gonna
teach you how to make

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.370
your very own colorful pasta.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.492
Here's what you'll need.

00:00:16.492 --> 00:00:19.410
A big pot, some
spaghetti noodles

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.760
or any noodles you
want, a tablespoon,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.590
some water, some
sandwich bags, a pinch

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.680
of salt, a strainer, some
food coloring, and an adult.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.500
Let's get cooking.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.320
First, boil some water.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.080
[GAS IGNITING]

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.540
This might take a while.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.300
Looks like the water's boiling.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.210
Add a pinch of salt so the
noodles don't stick together.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.760
Then add your noodles.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.900
While the water's boiling,
we're going to prepare our bags.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.020
First, put in two tablespoons of
water into your bags like this.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.110
One, two.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.550
Now pick a color-- any color--
and put two to four drops

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.540
into your bag.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.440
I'm gonna close the bag.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.859
Now do that with all
the remaining colors.

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:07.525
When you're done with
your plastic bags,

00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:09.241
it should look like this.

00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:09.740
[CHIMES]

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.856
Pretty, isn't it?

00:01:10.856 --> 00:01:11.730
The noodles are done.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.980
We strain them and rinse
them in cold water.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.920
To dye them, simply
open your bag

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.130
and put in an equal
amount of noodles.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.860
Be careful.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.685
Your noodles might be a bit hot.

00:01:26.395 --> 00:01:28.480
This pasta is looking delicious.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.562
Now it's time to shake.

00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:33.418
Shake, shake, shake,
shake, shake, shake, shake.

00:01:33.418 --> 00:01:36.274
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:38.627 --> 00:01:40.710
Once your noodles have set
for about five minutes,

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.865
you're going to rinse
them under water.

00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:46.010
Then you're going to put it
into separate bowls like this.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.910
Now carefully pour all the
colors into one big bowl.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.470
Now mix them around with a fork.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.910
Season to taste.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.190
You can do anything you want.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.842
I'm adding in a pinch of salt.

00:01:59.842 --> 00:02:04.735
Once it's seasoned,
it's time to dig in.

00:02:04.735 --> 00:02:06.651
Mmm.

00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:09.423
Al dente, just
the way I like it.

00:02:09.423 --> 00:02:13.904
But if you don't want to eat it,
you can of course play with it.

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:16.284
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:17.712 --> 00:02:21.044
Do I have anything on my face?

00:02:21.044 --> 00:02:22.907
Hope you had fun
making this pasta.

00:02:22.907 --> 00:02:23.740
Thanks for watching.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.310
Make sure to tell
me in the comments

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.906
how you play with your food.

00:02:27.906 --> 00:02:28.874
Bye!

00:02:28.874 --> 00:02:30.794
Bah!

00:02:30.794 --> 00:02:31.294

MAN: What are you doing there?

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:35.166
Um.

00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:35.975
WOMAN: Taste test.

00:02:35.975 --> 00:02:37.070
Taste test, yeah.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.570
[BEEP]

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.388
Just like I would, like I
would like it. [GIGGLES]

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.124
Brains!

00:02:45.124 --> 00:02:48.297
[GAGS] I think I'm eating
more of my hair than pasta.
