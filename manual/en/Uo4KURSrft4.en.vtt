00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.500
Welcome to Bigpoint Berlin.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.500
My name’s Bernd Beyreuther and I’m the Producer of Drakensang Online.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.500
Drakensang Online has been in the closed beta since May

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000
and the team had to adapt the way they work

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.500
due to the fact that developing and producing a live online game

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.000
is a new experience for us.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The largest change is that we now review the numbers from the previous evening.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We check to see how the servers performed,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
how many players were on them, if there were any problems, or if there were any crashes.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We analyze these numbers and then

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
we discuss them briefly in our daily team stand-up meetings along with the daily goals.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I’m Florian Busse and I’m the supervisor for level design.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In our stand-up meetings, we review everything that we did the day before.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The team members’ workflows are synchronized.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
For some work processes, we have a road map which helps them make better

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.500
and more flexible decisions on their own and determine what their goals for the day should be.  

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.500
We’re currently working on Tegans Wall, which is the first game expansion.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.000
Thanks to special locations which are being added, players will turn around the corner and say: “Oh wow!

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.500
There’s something totally different going on here!”

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.000
I’m really proud of the fact that we managed to create such an outdoor world.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Because of our modular system, we originally thought: “We’re never going do it!”

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.500
The fact that we can now offer such diverse terrain is something I’m very proud of.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.000
As well as the fact that we’re doing it with the amount of data space we have available.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I’m Ivonne and I’m the author of Drakensang online and I write all the quest texts.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I think it’s great that the world is constantly expanding and that you can always add additional details.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
In the Teganswall update, we come to the end of the first chapter in Duria.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
My name is Robin Henkys.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I’m the Lead Game Designer of Drakensang Online.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Teganswall is mainly going to give higher-level players (between level 30–40) new game content.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The herald is our new level-40 boss.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.500
With the herald, I think we’ll set new standards for boss battles.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.500
We’ve spent a lot of time considering how to make a great boss battle in a hack-and-slash game.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.000
And I think we’ve managed to put it together well.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I think the herald is really going to raise the bar.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Creating the concept for a boss battle is relatively difficult because it’s an interdisciplinary process.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.000
A lot of people are involved:

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Effects people need to make the battle visually appealing,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
animators, lots of programmers to create the mechanics,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and of course the game designers who need to plan out how the battle will go.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
But in the end, it’s always difficult to predict exactly how the players will react to it.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So we plan, test, give it a try, balance and tweak.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I want the players to be able to see for themselves the full power of the Anderworld

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and to really go into the depths of evil against the herald

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:17.000
in order to confront this danger which threatens their world.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I think this is something that the players can really look forward to.
