00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.009
There's been a real surge of interest in cold-brewed
beverages - both coffee and tea.

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.780
Today I'm going to share with you an easy, step-by-step
guide to making cold-brewed iced tea at home.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.920
Before you begin, you'll want to assemble
the following ingredients and equipment:

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.790
A package of your favorite Arbor Teas' loose
leaf tea - almost any variety will brew up great

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.170
A teaspoon measure

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.210
A T-sac, tea infuser, or strainer;
And a pitcher;

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.450
Start by measuring your loose leaf tea. Generally,
you should measure 1 teaspoon loose leaf tea

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.000
per cup of iced tea. But fluffier blends - like
white teas and some herbals - may require

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.940
as much as one tablespoon or more, while denser
teas such as gunpowder may require less than one teaspoon.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.149
Just flip over the label on your Arbor Teas
bag to find our suggested serving size per cup.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.320
Place the tea in a T-sac or infuser, and place
that in your glass or iced tea pitcher.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.489
If you are using a pitcher with a built in strainer
(like our Cold Brew Iced Tea Maker here),

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.950
or you plan on straining out your tea, simply
place the leaves directly in the pitcher.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.780
Fill your container with 1 cup room temperature
water per final cup of iced tea you intend to make.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.459
Just pour the water over the tea-filled
T-Sac or infuser, or directly over the tea leaves.

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:15.560
Be sure the tea is covered completely
with water.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.889
If you're making tea for lots of people and
need to scale up the recipe, one quart of

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:23.119
iced tea generally requires a ½ ounce of
loose leaf tea.

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.819
Now just place your glass or pitcher in the
refrigerator for 6 to 10 hours - basically overnight.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.179
Remove the leaves when you’ve reached the
desired strength or strain the tea when you

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:34.679
serve it.

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.869
Doesn't that look delicious?

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.929
Another nice thing about cold-brewing your
iced tea is that it practically never clouds,

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.979
as some teas can when chilled too quickly.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.440
You might be surprised to know that heating the water is the most energy-intensive step

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.760
in the whole process of growing, manufacturing, shipping and preparing your tea. 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.580
Cold brewing your
tea is eco-friendly because it slashes energy use by eliminating the water-heating process.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.980
