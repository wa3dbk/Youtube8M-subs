00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:09.690
And so my fellow Americans, ask not what your
country can do for you, ask what you can do

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.789
for your country.

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:19.430
I pledge you that we shall neither commit
nor provoke aggression.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.570
That we shall neither flee nor invoke the
threat of force.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.000
That we shall never negotiate out of fear
and we shall never fear to negotiate.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.070
Terror is not a new weapon.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.079
Throughout history, it has been used by those
who could not prevail either by persuasion

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.780
or example.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:51.500
But, inevitably, they fail, either because
men are not afraid to die for a life worth

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:59.530
living, or because terrorists themselves came
to realize free men cannot be frightened by

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.809
threats, and that aggression would meet its
own response.

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.820
And it is, in the light of that history, that
every nation should know - be he friend or

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:19.130
foe - that the United States has both the
will and the weapons to join free men in standing

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.920
up to their responsibilities.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.360
All free men, wherever they may live, are
citizens of Berlin.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:39.600
And therefore, as a free man, I take pride
in the words ich bin ein Berliner.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.060
The path we have chosen for the present is
full of hazards, as all paths are.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.659
But is is the one most consistent with our
character and courage as a nation, and our

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.100
commitments around the world.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.649
The cost of freedom is always high, but Americans
have always paid it.

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.009
And one path we shall never choose and that
is the path of surrender, or submission.

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.079
We choose to go to the moon.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:13.570
We choose to go to the moon in this decade
and do the other things, not because they

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.700
are easy, but because they are hard.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:24.250
Because that goal will serve to organize and
measure the best of our energies and skills.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.800
Because that challenge is one that we're willing
to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.190
and one we intend to win, and the others too.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.800
I believe in an America where the separation
of church and state is absolute.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.360
Where no Catholic prelate, would tell the
president, should he be Catholic, how to act.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.560
And no Protestant minister would tell his
parishioners for whom to vote.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.580
Where no church or church school is granted
any public funds or political preference.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.840
And where no man is denied public office merely
because his religion differs from the president

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.790
who might appoint him, or the people who might
elect him.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.240
I have therefore chosen this time and place
to discuss a topic upon which ignorance too

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:26.800
often abounds, and the truth too rarely perceived,
and that is the most important topic on earth,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.290
peace.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.790
What kind of a peace do I mean and what kind
of a peace do we seek?

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:40.040
Not a Pax-Americana, enforced on the world
by American weapons of war.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.170
Not the peace of the grave, or the security
of the slayed.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:52.620
I am talking about genuine peace, the kind
of peace that makes life on Earth worth living.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.310
The kind that enables men and nations to grow
and to hope and build a better life for their

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.140
children.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.720
Not merely peace for Americans, but peace
for all men and women, not merely peace in

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.980
our time, but peace in all time.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.290
We are confronted primarily with a moral issue.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.760
It is as old as the Scriptures and is as clear
as the American constitution.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.200
The heart of the question is whether all Americans
are to be afforded equal rights and equal

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.150
opportunities.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.690
Whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans
as we want to be treated.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.850
If an American, because his skin is dark,
cannot eat lunch in a restaurant open to the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:44.820
public, if he cannot send his children to
the best public school available, if he cannot

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.380
vote for the public officials who represent
him, if, in short, he cannot enjoy the full

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:58.010
and free life that all of us want, then who
among us would be content to have the color

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.070
of his skin changed and stand in his place?

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.710
Who among us would then be content with the
councils of 'patience' and 'delay'?

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:15.510
100 years of delay have passed since President
Lincoln freed the slaves, yet their heirs,

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.120
their grandsons, are not fully free.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:26.240
They are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice,
they are not yet freed from social and economic

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.790
oppression.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:35.490
And this nation, for all its hopes and all
its boasts, will not be fully free until all

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.250
its citizens are free.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.580
The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free
and open society.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:50.280
And we are as a people inherently and historically
opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths,

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.890
and to secret proceedings.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:06:00.520
We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive
and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.250
far outweighed the dangers which are cited
to justify it.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.840
Even today, there is little value in opposing
the threat of a closed society by imitating

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.510
its arbitrary restrictions.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:21.050
Even today, there is little value in insuring
the survival of our nation if our traditions

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.490
do not survive with it.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:30.510
And there is very grave danger that an announced
need for increased security will be seized

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:36.590
upon by those anxious to expand its meaning
to the very limits of official censorship

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.670
and concealment.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.320
That I do not intend to permit to the extent
that it is within my control.
