00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.270
Today on this 2004 Toyota RAV4 were going
to be installing Draw Tite Hitch part number

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.220
75125.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.621
Well give you some measurements to help you
select accessories like a bike rack and a

00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:11.700
cargo carrier.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.049
From the center of the hitch pinhole to the
farthest south part of the vehicle which,

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.630
in this case, is the spare tire thats mounted
on the back of the RAV4, we have 10 inches

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.490
and from the ground to the top of the receiver
opening the measurements 15 5/8 inches.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.200
Now well go ahead with our installation.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.929
The first step is to remove the tow bracket
on the driver side of the vehicle.

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:39.530
The tow bracket and bolts that are holding
it on will be returned to the owner and will

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.680
not be reused.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:49.449
Next, well use some spray lubricant and a
brush part number 814092 to clean the weld

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:55.659
knots in the vehicle frame to make sure theyre
ready for the new bolts that are going be

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.019
used to install the hitch.

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.659
Well repeat that same process on the passenger
side of the vehicle.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.120
Next well go ahead and point out our attachment
points.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.890
On the driver side theres 2 weld knots where
we remove the tow hook and on the passenger

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.280
side there are 2 weld knots and those are
identical to the one on the driver side.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:31.060
Next well go ahead and put our 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:02:05.610
hitch 
into place.
