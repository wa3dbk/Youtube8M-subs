00:00:01.696 --> 00:00:04.026
&gt;&gt; Here in Flagstaff we
can see one of the problems

00:00:04.026 --> 00:00:07.616
that many southwestern gardeners
face, that is wildlife damage

00:00:07.616 --> 00:00:10.296
to the garden, especially if
they live near a national forest

00:00:10.296 --> 00:00:12.266
and the deer and the elk
come and visit their garden

00:00:12.506 --> 00:00:13.616
and feed on their plants.

00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:16.016
We're at the garden
of Molly Larson,

00:00:16.506 --> 00:00:19.046
one of the Flagstaff master
gardeners who's very innovative

00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:20.166
in the way she's
dealing with this:

00:00:20.476 --> 00:00:23.116
She's observing what the
deer and the elk like to eat

00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:24.216
and what they don't like to eat.

00:00:24.576 --> 00:00:27.946
Let's see what she can
share with us about that.

00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:32.446
Molly, you have a very
attractive garden here.

00:00:32.446 --> 00:00:33.576
&gt;&gt; Well, hello, Curtis.

00:00:33.676 --> 00:00:36.136
It is attractive but
mainly to elk and deer.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:36.636
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:38.146
What do you have
that they don't like?

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.236
&gt;&gt; Well, they don't like
this miscanthus grass

00:00:41.946 --> 00:00:44.206
and any of the herbs.

00:00:44.556 --> 00:00:47.056
They generally don't touch the
herbs at all because they're

00:00:47.156 --> 00:00:48.626
so fragrant and strong.

00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:50.226
&gt;&gt; And things that they do love?

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:52.436
&gt;&gt; Come over here, I'll
show you the vegetables.

00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:53.046
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:00.216
It looks like they like beans.

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:01.776
&gt;&gt; They do, Curtis.

00:01:01.876 --> 00:01:03.026
They love beans.

00:01:03.576 --> 00:01:06.586
Some years my beans
cover these teepees,

00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:09.286
but this year I don't
think it will get that way.

00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:12.006
&gt;&gt; I notice you got some
plants inside a fence here.

00:01:12.926 --> 00:01:14.456
&gt;&gt; Yes. These are plants

00:01:14.496 --> 00:01:17.226
that any year the elk
and deer will eat.

00:01:17.726 --> 00:01:22.836
I've got lettuce, my bush
beans, corn, sunflowers --

00:01:22.836 --> 00:01:25.216
they'll eat those anytime.

00:01:25.306 --> 00:01:27.086
&gt;&gt; And so you just start
off with them protected.

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:27.586
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:27.616 --> 00:01:28.766
&gt;&gt; Do you have other
things for us to see?

00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:29.966
&gt;&gt; Yes, come over here.

00:01:37.056 --> 00:01:39.196
It looks like they don't
like to eat tomatoes.

00:01:40.036 --> 00:01:42.466
&gt;&gt; They generally
leave tomatoes alone.

00:01:42.606 --> 00:01:45.536
Sometimes on a dry year
they'll nip a flower,

00:01:45.536 --> 00:01:46.986
but tomatoes are pretty safe.

00:01:47.326 --> 00:01:48.626
&gt;&gt; And the turnips look safe.

00:01:48.946 --> 00:01:50.716
&gt;&gt; Turnips are safe, Curtis,

00:01:50.826 --> 00:01:53.286
but I had beets here
and they're all gone.

00:01:53.286 --> 00:01:53.786
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:01:53.786 --> 00:01:55.426
And the squash looks
pretty safe?

00:01:55.796 --> 00:01:57.486
&gt;&gt; Squash is safe, too, yes.

00:01:57.656 --> 00:01:59.766
&gt;&gt; Okay. I see a tree over
here, let's go look at that.

00:02:00.746 --> 00:02:01.246
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:03.366
&gt;&gt; Now, this is a native tree,

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:05.216
but I see that it's
got some damage on it.

00:02:05.676 --> 00:02:08.606
&gt;&gt; It sure does, Curtis,
years and years of damage.

00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:13.006
And we finally put this
chicken wire up to protect it.

00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:16.376
&gt;&gt; And this is from them
rubbing their antlers on it?

00:02:16.516 --> 00:02:18.446
&gt;&gt; It is. They rub
their velvet off.

00:02:18.446 --> 00:02:19.556
&gt;&gt; You can see the damage here

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:20.716
and up here on the
branches even.

00:02:21.076 --> 00:02:24.876
&gt;&gt; And they even eat these aspen
leaves as high as they can go.

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:28.966
&gt;&gt; Wow. It looks like they're
really not bothering your

00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:29.896
peonies pretty much.

00:02:30.456 --> 00:02:31.076
&gt;&gt; You're right.

00:02:31.076 --> 00:02:32.496
The peonies are safe.

00:02:32.956 --> 00:02:33.866
They're good.

00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:37.596
But this middle shrub, the
rose of Sharon they eat a lot.

00:02:37.766 --> 00:02:39.196
&gt;&gt; Okay. And how about
the lamb's ears here?

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:43.966
&gt;&gt; Well, those little fuzzy
things, they don't touch those.

00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:44.996
They're safe.

00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:48.666
Lady's mantle next
to it is fairly safe.

00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:49.746
That's good.

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:52.756
Your California poppies
they don't eat.

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:55.166
&gt;&gt; Okay. There's quite a
few things they won't eat

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:56.436
but some things they will eat.

00:02:56.436 --> 00:02:56.936
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:56.936 --> 00:02:58.746
&gt;&gt; And we appreciate the
fact that you're going

00:02:58.746 --> 00:02:59.886
to this trouble to find out.

00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:01.596
Now, have you tried
any repellants.

00:03:02.236 --> 00:03:02.966
&gt;&gt; We have.

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:08.416
Over the years we've tried the
usual soap; bags of human hair;

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:12.716
we've ordered ultrasonic
devices; sprays;

00:03:12.836 --> 00:03:17.386
we even ordered mountain
lion urine from a catalogue.

00:03:17.386 --> 00:03:20.026
And unfortunately, none
of it works for us.

00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:21.856
&gt;&gt; The experts say
really the only way

00:03:21.856 --> 00:03:23.026
to do it is to fence them out.

00:03:23.446 --> 00:03:25.526
&gt;&gt; We purchased a
motion detector alarm,

00:03:25.596 --> 00:03:27.886
and that worked for
quite a while.

00:03:28.156 --> 00:03:31.076
But then they got used to it and
all it does is wake us up now.

00:03:31.736 --> 00:03:33.216
&gt;&gt; So fences are the option.

00:03:33.216 --> 00:03:35.316
If you can't have a fence,
you've got to choose the plants

00:03:35.316 --> 00:03:36.286
that they don't like to eat.

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:39.056
Thanks for discovering some
of those plants for us.

00:03:39.056 --> 00:03:39.876
&gt;&gt; Oh, you're welcome, Curtis.
