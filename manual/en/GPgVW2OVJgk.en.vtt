00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.939
it's only been a few short months since
the terrible massacre shooting in aurora

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:10.080
colorado but yeah style lasts are just
this last sunday a part-time student at

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.040
the university of colorado at boulder
decided he thought it would be a good

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.649
idea to go to the movies here

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:19.439
wearing age chauffeur mask annex clown
hat

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.899
needless to say it that sparks terror
and many of the movie theater goers this

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:26.119
article actually says they fled to the
fearing

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.839
fear of their lives and that's
completely understandable considering

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.519
uh... what happened on july twentieth in
aurora colorado at the movie theater

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:34.219
there

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.749
uh... as though i'm sure you guys are
all when james holmes killed twelve

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:42.880
people and wounded fifty eight more
entity and kindly and convicted yet but

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.880
pretty obvious that it was hand

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.220
and according to a lot of authorities he
identified himself

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.520
out with the batman comic book milan

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.800
the joker cell

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.140
uh... cartoon no

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.280
colorado i i i one of faith do you have

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.860
uh... math clients went you're not
allowed to master space in public

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.350
colorado actually does not self

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.360
wasn't necessarily illegal and and
that's

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.540
uh... but he is at this older teen who
is obviously not being named since he's

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.609
a a minor

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:17.099
is charged with five counts of
misdemeanor menacing uh... that wasn't

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:19.210
he in the river misdemeanor menacing

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.220
nanditha

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.159
in this case it seems precision of now
the interesting thing is when he was

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.440
arrested he uh...

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.940
he told the the police in just one is
scarce friends

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.570
scout proceed we do it but then that i
think talked a little bit later he says

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.900
that he planted undressing and sugar
next halloween

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.250
which that's a huge warning sign what
he's saying yes i know it's like totally

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.000
wrong that like identify with joker but
only one of the joker in the future

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.140
and who plans are held in custody of a
year and a half like that

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.369
the ac uh... so he never anybody
nobody's her um... although that is the

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.479
missile movie

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.640
which depending which movie it was done
myself um... but he needs to be gets

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.740
counseling

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.770
gak really and to think people act

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.100
thinking cuz i like any level-headed
individual would know that that's

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.880
completely inappropriate in a terrible
idea and i i do agree with the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.200
evansville indiana convention the
dislike mob yeah absolutely and this

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.310
article also point out to this is not
the first time that somebody had been

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.860
insensitive about this to be even though
it was only a few months ago i a m in

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.530
october broncos cornerback tony carter
joked about this on to attorney said a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.439
adelina a movie in denver ya ll pray for
me

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.379
and and also in october and email user
tried to sell and very realistic james

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.449
holmes halloween mask

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:35.189
for five hundred dollars and i just
can't believe the insensitivity a

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:40.469
communicated unfortunate proper but
frame profit off and just how people

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.099
are just so you think so disconnected in
it

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.859
just taking any opportunity to either
making show or take a chance to scare

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.159
your friends permitted or make a dollar
uh...

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.319
unfortunate what that says about people
in this country

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.430
for that so we use

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.919
no job losses

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:56.900
together

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.409
there's a lot of other buildings in the
missiles down

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.569
uh... tweak in the field with honey and
other movies out there for that's true
