really offsets

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.719

in Syria conflict where

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.400
by a most estimates a hundred thousand
people have already lost their lives

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.580
I depending on whose numbers you use the
French

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.809
or the Americans upwards 1400 people

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.129
perhaps four hundred love them

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.140
or more children killed in a a chemical
attack

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.350
