00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.420
Claudia: Mommy has breast cancer.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.920
You think about a lot of things.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:23.929
I think, mostly for me, I mean, at least give
me a few more years to finish raising my son.

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:32.180
Pat Nemeth, Architect: We asked every subcontractor,
"How many of you had had a family member have

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.400
cancer?"

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.730
And up the hands go.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.170
"Did you feel hopeless about that?"

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.440
And up the hands go.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.340
"Would you like to be part of healing cancer
patients?"

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.510
And up every hand in the room goes.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.260
Claudia: Everyone has cancer.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Like everyone.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.761
I’m going through it physically, but my
mom, my aunts, my cousins, my brothers, they

00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:56.800
all feel my pain.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.400
Pat: This project was thought of through the
eye of a cancer patient.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.920
Claudia: You don’t know if you’re going
to go through another holiday with your families.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.499
You don’t know if you’re going to be there
for your son’s graduation, when he gets

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:10.499
married….

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:14.330
Pat: I want the spaces we build to take the
fear out of healing.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.400
Wow, wow, unbelievable.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.569
Jonathan Clowes, Artist: We would like folks
that are suffering to have some hope, to raise

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:24.619
their spirits.

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.829
Even medically they have found that taking
care of the aesthetic or spiritual side of

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.159
a person is every bit as important as the
physical side of a person.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.179
Pat: I’m absolutely part of the process
of healing.

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:38.610
This is where my heart belongs.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.210
Radiation Technologist: You ready?

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.210
Claudia: Yes.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.689
Today, I’m starting my radiation for six
and a half weeks.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:51.220
I’m not fearful; I know that the treatment
I am getting is going to work.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.470
I feel confident.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.450
Pat: You lie next to a machine that is behind
you, to serve you, not to intimidate you.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.649
If you have a cancerous tumor, these are the
rooms you want to be in.

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.679
Dr. Phillip Zentner: The level of accuracy
on this system is extremely accurate, it’s

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.200
submillimeter accuracy.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.810
We can see at a whole different level exactly
what we’re doing.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.650
Claudia: You have such a storm inside your
mind.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.560
When you walk into a place that was built
for you in mind, I think that’s reassuring.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.980
It’s a healing, from the moment that you
walk in, and you feel that.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.640
You know that you’re in the right place.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.629
Dr. Marilyn Ortuno Norton: If you feel loved,
if you feel comfort, if you feel like there’s

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:45.190
an entire team that’s behind you, that’s
helping you with your new cancer diagnosis,

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.580
that in itself, it’s part of healing.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.159
Claudia: I see the future, it’s not so gray
anymore.

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.390
There’s always hope.
