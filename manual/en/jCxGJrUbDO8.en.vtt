00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.090
Rugby league is a brutal sport.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.700
It's physically and
mentally challenging.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.960
Opponents are trying to
take you out

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.510
of the game, pretty much.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.540
Kill or be killed.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.910
Kill them or you'll get killed.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.650
Scoring a try is one
of the best feelingsâ€”

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.350
hearing the crowd, then
getting up and seeing

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.550
the smiles of joy on
teammates' faces.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.650
It's pretty exciting.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:47.920
The feeling is very pleasing.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.230
My name is William Hopoate.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.840
I'm 19 years old.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.480
I started professional rugby
league when I was 18.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.330
It was one of the proudest
moments and

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.380
achievements in my life.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.990
Since I was five, I dreamed
of playing with the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.480
professional boys.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.670
To get to run out in
front of a crowd

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.370
for the team I supported as
a kid, and my dad

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.050
played for, is
a dream come true.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.630
I've enjoyed every minute of it.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.040
After this season, I decided
to step away from

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.570
rugby league and serve
a two-year mission.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.110
In my church, The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.570
when boys turn 19, they can
serve a mission,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.920
which is a volunteer mission.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.470
You teach people about
Jesus Christ and do

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.600
community service.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.220
To step away from rugby league
will be pretty

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.750
hard, walking away from
money that could help

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.860
support my family.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.960
But I'm still keen and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.600
excited to serve a mission.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.230
Serving has always been
a dream of mine as a kid, so

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.150
I'll be blessed to have
that opportunity.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.690
My parents are loving
and supportive.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.890
I've got younger siblings
that I love.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.070
I've been blessed with
the talent to play rugby league.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.410
I believe all these things are
blessings from God.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.360
If I can serve others to
show my gratitude,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.430
then I will.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.900
I'm a rugby league player.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.540
I'm one of the youngest
on the field, but I'm

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.170
the oldest in my family.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.140
I'm taking a break
from rugby league

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.830
to serve a volunteer mission.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.410
My name is Will Hopoate,
and I'm a Mormon.
