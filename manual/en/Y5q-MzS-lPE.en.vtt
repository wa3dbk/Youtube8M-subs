00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.620
Hello again, everyone!

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.400
Last time,  I set you a challenge--

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.640
a challenge to write a sequence of numbers

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.420
using numbers from 0 to 1,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.000
so that the first two numbers

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.560
occupy different halves,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.200
and the first three numbers

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.900
then occupy different thirds,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.600
and the first four numbers

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.800
occupy different fourths, and so on.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.440
I set it up as a puzzle,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.340
building houses on a strip of land,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.580
so that every time a new person comes along,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.680
you have to re-share the land,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.220
so that everyone gets a plot

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.000
of equal length.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.640
And I asked you, how many houses

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.940
can you build?

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.480
Can you do this indefinitely,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.740
or is there some sort of limit to it?

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.580
Now, if you haven't tried this already,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.600
please do!

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.600
You can do this with a pen and paper,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.240
or if you haven't seen this,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.700
we did make a computer game out of it.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.500
There's a link in the description to this.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.500
So you just sort of point and click

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.760
and build your houses as you go along.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.540
Do try this out now

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.600
if you haven't already,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.060
because I am going to give the solution.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.280
You see,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.240
you can't do this indefinitely.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.200
There is a limit to how many houses you can build.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.900
And that limit

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.500
is 17.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700
Now, that's really odd!

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.280
17 houses!

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.300
So, for a start, it's weird that you can't do it indefinitely.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.300
That's not obvious.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.680
There is a limit.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.140
The limit is 17, though.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.380
Why 17? Why not 18, or something else?

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.660
Now, I am going to show you a solution,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.400
with 17 houses on it,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.580
which I'm going to do later.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.780
But first,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.160
I want to show you a proof--

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.440
a proof that it's not 18 houses.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.080
Now, to do that,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.800
we're going to have to consider

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.320
a number of steps

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.740
with the land split up into different sized plots.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.940
I'm going to start by splitting the land

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.520
into 9 equally-sized plots,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.200
and then I'm going to consider

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.160
the tenths and the elevenths and the twelfths, and so on.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.280
And first, I'm going to consider

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.580
the point that occupies the fifth plot

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.260
after division by 9.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.880
Let's call that 'x.'

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.840
So x is somewhere between 4/9 and 5/9.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.760
But let's say x is equal to 0.46.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.100
But if x is 0.46,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.320
then I know that 0.46 occupies the fifth plot

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.240
after division by 10.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.720
And it also occupies the sixth plot

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.200
after division by 11.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.740
And the sixth plot after division by 12.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.040
That's all automatic.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.720
Now let's consider the point

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.780
that occupies the fourth plot

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.360
after division by 9.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.300
Let's call that 'y,' and we'll try and work out

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.500
the value of y.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.460
Now, y might occupy the fourth or fifth plot

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.940
after division by 10.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.620
But it can't occupy the fifth plot

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.120
because that belongs to x,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.060
So y must occupy the fourth plot.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.280
That means y must be less than 4/10, or 0.4.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.700
Looking at division by 11,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.960
y crosses a border again,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.400
so it might occupy the fourth plot,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.980
or the fifth plot.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.100
If y occupies the fourth plot,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.440
that means the fifth plot is empty.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.660
That's OK. That just means the empty plot

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.020
must be occupied by the 11th point.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.360
But that's a problem when you look at division by 12,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.160
because the eleventh point

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.040
must either share a plot with either x or y,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.720
and that's not allowed.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.860
So y cannot occupy the fourth plot after division by 11.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.000
It must occupy the fifth plot after division by 11.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.080
And that means we've worked out

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
that y must be between

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.580
4/11 and 4/10.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.740
In other words, y is between 0.364 and 0.4.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.880
Now let's add a new point.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.580
We'll call that zed, and that occupies the fourth plot

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.160
after division by 12.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.240
And we're now going to go through the same process

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.460
considering what happens after division by 13, 14 and 15.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.880
And we'll discover that y occupies the sixth plot

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.940
after division by 15, and zed occupies the fifth plot

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.580
after division by 15.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.100
Continuing on again, we now see that y occupies

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.580
the seventh plot after division by 16,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.240
and zed will occupy the fifth plot. But that means the sixth plot is going to be empty.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.500
So that must be filled with the 16th point.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.400
Now consider the next division.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.220
So y would occupy the seventh plot,

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.220
after division by 17,

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.360
and zed will occupy the fifth plot,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.060
and the new point occupies the sixth plot.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.760
But like before, this is a problem,

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.360
this means the 16th point

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.560
will share a plot

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.180
with either zed or y,

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.420
when we divide by 18,

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.420
and that can't happen.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.600
So we've found that we have failed

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.020
at division by 18.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.300
But this was all working perfectly fine

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.300
up to and including division by 17.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.620
This is what happens when I choose x to be 0.46.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.980
But what if I chose a different point?

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.820
Well, the full proof shows

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.180
that you will always get stuck

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.700
for any value of x.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.420
And remember, x was defined to be the point

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.660
in the fifth plot

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.180
after division by 9.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.560
In fact, I chose this value of x because

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.240
we could get as far as division by 17.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.020
Other choices for x

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.140
actually fail a lot sooner.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.200
So the proof shows that it fails at division by 18.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.100
So a sequence of 18 points does not exist.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.080
That's impossible.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.820
But the same method may also be applied to

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.520
construct solutions, including solutions

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.320
up to and including 17 points.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.720
For example, here is one solution where the sixth point

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.120
is 0.46--

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.860
that was x in my proof.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.900
And zed and y are exactly where I predicted they would be.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.680
The thing to remember is

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.200
it's not just the values of the solution that are important,

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.880
but it's the order, as well.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.980
For example, we can't just divide the line into, say, 100 equal parts,

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.980
and then put a point in each part.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.500
No--the first two points have to be in different halves.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.300
The first three points have to be in different thirds, and so on.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.840
And it's this restriction that gives us this limit.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.080
The problem is related to the Farey sequence of order 18.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.820
That's the ordered sequence of all fractions

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.180
with denominators less than, or equal to, 18.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.800
And the problem is actually called

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.160
"The Irregularity of Distributions," or "The 18 Point Problem."

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.020
Now, this proof actually goes back to the 1960's.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.740
It's very functional, though.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.680
It does show that you can't construct

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.060
an 18th point,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.420
and that you can construct a 17th point.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.700
So there are solutions with 17.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.260
But on a deeper level,

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.480
it doesn't really tell you why

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.720
it's that number.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.120
And if you're thinking that,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.000
I agree.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.260
It's really curious;

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.540
it's really odd.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.600
I don't think it's a very well-known fact,

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.740
which is why I wanted to share it with you.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.640
Finally, I just want to give some thanks to Christian Perfect

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.840
for making the game for us to use.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.280
And, well--if you have been,

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.500
thanks for watching!
