00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.939
Flying south to escape cold northern winters
is a luxury for the birds, right?

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:05.790
Not always.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.950
Hey guys, Amy here with DNews, and as you
suffer through the dregs of a ridiculously

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.010
cold winter you’re not alone.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.220
Some species of birds are right there with
you, but without the benefit of indoor heating

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.390
and wool sweaters.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.410
So how exactly do small animals survive harsh
winters?

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.050
Whether or not a given bird species flies
south for the winter depends a lot on what

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.050
its diet is.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.070
If a bird exists largely on flying insects
and nectar it will likely migrate south during

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.780
the cold seasons since these food sources
aren’t exactly plentiful in cold weather.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.800
But if a bird lives off seeds or insects that
live under tree bark, it can usually find

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.700
enough food to spend the winters in the north,
even if the temperatures drop dramatically.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.990
But having food doesn’t equal warmth.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.120
Small animals have a large surface area compared
to their body size.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.030
They also can’t store as much fat so they
have less insulation.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.730
All this means they are more prone to losing
heat once the cold sets in, and surviving

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.280
a cold winter is all about preventing heat
loss.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.829
Biologists at the Norwegian University of
Science and Technology did some research on

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.620
the survival skills of these non-migrating
birds and found some interesting things.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.060
For instance, some species survive by using
the snow to their advantage.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.270
Like the small hazel grouse or hazel hen common
in Northern Europe as well as small rodents

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.950
like voles and field mice.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.630
These small animals burrow into the snow,
digging out little tunnels to sleep in at

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.380
night or rest in during the day.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.490
The snow’s insulting properties mean these
animals can focus on finding food and not

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.939
on surviving cold nights.

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.209
For some species, strength comes in numbers.

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.990
One of Norway’s smallest birds, the Eurasian
wren, spends cold nights huddled together

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.990
under the snow.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.069
They can congregate into groups of as many
as 60 birds, huddling in layers to share and

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:37.689
conserve vital body heat.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.240
But it’s not the case that all species make
their own nests to fight off the cold.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.599
Some species of tits just take over existing
nests, often fighting over the best sleeping

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:45.869
spots at twilight.

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.469
And some birds have a completely different
way of dealing with the cold: they can actually

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.380
slow their metabolism and lower their core
temperature to reduce body heat loss.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.590
Like willow tits.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.259
These tiny birds can reduce their body temperature
from about 105 to 87 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.429
They have a finely tuned internal thermostat
that tells the bird to start shivering when

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.719
its core temperature reaches about 90 degrees.

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.239
Just the act of shivering produces enough
heat to allow the bird to stabilize its core

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.239
temperature.

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.780
Aren’t you glad you don’t have to tough
it out outside all winter?

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.750
But if you ever have spent a recreation night
out in the cold, how did you stay warm?

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.920

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.620
the grid.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:40.709
Like this family in Idaho that packed up their
lives to live in the wilderness.

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.099
So make sure you check that video out, it’s
the first link in the description, and subscribe
