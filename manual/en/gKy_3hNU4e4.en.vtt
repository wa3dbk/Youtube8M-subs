00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:05.120
In this tutorial I'll show you a new feature
in version 5: the Animation Creator.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:12.150
We're going to create an animation of an airplane
with a spinning propeller on it.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.830
The first thing you do in creating an animation
is add subcomponents,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.770
so I click the "Add" button at the top.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.100
This will add a subcomponent.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.700
Then I name the subcomponent "Plane", and
I give that subcomponent a 3D shape.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.230
I've downloaded a 3D shape of a World War
Two airplane from

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.930
Google 3D Warehouse.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.220
Next, I add a second subcomponent, which will
be the propeller.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.400
I then give it the name "Propeller", then
I use the right arrow at the top

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.920
to move it into the plane.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.600
These buttons at the top let you move the
component up or down,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.829
move it into other objects, and so forth.

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.960
I want to move it inside the airplane, so
I use the right arrow.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.329
Next, I give it a 3D shape of a propeller.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.299
I then move the propeller's shape to the end
of the airplane's nose.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.579
Make sure that you position it properly in
all three axes.

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.850
Next, we give the propeller the correct rotation
point.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.850
Right now, the propeller

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.729
rotates around the wrong axis point.

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.380
To fix that, we configure the rotation point

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.590
using the "Midpoint Z" control in the panel
on the left.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.840
You'll notice that the red rotator arrow will
move as I make the change,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.509
indicating the new rotation point.

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.609
I want to move it right into the center of
where that propeller should be rotating.

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:44.159
The last thing we need to do is create a spinning
propeller animation.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.499
This panel in the center is where you add,
remove and configure animations.

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:56.159
The top panel is where you define keyframes
for your current animation.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.329
So I add an animation and give it the name
"SpinPropeller", then I right-click on

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.709
the propeller subcomponent in the top pane
and select "Add Component Keyframe."

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:13.110
I then move the timeline ahead a certain amount
of time and spin the propeller,

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.750
then I right-click in the animation panel
and choose "Add Component Keyframe" again.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.170
At this point I can reset and run the animation
and I should see the propeller spinning.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.020
So that's how you create a basic animation
using the Animation Creator.
