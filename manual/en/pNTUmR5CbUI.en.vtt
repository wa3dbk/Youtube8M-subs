00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.500
We are with Mercedes CLA45 AMG.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.000
It has 2,0 liters turbocharged engine with

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.189
360 HP and 450 Nm of torque.

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:19.000
Which takes it from naught to 100 km/h in
4,6 seconds.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.500
CLA45 AMG as it looks is not much different
from its standard versions.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.000
To begin with to differentiate from outside
you have to look at the bumpers,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
rims and especially brake and calipers.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Inside is also quite similar 
to the standard version.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The specially designed steering wheel of leather and alcantara,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
gear knob and Recaro's sport seats for AMG
makes the interior more sportive.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You shouldn't dabble too much to the car's
design.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
CLA45 AMG is a pleasant car to drive.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
With 2,0 liters engine and 180 HP for each
liter

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
means it is the strongest version in the market.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It conveys it to the driver as soon as you
turn on the ignition.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
How is it done?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
As the engine starts, the exhaust starts to
purr.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And later as you drive you feel as if it has
more than four cylinders

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.500
because of the exhausts sound.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But the real change is felt when you choose
Sport or Manual mode

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that is situated next to the gear console.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The sound of the exhaust really quite differs especially at higher revs.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Let's try it.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
My preference here is Manual rather than Sport.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Because I can change the gears as fast as
I wish with the Manual.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
From now on all you need is an open road

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
to enjoy the ride.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The brakes of CLA45 AMG are as good as its
engine.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.300
They perform very well.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:20.000
Big discs and big calipers play an important
role on the dosage of the brakes.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The steering system is another feature that
deserves tribute.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It has no variable ratio, it's just typical
standard steering.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
But it gives so quick reactions that wherever
you direct its head

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
it goes there very agile.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The sport seats that were developed by Recaro

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
hug the driver like a mother's tender arms.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And at corners however you lean to the side
it still succeeds to hold you properly.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Of course for someone with my body proportions it is very satisfying.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
But I don't think someone heavier or bigger
than me

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
will have the same satisfaction. But now I
really fell at home.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Speed of gear changes is very good.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Only it reacts faster when decreasing.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
When you want to lower the gear it acts instantly.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But when you want to increase it than it reacts a bit late.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Anyway it still is so fast and the sound of
gear change is so satisfying

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
you will not be bothered.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The car almost loses no traction when it transfers the power to the wheels.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Because CLA45 AMG which is known as 4MATIC,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
normally transfers the power to the front
wheels

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
but when there are possibilities of traction
lost

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
than up to 50 percent of it is directed to
the rear axle.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And therefore the car almost sticks to the
floor like a glue

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and proceed without any loss even when we
are driving on a wet surface.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
It is said that everything has a price.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Naturally CLA45 AMG has a price too.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
It's starting price is 255 thousand TL.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
This version that I'm driving with all the
optional extras

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
worth up to 295 thousand TL. Briefly let us
say 300 thousand TL.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
For this price you can buy three A180 and
even start an auto fleet.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
You can think like this or you can say that
you don't look at it this way.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And want definitely a sports car.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
But believe me for 300 thousand TL there are
lots of choices.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.090
If you ask my preference, I have enjoyed driving it

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.870
but my preference will not be this car for
this price.
