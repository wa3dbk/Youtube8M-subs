Hi. This is Yolanda Vanveen from Vanveenbulbs.com.
Next we're going to talk about how to get

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.620
rid of bamboo. We buy bamboo at the garden
center or the farmer's market. It's so beautiful,

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.290
so we plant a big clump of it. Well, twenty
years down the line it's taken over the whole

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.690
front bed, the sidewalk and it's going into
the neighbor's house and they're not happy

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.150
about it. So, what's the best way to actually
get rid of your bamboo? So, bamboo is just

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.740
a grass. So, it grows just like grass does.
It has a root, and it has a stem and then

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.329
it drops seeds as well. So, to get rid of
the bamboo you're going to get rid of every

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.940
single piece of root. There's really no getting
out of it. So, there's a couple of ways to

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.859
accomplish that. You can take your shovel
and dig as deep as you can and dig it out.

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:54.499
That's the more; that's really your only choice
to get rid of all the roots is you just dig

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:59.600
and dig and dig the roots out. Another easy
way to get rid of that bamboo if it becomes

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.970
a problem is to make a raze bed over it. So,
basically there's all kinds of shay cloth

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.860
or vegetation cloth that keeps vegetation
down, so chop all the bamboo down to the ground

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.630
and try to dig some up if you can. Which is
almost impossible to do when it's really,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.860
really thick or an easy trick just put some
whey cloth down and make a barrier whether

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:31.260
it's rocks or wood and fill it with dirt.
That way your bamboo is underneath that cloth.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.200
Eventually it'll try to work its way through
the cloth. It'll try to work its way around

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.030
the cloth. A lot of times put newspapers,
plastic bags, recycling mulch whatever you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:53.430
can put down on it. It should help. Plastic,
weed barrier, mulch, clippings, grass clippings

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.410
and then put a lot of soil, like thick, like
four feet of soil above that. For years and

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.050
years and years you should be able to contain
it. It's a good way to deal with it, because

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.209
basically once it's deep into the ground and
it's taken over you can't really deal with

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.060
those areas for years, because you want to
get those roots so they'll get no sunlight

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.000
for years and years and eventually they will
die out. So, it is man versus bamboo and I

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.120
know you can do. So, go out there and dig
it up. If you still don't want to deal with

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.020
it cover it up. Put your shed on top of it.
Put plastic on top of it. Put the swimming

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.739
pool on top of it. Whatever it takes to get
rid of it you've got to do it.
