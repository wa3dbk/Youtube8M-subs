the general population do not want to
see prices fall anytime

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:14.319
this is because they have already taken
bulging before you getting their house

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.799
all of them are benefited by the rising
house prices

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.699
it is unfair for those people who are
desperate for housing do not have the

quicktax economy realistic goes into a
serious look in the future

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:05.979
many people will still be unable to
afford to buy a house

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.389
if we don't take any effective legends
and policies to solve this problem

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.229
the real housing disaster will be coming
soon

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.339
what should we do to change the
situation

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.989
firstly if there is still so many
residential buildings that astounding

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:23.800
empty while waiting to be sold

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.519
perhaps we could rent out these
buildings

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:30.990
rejecting for more than six months
protect

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.869
at the same time this was cut down the
stress that the realistic

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:39.989
so we keep the high prices substantial
price not alliances

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:41.270
secondly

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.440
we should not be hurts the constant

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.590
mall residential buildings

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.479
because the rate of expansion realestate

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.969
creates many last best and joblessness

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.889
also developed a sign-up continued
matches agricultural opt for the

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.999
building of realistic any longer

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:03.749
we do not want to see that the chinese
property market collapses to leave

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:06.229
people starting tomorrow

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:07.389
after all

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:08.460
no matter whether tax

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.419
cutting market is testing of are
settling down

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:17.059
their victims always ordinary people

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:21.849
we should all band together conference
and actively changed as housing disaster

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:22.409
in china
