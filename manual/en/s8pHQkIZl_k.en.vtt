00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:16.750
Performance Accessories manufactures a Premium
Lift System for the 2015 Toyota Tundra that

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.090
provides five and a half inches of lift.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.079
The idea of raising a vehicle by means of
a body-lift has been around for more than

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.119
30-years and in that time the Body Lift kit
concept has evolved along with the technologies

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.720
of new trucks and SUVs.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.720
As a result Body Lift kits are a great choice
today and in many cases superior to any other

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.140
option.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.690
Since only the body is raised and suspension
components are not modified or replaced, body-lift

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.129
systems will not affect stability control
systems nor alter driveline angles all while

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.519
maintaining your vehicles smooth factory ride.

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:52.519
Premium Lift Systems

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:58.559
Performance Accessories' Premium Lift System
for the 2015 Toyota Tundra utilizes a body-lift,

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.960
(pause) combined with a leveling kit, (pause)
that will allow the use of up to a 35-inch

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.640
diameter tire.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.280
This provides the vehicle with greater ground
clearance and improved off-road capability.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.690
The system includes fiberglass reinforced
nylon body blocks, precision laser cut and

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.330
powder coated bumper relocation brackets,
a CNC machined and zinc plated steering extension,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.170
high-grade hardware, and urethane Gap Guards
that extend the factory inner wheel wells

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.460
to hide any visible gaps between the body
and frame.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.410
The leveling portion of the kit includes strut
extensions that level out the front-to-rear

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.560
ride height, but keeps the Toyota's ball-joint
angles within factory specifications, (pause)

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.280
avoiding any additional wear on these components.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.280
Installation

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.701
With proper vehicle preparation, the installation
of the Premium Lift System for the 2015 Toyota

00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:54.230
Tundra takes approximately ten hours.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.280
The instructions give you details on disassembly,
in preparation for installation of your body

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.280
lift.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.550
This includes disconnecting battery cables,
draining the power steering fluid to allow

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.250
for the addition of hose extensions, removing
splash guards, and detaching retaining clips

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.510
from various body components.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.870
The Toyota's grille, fascia, and bumpers are
removed from the vehicle.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.210
In the engine compartment, the front steering
shaft assembly is disconnected (pause) as

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.989
are several hoses near the air-box.

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.920
Performance Accessories body-blocks are easily
installed over the factory body-mounts by

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.450
removing the bolts and raising the bed and
cab.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.049
On the 2015 Tundra, interior kick panels and
carpet are removed and pulled back to access

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.989
body mount bolts in these areas.

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.510
Depending on the tire size, some trimming
of the frame B-pillar body mount may also

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.739
be required for proper tire clearance.

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.269
When using an eighteen by nine wheel with
a five inch backspace and a thirty four to

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.090
thirty five inch tire size, or equivalent,
some trimming of the frame B-Pillar body mount

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.060
may be required.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.389
Using a cutoff wheel, remove just enough material
from the frame B-Pillar body mount to allow

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.230
the edge of the tire to clear while steering
to full lock.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.480
Be sure to rotate tire fully in both directions
to ensure proper clearance.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.329
The bumper brackets relocate the factory bumpers
to their correct position on the vehicle's

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.980
body, and additional hose extensions are provided
for the fuel filler and power steering.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.530
Performance Accessories' CNC steering extension
is zinc plated to avoid corrosion and assures

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.370
a durable and precise connection.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.430
The leveling portion of the system is installed
by removing the factory strut in one piece

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.200
and installing the extensions over the unit.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.109
Advantages of Premium Lift Systems

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.340
Once the Performance Accessories premium lift
system is installed, the truck owner can enjoy

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.309
greater ground clearance from larger tires,
but also maintain a lower center of gravity

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:01.500
than a suspension kit with a comparable amount
of lift.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.559
Because only the body has been lifted, and
no suspension components were replaced or

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:12.159
modified, the vehicle maintains the factory
smooth ride and new vehicle warranties remain

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.309
unaffected.

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:19.030
Performance Accessories body-lifts, leveling
kits and Premium Lift Systems are available

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.480
for a variety of make and model pickups, SUVs
and Jeeps.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.910
