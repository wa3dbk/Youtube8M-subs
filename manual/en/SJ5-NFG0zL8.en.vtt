Hi, Allen Brouwer with www.LifesBetterBoating.com,
I was able to step aboard the brand new 2013

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.969
Viking 52 foot convertible.

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.520
I was moving a boat from central Jersey down
to Cape May in order to do a swap from another

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.880
boat that was coming up from Baltimore.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.160
We met in Cape May and where we met, was Canyon
Club.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.660
When I pulled into Canyon Club I saw this
beautiful Sport Fish with a Yellow Hull, and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.050
I knew exactly what boat it was.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.410
It was Vikings New 52 Foot Sport Fish, Hull
Number One.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.380
I know this boat specifically because it is
the wallpaper on the desktop computer that

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.710
is in my office.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:59.310
So I told my crew member that I was with "you
have to give me 15 minutes", he goes "why?

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.380
do you have to use the bathroom, wanna grab
a cup of coffee?".

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.220
I tell him "you see that yellow hull over
there?

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.270
I'm jumping on that boat"
I walk on over, I meet the first mate, his

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.440
name is Thomas, Super friendly guy.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.930
Gave me a tour of the boat, and all I have
to say is, it's immaculate.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.330
The setup is phenomenal, construction is superb.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:39.110
And I'm a little bias, because in the production
boat world, I consider Viking to be a step

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:47.990
down 
from GOD.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:56.659
Viking just splashed the new 52, hull number
2- with a beautiful blue hull.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.670
I hope to get on that and do a full feature
for you all of you soon.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.450
I'm Allen Brouwer with www.LifesBetterBoating.com
I hope you enjoyed our presentation on Viking's

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.969
new 52 Sedan.
