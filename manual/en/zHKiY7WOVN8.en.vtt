00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.820
DADDY BRAD: Gas prices have you thinking about
a staycation this summer?

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.890
DADDY CLAY: With a little short-range planning,
it’s still very possible to have a memorable

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.890
retro-road trip with the family.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.790
DADDY BRAD: That’s why this week we are
coming to you from the world famous Snake

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.079
Farm in New Branfels, Texas.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.230
DADDY CLAY: This special episode is brought
to by Graco’s Ready for the Road Ahead.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:51.530
DADDY BRAD: Retro-Road trips rule!

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.149
DADDY CLAY: You know, sometimes, as parents,
I think we get trapped into thinking that

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.930
only Disney-level entertainment is family
friendly and nothing less that a waterpark

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.640
is a reasonable destination. That it isn’t
family fun unless a character breakfast is

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.640
involved.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.610
DADDY BRAD: More modest destinations near
you may be just as rewarding to you as a family.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.509
And a lot easier on the wallet, not to mention
your carbon footprint.

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.900
DADDY CLAY: Our first road trip suggestion
is the one tank rule.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.610
DADDY BRAD: Pick an itinerary that doesn’t
require you to drive farther than you can

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:28.659
get on one tank of gas. Our minivans get about
300 miles on a tank, that gives us a radius

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.869
of about 150 miles from Austin.

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.159
DADDY CLAY: This keeps you from over-driving,
and over-scheduling. We think that for a two

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.681
day, one night trip, you should have just
about 2-3 attractions total for the whole

00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:43.539
trip. But how to find cool, off the beaten
path attractions near you? We asked travel

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.090
author and columnist Gerald McLeod.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.960
DADDY BRAD: Go retro. Think of something offbeat,
funky, maybe even a little sketchy.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.670
DADDY CLAY: It’s good for kids to get a
little of the authentic, kitchy, hilarious,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.020
even odd in their lives.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.640
DADDY BRAD This does not apply to the hotel,
however.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.780
DADDY CLAY: Although an overnight stay is
huge. All you need is a pool.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.490
DADDY BRAD: But how are you going to get there?

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.750
DADDY CLAY: Did you know that you can rent
a GPS system for a weekend? As anyone here

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.490
at DadLabs will tell you, I get lost a lot.
Couldn’t find my butt if it had a bell on

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.951
it. And I get stressed when I get lost, and
if my family is with me, they get stressed.

00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:31.140
I finally got tired of my son asking me if
I know where I’m going, so I sprung for

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.280
the GPS. Maybe you’ve got a better set of
direction, you don’t need one every day,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:51.980
but for a road trip, these things can really
cut down on stress. Go to GPS for rent dot

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.160
com, you can get one of these for about 6
bucks a day. The kids love to participate,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.280
to follow the progress on the map -- might
even be educational. One note: if you are

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.180
planning a Saturday departure, you should
have your order in by the previous Monday.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.020
When you’re done, slap a return label on
there and ship it back.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.920
DADDY BRAD: Get out early on the first day,
get to the Snake Farm right when it opens,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.070
then find a spot for a picnic lunch. Saves
on a little cash and keeps with your retro

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:26.440
theme. Pack the lunch, Dad! Here’s a great
way to go -- mini sandwiches. Get a baguette,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:36.640
sliced, some turkey, ham and cheese cut to
size and let the kids make their own. And

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:45.510
what’s more summer than watermelon? Don’t
want to haul this big boy around? How about

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:55.830
this seedless mini-melons? Throw in some frozen
yogurts and juice bags and you don’t even

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.020
need ice. Perfect post Snake Farm snack.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.460
DADDY CLAY: If want more tips and safety suggestions,
please visit the Ready for the Road Ahead

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.460

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.760
