Hi so we're here with David Gandy, Hello David.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.050
Afternoon.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.050
Afternoon, afternoon.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.599
We're here at V Fest and we're at the Wheyhey
stand which is protein ice cream so you can

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.410
get fit and build muscle while you eat ice
cream which is great, how do you feel about

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.410
that?

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.840
It's an amazing concept, it's almost like
a revolutionary idea.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.730
The guys Greg and Damien sort of approached
me a while ago and obviously I'm quite fitness

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.620
aware and very into my nutrition and when
they told me about the ice cream I really

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.271
thought too good to be true because there's
no sugar, no saturated fat, 20 grams of whey

00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:49.530
protein and then it tasted amazing, so I was
like no there has got to be something to it.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.239
Went through all the facts with the guys and
it's just a great product and now I'm on the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.129
board for the company and ambassador for it.

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.640
I get asked a million times about, I've spoken
at Vogue and Oxford and everything about health

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.960
and body image and everything else and it's
revolutionary ideas like this that sort of

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.030
can help people, because unfortunately now
we live in the most obese country in Europe,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.990
so it's sort of ideas like this - it's great
for children and it's great for everyone.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.060
Perfect so I love ice cream, I don't like
milkshakes.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.240
Who doesn't like ice cream?

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.450
Don't trust people who don't like ice cream.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.450
Exactly.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.000
I know that at the minute there's strawberry,
vanilla and chocolate so if you had to pick

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.630
out of those three which would be your favourite?

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.119
I'm chocolate all the way.

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.930
Chocolate, we like a bit of chocolate, alright!

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.040
Brilliant, well thank you so much - will you
be here for the whole weekend?

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.210
I'll be with my little nephew tomorrow so
he's coming to V Festival with me.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.270
Brilliant, give him lots of Wheyhey ice cream.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.630
That's exactly it.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.020
Thank you so much, lovely to meet you.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.090
Take care, enjoy your weekend.
