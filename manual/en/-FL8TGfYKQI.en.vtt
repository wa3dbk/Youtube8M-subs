Pruning grape vines for growing on a pergola

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.020
Growing this plant is not as difficult as it seems,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.000
but sit in the shade and taste fruit - priceless ...

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.660
Correct cutting of the vine is a matter of skill and certain knowledge.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.400
We will not deal with vine cutting for crop cultivation. This is what specialists are dealing with.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:44.580
Shrubs that we have in home gardens, in addition to the release of tasty fruit have additional tasks - look good and usually bring some shade under the pergola.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:58.360
We will take up with the bush today, supported by temporary trellises. Ultimately, it will support on a pergola, which, together with the bush, should give respite and shadow to resting household members.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:08.360
Cutting such a bush can not be as drastic as in the case of growing in vineyards, but we must take into account several important principles:

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:26.000
- aboveground part of the bush can not be excessively expanded because the nutrients taken up by the roots will be used mainly for the development of leaves and veins, and we will not get any nice and tasty fruit;

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:37.680
- some grape varieties are quite susceptible to fungal diseases, and excessive thickening of the bush and lack of ventilation serve to develop pathogens,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:51.340
- grapes ripen in the sun, that is why it is important to choose the right position for the bush and cut, also during the growing season, to brighten the grapes.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:07.340
In addition, vine bushes came to us from the warmer regions of the globe, so they are not completely resistant to severe frosts, and some varieties, especially young specimens, should be covered for the winter.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:21.860
During the search of the literature on the subject of vines we will come across some recurring terms, which we basically do not know from growing other plants.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:32.560
The shoot - is a new, green growth with leaves, tendrils, flower clusters, developing from z bud of cane.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:43.040
The cane - a mature shoot after leaf fall. There are buds on it, from which grow shoots in the next year.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:03:01.580
Suckers are additional shoots grown from the buds at the corners of the petioles during the growing season. They cause unnecessary and unfavorable thickening of the bush and should be broken.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:18.700
Cutting consists in shortening the cane on 3 to 8 buds. Some cut even for 1 bud, but in the case of house cultivation, especially when we carry grapevine with pergolas, there is no need.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:28.220
I cut my bush for 3-4 buds depending on the place and if I want to make it more or less thick.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:54.700
One more important information. The grapevine is cut into the first half of March. At a later date, we expose our shrub to "crying cane," meaning a prolonged and intense leakage of juices from wounds.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.040
Good luck!
