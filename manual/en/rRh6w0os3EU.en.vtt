BEN ANDERSON: Hi. I'm Ben Anderson with Expert
Village, and I'm here today to talk to you

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.721
about playing chords on a keyboard. A lot
of people have the misconception that a lot

00:00:08.721 --> 00:00:14.170
of keyboardists will play a style that was
really popular in the '70s with a Hammond

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.330
B-3 organ where a lot of players would do
a lot of quick fingering on the keyboard and

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:26.829
will play fast trills or fast-moving notes,
they would solo a lot, and not all keyboardists

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:32.520
have to do that. In fact, when I play keyboard
most of the time, I sit and I play chords.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.430
What most people think of when they hear about
keyboards especially from back in the day,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:57.190
they hear more melodic-sounding stuff that
would sound something like this.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.710
That's more of a lead sound and you could
use that if you are going to be soloing but

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.180
a lot of times, keyboardists really don't
do that. And so, what I do is I will play

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.360
a lot of chords and that comes from years
and years of practicing piano and keyboards

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:51.659
but there are many different chords that you
can use.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.799
So, it's important to decide what needs to
fit into your piece, what needs to fit into

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.659
your song, what are the instruments are going
along in your song, "How will that affect

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.189
what I am playing?" It's important using chords
especially since the role of a keyboard in

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.470
contemporary music is mostly to help support....
