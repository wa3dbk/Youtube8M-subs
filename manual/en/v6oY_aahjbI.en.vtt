00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:03.676
(bright pop melody)

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:07.682
- [Voiceover] Hi, everyone. It's me, Ann.

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:09.430
And today is DIY day.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.477
We will be making colorful
bow rings and bracelet charms.

00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:15.108
These are perfect for
Spring and Summer time.

00:00:15.108 --> 00:00:17.567
They're just so colorful
and fun to look at.

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:19.896
And as a bonus, I will also show you

00:00:19.896 --> 00:00:22.111
how to make a mustache pendant.

00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:24.945
I had so much fun making
these bow rings and mustache.

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:27.109
They all turn out so cute and pretty.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.204
So, let's not waste any time
and get into this, shall we?

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:33.528
(bright pop melody)

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.044
Okay, so let's start with materials.

00:00:37.044 --> 00:00:39.665
All you will need are so
polymer oven baked clay,

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:41.880
nail polish for coloring.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.094
You know, if you want
to change up the colors

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:47.416
and add more variety, then
this is a great way to do so.

00:00:47.416 --> 00:00:49.126
And a gloss coating.

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:51.461
This will protect your clay

00:00:51.461 --> 00:00:53.766
and also gives it a nice glossy finish,

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:57.433
which makes the color a lot
more vibrant and stand out more.

00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:59.607
For tools, you will need a knife.

00:00:59.607 --> 00:01:01.232
Plastic knife will do.

00:01:01.232 --> 00:01:04.107
And something to roll and
flatten the clay with.

00:01:04.107 --> 00:01:07.327
Here I have some ring base
that I bought from etsy.com

00:01:07.327 --> 00:01:09.573
and I will include the link
on the bottom of this video.

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:12.982
Okay, so let's get started, shall we?

00:01:13.778 --> 00:01:16.044
The clay usually comes in bars like this.

00:01:16.044 --> 00:01:19.711
To make this, I only need
like about 1/3 of the bar.

00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:21.834
Cut off a third with the knife

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:24.293
and then soften if by
kneading it with your fingers.

00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:28.718
Next, roll it into a ball
like how I'm doing right here.

00:01:28.718 --> 00:01:30.845
And then, roll it down
into a barrel shape.

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:35.437
Make it wide as your three
fingers together, combined.

00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:37.682
Then, narrow the ends a little bit,

00:01:37.682 --> 00:01:39.695
just like how I'm doing here.

00:01:39.695 --> 00:01:41.562
Once you have your shape, roll it flat

00:01:41.562 --> 00:01:45.697
and then evenly as you
can to form a oval ribbon,

00:01:45.697 --> 00:01:47.590
just like this right here.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.905
Try not to make it too thin.

00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:52.160
Otherwise, it will not
maintain shape easily.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.735
And if you make it too thick,

00:01:53.735 --> 00:01:56.244
then it just be, you know, too chunky.

00:01:57.934 --> 00:01:59.416
You just want to make it flat enough

00:01:59.416 --> 00:02:01.295
to mold it into a shape.

00:02:02.305 --> 00:02:05.338
Now that you have this flat,
long oval as the ribbon,

00:02:05.338 --> 00:02:08.426
fold in the sides, just
like how I'm doing it here.

00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:14.928
Okay, so now we need to cinch
in the center of this ribbon.

00:02:14.928 --> 00:02:16.726
The next thing you are going to need to do

00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:20.637
is take something that's flat and small,

00:02:20.637 --> 00:02:22.984
so that way you can
push the center inward.

00:02:22.984 --> 00:02:25.663
And then, pinch the top
and the bottom together.

00:02:26.343 --> 00:02:28.690
(light melody)

00:02:29.613 --> 00:02:31.611
Okay, so now it's time
to make another ribbon.

00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:32.951
What you're going to do

00:02:32.951 --> 00:02:35.623
is cut out 1/8 of the clay bar again.

00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:38.488
Knead it and then roll it into a bowl,

00:02:38.488 --> 00:02:40.332
and then a long barrel.

00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:42.835
Once you have your long barrel,

00:02:42.835 --> 00:02:45.253
go ahead and flatten it out to your desire

00:02:45.253 --> 00:02:48.585
with something that's wide enough

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:50.505
to cover the center of your bow.

00:02:50.505 --> 00:02:52.303
And then, you're going to take that

00:02:52.303 --> 00:02:55.885
and then wrap it at the
center of your ribbon bow.

00:02:56.722 --> 00:02:58.063
And once you're happy with that,

00:02:58.063 --> 00:03:00.857
go ahead and snip off the extra remaining.

00:03:00.857 --> 00:03:03.807
So, that is basically
how you make your bow.

00:03:03.807 --> 00:03:06.150
And I would suggest to
make as many as you like

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.775
before baking them.

00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:10.814
Okay, so for the mustache pendant,

00:03:10.814 --> 00:03:13.159
what you're going to do is
go ahead and prep the clay

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.201
the same way you did with the bow.

00:03:15.201 --> 00:03:18.828
Just create a flat
surface big enough for you

00:03:18.828 --> 00:03:22.667
to place the mustache
picture and template on.

00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:24.589
And we will get to that in a bit.

00:03:25.294 --> 00:03:27.549
So, once you have the
flat surface laid out,

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.216
print out a mustache drawing
or you could draw it yourself.

00:03:31.216 --> 00:03:34.419
If you want this template,
I will put this on my blog.

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.888
LifeAnnStyle.com,

00:03:36.888 --> 00:03:39.261
so that way you can print it out.

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:42.767
What I'm basically doing here
is cutting out my template,

00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:45.689
so that way I can lay
it on top of my clay.

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.655
Once that's cut out, I'm
gonna lay it on my clay.

00:03:49.655 --> 00:03:52.946
And then, take a knife and
cut around the template.

00:03:55.756 --> 00:03:57.405
After you're done cutting,

00:03:57.405 --> 00:04:00.371
I suggest you soften around
the shape with your fingers.

00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:04.252
If you want to make this
into a necklace pendant

00:04:04.252 --> 00:04:08.001
or something else, then make
sure that you add in your holes

00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:10.089
before you bake these.

00:04:10.754 --> 00:04:13.425
Now, it's time to bake
these wonderful creations.

00:04:13.425 --> 00:04:15.132
Make sure to follow the instruction

00:04:15.132 --> 00:04:17.306
on the packaging of your clay.

00:04:17.306 --> 00:04:21.597
Mine is to preheat the
oven to 275 Farenheit.

00:04:21.597 --> 00:04:24.143
And then, bake them for 15 minutes.

00:04:25.975 --> 00:04:27.357
After they are done baking,

00:04:27.357 --> 00:04:28.901
let them cool at room temperature.

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:30.404
And then after that, you can have fun

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:32.515
and decorate them however way you like.

00:04:33.475 --> 00:04:36.022
I like to decorate this with
little embellished pearls.

00:04:36.022 --> 00:04:38.663
You could totally do
this with rhinestones.

00:04:38.663 --> 00:04:40.701
It would look really cute, as well.

00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:43.113
You can also use your old nail polishes

00:04:43.113 --> 00:04:44.444
to give this some color.

00:04:44.444 --> 00:04:48.625
Or paint some glitter over
this to give it some sparkles.

00:04:51.677 --> 00:04:53.660
If you want to keep the color of the clay,

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.136
then go ahead and cover
this with some gloss.

00:04:56.136 --> 00:04:58.174
It will look just as pretty.

00:04:58.513 --> 00:04:59.804
Lastly, with some hot glue,

00:04:59.804 --> 00:05:03.599
I'm going to glue the bows
onto my ring base right here.

00:05:05.604 --> 00:05:06.926
For the mustache pendant,

00:05:06.926 --> 00:05:08.896
all I have to do is take some jump rings

00:05:08.896 --> 00:05:11.696
and loop it into the
holes that I made earlier.

00:05:11.943 --> 00:05:16.531
Then, I'm just going to
loop it into a necklace.

00:05:17.063 --> 00:05:18.606
And that's pretty much it.

00:05:19.105 --> 00:05:20.497
Thank you guys so much for watching.

00:05:20.497 --> 00:05:23.650

00:05:32.383 --> 00:05:34.837
