Hello, Fellow Filmigos it's me Paulie Popcorn
and this is Carmella DiCorno

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.950
and we got David the Movie Blogger
David, say hello

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.690
David: "Lo!"

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.419
As you can see he's not only the world's worst
movie blogger, he's also world's worst Thor

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:18.419
impersonator

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:19.419
Yikes!

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.259
Aw come one, why do you have to hurt my feelings
for?

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:22.259
Yeah

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.259
Well, as you can see we're here celebrating
Avengers: Age of Ultron

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.079
sorry for our review being a little late
we had a few snafus this week

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:36.039
that's ok, we going to jump right into it
David why don't you go ahead and kick it off

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.590
Sounds good to me let's do this, Paulie

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.260
I loved it
Theater Theater Theater!

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.379
The action in this movie was just like reading
a comic book

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.019
There's a couple of action sequences where
it's just like

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.899
splash page come to life
James Spader as Ultron

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.010
Nailed it!

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.870
James Spader brings the right amount of sinisterism,
evilness, and humor

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.600
that makes you absolutely love to hate Ultron
And that's what we want.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.679
We want to love to hate villains
Unlike that stupid one in Thor 2

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:04.850
It was horrible.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.850
What was that guys name?

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.450
Anyways, number 3 SPOILER ALERT
So if you want to skip ahead and not hear

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.170
this part
just fast forward a couple of seconds

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.140
The Vision, it's was perfect the way the introduced
him

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.170
and I can't wait to see more of him
So there you have it folks

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.610
Theater Theater Theater!

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.159

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.070
That's it Paulie, Today I seek my revenge!

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.070
Ohh!

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.159
That's not a smart move on your part buddy!

00:01:50.159 --> 00:02:25.620
Carmella you know what to do!

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:34.130
