Drugs have no economic boundaries.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.900
They have no religious boundaries, they have
no geographical boundaries.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.770
And it really affects all youth across the board.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.800
I’m John Redman, I’m the Executive Director of
Californians for Drug Free-Youth

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.000
and my organisation and the HIDTA –
High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas –

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.070
work with organizations and institutions and
schools down in Mexico.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.370
And we found that there was a horrendous
problem with youth where kids were

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.070
ending their education early, dropping out.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.900
And they weren’t going into gangs anymore,

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.630
they weren’t even going into drug trafficking
organizations.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.230
They were going straight to drug cartels and
starting to work for them –

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.230
kind of ending their youth, ending their
education, ending their childhood.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.470
been working with Drug-Free World for, I would
say, about 7 years.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.070
So when I talked to one of
the people there I said,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.100
“We have this opportunity to educate 100,000 youth
in terms of substance abuse problems.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.270
Do you think we can do that?” And the response
was, “We have to.”

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.070
So to Drug-Free World it wasn’t whether
we can or not, we must.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.370
I’ve worked on a number of educational
programs on substance abuse over the years.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.070
I haven’t seen anything that is as
comprehensive,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.200
but maybe more importantly that is geared
towards youth.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.970
The curriculum for Truth About Drugs,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.400
it presents it in a very visual way that captures
the youth’s attention.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.300
It started out in one school district and then
started to grow and grow and grow.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.400
And then we had, very quickly,
within 6 months practically,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.070
every school district in Baja California that
wanted to be involved.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.230
It’s not only taught to the kids but the teachers
that have been taught how to teach the kids.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.400
And they have a connection to the parents
within the community

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.270
and other members of the community.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.200
We really have that mission of drug-free youth,
safe and drug-free communities

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.100
That’s our mission. That’s our goal.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.670
And it falls right in line with the Foundation for a
Drug-Free World.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.300
To Scientology, it’s drug-free world,
not drug-almost-free world.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.330
And it’s that vision,
that high level of attainment

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.730
that is so important to me and
so important to the world.
