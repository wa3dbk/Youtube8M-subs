00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.480
So today we're going to try and
do some laser diffraction,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.630
hopefully with a view,
ultimately, to creating the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.239
famous cross-shaped diffraction
pattern from the

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.150
helix that Watson and Crick
observed when they were doing

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.570
their X-ray diffraction
of DNA.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.640
First mistake of the film, it
wasn't, of course, Crick and

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.000
Watson who did the X-ray
diffraction work on DNA.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.900
It was...

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.735
Rosalind Franklin!

00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:32.380
So first I need to go and get
the laser, obviously.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.205
I thought I had one in here,
but it turns out I don't.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.390
I have no idea when this might
have last been used.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.752
So there's definitely something
going on there when

00:00:59.752 --> 00:01:01.715
I pull the wire into the beam.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.370
OK, so this looks a bit more
convincing, if you like.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.900
We've got something interesting
happening.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.960
Pretty definitely a diffraction

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.900
pattern going on there.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.670
We've got some nice, dark
fringes and light fringes.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.620
A bit of a mess in the middle,
but it's spreading all

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.160
the way over here.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.670
There is definitely something
going on.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.550
So what's happening is that the
laser beam is effectively

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.000
being cut into two
by the wire.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.460
The wire is narrower than the
beams, so the beam is passing

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.710
around both sides.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.520
And you can see all the
nice little, the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.380
nice pattern of, er...

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.100
The waves add up and
you get a bright...

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.620
So anyway, they get
to the screen.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.350
And because they both traveled,
erm, not the same

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.120
amount of, not the
same distance...

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.310
Anyway.

00:02:15.142 --> 00:02:18.150
Don't know what you just did,
but it was good, yeah.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.520
OK, so don't mind this little
light exclusion apparatus we

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.870
just had to set up here.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.034
We can't really block out the
lights in the Prep Room at the

00:02:28.034 --> 00:02:29.950
moment so we're having
to improvise.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.790
But you can see so much more
structure now, obviously,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.040
because of the slightly crazy
assortment of wires

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.130
that we've set up.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.100
But we've got diffraction going
off all over the place.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.430
And if you really look into the
structure of the pattern,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.030
you can see this really fine
structure throughout the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.380
two-dimensional field.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.560
But you can imagine, that if
we went through the whole

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.000
process backwards, you could
work out from this pattern

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.010
where all those wires are.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.700
Because if you move any one
of those wires then the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.690
diffraction pattern is
going to change.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.710
So if you could do the math,
then you could work out

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.420
exactly where all those wires
are from this pattern.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.100
Imagine then doing that, not
with laser light, but with

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.180
X-rays, and, instead, not with
wires but with atoms. And that

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.130
is the basis of X-ray
crystallography.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.290
Another day, another
diffraction target.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.870
I'm going to remove the glass
as carefully as I can.

00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:31.040
That will probably do.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.030
So I think we've got, well
we've got a diffraction

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.530
pattern there.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.100
It's a very, sort of, flat
cross but the axis of the

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.990
cross are very close together.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.130
But I think that's what you'd
expect from a coil like this

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.750
because it's a very
tight coil.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.350
If you remember the diffraction
pattern we got

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.480
from the vertical wires were
spread out into this

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.579
horizontal pattern.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.529
Basically we've got that
happening from the coil from

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.660
two different, but not quite
perfectly aligned, sets of the

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.380
vertical wires.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.250
We've got these, sort of, line
on the near side of the coil,

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.770
sort of, all lined
up together.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.230
And then on the far side of the
coil we've got the same

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.450
thing but shifted very slightly
as the coil, sort of,

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.040
winds itself around.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.250
So I think this is what I would
have expected to happen.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.080
And if we, using my surgical
tweezers, if we just sort of

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.710
tease the filament out a bit.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.600
Hopefully as we extend the coil
and we accentuate the

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.180
difference between the, sort
of, front and back of the

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.460
coil, we should see the
cross open out a bit.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.540
And yeah, it's kind
of doing that.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.630
Probably only so far I can pull
this before it breaks.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.130
But, yeah, that's quite nice.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.970
So we've got this really lovely
diffraction pattern

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.130
just from our light bulb
filament over there.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.350
And this is very characteristic
of the

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.550
diffraction you get from
a helix or a coil or

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.310
something like that.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.510
And it's what Rosalind Franklin
saw when she was

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.310
doing her X-ray diffraction
of DNA.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.330
And it really influenced Crick
and Watson in determining the

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.880
structure and finding
this famous double

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.580
helix that is DNA.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.320
And we've produced something
pretty similar here with a

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.250
light bulb and a laser pen.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.590
And I think it's pretty good.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.840
I'm quite pleased with it.
