00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.600
Hey - now that you've registered for SOAR,
remember this 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.799
important information about orientation.

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:07.709
Number one - packing.

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:11.699
SOAR is a two-day program so make sure you
bring just enough clothing for those two days.

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.129
You may also want to check the weather in
Greensboro before packing to make sure you

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:16.059
have appropriate clothing.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.819
You need to bring toiletries, such as towels,
washclothes, and any other personal items and medications.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.999
 In addition, bring your own
linens for a full-sized bed. Keep in mind

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:28.169
that some students may be housed in rooms
with twin-sized beds.

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.960
Students, pack separately from your guests,
parents, or family members as you will all

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.940
be staying in separate residence halls. Watch
the housing video on our SOAR web page to

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.770
learn more details about your overnight stay
at SOAR.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.230
Number two - parking.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.970
Now that your SOAR session date has arrived,
it's time to come to campus. Please be sure

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.980
to arrive on campus by 8 am. Free parking
will be provided in Walker Avenue Parking Deck,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.650
located directly across the front entrance
of the Elliott University Center (or the EUC).

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.400
Number three - check in.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.870
Once you've parked and unloaded your luggage,
make your way to the Quad residence halls.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.309
During this time students, guests, and family
members will receive their SOAR materials.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.380
These materials include a name tag, (which
needs to be worn throughout the program),

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.740
a resource guide with lots of information
about campus resources, and a schedule of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.460
all the sessions and their locations for the
next two days. 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.740
Conveniently, the schedule is currently available on our SOAR web page.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.960
Number four - At SOAR.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.420
At SOAR, there will be information sessions
and fun activities for students, guests, and

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.079
family members to attend. Some students may
need to take the foreign language placement exam. 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.959
We've provided a link with more information
concerning who needs to take this exam. 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.100
Students will also be able to take a photo and receive their Spartan Card, which is their university ID card.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.180
Throughout SOAR, students will be
divided into groups led by Spartan orientation leaders.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.999
These student leaders will be around
to assist everyone during the two-day program.

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:53.799
On day two, after you check out of your residence
hall, you do have the option of attending breakfast in 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.400
Moran Commons. Later on, students will meet with an academic advisor to register for classes.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.420
Watch the academic advising video
on our SOAR web page to learn more details

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.119
about academic advising and registration.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.289
Number 5 - Questions

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.400
Save these numbers in your phone. This is
the YFY texting service. Text us about any

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.150
UNCG-related questions that you have, and
someone will get back to you as soon as possible

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.280
during UNCG business hours. You can also follow
us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Vine

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.319
to stay up-to-date.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.970
Remember, this is a two-day program FULL of
information. This may seem overwhelming at

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.090
times, but it gives you the opportunity to
meet with your fellow Spartans, interact with

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.010
student leaders, and other members of the
UNCG community.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.670
We look forward to seeing you at SOAR. 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.120
GO SPARTANS!
