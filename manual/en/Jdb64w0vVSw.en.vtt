Okay, I'm here today to talk about Canon's
XH A1 high definition camcorder. This is my

00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:14.281
personal camera, right here, and it's just
a fantastic camera. In my opinion, some of

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:19.310
the best high definition you can get for the
price. Right now, this range anywhere from

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.349
three to four thousand dollars, depending
on where you buy it. This may seem a little

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.730
bit pricey, but you're basically getting the
high definition capabilities of much more

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.650
expensive cameras, and an incredibly affordable
high def camera. Do your research, of course.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.310
I did mine before I bought this camera, and
almost every review I read is giving it 4.5

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:52.140
out of 5 stars, just fantastic reviews, a
lot of Editor's choices as well. First off,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.920
what comes in the box with your XH A1; of
course the camera, but you also have your

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.210
lens hood up here. This helps to protect against
direct sunlight getting into the lens. A lens

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.530
cap, which you probably can't see. It's very
important to always keep your lens cap on

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.970
to protect your lens. The camera comes with
an SD memory card because you can actually

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.620
take pictures. These are pretty standard with
digital cameras. The other stuff that you've

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:32.159
got; a small battery; a lithium ion battery
pack. You have a battery charger right here.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.480
Along with the battery charger is the plug
for it to plug it into the wall. It just connects

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.620
right there, and an AC adapter for the XH
A1. This connects the battery charger, and

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.600
can actually power the camera so you can plug
your camera into the wall. It comes with a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.650
remote control, as well as two double A batteries,
and for connecting to a television, it comes

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:05.180
with some standard RCA cables for standard
definition. It also comes with some component

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:13.779
cables so you can watch the 1080I high definition
video you recorded on your high def TV in

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:20.340
true high def. So, definitely use the component
cables if you have a high definition TV to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.170
watch back on. It comes with a shoulder strap,
which I choose not to use, and that's about

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.749
it. Let's start learning about this XH A1.
I'm going to take you through all of the basics

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:33.339
of using it.
