Today on Drinks With Diablo, we're doing a drink

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
called the Bottle Cap.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
TheFNDC.com presents "Drinks With Diablo":

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The Bottle Cap.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.500
Welcome back to Drinks With Diablo.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.850
This is your host, Jöhnny Dîablø,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.850
and we're doing the Bottle Cap.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.850
Now this is a drink that I have seen people search for 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.000
on the website, so we've decided to do it.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.850
Now what you're going to need: root beer schnapps,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.850
Chambord, fresh squeezed lime juice, 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.600
and 7-up.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.600
Now basically, this is a bomb shot.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.200
You're going to take two ounces of 7-up,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.500
 &amp; two ounces of fresh squeezed lime juice.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.200
So you throw into that mixture

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.200
a half-ounce of Chambord, 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.200
OR if you can find it, 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.200
Sour Puss raspberry schnapps,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200
which I couldn't find anywhere

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.200
( so we're just using Chambord ).

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.200
And one half-ounce of root beer schnapps.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.200
Let's see how this tastes.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.200
Hmm.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.200
Wow.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.500
I know what this is supposed to taste like.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.500
This is supposed to taste like those Willie Wonka candies,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.500
the Bottle Caps.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.800
And guess what?

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.200
It tastes exactly like that!

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.200
There you go, the Bottle Cap.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.200

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.900

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.450

&gt;&gt; Inferno: What do you got there?

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.700
Whippy-whip?

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.960
You're going to get me in trouble for the whippy whip.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.700
You're bad, John.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.600
&gt;&gt;  Dîablø: I am.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.000
Do it again?
