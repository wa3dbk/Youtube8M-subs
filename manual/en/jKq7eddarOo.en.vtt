00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.680
*Blimey Cow Theme Music*

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.680
Twas the night before Monday, and Jordan got worried

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.700
Because all of his family had suddenly scurried.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.340
They left on vacation and forgot him somehow!

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.440
And he realized he was alone, making "Blimey Cow".

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.180
"Oh, no!" He shrieked, his eyebrows were raised,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.720
"These take all week, and I've just one day!

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.960
I'm not sure I can do this all on my own,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.360
But I'll take a stab at it since they left me alone!"

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.400
"I wonder..." he inquired, not sure what he was thinking,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.000
"Is it possible to do this without it stinking?"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.720
He gathered his courage. From where? He didn't know.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.600
He cleared his throat and said, "Well, here goes..."

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.780
Come one, come all! I ask you: bear witness

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.080
To the tale of why I want nothing for Christmas.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:50.760
*Messy Mondays Theme Music*

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.320
The holidays are here again and with them come the gifts!

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.820
It's that time when my idolatry becomes a Christmas list.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.240
I want movies, I want games, I want everything I see!

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.500
I want to put my friends to shame with how much my parents spend on me. (hehe)

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.040
Over and over and time after time,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.340
We're told "Christmas" means "presents", and most of them mine.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.500
"Dad, I'm quite miffed 'cause my brother got more!

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.960
I received one gift and Percy got four!"

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.960
"Son, you're much older, your gifts were expensive!

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.920
We refinanced our mortgage!"
"You're really defensive!

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.540
If you really love me, you'd get what I want:

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.100
I asked for an Xbox, and this is what I got?"

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.560
And if you're unsure of things that you're wanting,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.680
The TV should make that a little less daunting.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.160
"This is the one, the toy you've been after!

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.020
It's plenty of fun and the cost doesn't matter!"

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.380
All the way till Christmas Eve, we just keep on shopping,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.700
And buying stuff that no one needs without ever stopping!

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.320
"A gift that so-and-so might like!" "And one I just couldn't resist!"

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.060
"Gifts that aren't from the heart." "We're just checking names off our list."

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.920
We eat feast with all the dressings, finding ways to spend our money,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.560
And we thank God for all our blessings, while the poor keep going hungry.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.820
"Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry, but have you anything to spare?"

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.460
"Oh my word, okay, I must explain what isn't fair.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.340
I see you out here day and night. In the cold is where you stand out,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.320
But who's to say you have the right to ask me for a handout?"

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.080
"I meant no harm, I just don't want to die of starvation."

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.240
"No, Mom, I said in Xbox ONE, not a Playstation."

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.790
I ask myself sometimes about these consumerist obsessions,

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.340
And I wonder, "Am I wasting my life accumulating possessions?"

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.400
"My friends, they were plenty, and my family, not bad,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.200
But check out how many iphones I had?"
*chuckle coughs*

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.580
But no that can't be right. I mean, where would this country be

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.440
Without our insatiable appetites to stimulate the economy?

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.680
"See, if a lot isn't bought during the Christmas season,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.840
Our economy halts!" Wait, that's the reason?

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.520
If the country falls apart without Christmas money made,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.000
Then perhaps our economy doesn't need to be saved.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.680
Christmas isn't about money or presents or gifts,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.020
Christmas is about Jesus and the things that He did!

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.220
I just find it kind of funny the day we "celebrate" Christ

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.660
Is now all about money instead of sacrifice.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.120
And I'm glad He still loves us, though we ruined His birthday

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.620
By turning his love into a money-making holiday.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.520
I have best friends and family; What more could I want?

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.980
You can't buy with money the joy that I've got!

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.020
The love that Christ showed can't be bought from a business,

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.080
And that's exactly why I don't want anything for Christmas.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.200
He heard a door creak. "Vandals?" he feared.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.700
He took a quick peek; the steps they drew near!

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.480
"Hello?" he stuttered; his voice had escaped him!

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.180
"Who's there?" he wondered. Had they come to take him?

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.100
"We're home!" came the answer. It was Josh, Kellie and Amy!

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.480
"I thought you'd gone on vacation and that you had left me!"

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.160
"Of course not!"Josh said, "We went out and got

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.920
This picture of all of us; It's straight from the heart.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.520
We don't have much money to spend this Christmas,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.800
But it's our way of saying, well, how much you mean to us."

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.100
Jordan looked at the photo and his smile grew.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.360
He didn't know much, but he knew this to be true:

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.500
"It really doesn't matter how much money you spent,

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.760
This is the best present ever because it came from my friends!"

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.040
*haHA* They laughed well into the evening and were filled with delight.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.780
A "Messy Christmas" to all and to all a good night!

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.840
Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode!

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.800
Thanks so much for watching our Christmas special

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.900
and a huge "thank you" to Garrett Vandenberg for composing the music for this video.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.060
He does such a great job, and, uh, he's got a website now

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.840
where if you want him to compose music for you, you can go check it out.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.640
And he sent me a text message with all the things he can do (are you ready for this?):

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.680
Theme songs, background music, score composing for videos, podcasts, and audio dramas,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.960
and he can also work with people on their own music and arrange and play

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.380
music tracks for them if they want to do a short album,

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.720
but don't have the recording equipment or budget to hire multiple musicians.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.560
He's like the most insanely talented musician that I know, and he's awesome,

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.960
and he's a friend of ours, and so we just wanted to plug him.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.220
His name is Garrett Vandenberg.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.580
Go to garrettvandenberg.com if you do videos or audio or anything and you need music. He's-He's your man.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.760
Next week on Messy Mondays: Grandpa Jordan learns to dance.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.640
Take care of your precious body while you're young

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.240
so that you can bust a move like your old Grandpa!

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.060
*Grunts while busting moves*

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.180
Busted moves before the break of dawn.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.480
*Grunts while busting moves*

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.540
They used to wake up before the sun rose so they could hoe some corn.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.040
Now I'm dancing in the morning!

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.820
Bustin' a move, all morning long...

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.280
Eating my bacon, going to the Cracker Barrel,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.240
eating, sitting on the rocking chair, playing with my iPhones.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.440
That's right.
