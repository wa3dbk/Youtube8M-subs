00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.750
Yes, it's been a long time coming hasn't it?

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.750
But Jaguar has finally got round to building
a two seater sports car again - ladies and

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:21.140
gentlemen I give you the F-Type

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.070
This car is clearly the spiritual successor
to the legendary E-Type.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.130
But don't expect any retro olde-worldey styling
here.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.860
This is a thoroughly modern looking sports
car with an all aluminium body that's been

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.180
designed to slip through the air as effortlessly
as possible.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.170
Inside, F-Type feels every inch a true sports
car with a dash is angled towards the driver

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.899
and body hugging sports seats that hold you
firmly in place.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.800
It's got some really nice touches too such
as heater vents which stay hidden until they

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.789
are needed.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:17.050
Jaguar set out to create a really sharp handling
and fun sports car with the F-Type and let

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.300
me assure you they have done just that.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.210
The steering is nice and quick yet the car
is never twitchy.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.390
And in the corners this thing just stays completely
flat and grips and grips.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.300
Yet when you are just cruising along the adaptive
dampers make sure that its still a comfy car

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.300
to travel in.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.440
And if you tire of having the wind in your
hair you can easily raise the roof on the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.110
move at up to 30mph.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.750
And with it up the F-Type is a surprisingly
quiet car to travel in.... so long as you

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.580
don't put the car in dynamic mode as this
brings the active exhaust into play.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.910
In sport mode you also get a sharper throttle
response, weighted steering, stiffer suspension

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.340
and faster shifts from the excellent paddle
shift eight speed automatic gearbox.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.970
You can get the F-Type in three different
flavours.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.830
This is the range-topping 488bhp 5.0litre
supercharged V8S and its absolutely mental.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.810
But you don't actually want it.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.590
The one you want is the 3.0-litre supercharge
V6 S - it still has 375bhp and can do 0-62

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.570
mpg in about 5 seconds and being less nose
heavy is actually sharper to drive.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:43.930
The car you don't want is the entry level
335bhp V6.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:54.130
It's still quick enough but it doesn't get
the adaptive dampers, nor active exhaust,

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.670
nor a limited slip differential like the other
cars do.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:12.530
And those bits of kit are important.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.740
Believe me they are.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:25.330
There are some other issues with the F-Type
too.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.390
The touch screen infotainment system is a
bit old and awkward to use.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:42.370
While Jaguar has taken a leaf out of Porsches
book by charging for stuff that should be

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.160
standard like a wind deflector.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:54.300
Speaking of which, poor in car storage and
a boot that's' not only tiny but is an awkward

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:03.590
shape means the F-Type isn't as practical
as a Boxster which is not only cheaper but

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.160
if I'm honest even better to drive too.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:22.340
Still, the difference is marginal and if you
ask me this is far the more manly looking

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.340
car.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.710
In fact Jaguar should be proud of the F-Type,
it proves that after all these years it still

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.470
knows how to build a cracking two-seater sports
car.
