Emma: I came to LSBU, and the campus was huge
but everyone was really friendly and made

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.950
everything really welcoming for me.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.769
Tim: I think the most enjoyable thing has
been the placement, the very first placement

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.689
I was on. It was a 12 week placement in a
hospital in South London. I was working with

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.140
mental health older adults so I just really
enjoyed meeting them, and yeah, just getting

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.630
them back into the community.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:39.480
Preya: The course here is a good balance of,
ah, background knowledge as well as, umm,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.969
nursing skills, so in the first year we learn
a lot of anatomy &amp; physiology, umm which forms

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.600
a good fundamental basis for what comes in
second year which is mostly patient assessment

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.649
which is how to look after patients who are
ill.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.430
Tim: I find it really interesting, ah, doing
the practicals in the clinical labs like here,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.719
and that was one of the main reasons I came
to this university as well, was because they

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.199
have wards that you can work on.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.199
Preya: It’s an emergency: critical situation,
and you have to simulate everything from assessing

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.110
the patient to calling the doctor, umm and
it’s it’s really intense, it kind of,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.770
it’s over in sort of five minutes and you
think: let me go again - laughter

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.930
Emma: I think that there’ll always be things
that, kind of, you not confident… so when

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.270
I went into my first placement I was nervous
but I knew what I was doing.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.470
Preya: Some of the hospitals that London South
Bank are attached to are the big teaching

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.939
hospitals, so Guys &amp; St Thomas’s, umm UCH,
umm St. Mary’s and I’ve got to see some

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.700
really interesting procedures.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.130
Emma: The majority of teachers practice still,
so everything is up to date and they still

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.040
know all the kind of dos &amp; don’ts, which
is really good.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.979
Tim: I’d say the cool part of the education
is that you have your own personal tutor to

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.680
help you out at any time, you’ve got the
lecturers always supporting you and university

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.149
has a website that, umm, helps you support
you through your education, umm, it has your

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.360
assignments on there, it has documents, and
it has any announcements that lecturers make.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.750
Emma: There’s still a lot for me to learn
cos I’m still first year, and learning it

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.750
all has been very hard but incredibly rewarding.
Umm, I’ve loved every minute of it I haven’t

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.800
had a day when I’ve thought, God I’m in
the wrong profession.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.660
Preya: So if someone said to me they were
thinking of studying nursing at South Bank

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.600
I would definitely encourage them to, umm
my experience here has been great in terms

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.760
of the location, the learning, but also the
placements, have been fantastic.
