00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:06.330
Today on our 2012 Jeep Compass, were going
to install Hidden Hitch, part number 87606.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.920
Alright, here are a couple of measurements
that will assist you with selecting accessories

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.519
for your new hitch such as a drawbar, a bike
rack, or a cargo carrier.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.609
From the center of the hitch pinhole to the
outermost edge of the bumper is 5-1/2 inches.

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.150
From the top of the receiver tube to the ground
is 15-3/4 inches.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.439
Now, lets go ahead with the installation.

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.970
Our first step with our install is going to
be removing the tow hook here on the drivers

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.970
side.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.130
The tow hook will be removed with the three
fasteners, two in the frame and one in the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.420
bumper, and will not be reinstalled as the
hitch is going to take it to place.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:51.790
Now, were ready to move on to the center bumper
fascia.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.760
The fascia will need to be trimmed to allow
for the receiver tube of the hitch.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.040
As per the instructions, we need to find the
center mark of our fascia.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:21.000
Measuring from outside of the pushpin tab
to the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:03:16.379
outside 
of the pushpin tab 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:24.959
is 14 inches.
