uh... plano there's bad stuff going back to
go out on the kitchen stolen no

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.590
it isn't fun you don't have to do this might
be selective fine

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.510
and here you and i know that i'm supposed
to be real transparency do you live pro-democracy

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.560
that i am

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.250
let you don't find that stuff out to see the
damn thing you'll be fine

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.720
now i wanna find out by like the idea

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.280
itself you know what

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.620
you know i had to guess at satisfy minedu
despite the slate as and i would put it so

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.400
when you go out with a bunch of friends who
are going to prefer somebody somebody's going

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.690
to do it user who did you notice that my strategy
judo business card bridges day they will be

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.200
shut up about it but

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.310
and then we did see that it is like

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.620
and our longer to go find a restaurant

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.159
blankets that's that's a good idea because
of new yorkers in this california

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.920
with you hear the a_b_c_ raids

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.770
in america is a move would be as being in
the season randy michaels so that they got

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.740
to see thereby statements like

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.980
season is threatening you know used to be
if they have this mail

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.240
if it's between in that they had like an eighty
nine percent theatrics when things are by

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.049
speculation that really know

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.509
benefits for us to act like they know what
the problem is in front of the window

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.130
how the hell department came up with the rating
from the surrender mister

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.270
so is that we get in on this on this

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.319
is more speculation would you like you can
say inot pachyderm

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.290
you can see if it's a little v

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.090
or heidi like you know how you nine i can
do it visit eighty one you like their own

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.119
precipice of rats in the kitchen

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:21.849
and i think it's a vacancy in your more educated
decision alpha no i'm not being able to make

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.560
educated decisions but there was a study released
a talked about how

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.549
people aren't going to have a report thread
of the health department dot

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.959
look if we post calories uh... or the food

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.989
and amount of calories it contains the and
people are gonna be less likely to eat the

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.619
fatty burgers they're gonna make healthier
choices some people actually the majority

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:44.949
of americans completely ignore the calorie
postings right except i don't and there are

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:49.409
people that don't and they're people who actually
lovett right and i'm one of those people by

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.159
love knowing how many calories is in my food
isle of knowing if they're right droppings

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:59.469
and you know in the chefs kitchen i wanna
know as much as i can about the food and the

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.229
excel at their people weren't definitely gonna
love this and by the way the most interesting

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:06.859
part about this story is it's not just to
restaurants

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:12.769
now like museums are using barcode c swipe
your phone and you learn about a particular

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.180
artifact that's at the museum their barcodes
everybody just might be slight left and right

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.060
and you'll learn things which is cool some
pretty soon if this is my theory we're not

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.609
going to have to talk to one another we're
all gonna how bar codes on our asses at all

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.500
people do is they just a quick slight but
there's smartphone

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.480
and bad you know everything you need to know
about the prison history

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.700
you know whether or not they were a cheater
you know about their financial situation dot

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.599
and mission necessary

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.179
initiate

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:45.889
uh... i like this might be slide on the monuments
and you find out about the history that sounds

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.319
really good

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.289
the and then this lady swipe on your ass if
you find out of the guys are the girls about

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:53.549
that salsa

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.589
and then you get into all you're going to
be six years financial records of her are

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:01.419
dot but now let's first error what i want
to know that

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:06.159
know that it was a very slightly slipping
my head sunset and in new york it really stocks

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.590
because we have to have all these meetings
to pick out what kind of clips that we want

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.719
