00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.410
Now I'm going to give you a few useful tips
to maximize on the ballet classes that you're

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.140
going to. One good thing to remember when
going to class, is to always apply the corrections

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.080
as quickly as possible. You are paying for
the teacher to give you instructions and to

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.320
help you become a better dancer, so you want
to maximize that and apply them as quickly

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.039
as possible, so they get sunken in to your
muscle memory. Another good tip is going to

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.829
be, be early for class, get a good spot, make
sure you have enough space to be dancing.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.420
A lot of classes get really crowded really
quickly, so the earlier you are the better

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.990
of a spot you have in class. Another good
tip is to always stand in the front. This

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.260
way the instructor is paying attention to
you, so they can give you more corrections,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.329
so you can improve more quickly. Also, another
thing is to always give a hundred and fifty

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.140
percent. Make sure you're putting in the effort;
otherwise it's a waste of time. Ballet is

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.790
very, very hard work. And a lot of people
spend lifetimes trying to hone their craft.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.220
So make sure you are giving the most that
you have to give. Energy wise and mentally

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.140
when you're in class. Using these tips, it
will definitely help you when you're in classes

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.740
and enjoy them, have fun. Looking the part
when going to a ballet class is very, very

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.570
important. So I'm going to explain a few things
to you today about what to wear to class.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.490
Firstly, you're going to want to make sure
you get a leotard, and you're going to want

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.460
to make sure it's not too big, you want it
tight against your body so they can see the

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.770
different muscles and the way your body is
working. Also, you're going to want to make

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.509
sure to get tights. They come in pink, black,
tan, the most popular in ballet classes are

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.050
going to be the black tights or the pink tights.
You're also going to want to get maybe like

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.160
a little skirt, you can wear them to most
classes. You don't want to get all the bulky

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.509
warm-ups, such as the warm up shorts, the
garbage bag pants, all of the heavy sweaters,

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.110
teachers hate those. They keep them from being
able to see your body and see the way your

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.250
body is working. Also, make sure to always
wear your hair slicked back, and held secured

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.341
tightly to the back of your head. Whether
it's a clip you put it in, or you put it in

00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:24.090
a bun, or maybe a French twist, you don't
want your hair in your face because it's very

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.040
distracting when you're trying to dance. When
you start doing turns it'll get in your face,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.459
a ponytail will slap you in the eyes, and
it's not the best way to wear your hair to

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.150
go to ballet class. Also, you're going to
want to make sure to by your ballet shoes.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.230
Whether they be point shoes, or your flat
ballet shoes, going to want to make sure to

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.610
go to the dance store to buy them. There's
several different large name stores such as

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.280
Capizio, Morella, there's also Fried. Those
are some bigger stores, there's also some

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.580
smaller dance stores that you can go to, going
to be locally owned. If you just open the

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.430
yellow page book, there's actually a section
for dance shops and they'll list all of them.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.320
Just call around to see who has what you're
looking for.
