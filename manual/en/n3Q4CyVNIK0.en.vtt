Hello! Batteries.com tech team again.
Today we're going to go over some

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.599
Laptop battery buying tips, including
help on finding your laptop model and

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.089
searching for a good replacement battery.

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.379
Any good battery website like Batteries.com
will include some type of

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.080
Battery Finder tool

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.220
that allows you to search by the model number.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.029
So let's start by finding the model
number of your laptop.

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.529
Most laptops will display the model near
the brand name or logo.

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.619
On the front or in this case near the
keyboard.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.440
If you can't find the model number

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.690
Try looking at the information in the
bottom or back of the laptop.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.460
Most devices will have the label listing
serial and model information.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.870
Oddly enough the model info on the back
of might not always match what's

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:48.920
on the front.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.540
These are detailed specs for the laptop, and
may include a more specific model number

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.270
that accounts for the system
configuration.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.240
So if you have to choose, use the one on
the front as it's usually more

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.100
commonly known.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.000
Another way to find a replacement
battery is to look for the battery

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.650
number itself on the one you have.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.530
Make sure your laptop is powered off
and unplugged.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.170
Then pop the battery out and look
for the part number.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.280
Don't worry if you can't find them,
not all batteries display it on the label.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.889
If you do see a part number,

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:21.770
type it into the search box at
Batteries.com.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.000
and if the battery's available it'll be
listed along with some additional

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.930
compatible batteries.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.560
along with some additional 
compatible batteries.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.610
An OEM battery will typically have a 
little more power than the aftermarket battery

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.350
but at a higher price.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.930
One final note on finding a battery,
remember to look at the actual picture

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.160
of the battery you're buying online.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.870
It seems like a no-brainer, but you can
save yourself some headache if you

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.770
actually compare the picture with the
battery you have in your hand.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:51.820
And that's it!

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.850
Remember to do a little homework to 
save yourself some time and money 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.830
down the road.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.090

selection of both or OEM and aftermarket
