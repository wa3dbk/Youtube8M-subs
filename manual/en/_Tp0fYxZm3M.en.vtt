This is Diana Sullivan in Austin, Texas.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.680
I've been teaching a series of machine knitting ribber lessons,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.989
and now I'm going to show how to cast off knit-two-purl-two rib

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.889
using a tapestry needle and the "smiles and frowns" cast off.  The first thing

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.140
that's needed is to cut the yarn so that I have a nice long end

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.119
to sew with, and I think I want about three times the width of

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.760
the stitches.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.850
To set the carriages for circular knitting, put the PR lever up on the ribber and

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.059
depress the left part button on a Brother machine.  If you have another make of machine,

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.288
check your manual to see what the circular settings are.

00:01:00.288 --> 00:01:01.139
Now I'm knitting

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.440
20 rows of circular knitting

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.733
to put a nice edge on with the waste yarn.

00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.289
And now to get the sample off,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.270
I'm just going to cut the yarn, and I'm going knit across and back and reach under and catch the sample.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.830
So here's my sample.

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.459
Here's how that knit-two-purl-two sample looks off the machine and in my lap.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.649
I have the knit-two-purl-two circular cast on at the bottom here,

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.149
and then the knit-2-purl-2 up to here, and then with the waste yarn

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.819
I have done circular knitting, which can be folded down so that I can sew

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.529
the edge.  And the first step is to thread the needle with the loose end,

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.259
so I just take the needle,

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.220
fold the yarn around it, pinch, and push it through.

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:04.139
The next step is to bring this yarn from the outside of the purple to the inside of the purple, and what I want to do

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.279
is go in right next to the stitch this came out of.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.419
The next step is to fold the waste yarn down.

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.099
Now, the stitches that I am going to sew into are the rose-colored

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.799
stitches that show

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.429
right beyond this ring of waste yarn

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.848
where the first row of waste yarn catches in.  So these little bumps here are the stitches I'm going to catch,

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:48.679
beginning with the one that is the farthest to the right, which happens to be this stitch.

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.358
What I do is I go in that

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.879
stitch from the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.919
outside of the purple ring toward the inside and then I come out

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.519
the very next stitch away from me on this away side of the knitting, and then

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.980
I just pull that through.

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.469
Now just like the one-by-one version, every single time

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.429
I take a new stitch, I switch from the away side to the close side, so my next stitch is going to be

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:32.479
here and here, so I bring my needle from the outside toward the inside and

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.409
pick up this first stitch on this side and

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.519
then I tip my needle over and I come out

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.020
the second stitch on this side.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.360
Now this is a "frown" stitch because

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:54.049
the yarn goes this way.  It goes in the stitch and out the stitch an upside down U shape.

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.219
And you see the yarn being pulled across -- just goes across the top.

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:05.179
Now I go to the opposite side for the next stitch, so over here is where I go.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.980
I insert the needle there.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.859
It's the same place I came out of.  I go in where I came out,

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:19.848
and then I go through the next stitch from the inside. This is a used stitch and this is a new stitch.

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.549
And I pull that through,

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.010
and don't go tight.  Keep a nice soft tension.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.869
Next, that stitch was on this side so the next stitch is on this side,

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.640
and I go in where I came out, and I can see it there, and

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.899
then I come and take the next stitch from the inside out.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.690
That's another frown stitch

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.490
The stitches on my

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.560
side -- on the close side -- are the frown stitches.  The stitches on the far side are the smile stitches.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.220
So again I go in where I came out and

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:04.749
then come out the next stitch.  Now we call that a smile stitch because the yarn went in this way and came out that way,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.929
forming a U-shape or a smile shape.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.809
And then the next stitch is going to be a frown on my side -- used stitch,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
new stitch.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.560
The next stitch will be a smile on the far side, so in and out --

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:35.160
used stitch, new stitch.  And I'm going to go ahead and finish sewing this on across

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.724
so that you can see how it looks.

00:05:37.724 --> 00:05:39.850
Here I am really close to the end,

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.760
so I thought I would

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:49.239
film these last few stitches, where I go in and come out like I did earlier,

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.820
and just show how to end it off.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.410
Come in,

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.189
do my smile stitch over here.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.509
There it is.

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.220
Bring that through,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.249
and then I like to just tug and fiddle and make sure that I got everything.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.669
The final stitch goes in where I came out, and then it just catches across on the other side,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:25.699
through the stitch I was just on on the other side.  And then I want to bring this through the purple waste yarn

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.679
and simply unravel the waste yarn,

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.110
so I'll get that off and be right back.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:43.099
Well, you're probably wondering if it worked okay to use smiles and frowns on a two-by-two ribbing,

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:50.509
because it is very different in the way it's constructed from a one-by-one ribbing, but look how nice that looks.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:59.150
I will tell you that even though it looks just fine on this end and the same on the front and the back,

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:07.099
Look!  It doesn't really look like the circular cast on at all.  It really does look a little different.

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:11.149
But that's quite a nice bind off, and you can use it in a lot of situations.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:18.079
So that was the tapestry needle smiles and frowns bind off in two-by-two ribbing.
