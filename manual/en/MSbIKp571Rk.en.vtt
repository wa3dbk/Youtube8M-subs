00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.970
Today we know the topography of Mars one hundred
times better than the topography of our

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.400
own

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.330
oceans. This is because more than
two-thirds of our planet is covered by

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.200
deep oceans.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.430
What would the Earth look like if we could
drain the ocean?

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.680
Well, you would probably ask for a window
seat on your next flight to Hawaii

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.940
and let me show you why. So far only a
few percent of the oceans have been

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.080
surveyed by ships.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.690
Shipper surveys provide very high
spatial resolution

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.960
but these ships travel at only about
twelve miles per hour.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.640
It's been estimated that a 125 to 200
ship years observing time

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.890
will be needed to map the deep oceans
and this would cost

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.270
a few billion dollars. Fortunately

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.260
such a major mapping is largely
unnecessary because the ocean surface

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.700
has broad bumps and dips which mimic the
topography of the ocean floor. 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.600
The extra gravitational attraction of these
features on the seafloor

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.710
produce minor variations in the pull of
gravity

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.080
that produce tiny variations in ocean
surface height.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.119
These bumps and dips can be mapped using
a very accurate

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.700
radar altimeter mounted on a satellite.
Most of the new information comes from

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.340
the CryoSat-2 satellite

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.740
launched by the European Space Agency in
2010.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.670
While the primary mission of the CryoSat-2 is to monitor the volume of ice

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.910
in the polar regions, the satellite
continues to collect data

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.459
over the global ocean. The CryoSat-2 data

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.270
are more accurate and provide vastly
improved coverage than the data

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.319
from all previous satellite altimeter
gravity missions.

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.500
We will now fly along the global mid-

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.630
ocean system. The red line marks the
location of the spreading boundaries.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.899
These images show the vertical gravity
gradient,

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.989
which highlights the smaller scale
features on the seafloor.

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:04.560
We start at the mid-atlantic ridge. The
seafloor spreading boundary consists of

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.500
north-south oriented spreading ridges

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.400
connected by east-west trending
transform faults. The new gravity model

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.750
highlights these features in
unprecedented decamp.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.110
As we cross the equator one can track the fracture zones from South

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.870
America

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.730
across the mid-atlantic ridge to the
coast of Africa.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.099
Close to the continents, the original
seafloor is buried by

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.959
thick layers of sediment so the match
points where the continents rifted

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.580
have only been seen in these new gravity
data. It is in these sediment covered areas

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.060
where most of the new discoveries are
being made playing. Flying further along the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.510
southern mid-atlantic ridge,

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.450
the orthogonal pattern bridges and transform
faults is very clear.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.430
There is also a left distinct north-south
corrugated pattern,

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.849
associated with the abyssal Hills, that are
formed parallel to

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.950
all the spreading ridges. Most of these
abyssal hills are uncharted by ships,

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.349
so we are seeing them for the first time
in this gravity data.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.760
In the far south Atlantic, we fly over
the bouvet triple junction

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.709
defining a connection point between
three major tectonic plates.

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.810
We continue along the slow spreading
southwest Indian Ridge access.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.430
The gravity anomalies from the
north-south trending fracture zones

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.810
are very strong along this ridge. Next,

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.250
we approach the Indian Ocean triple
junction, which marks the connection

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.709
point

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.019
between African Plate on the left, the
indo-australian plate on the right,

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.620
and Antarctic plate below. We continue our
flight

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.859
along the southeast Indian Ridge. This is
one of the most remote areas on our

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:38.400
planet,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.650
includes the region where the Malaysian
flight MH 370 disappeared.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.760
Note that the spacings between these
fracture zones

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.799
increase along this section of the ridge
and the location of the spreading axis

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.810
is less pronounced and there are fewer
earthquakes. This dramatic change in the

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.230
style of sea floor spreading

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.169
is due to an increase in the spreading
rate above a threshold value  of70

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:01.419
millimeters per year

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:05.200
or about 3 inches per year. As we fly
from the

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.250
southern Indian Ocean into the South
Pacific Ocean, we begin to follow the

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.849
Pacific Antarctic Ridge.

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.310
From this point, until we reach the end
of this ridge axis

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.970
in the Gulf of California, the transform
faults are infrequent

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.490
and the ridge axis is a narrow high. This
part of the South Pacific Ocean

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.130
has some areas the size of the state
of New Jersey that have not been

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.860
surveyed

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.150
by any ship. We continue our journey up
the Pacific Antarctic rise to the Chili

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.080
triple junction

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.520
and then over the Eastern microplate.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.639
This section of the East Pacific Rise has
the highest spreading rate on earth

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.570
of 120 millimeters per year. Finally,

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.060
we continue across the Galapagos triple
junction and up into the Gulf of California.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.750
At this point the global spreading
center goes on to land

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.790
where it is called the San Andreas fault
system.
