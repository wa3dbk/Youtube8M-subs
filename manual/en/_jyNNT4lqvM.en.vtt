00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.600
We're going to play Angel of Harlem by U2.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.910
This song's got a few chords in it...

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:17.920
C major, F major, and that's during the verse
parts.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.690
On the electric guitar, which is what I'm
going to play, it's got a C bar chord up to

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:37.760
the F bar chord and during the pre-chorus
it's F major to a G major chord, G major,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.730
back down to the F.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.430
Basically it sounds like this...

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:57.010
The intro sounds like this.. and that's 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.510
played through the intro and the verse.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.970
The pre-chorus sounds like this...

00:01:02.970 --> 00:06:04.020
The bridge of the song is A minor, to a G,
to an F. A minor, G, and F. And then back

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.020
to the verse.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.020
Alright!

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.022
Thank you!
