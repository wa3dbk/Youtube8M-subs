Your dog's lying on the living room carpet
and starts to scratch. Uh oh you think. I

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.929
hope the dog doesn't have fleas. I'm Janice
Creneti and this is biology of fleas. Why

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.830
are fleas such a problem? Why are they so
difficult to control? Well let's talk a little

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.669
bit about what a flea is and maybe I can help
you shed some light on the subject. Fleas

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.880
are invertebrate animals that means they don't
have a backbone. A lot of animals that don't

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.939
have backbones instead have very thick coverings.
The flea's one of them. That's why it can

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.070
be difficult to kill with chemicals. Fleas
are, belong to a group of invertebrates called

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.520
arthropods. Arthropods have jointed legs which
you can see here on the picture. Fleas have

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.720
the ability to jump great distances. I don't
know if you've ever seen one jump but it's

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.780
really a pretty amazing thing. So exactly
how does your dog wind up with fleas? Well

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.559
there's a couple of different ways that can
happen. If your dog goes outside or is exposed

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.750
to other dogs that already have fleas, the
fleas can jump from the ground onto the dog

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.190
or from one dog to the next. Like I said they're
really good jumpers. Fleas can lay eggs. They

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.520
can lay them in your carpet, they can lay
them outside in the grass, it can even lay

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.160
them in pillows and bedding. That can be why
it's so hard to get rid of fleas. Once the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.110
flea eggs are hatched, they're going to turn
into flea larva. Then they'll go into a cocoon

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.460
and then the adult fleas emerge. Again ready
to jump on your dog and start drinking its

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.230
blood. In fact one of the ways that you can
tell the dog actually has fleas is to apply

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.820
a little water and smear it. If it turns reddish-brown
that's, that's blood and you know that the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.200
animal that's been biting your dog is actually
a flea. So how do you get rid of them? Well

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.020
there's lots of different things that you
can use. Dog collars, if you have a really

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.070
bad infestation you might have to result to
something like a flea bomb where you actually

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.500
set off a chemical. And you want to look for
something in the bomb that actually is going

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.220
to kill the flea eggs as well as the adults
or you're never going to get rid of your fleas.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.860
