[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:08.712
-Hi.

00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:10.060
We're Brooklyn and Bailey.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.230
And today we decided
to do a room tour,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.010
because you guys have
requested it so much.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.055
We thought it would be
fun to show you our room,

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:19.714
and we really hope
you guys like it.

00:00:19.714 --> 00:00:20.880
So do you want to start off?

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.800
-Well, I thought we'd
start off with our beds,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.860
because they're
kind of different.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.520
We did them based on
our personalities.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.360
Mine's blue, because I'm
more of a boyish person.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.455
And she's more of-- well, not
really boyish, but tomboyish.

00:00:33.455 --> 00:00:35.990
And she's-- do you want
to explain your bed?

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.710
-Girly.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.710
As you can see, it's
a really bright pink.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.520
And then we just have the
cute pillows that match it.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.680
And we also got some pillows
from-- was it-- where?

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.557
-From Pottery Barn.

00:00:47.557 --> 00:00:48.140
-Pottery Barn.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.757
-All of this is
from Pottery Barn.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:49.950
-They have the best pillows.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.283
And this has got some cute
XO's in all different colors.

00:00:52.283 --> 00:00:53.760
So pull in her bed
colors as well.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.955
-Mine's an owl.

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.020
I love owls.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.750
That's why I chose this one.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.652
We actually made our little
bed frames from old bunk beds.

00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:04.360
But since we're getting
older, we kind of

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.032
wanted to split the
beds so we weren't

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:08.240
on top of each other anymore.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.500
And our mom and Jenny
from ShowMeCute did this.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.590
They painted it
and then sanded it

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.180
to make it look
[? rustic ?], kind of.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.640
-So this is a cute nightstand
that my mom found just

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.962
at a little antique store.

00:01:23.962 --> 00:01:25.920
And we fell in love with
it, because it kind of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.704
pulled in the whole
room together.

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:29.870
Plus it's also something
you can set your stuff down

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.744
when you're sleeping.

00:01:30.744 --> 00:01:32.450
So this is helpful.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.120
-And the walls-- actually,
the polka dots are done by,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.670
again, Jenny, ShowMeCute.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.440
She actually has a video
on her YouTube channel.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.690
It's called ShowMeCute if
you want to go check it out.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.150
But we decided to do a whole
bunch of modge podge colors

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.870
to bring in the entire polka
dots and a multicolored room.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.810
-And make it brighter and fun.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.020
-So let's move on to the
other side of the room.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.020
-So this is also like an
antique trunk that my mom found,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.870
I think, at the same
antique store, right?

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.079
-I don't know.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.370
They were antiquing everywhere.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.994
-Yeah, because we
really love antiques.

00:02:05.994 --> 00:02:09.060
So this is just a cute--

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.590
-Chest.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.256
-And it holds all our
blankets, as you can see.

00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:14.736
And then this is our desk area.

00:02:14.736 --> 00:02:17.880
-And this is, again, another
antique from some antique shop

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.510
somewhere.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.763
-We like to mix modern
and [? rustic ?].

00:02:22.763 --> 00:02:23.850
-Antique-ish things.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.348
-As you can see, it's a bright
pink chair, which is my touch.

00:02:27.348 --> 00:02:29.910
And I hold them in
a cute vase that's

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.110
made out of wrapped newspapers.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.899
-I love that.

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:33.440
It's so cute.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.740
Again, it brings in all
the colors of the room.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.550
And this we spent forever doing.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.640
It's modge podge
and scrapbooking

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.560
paper on a little cardboard B
that we found in a craft store

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.510
one time.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.660
Love it, so cute.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:56.120
-And then of course we have
our picture frame of past.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.867
It's got all of our pictures
from when we were little,

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:01.345
growing up, all our trips.

00:03:01.345 --> 00:03:02.780
-From vacations.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.590
-Photo shoots.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.927
And then sparkly "peace."

00:03:05.927 --> 00:03:07.510
I mean, who doesn't
like peace, right?

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.510
-Yeah, so I love this.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.780
I think we painted
this outside white,

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.120
because it was black
originally but kind of meshed

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.980
with the room.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.500
So we decided to paint it white.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.670
So love it, so cute.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.480
-So we're going to head
into our closet on now.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.180
And actually we're really lucky
when we came to the house.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.405
We scored the biggest closet.

00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:29.030
Well, besides--

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.290
-It used to be a little
miniature storage room.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.930
But when we finished
the basement,

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.670
my parents decided to
give us the biggest

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.490
closet, because
there were two of us.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.089
So we had double the clothes
and shoes and all of that stuff.

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.880
So as you can see--

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.820
-We start with the jackets.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.320
-Jackets.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.236
-Which, of course, you
need during the winter.

00:03:46.236 --> 00:03:46.770
-Bags.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.970
-And then the purses
and the belts.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.230
-Yes.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.180
This is just a bunch
of shelves to hold

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.500
a bunch of random stuff.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.920
This is where we put our little
cute boxes and our perfumes

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.420
and--

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.710
-Yeah, and we put
our makeup here

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.168
when we're doing
it in the morning.

00:04:00.168 --> 00:04:03.760
-Yes, and this once just
holds sunglasses and bags.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.790
And these are--

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.160
-For our scarves.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.070
I love scarves.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.390
-We have, like, a bajillion.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.840
-And then our nice dresses.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.050
So, like, skirts and
dresses and stuff here.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.010
-We have this shelf
full of a bunch of books

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.010
that we absolutely love.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.230
-Because we love reading.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.300
And then here, this
shelf just holds a bunch

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.610
of fedoras and hats,
as you can see.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.555
And our dance clothes,
because we like to dance.

00:04:27.555 --> 00:04:29.130
-PJs.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.130
-And then here are our shirts.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.310
-Long sleeve, short
sleeves for the summertime.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.120
And then we have
long pants and then

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.380
short pants for the
summertime as well.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.270
So yeah.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.294
And then just our shoes.

00:04:40.294 --> 00:04:41.710
-These, if you
might be wondering,

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.150
we call them our junk bins.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.840
The kind of stuff
you don't want--

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.370
-Laying around in your room.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.270
- --loose around your room, but
you still want to keep them.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.785
-So they're like your little
treasure boxes, basically.

00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:54.240
-Yeah, so we just labeled
them as "Brooklyn Junk"

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.686
and "Bailey Junk."

00:04:55.686 --> 00:04:57.560
And we keep them there
for special occasions.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.920
-Yes, for all of
our special things.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.570
-And then who can
forget our jewelery?

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.150
We've got a whole bunch of it.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.760
Of course, you
can see most of it

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.380
is mine, because Brooklyn
doesn't like wearing jewelry.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.580
And then just some long
earrings here and there.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.200
-My mom got this cute idea
to go to an antique store,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.457
and we got this old rundown--
what do they call them?

00:05:17.457 --> 00:05:18.040
-Screen doors?

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.890
-Screen doors from olden times.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.880
-Oh, those are so long ago,
we can't remember rain.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.994
-But they hold our
earrings on the top.

00:05:24.994 --> 00:05:26.910
And then the middle row
is for your bracelets.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.076
And then the big long one
is for all your necklaces.

00:05:29.076 --> 00:05:31.322
And It's really pretty
nifty and cute, so--

00:05:31.322 --> 00:05:32.030
-So this is the--

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.800
-The full-length mirror.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.300
Yeah.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.190
-Yeah.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.410
-Full-length mirror.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.001
-I think you all
know what that does.

00:05:38.001 --> 00:05:39.250
You just stand in front of it.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.916
-Look at yourself,
look at your clothes.

00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:44.740
-So that's pretty much a wrap
for all of our room tour.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.780
And we really hope
you guys enjoyed it.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.760
And we'd like you
guys to comment below

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.080
on what your favorite
part of our room was.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.810
-And we decided
we'll be uploading

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.880
our videos every Wednesday.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.890
So be sure to check up on that.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.370
And be sure to follow us on
Instagram @BrooklynAndBailey.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.290

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.890
-Bye.
