Hi. I'm Candy Cane-Canncel with Expert Village.
So in this clip we're going to take our bound

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.170
button hole and we're going to be pressing
on the wrong side as well as pinning it. So

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.770
once you turn it inside out it looks like
this. And now what we're going to do is press

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.550
it. Go ahead and take your iron and you just
want to press it kind of flat. Get out any

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:36.900
crinkles. So now what you're going to be doing
is pushing the fabric inward a little bit

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:45.010
so that both the top and the bottom are even.
So turn it to the wrong side and just fold

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.520
up the fabric just a little. And you want
to take some pins and go ahead and pin it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:01:01.450
in please. And you kind of have to play with
this a little bit to get it perfect. So, you

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:12.060
kind of push down the fabric on the top, pin
that in place and then come around to the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.820
front and look at how it looks. And this will
determine how much more you need to push it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:30.359
in to place.
And the whole point is you want to line up

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:39.649
the fabric so that they both meet in the center
but that they're equal distances apart. So

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:46.240
in this case the bottom's a little bit too
far out. So we're going to take it in a little

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.740
bit. And again, you just have to play with
it. It takes a little bit of practice to get

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.950
this bound button hole perfect. So when you
are going to attempt to do this try it out

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.159
on a piece of scrap fabric first? Don't just
go straight to your garment because it does

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.159
take a little bit of practice to get this.
