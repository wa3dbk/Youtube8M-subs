00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.669
This is a ratchet strap with dimensions of
2 inches by 8 feet long and is rated for 5,000

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:08.669
pounds.

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:11.700
This is intended for a car tie down with a
built in axle strap.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.719
We will go ahead and show you how it works
and how it actually attaches to your vehicle.

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.970
We will begin with the actual axle strap itself.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.090
It has an extra sleeve on here for cushions,
so in case you have a show car and you have

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.850
a detailed under body, this will not scratch
up your paint finish.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.520
And what it simply does, it just wraps around
the axle or cross member and snaps over itself

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.280
like so.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.480
The rest of the strap we have coiled up here,
again you have 8 foot length.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.720
And the rest of that length will actually
go to your ratchet here.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.852
To use this, your ratchet end will get tied
down to the trailer and your strap will go

00:00:50.852 --> 00:00:58.989
through the slot here and that just pulls
on through.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:07.430
Leave excess alone like that, then take your
handle here, pull this lever back, and you

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.790
ratchet it tight.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.680
OK, we will go ahead and demonstrate this
product, as you can see the padding goes around

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.770
the axle itself and goes back on itself with
this tie loop here.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.730
You can also vary the loop here as you need
it, you can make it smaller or bigger, and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.880
we will leave it just like it is.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.560
Now we will run it over to our ratchet right
here, and we just need to simply just put

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.760
it through the center of the axle there and
just pull out the excess length.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.810
Now, take your ratchet and lock it with that
lever here, basically all you do is squeeze

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.700
between these two points.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.869
And there you have it.

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.060
Four more of those and your cars properly
secured.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:58.110
There you have it for part # 78433, 2 inch
by 8 foot long 5,000 lb flex car tie-down

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.130
with a built-in axle strap from Erikson Manufacturing.
