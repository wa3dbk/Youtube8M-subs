00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Hi! I'm Aurora Mazzucchelli and this is my restaurant "Ristorante Marconi" in Sasso Marconi, Bologna 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and today I'll show you my "lasagne alla bolognese" kind of recipe

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
let's start with dough to make the lasagna 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
according to the traditional recipe we add some spinach 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
so we have some milled semolina and some flour 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
about 1,50Kg milled semolina, 450g flour 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
in order to reach 1kg and half

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
four or five eggs and nine yolks 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
let's arrange the flour so that it forms something like a fountain

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
let's add the eggs 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
let's start to work it from the centre, taking some flour from the sides  

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
let's add the flour

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:33.000
at this stage let's add about 300g of cooked and chopped spinach 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
now let's knead it until we get an homogeneous ball 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
to let it stand about half an hour before using it 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
covered with some cellophane not to let it dry 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Here our dough we have kneaded and let it stand before 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Now we're ready to stretch our sheet of pasta dough 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
then let's cut it in squares that will be cooked 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the water is boiling 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
let's sear first and leave them to cool in a bowl 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
with cold water, ice and a drizzle of oil not to let them stick together 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
the main ingredient of the lasagna is the béchamel sauce 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
to make the béchamel sauce:

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
1l of milk, 70g of butter, 70g of flour, nutmeg, shallot or onion and clove

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Bring milk to the boil

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and add the butter and the flour

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
butter and flour must be well cooked 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
let's scratch some nutmeg

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
once it starts to come unstuck from the pot sides we can pour the milk 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
that we have flavoured with some onion and clove 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
let's stir in the milk at one time

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
let it cook for about 10 minutes until it gets the desired consistency

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
the béchamel sauce must be creamy, neither too thickened nor too loose 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
to make the Bolognese sauce to put inside the lasagna

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
we've taken some ground beef, some ground pork and some pork bacon slices 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
celery, carrot and onion

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
sauté celery, carrot and onion finely chopped

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I let them gently cook

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I add the ground meat

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I let it well sauté

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I splash it with some red wine

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I let the wine evaporate and I let the rest cook 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I add some tomato sauce

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and I let it cook at low heat for about 4 hours

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
in order to get this Bolognese sauce

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
let's continue to assemble our lasagna 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
let's place the sheets of pasta and the béchamel sauce on top

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
together with the Bolognese sauce as well

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
we usually make nine layers of pasta

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
starting with a bit of béchamel sauce and some Bolognese sauce

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
then the first pasta layer and all layers to follow

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
the béchamel sauce

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
the Bolognese sauce

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
let's mix everything

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
in order to have all the surface covered 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and some grated parmesan cheese

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
let's put less Bolognese sauce on the last layer

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
so a bit of béchamel sauce, some drops of Bolognese sauce, some parmesan

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and some butter flakes. Then let's place it in the oven 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
at 170°C for about 40 minutes 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
The lasagna is ready

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
let's cut it in squares and serve its

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
here the lasagna

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 well thick : nine layers all well seasoned and tasty 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Thanks!
