00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:06.490
How to Eat for Maximum Energy.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.860
Skip the energy drinks and extra large lattes
and follow these simple guidelines to get

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.380
all the energy you need from your food.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.220
You will need Breakfast Complex carbohydrates
Good fat and protein Frequent small meals

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.570
Water and fresh fruit (optional).

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.590
Step 1.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.230
Eat breakfast every day.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.070
You need to put fuel in to get energy out,
and after a full night's sleep you're running

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.340
on empty.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.469
Step 2.

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.560
Make complex carbohydrates the centerpiece
of your diet.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.590
Carbs supply energy; you should get about
half your calories from them.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.850
Complex carbohydrates from whole grains, fruits,
and vegetables provide steady, lasting energy.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.930
Simple carbohydrates spike your blood sugar,
causing a sugar rush and then a crash.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.930
Step 3.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.290
Include unsaturated fat and high-quality protein
in your diet.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.910
Good fats from such sources as olive oil and
nuts are a healthy concentrated energy source.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.850
Protein helps the body regulate energy use.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.930
Step 4.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.060
Eat more often.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.920
Frequent small meals -- five or six a day
-- keep your metabolism up, your blood sugar

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.469
stable, and your energy level constant.

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.140
Step 5.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.200
Don't eat too much.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.079
Overeating can literally weigh you down and
start a negative energy spiral.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.509
Weight gain from overeating can make you feel
sluggish and less like exercising, contributing

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.929
to even lower energy.

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:28.459
Eat whole fresh fruit for snacks.

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:33.570
The fiber in fruit makes your body burn its
sugars slowly, for long-lasting energy.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.880
Step 6.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.350
Drink plenty of water because dehydration
leads to fatigue.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.350
Step 7.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.570
Cut back on alcohol and caffeine.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.469
Alcohol disrupts sleep, leaving you tired
the next day and the temporary boost from

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.100
caffeine eventually leads to an energy letdown.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.869
Did you know Potential energy is stored energy.

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.579
Kinetic energy is the energy of motion -- the
use of potential energy.
