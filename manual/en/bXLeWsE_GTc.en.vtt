00:00:00.214 --> 00:00:04.944
(gentle music)

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:13.319
♫ Lights, camera ♫

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:15.154
- Hi everyone, how's it going?

00:00:15.154 --> 00:00:18.173
So welcome to another DIY Sunday

00:00:18.173 --> 00:00:20.971
and today I am going
to show you how to make

00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:23.420
a kimono/shawl top.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.916
This is really pretty if you're
going to a music festival

00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:28.795
this summertime and you
want to put something

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:32.035
over your tank top or as a beach cover-up.

00:00:32.035 --> 00:00:33.613
You can wear this for day or evening

00:00:33.613 --> 00:00:35.633
depending on the choice
of fabric you choose.

00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:38.373
So this is something you can
definitely get creative with.

00:00:38.373 --> 00:00:42.959
So I have my angle ruler
here which I am going to,

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:45.141
just make sure the sides are cut evenly

00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:47.696
because as you know, when
you go to a fabric store,

00:00:47.696 --> 00:00:50.877
they never cut your fabric straight.

00:00:50.877 --> 00:00:52.576
For some reason, they're just like

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:54.804
whoop choo choo choo.

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:57.977
So here I have the wrong side facing out

00:00:57.977 --> 00:01:02.084
and the right side inside
of the folded fabric.

00:01:02.876 --> 00:01:05.558
Over on this side is the folded side

00:01:05.558 --> 00:01:08.182
and then over on this side is the opening.

00:01:08.182 --> 00:01:11.676
So that's how I have my fabric laid out.

00:01:11.676 --> 00:01:14.056
All right so to start, find you midpoint

00:01:14.056 --> 00:01:16.134
and measure it downward.

00:01:16.134 --> 00:01:18.538
Make sure both sides are even.

00:01:18.538 --> 00:01:21.561
Then cut a straight line across like so.

00:01:22.505 --> 00:01:24.851
This way you will have two pieces

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:28.521
that are the same width and length.

00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:31.604
All right, so now onto the sleeves

00:01:31.604 --> 00:01:33.949
and there are two ways of doing this.

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:38.825
You can one, leave this as is
which is the easier option,

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:40.530
or two if you want to give this

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.572
more of a kimono-inspired look,

00:01:43.572 --> 00:01:47.067
then what I would suggest
for you to do is draw

00:01:47.067 --> 00:01:50.832
an upside down L at the
bottom left and right corner,

00:01:50.832 --> 00:01:52.748
just like what I'm doing here.

00:01:52.748 --> 00:01:55.515
Basically this will measure out to be

00:01:55.515 --> 00:02:00.451
six and a half inches
in and 16 inches down.

00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:04.667
Once you draw out that
L shape of the sleeves,

00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:06.010
cut that out.

00:02:07.443 --> 00:02:09.207
All right guys, so I hope that last step

00:02:09.207 --> 00:02:10.657
wasn't so difficult.

00:02:11.184 --> 00:02:13.263
Now we're going to
finish all the raw edges

00:02:13.263 --> 00:02:15.712
by folding it in half an inch.

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:18.509
So take half an inch of the raw edges

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.609
and fold it in toward the wrong side.

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.370
You can either pin or press
it down with a hot iron.

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:27.463
Here I first started and experimented

00:02:27.463 --> 00:02:29.739
with the gluing method because I wanted

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.979
to show you guys how this would work

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.243
if you were to use the gluing method.

00:02:34.243 --> 00:02:37.423
Now for my specific type of fabric,

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:40.420
it didn't work quite
effectively or efficiently

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.404
as it would with a sewing machine

00:02:42.404 --> 00:02:45.543
but I want to just give you
guys an idea how it would look.

00:02:45.543 --> 00:02:47.945
Here I am just using a sewing machine

00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:51.330
since it gave me better results
and it was a lot quicker.

00:02:55.782 --> 00:02:57.640
After you're done finishing your edges,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.658
it's now time to take
your two pieces of fabric

00:03:00.658 --> 00:03:03.430
and lay them together, just
like how I have it here.

00:03:05.642 --> 00:03:09.449
The next step is to pick
up the two top layers

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:11.249
and fold them to the sides.

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:14.361
Now you should have the
back of the kimono shawl

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:17.101
facing you and what
you're going to do next

00:03:17.101 --> 00:03:19.923
is pin the right sides together.

00:03:27.347 --> 00:03:30.087
What you see here is
the inside of the shawl

00:03:30.087 --> 00:03:32.827
and then on the outside it will look

00:03:32.827 --> 00:03:34.926
something like this once it's finished.

00:03:36.463 --> 00:03:38.356
After you're done pinning, go ahead

00:03:38.356 --> 00:03:41.253
and sew the two seams together.

00:03:43.395 --> 00:03:47.179
Okay, so if you are
leaving the shawl top as is

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:50.302
without the cut out
sleeves, your next step

00:03:50.302 --> 00:03:54.562
should be measure from the
fold line down 18 inches

00:03:54.562 --> 00:03:57.348
and then just make a
marking with your pin.

00:03:57.348 --> 00:03:59.994
From the 18-inch mark,
what you're going to do

00:03:59.994 --> 00:04:04.034
is either glue or sew the
seam allowance together

00:04:04.034 --> 00:04:07.396
down to the hem which is
the bottom of the shawl.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.011
If you're going to be attempting to make

00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:15.644
the kimono-inspired
sleeves, then basically

00:04:15.644 --> 00:04:19.104
do all the same steps by
finishing the raw edges

00:04:19.104 --> 00:04:22.865
and right when you're ready
to sew in the sleeves,

00:04:22.865 --> 00:04:24.873
have the right sides facing together

00:04:24.873 --> 00:04:26.789
just like what I have here

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.395
and then sew along the
upside down L shape.

00:04:31.723 --> 00:04:34.289
After you sew in the sleeves
and the sides together,

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.611
you're basically going
to repeat the same steps

00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:40.570
that you did with the
other kimono shawl top.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.146
You're going to attach the center together

00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:45.388
with the right sides facing each other.

00:04:45.388 --> 00:04:48.313
Pin it and then sew along the back seam.

00:04:48.313 --> 00:04:50.287
Once you're done sewing,
turn this inside out,

00:04:50.287 --> 00:04:52.528
steam it, or iron it so that way

00:04:52.528 --> 00:04:54.083
all the wrinkles can be gone.

00:04:54.083 --> 00:04:55.824
And that is it, you can now wear

00:04:55.824 --> 00:04:58.470
your new shawl kimono top.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.946
I hope you guys enjoyed this video.

Thank you guys so much for watching

00:05:06.632 --> 00:05:09.181
