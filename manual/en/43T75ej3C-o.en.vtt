00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.250
One of the best elements of cruising, in our
opinion, is dressing up each evening, heading

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.670
to the main dining room, and enjoying the
pampering without having to wait for the check.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.310
We've discovered a few things that make our
Main Dining Room time more enjoyable:

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.310
First, scope out your table assignment:
If you've chosen assigned dining, When you

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.009
board, your dining room assignment will probably
be noted on your cruise documents or right on your

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.460
room card. If you're picky about where you
sit, and with whom dine, you (for example,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.150
if you're set to be seated with 10 others
and want to dine as a couple, or vice versa)

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.990
Then visit the maitre d in the main dining
room the afternoon you board to scope out

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.940
your table. Remember, if you're not happy
with your table assignment, the staff WILL

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.360
try to accommodate your request but a little
kindness is always the best approach. Obviously,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.159
if you've chosen a more relaxed dining sytle
(such as freestyle dining, or anytime dining),

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.260
this approach doesn't really apply.
Not sure what to order when you see so many

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.280
choices on the menu?
Ask your server for an appetizer portion of

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.560
an entrée, or order more than one entree
if you'd like. Most cruise lines main course

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.200
portions aren't that large, and you can feel
free to order anything you'd like in just

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.030
about any order. You can skip the entrée
all together, or order two desserts! We're

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.979
not encouraging you to be wasteful, just to
enjoy your cruise and take advantage of being

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.790
spoiled by your waitstaff.
Lastly, Don't hesitate to make special requests

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.000
within reason:
Cruise ship dining rooms accommodate thousands

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.840
of people every week, and we've found they
more well stocked than one might expect. For

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.860
example, we met a couple that requested a
side of artichoke hearts and olives with their

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.040
salads nightly. I love Tabasco and horseradish
with just about everything and our son loves

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.380
sliced cucumbers and carrots with his meals.
So -- ask for what you want, and generally

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.009
your waitstaff will remember your preferences
the entire cruise. We're not saying that they

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.950
will accommodate every request, but you may
be surprised.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.410
