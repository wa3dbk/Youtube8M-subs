00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.880
Hi! I'm Dr. Beth Kailes. Welcome to my office!

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.830
Our mission is to provide exceptional dental
care for infants, children, young adults &amp; patients

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.800
with special needs in a caring, warm and fun
environment. As soon as you walk through the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.539
door, kids know this a place just for them.

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.910
Our colorful and inviting office reflects
our growing healthy smiles theme with toys,

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.560
video games and movies in the reception area.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.439
Many people ask why they should choose a pediatric
specialist for their child. Pediatric dentists

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.240
are dentists just for kids! We have additional
years of training beyond dental school and

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.480
that gives us a more unique and thorough understanding
of children and their dental needs.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.100
Our caring, friendly team is highly trained
to be able to communicate with kids in a way

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.540
that they can understand.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.760
The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry
recommends that children have their first

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.090
visit to the dentist by age one or within
six months of getting their first tooth. We

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.120
call this the "Baby &amp; Me" visit

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.000
Specifically designed for the child under
the age of 2, this is a great opportunity

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.880
to introduce your child to dentistry in a
fun and positive way. An exam will be performed

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.579
to check your child's teeth for decay and
proper eruption and you will learn the best

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:18.670
ways to give your child's teeth a healthy
start in life.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.390
Are parents allowed to go back with their
children?

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.359
Yes, parents are always allowed in back! We
encourage parents to get involved by learning

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:31.619
about how their child can prevent decay with
proper home care and diet.

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.249
Are X-rays safe?

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:38.450
X-rays may be taken depending on your child's
age &amp; dental needs. We use digital x-rays

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.499
that reduce your child's exposure to radiation
by as much as 90%. Not only are they safer,

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:46.459
they are also better for the environment.

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:49.569
Why are primary teeth important?

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.520
Primary teeth are important for your child's
future dental health. Not only do they aid

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.899
in proper chewing and eating, but they also
guide the eruption of permanent teeth. If

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.450
a baby tooth is lost too soon, the permanent
tooth may not come in correctly. Your child's

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.329
general health can be affected if diseased
baby teeth are not treated.

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.260
If your child is cavity-free at their checkup,
they will become a member of our No Cavity

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.689
Club and be entered into a drawing for a special
prize.

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:20.330
If your child requires dental treatment, we
are able to complete most dental procedures

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.390
with local anesthesia. However, for the very
young or fearful child, nitrous oxide, oral

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.040
sedation and IV sedation are available treatment
options.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.150
If your child has a dental emergency, call
our office as soon as possible. We will make

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.680
every effort to see your child in a timely
manner. We also have a 24 hour emergency line

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.610
for after hours emergencies.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.739
We love to make each appointment special,
from picking out fun flavored toothpaste and

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.870
a cool toothbrush, to getting a sticker and
token for a job well done!

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.750

the street from Fleming Island High School,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.730
