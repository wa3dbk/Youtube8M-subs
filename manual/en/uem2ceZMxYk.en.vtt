00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.689
The world's population keeps growing.

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:15.689
By 2050, we'll have to
double our food production.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:22.010
For that, we'll need genetic engineering,
advanced pesticides, and fertilizer --

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.860
lots

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.000
of fertilizer.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.519
That's why at Agra Con, we're working
everyday

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:29.810
hand-in-hand with farmers and their families

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.770
and don't you wanna feed the world?

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.040
Messages like this one seem to be
popping up everywhere. But who's really behind them?

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.879
Turns out it's the corporations profiting
from this way of farming --

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.770
like those selling the pesticides,
fertilizers, and chemicals.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.850
They're spending billions to warn us
that their way is the only way,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.199
with industry groups like The Alliance
to Feed the Future, whose members include

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.140
the Association for Dressings and Sauces

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.130
and The National Frozen Pizza Institute.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.480
But ask farmers who really know how to feed
us and you'll get a very different story --

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.190
a heartbreaking AND hopeful story that
I've heard talking to hundreds of

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.250
families like this one.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.860
Fifty years of this myth -- and the lobbying  dollars to support it -- have tilted the playing field

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.200
to favor corporate-controlled
chemical agriculture,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.490
giving farmers little or no support for
any other path.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.330
So it's easy to understand a lot of
farmers feel it's either "get on board or get out."

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.380
"Getting on board" means farmers stop
practices that keep soil healthy

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.100
and go for single crops.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.550
Livestock that used to be raised on the
farm get crammed into polluting factories.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.900
To keep this unnatural system going, these
farmers now buy expensive inputs, all from

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.869
ever-fewer corporations, demanding ever-rising prices.

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.270
It's a quick addiction:

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.850
pests become resistant so you've got to
use more chemicals;

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.490
livestock become sicker so you've got
to use more drugs; soil loses its natural fertility

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.280
so you've got to use more chemical fertilizer.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.310
Then, on the other side, when farmers try
to sell their crops,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.909
they face only a few big buyers offering
unpredictable prices.

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.199
The economics don't work for long.

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:19.689
Over the last fifty years, millions of
desperate farmers have had to sign contracts

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:24.900
with corporations that dictate their every move or have lost their farms altogether.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.969
More and more, farm income is
concentrating at the top

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.189
so now only one in ten U.S. farms can support a family.

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.340
In many other countries, a similar thing
is happening. 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.749
Small farmers who buy into the promise
that corporate agriculture is the solution

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.109
often get trapped by debt and dependency.

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.669
So yes, corporate agriculture is good for
some folks --

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:48.749
including some of the largest growers --

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.120
but not the typical farm family.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.969
And that's strike one for this myth.

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:57.189
But we have to feed the world, right?

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.469
And if not this way, what choice do we
have?

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:01.739
A great one.

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.009
We just don't see ads for it and it
certainly isn't getting the subsidies

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:06.839
going to corporate ag.

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:11.169
State of the art sustainable farming ends this unnatural chemical addiction

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.909
It uses better practices not ever-more
expensive purchases.

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.649
Sustainable farmers build healthy soil
by planting a variety of crops and rotating them.

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:23.139
They raise their animals on the farm,
not in cramped factories.

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.969
They fertilize using compost and livestock or planting soil-nourishing crops.

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.390
Healthier plants with good crop rotation also help keep pest in check

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.359
without hurting the bugs we need--

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.919
like those all-important pollinators.

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.019
How does this choice impact everyone
else? Massively.

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.459
Industrial farms degrade and erode
precious topsoil --

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.669
64 tons per acre are being lost every year in some spots in our heartland.

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.109
They suck up huge amounts of water -- a lot of it from deep underground -- essentially irreplaceable.

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.719
And they also use millions of pounds of
antibiotics, a practice that leads to 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:59.689
dangerous new bacteria.

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.809
They also produce toxic run-off that pollutes our rivers, our oceans, and us.

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:09.669
The average American already has at least
13 pesticides in our bodies.

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.669
And thanks to chemicals in the field,
farmers and farm-workers have higher rates of many cancers. 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:19.479
So the sustainable farm is better for
farmers and the environment, but 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.130
can it really feed the world?

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.360
Study after study is saying yes!

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.819
Sustainable farms produce as well...and in drought years even better.

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:31.439
This is important news for small farmers
who already grow 70 percent of the world's food --

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.979
to increase production they don't have
to follow the chemical path.

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.739
And the future we're all talking about
feeding? The industrial farm requires more fossil fuels, 

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:41.949
water, 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.699
and mined minerals --

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.879
all stuff that will only get more
expensive as it runs out.

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:51.150
So down the line, the chemical path not
only can't work for farmers,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.800
it won't be a choice at all.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.610
Corporate agriculture doesn't reliably
grow more food in the future -- or even today.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.039
And that's strike two for this myth.

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.779
But we still haven't looked at the
biggest hole of all.

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:08.020
They say we need to double food
production or we'll go hungry. Really?

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.490
We already have almost 3,000
calories a day available

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.779
for every human being on Earth --

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:15.039
more than enough. 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.150
And that's after wasting a third of all food
grown,

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.159
and a lot of what is grown isn't food
we eat directly. A third of the world's

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.100
grain is going to livestock.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.720
In the U.S. our biggest crop is corn, but less than one percent of all corn planted

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.979
is what we eat. Most goes to fuel or feed.

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.409
So staying on this track,

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:34.909
we could increase production,

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:37.249
and still have more hunger.

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:41.559
To end it, everybody has to have the
power to buy or grow the food they need

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:45.719
and that's what sustainable farming is
all about.

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.249
Strike three for this dangerous myth.

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:52.300
So the next time someone who makes
frozen pizza -- or toxic pesticides --

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.690
tells you there's only one way to feed the future,

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.789
tell them their story is full of holes.

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.120
The evidence is clear:

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.799
sustainable farmers prove we all can
enjoy healthy food --

00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:06.379
and we each have power to make this
happen.

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:10.499
We can redirect our own food dollars and
the billions in public money now going

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:15.239
into the pockets of Big Ag. We can stand
up and speak out for sustainable farmers

00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:16.869
here and around the world.
