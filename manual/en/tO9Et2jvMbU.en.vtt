Hi, I'm Kevin, on behalf of Expert Village.com.
The next step we're going to do is sealing

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:14.150
the ball of clay that we just wedged up onto
the bat on the potters wheel. Now, here I

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:21.390
have four pieces of clay that I'm going to
throw. Now, I only need one bowl, (we're going

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.720
to do a bowl) but if I just do one bowl, sure
enough something's going to happen to it in

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.730
the kiln. It's going to crack, it's going
to touch something in the kiln - something's

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.270
going to happen to it - I know it, it's Murphy's
Law. So always, I like to throw more than

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.780
what I need. One important thing though, especially
in the summertime, is, I have my balls of

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.620
clay sitting out here - but I'm not going
to let them sit out. The important thing is

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.460
to keep them covered with plastic while you're
working on a piece on the potter's wheel.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.079
So what this does, this will keep moisture
in because it only takes a little bit of air

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:09.280
to put a (it's not so hard, you can still
poke it) kind of hard shell on your clay where

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.100
the inside is real moist. You'll be throwing
your pot, and you'll start hitting some hard

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.770
sections in there, and it really messes you
up. I wedged this out, I like to use the cone

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.349
shape because that's what we're going after
anyway. So, this step we're going to learn

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:32.099
how to seal your clay onto the bat that's
already on the wheel head. So I take the clay,

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:35.649
I try to get it in the center someplace, just
give it a wop down like that. Second thing

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:43.479
I do, wop it down like that. Now, the clay's
pretty sticky on this Formica, but sure enough

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.369
if I don't seal it, the clay's going to come
off as I'm putting pressure on it. So what

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.039
I do is I put my hands in the water, get the
clay wet a little bit, it's going to be really

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.101
slick, hold my hand on top - a little bit
of pressure, not a lot, but take one of my

00:01:58.101 --> 00:02:06.289
fingers from my other hand and just put pressure
down on the bat and in. This helps seal the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:15.769
clay on your bat so it doesn't come off - that's
a really important part. It's always important

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.690
to get the clay wet rather than put your hands
in the bucket and start throwing. It's nice

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:29.860
to grab a bunch of water, let it drip on your
clay, then put your hands on the clay. What

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.989
happens is if the clay's wet, your hands will
get wet - if your hands are wet, and then

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.390
the clay soaks it up - and then you put your
hands on there - I hope I'm making myself

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.151
clear. But it's always good, again, scoop
up the water, you're always putting water

00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:48.189
on your clay - that's the important part.
