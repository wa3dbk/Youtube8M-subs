00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:00.930
No.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.380
Oh, I'm sorry, did you want more of an
explanation? Well, okay.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.760
Hi it’s Emily from Bite Size Vegan and welcome
to another vegan nugget. If you ever have

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.279
an extended conversation about veganism, or
even one that's not so extended, there are

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:28.279
two topics that I guarantee you will be brought
up: bacon and Hitler. Although “Hitler bacon”

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.429
would be a new one. You see the argument goes
something like this, “well Hitler was vegetarian.”

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:38.399
And...well, not, that’s really it.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.019
I’m going to address the validity of this
argument after I first address its value.

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.829
Let’s say Hitler was a vegetarian, or a
even a vegan. So what? How about all of the

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.039
horrific people throughout history who were
not vegan or vegetarian? Does that mean that

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.699
everyone who consumes animal products is automatically
on the same level as the likes of Stalin,

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.899
Osama bin Laden, Jeffrey Dahmer, and countless
other animal-consuming sociopaths throughout

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.079
history? Including Hitler, by the way, as
we shall soon see. It’s simply not a valid

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:13.320
argument, or really an argument at all. So
lets get down to the facts, shall we?

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.390
Hitler was far from vegetarian, though there
are valid reasons why people believe he was.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.420
According to historian Robert Payne in his
text "The Life And Death Of Adolf Hitler,"

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.270
the myth of Hitler’s vegetarianism was more
or less a PR campaign orchestrated by Hitler’s

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.070
minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels. Payne
states that, “Hitler’s asceticism played

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.149
an important part in the image he projected
over Germany. According to the widely believed

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.710
legend, he neither smoke nor drank, nor did
he eat meat or have anything to do with women.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.039
Only the first was true…his asceticism was
fiction invented by Goebbels to emphasize

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.929
his total dedication, his self control, the
distance that separated him from other men.

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.759
By this outwards show of aestheticism, he
could claim that he was dedicated to the service

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.549
of his people.” While in reality, Payne
writes that Hitler was “remarkably self

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.479
indulgent and possessed none of the instincts
of the aesthetic.”

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.880
Beyond this PR campaign to portray Hitler
as a master of self-control, there is some

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.658
credence to him eschewing meat at some times.
In his mind-blowing text "Eternal Treblinka:

00:02:09.658 --> 00:02:13.560
Our Treatment Of Animals And The Holocaust,"
author Charles Patterson illuminates some

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.870
of Hitler’s rather unsightly medical conditions,
saying that Hitler “suffered from indigestion

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.040
and episodic stomach pains that had troubled
him from adolescence, as well as from excessive

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.299
flatulence and uncontrollable sweating…He
discovered that when he reduced his meat intake,

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.730
he did not sweat as much and there were fewer
stains in his underwear.” He apparently

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.140
also believed that increasing his vegetable
consumption improved the odors of his flatulence.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.290
I’m not making this sh*t up, people. See
the blog post in the description for all the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.840
citations and references.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.659
Regardless of his conditions, Hitler never
gave up the indulgence of his favorite meat

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:49.140
dishes, which, according to Dr. Fritz Redlich
in his text "Diagnosis Of A Destructive Prophet,"

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.819
were Bavarian sausages, liver dumplings, and
stuffed roasted game.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.019
Now not only was Hitler not a vegetarian himself,
but he was also vehemently against vegetarianism.

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.629
James Patterson writes that when Hitler “came
to power in 1933, he banned all the vegetarian

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.799
societies in Germany, arrested their leaders,
and shut down the main vegetarian magazine

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.989
published in Frankfurt…During the war Nazi
Germany banned all vegetarian organizations

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.040
in the territories it occupied, even though
vegetarian diets would have helped alleviate

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.420
wartime food shortages.”

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.260
Now a huge tenant of veganism, and I’m not
just talking a vegan diet here, but actual

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.849
veganism, is compassion towards animals. Hitler’s
treatment of animals was very much like his

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.900
treatment of humans: abrasive, abusive and
cruel. Hitler would often carry around a dog-whip

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.409
and viciously beat his dog in public. His
biographer Ian Kershaw writes that “with

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.400
his dogs, as with every human being, he came
into contact with, any relationship was based

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.390
upon subordination to his mastery.”

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.250
Hitler based his treatment of the Jews on
the assembly line slaughterhouses of the United

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.590
States. Hitler idolized Henry Ford, whose
own inspiration for his revolutionary assembly

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.480
line came from visiting a Chicago slaughterhouse
as a young man. Hitler essentially built his

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.409
own assembly line slaughterhouses, replacing
the animals with human beings. As Gary Yourofsky

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.480
says, if you walk into any slaughterhouse
today, remove the animals and replace them

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.069
with people, you've recreated Dachau and Auschwitz.

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.849
So as you can see, Hitler was as far from
a vegetarian as you can get. I hope this helps

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.390
clear up this persistent myth. For a full
list of citations and references for the information

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.700

blog post in the description below. Now share

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.790
this video around so we can keep busting this
myth, give it a thumbs up if you liked it,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.350
and if you’re new, I’d love to have you
as a subscriber. Now get out there, live vegan

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.250
and I’ll see you soon!
