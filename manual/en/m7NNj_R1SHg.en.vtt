00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.580
And so ended the first of many. I'm sure Miss
Croft would be the first to apologize for

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.540
her not entirely courteous behavior regarding some 
of the more delicate religious artifacts. Father Patrick?

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.890
No need, my friend, all in a good cause.
At least we knew they were in secure hands.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.349
And fortunately the Church was above sending
a bulletproof envoy to retrieve them.

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:31.800
Ah, but she recognized her place in the great
scheme. Some things, as history has illustrated,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.000
are best left to their slumber.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.840
I speak in riddles. I talk of the stricken
wolf ship.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.100
Ah, the U-boat episode. Miss Croft would
never enlighten me as to the details.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.330
For my own protection, she would often stress.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.330
Indeed, Winston, and for this you should be
grateful.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.630
Deep in the bowels of their vessels lay one
of the most powerful artifacts in all Christendom.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.180
An artifact which, when wielded at the vanguard
of an army, would make that army invincible.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.159
The Spear of Destiny.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.759
But the boat never reached the Fatherland
with it's precious cargo.

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:18.759
It disappeared from radar three weeks into
the journey.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.130
And so this was the resting place of the 52
seamen...

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.869
and also something much more sinister.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.580
The Zapadnaya Litsa port. Once the pride of the
Russian fleet.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.570
Ex-KGB the majority of them. Trained killers.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.090
Dealt with Mafioso before. Unpleasant memories.
Prefer to avoid them whenever possible.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.970
Yes, I would prefer this also.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.400
Hardly a major search party, is it? There's
something you're not telling me.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.000
Ah, yes.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.040
I'm a big girl now. Hit me with the bad news.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.000
It is bad news.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.340
The admiral's allegiance has been bought and 
under his command a nuclear submarine.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.340
It's housed in one of the dockyards.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.370
Well done. Nuclear submarine. Sounds nice.
Perfect holiday.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.570
Lara, wait. Take this tracking device.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.590
What's this? You're not worried about me.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.380
Yes. Somebody has to.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.380
Touching, but don't wait up.
