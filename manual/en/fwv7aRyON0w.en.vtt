00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.860
I just landed a huge deal for you

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.994
and then you tell me I'm going to take 5% less this year?

00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:10.160
You are replaceable.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.200
You say that kind of stuff a lot

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.020
and that's why Brian Peters wrote "You're a jackass" on your parking curb.

00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:15.914
What the hell, Dan?!

00:00:16.154 --> 00:00:17.594
That was one year ago.

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:19.500
The next day I started my own company.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.254
I only have two employees...

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:21.954
one's too old

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.300
and one's too young

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.094
I've never been on a business trip before!

00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:25.971
I'm pretty jacked!

00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:27.540
Can you NOT say your whole name today?

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.260
Because the client could lose focus.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.760
Hello!

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.440
I'm Mike Pancake.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.705
What was your last name?

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.420
Pancake?

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.300
Like breakfast?

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.100
It's Greek.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.893
It's delicious!

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.780
Yum!

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.263
The good news is we nailed a big deal and we're traveling to Germany to shake on it!

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:45.119
Hey, Dan.

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:46.463
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.700
This deal may not be done -

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.554
Dan, this is Chuck Portnoy who you know, don't you?

00:00:51.554 --> 00:00:53.584
Those pants are so tight - is that a crease?

00:00:53.584 --> 00:00:54.940
No, I don't have a crease, thank you.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.700
Slit?

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.200
No.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.772
There's space.

00:00:56.772 --> 00:00:57.400
There is no space.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.440
There's actually space.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.204
It's alarming.

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:02.553
You're telling me we're bankrupt?

00:01:02.553 --> 00:01:04.095
If we don't close this deal.

00:01:04.095 --> 00:01:06.313
We're the little guy taking on the big guy.

00:01:06.313 --> 00:01:08.674
You're going to go up against me and Dynamic Systems?

00:01:08.674 --> 00:01:09.499
We're going to be hard to beat.

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:12.069
The first rule is, show the client a good time.

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.640
Let's party!

00:01:15.463 --> 00:01:18.103
Snoop Lion, probably time to pass that.

00:01:18.103 --> 00:01:19.111
Just do it, throw it!

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.180
Ooohhhh!

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.355
What - what happened?

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.670
The second rule...

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.320
How you doin? I'm here for a meeting?

00:01:25.503 --> 00:01:27.343
Forget all the other rules.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.920
You okay, Dan?

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.644
I'm not crying, it's just poison in my eyes.

00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:47.034
If we close this deal

00:01:47.034 --> 00:01:50.336
I want to make love to a woman wheelbarrow position.

00:01:50.336 --> 00:01:51.475
How is it a wheelbarrow?

00:01:51.475 --> 00:01:53.534
One person's legs are being held up.

00:01:53.534 --> 00:01:54.634
Does that feel good?

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:55.448
No.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.700
Maybe we should just try to do it normal.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.440
Maybe put me down?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.695
When you get a chance?

00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:00.780
I'm losing confidence in the team.

00:02:03.183 --> 00:02:05.103
I'm next on the upgrade list!

00:02:05.254 --> 00:02:09.094
Sorry, I'd give you my seat, but I've never been upgraded.

00:02:09.094 --> 00:02:09.760
That's alright.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.440
But I appreciate you.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.281
It is an honor to sit in front of you.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.000
Please, I'd like you to have the seat.
