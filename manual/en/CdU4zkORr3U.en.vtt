00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.700
I'm going to show you how to decorate cupcakes
for a boy's birthday.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.020
I'm going to use different shades of blue.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.520
I'm going to color our white buttercream with
some blue food coloring.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.140
I put in one drop at time.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.320
A little bit goes a long way, and you can
always add more.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.220
I'm looking for a dark blue now.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.840
Just incorporate that really well.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:36.690
I think I'll add a few more drops.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.270
There, that's a really nice blue.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.040
Just keep mixing until you don't see any more
streaks of white.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:55.940
I'm going to put that into a pastry bag with
a small round tip.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.210
When you fill a pastry bag, you don't want
to go more than half way.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.500
I'm going to use the dark blue to write, so
we're not going to use that much.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.370
You're just going to put about half a cup
in there, squeeze it to the end, and make

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.470
sure you squeeze out a little bit before you
start writing so you don't have buttercream

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.220
exploding on your cupcake.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:22.960
Then I'm going to grab our light blue pastry
bag with the large round tip, and this is

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.300
going to be the base of our frosting.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.490
What I'm going to do is start in the center,
hover a little over the cupcake, and make

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.909
a nice round swirl.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.230
Now that we have our light blue in here, I'm
going to take our dark blue pastry bag.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.960
Let's say this is for a fourth birthday party,
so I'm going to write the number four really

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.440
big right in the center.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.030
Make sure your tip is hovering over the cupcake
so you get a nice straight line.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.090
Number four.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.299
And for another cupcake, we're going to take
our same light blue pastry bag and do the

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:11.020
same exact swirl.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.900
I'm going to use our blue sanding sugar.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.160
This is a really great color, it adds a really
great contrast to the light blue.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.750
Just sprinkle it right on top, as much as
you want.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.480
I like a lot of sprinkles.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.310
If you're making a dozen of them, you can
do six of these, six of these.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.920
If makes a really nice combination and a really
delicious birthday cupcake treat.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.730
That's how you make cupcakes for a boy's birthday.
