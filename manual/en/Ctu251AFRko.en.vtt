Hi guys, its Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay
Tutor, and today's Studio Tip, I'm gonna show

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.769
you how to organize Polymer Clay Cutters.

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.619
Now, you guys have been asking me to show
you some of the… how I organize some of

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.370
my tools and supplies and things so I thought
I would show you that today.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.860
Now, in this area here, I've got my paper
and some different drawers, and I've got my

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.230
cutters here, molds and rollers and textures,
and some other day, I'll show you those…what's

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.230
in those drawers.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.050
But I just wanted to show you quickly today
how I store my cutters…and I have a lot

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:46.079
of them, now in the drawer here, I have my…the
blade for my Simple Slicer, and then my Simple

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.520
Slicer is at the back there.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:58.170
And then I have my cutters set up in different
ways, here I have a box of the Amaco Beveled

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.500
Edge Cutters, and they just came in the box
so they fit quite nicely in here.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.710
Then I have some bags of cutters, I kept them
in bags because they're sets, these are some

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.670
old Studio by Sculpey Cutters that have these
little texture plates that went with them;

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.850
they don't sell those anymore.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:31.390
I've also got some smaller bags of the Amaco
Poly Cutters in the different sets, I don't

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.800
know if they sell these anymore, but they're
quite neat, they have some little flower cutters,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.200
leaf cutters, this one was a nice set of leaf
cutters, and you can see I've left them so

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.000
that they're all sitting flat and that way,
I can see each design really easily, and then

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.440
here's another set, the set number 4 with
some different shaped leaves, so they all

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.650
just sit right in there.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.750
But what is really handy is having these…oh,
here I'll get this out of the way first, I

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:11.770
have a set of the Snowflake cutters, but what's
really handy is how I've got these sets in

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.210
the tins, and they sit in the bottom of the
drawer, and I’ll lift one out so you can

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.580
see it better, these are the Makin's tins,
Makin's makes all kinds of clay and different

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.230
things and our Makin's Extruder, but they
also have sets of cutters in tins, this is

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.510
many more cutters than what was actually in
there originally, but because the cutters

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.490
are open and if you use…if you set them
inside each other of the similar shape, you

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.910
can usually get lots and lots nesting in together,
in fact, there's about 35 cutters in this

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.790
little tin here and I can see all of the shapes,
they're all there, and it's easy to grab one

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.670
from the bottom of the drawer, and just grab
one and then put it right back.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.310
I've got a few…a couple of tins, and you
can tell these are the Makin's ones ‘cause

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.400
they have the Green paper in the back of the
cutter, and then this was a little set of

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.190
number cutters, they fill up the whole thing
so I couldn't really fit anymore in.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:21.110
Another option besides the Makin's tins, are
these sorta Watch Case tins, now this one

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.300
I undid the hinge here on the back so that
I could take the lid off and slide it underneath,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:35.950
but often you can get these watch case tins
that have the little… there are little round

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.810
containers with glass lids on them, and they
all fit in there, but these work really well.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.690
You can probably find some sort of cookie
tin or that type of thing, but the low edge

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.160
tins are great ‘cause you can stack them
if you need to and you can get a lot of cutters

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.310
all nesting within each other.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.180
So I have about a hundred like I said or more
cutters in here, I can see them at a really

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:07.900
quick glance, I don't even have to move much
to see them all and I can put them away really

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.270
easily, and they're all back where they need
to go, and when you can see your tools, you'll

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.370
use them.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.400
