00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:01.867
The President:
Dorood.

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:04.700
As you and your families come
together to celebrate Nowruz,

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.400
I want to extend my best wishes
on this new spring and new year.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.000
Around the world, and
here in the United States,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.133
you are gathering at the Nowruz
table-to give thanks for loved

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.967
ones, reflect on your
blessings and welcome

00:00:17.967 --> 00:00:20.767
all the possibilities
of a new season.

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:22.600
As I have every
year as President,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.100
I want to take this opportunity
to speak directly to the people

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.000
and leaders of Iran.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.567
Since taking office, I have
offered the Iranian government

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:33.400
an opportunity-if it meets its
international obligations,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.600
then there could be a new
relationship between our two

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.367
countries, and Iran could begin
to return to its rightful place

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:41.967
among the community of nations.

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:44.533
I have had no illusions about
the difficulty of overcoming

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.667
decades of mistrust.

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:48.867
It will take a serious and
sustained effort to resolve

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:52.367
the many differences between
Iran and the United States.

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:55.100
This includes the world's
serious and growing concerns

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.066
about Iran's nuclear program,
which threatens peace and

00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:01.000
security in the
region and beyond.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.767
Iran's leaders say that their
nuclear program is for medical

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:06.066
research and electricity.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.934
To date, however, they have
been unable to convince the

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:11.700
international community that
their nuclear activities are

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.467
solely for peaceful purposes.

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:17.233
That's why the world is united
in its resolve to address this

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:19.834
issue and why Iran
is now so isolated.

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:24.467
The people of Iran have paid
a high and unnecessary price

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:26.767
because of your leaders'
unwillingness to address

00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:28.433
this issue.

00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:30.834
As I've said all along,
the United States prefers

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:34.367
to resolve this matter
peacefully, diplomatically.

00:01:34.367 --> 00:01:38.133
Indeed, if-as Iran's leaders
say-their nuclear program is

00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:40.834
for peaceful purposes,
then there is a basis

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:42.934
for a practical solution.

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:46.233
It's a solution that would give
Iran access to peaceful nuclear

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:49.633
energy while resolving once and
for all the serious questions

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:52.500
that the world has about the
true nature of the Iranian

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.500
nuclear program.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.266
The United States, alongside
the rest of the international

00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:00.834
community, is ready to
reach such a solution.

00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:04.233
Now is the time for the Iranian
government to take immediate and

00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:07.667
meaningful steps to reduce
tensions and work toward an

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:12.200
enduring, long-term settlement
of the nuclear issue.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.300
Finding a solution
will be no easy task.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.467
But if we can, the Iranian
people will begin to see the

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:21.333
benefits of greater trade
and ties with other nations,

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:23.533
including the United States.

00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:25.767
Whereas if the Iranian
government continues down

00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:29.800
its current path, it will
only further isolate Iran.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.834
This is the choice now
before Iran's leaders.

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:36.567
I hope they choose a better
path-for the sake of the Iranian

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:39.200
people and for the
sake of the world.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.700
Because there's no good reason
for Iranians to be denied the

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.900
opportunities enjoyed by
people in other countries,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.667
just as Iranians deserve the
same freedoms and rights as

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.567
people everywhere.

00:02:49.567 --> 00:02:52.200
Iran's isolation isn't
good for the world either.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.066
Just as your forbearers enriched
the arts and sciences throughout

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:57.900
history, all nations would
benefit from the talents and

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.900
creativity of the
Iranian people,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.200
especially your young people.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.900
Every day that you are cut
off from us is a day we're

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.567
not working together,
building together,

00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:11.433
innovating together-and building
a future of peace and prosperity

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:14.266
that is at the heart
of this holiday.

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:17.266
As you gather with family
and friends this Nowruz,

00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:20.667
many of you will turn to
the poet Hafez who wrote:

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:24.734
"Plant the tree of friendship that
bears the fruit of fulfillment;

00:03:24.734 --> 00:03:29.633
uproot the sapling of enmity
that bears endless suffering."

00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:33.333
As a new spring begins, I remain
hopeful that our two countries

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:35.066
can move beyond tension.

00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:38.200
And I will continue to work
toward a new day between our

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.700
nations that bears the fruit
of friendship and peace.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.834
Thank you, and
Eid-eh Shoma Mobarak.
