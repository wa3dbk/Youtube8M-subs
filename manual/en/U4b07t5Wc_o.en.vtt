Hello and welcome to Crouton Crackerjacks!

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.640
Today I'm going to show you how to make this
frozen peanut butter Butterfinger pie.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.380
This thing is so delicious, overly sweet and amazing.
And the best part about it, it is no bake.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.940
These are the ingredients you'll need...

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.330
so let's get started.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.620
I'm going to start off with a large bowl here
and I'm going to add in 24 Oreo cookies that

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.680
I have pulsed up in the food processor until
they are fine crumbs. If you get any large

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.740
pieces like that go ahead and take it out
and eat it. No one is going to miss it.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.040
And to that, I'm going to add in 1/2 a stick
of butter or margarine that I have melted.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.060
And using a spatula here I'm just going to
mix this together until all of those crumbs

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.710
are nicely moistened with that melted butter
or margarine.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.559
And then I'm going to take a 9 inch pie plate.
I just happen to be using a glass one here.

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.230
You could use, uh, metal or foil one as well.
That's perfectly fine.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.870
I'm just going to pour my crumb mixture in
there.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.880
And using my fingers, I'm going to work these
crumbs up the side of the pie plate

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.880
and get a nice even layer all the way around.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.880
And then I'm going to smooth out the bottom.

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.619
Make sure you get a nice, even layer of crumbs
throughout your entire crust so you don't

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.300
have any thin or thick spots or anything like that. 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.460
And once you get that done go ahead and put it into your freezer.

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:20.740
And while that is freezing, I'm going to take
some fun sized Butterfinger candy bars here.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.829
I've got, I think, 10 or 12, I don't remember
how many I used. Uh, I'm just going to take

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.740
a knife here and chop these up. 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.640
Now I put these candy bars into the refrigerator for

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.640
a good hour so they are nice and cold that
way they crumble up a lot better.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.220
And once I get all those chopped up, I'm going to put them into a bowl 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.700
and then we can start working on the filling for our pie

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:45.159
Now for the filling, I'm going to be using
my stand mixer here. You could also use a

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.810
large bowl with a hand beater or a whisk even.
I'm going to add in an 8oz block of softened

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.209
cream cheese. And to that I'm going to add
in half of a 14 ounce can of sweetened condensed

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:02.439
milk. Uh, it ends up being 7 ounces, I think,
don't quote me on this, but I think it's about

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.179
3/4 of a cup.

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.969
And to that I'm going to add in my creamy
peanut butter here. You can use whatever brand

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.390
is your favorite. You could also use crunchy
peanut butter if you wanted to.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.710
And then finally, I'm going to add in my powdered
sugar.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.940
Now I'm going to put the paddle attachment
on my mixer and I'm going to start this off

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.160
very slowly in spurts so that way my powdered
sugar doesn't go flying all over my kitchen.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.440
And I'm going to mix this until it is nice
and smooth.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.920
Now once that comes together, you want to
stop your mixer and you want to scrape down

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.200
your beater bar as well as your bowl and then
give it one final mix to make sure everything

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.480
is nice and incorporated and you don't have
any, you know, lumps of cream cheese or peanut

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.760
butter or whatever in there. You want it totally
mixed well.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.640
And then I went ahead and transferred that
to a large bowl. Uh, if you are making this

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.780
with a stand mixer, just go ahead and use
the bowl that uh, you mixed this in. Uh, for

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.230
video purposes, I changed out the bowls. And
then you want to add in an 8 ounce container

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.620
or carton of Cool-Whip. I'm using generic
here, uh, but you want to make sure it is

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.340
completely thawed. And to thaw it out just
leave it in the refrigerator overnight. And

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:14.320
using a spatula, you want to fold this Cool-Whip
or whipped topping, if you will, into your

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.790
peanut butter and cream cheese mixture. You
don't want to deflate this because then it'll

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.180
turn kind of runny and goopy on you and you
want to make sure it is mixed well but without

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.950
over mixing it.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.220
Now once you get that all folded in, you want
to take about 2/3rd's of your candy bars here

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.700
that you have chopped up and add that in.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.180
And gently fold those into that mixture.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.200
And then you want to pour all of that into
your cooled crust. Now it's not going to look

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.400
like it's going to fit. Trust me, it will
fit in there. Just kind of work it down and

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.680
spread it out and make sure it goes all the
way to the edges. And it will kind of mound

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.310
up a little bit, just use your spatula and
make it look nice and pretty on top.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.920
And then you want to take your remaining 1/3rd
of your chopped up candy bars, your Butterfingers

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.330
and put those right on top and then put this
into the freezer for preferably, overnight.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.600
Uh, if you cannot do overnight do at least
6 to 8 hours because you want this to freeze

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.199
firm and then you can go ahead and serve it
up. To cut this, take a large knife and run it

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:21.129
under hot water and then dry it off and that
way the metal will be hot and it'll just glide

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:23.639
right through that frozen pie.

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.590
And there you go. That is how I made frozen
peanut butter Butterfinger pie. I hope you

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.939
