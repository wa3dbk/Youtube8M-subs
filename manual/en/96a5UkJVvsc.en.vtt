00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.059
We're going to make a pair of jade drop earrings
and these are great just because they add

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.660
a little color to your outfits.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.349
You can wear this with an all black or you
can wear this with a sort of green top.

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:25.000
It will just pick up the green in your top
and a lot of people ask the question, "How

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.810
do you choose colors?"

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.599
My advice is to go into your closet, open
it and the first color that pops out, that's

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.890
your favorite color because intuitively, that's
what you buy all the time.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:48.420
You need a piece of wire and this piece of
wire is about 2 inches.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.800
I determined that because the bead goes onto
the center of the wire and I just want to

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.390
make sure I have enough room to wrap it.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm going to make the crimp to hold one side
then I'm going to make the crimp on the other

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:16.979
side and I'm going to make sure I do some
spacing as before on the side.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:27.100
With both ends, I'm going to make the loop
and bring them together.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:36.501
And then I'm 
going to wrap.

00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:47.460
One end is a little shorter, but I think I
have enough to secure the wrap.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.509
Now you see how it's all a little messed up,
your loop.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:02.369
You're just going to take around those pliers
and gently reshape the loop by just going

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:10.250
all the way around the loop to reshape your
loop.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.870
Then I'm just going to trim this tail.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.560
Make sure you have your safety goggles on
when you do that.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.620
The other tail here, I don't think I need
to trim that.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:35.340
I'm just going to close it a little bit more
with my pliers.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.910
I'm just going to reshape the loop.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:51.850
It's basically ready to put it on to your
ear wire then you're going to open the ear

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:52.850
wire loop.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.890
I have a little piece of wire that's sticking
out so I'm just going to fix that quickly.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:25.430
I'm going to close the ear wire and then I'm
just going to flatten all of this by using

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:36.480
a wooden against the metal will make it flat
without stressing the wire.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.629
That's it.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:49.260
Now, you have a finished earring.
