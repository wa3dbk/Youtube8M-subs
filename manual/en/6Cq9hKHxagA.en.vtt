00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:06.280
There is a phrase that appears in the Bible as "the times of the Gentiles":

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:23.269
This is the only time this phrase appears in scripture.

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.849
Because of this the only way to understand it from the context.

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:35.270
The context applicable to this subject starts in Luke 21:5 and ends in verse 24.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.290
Working backwards we should figure out who "they" of verse 24 are.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.740
Verse 21 says:

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.870
And verse 23 says:

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.000
Notice it says these people would fall by the sword.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.370
Keep that in mind as most modern day attackers use guns, and not swords.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.379
It says Jerusalem would be trodden down.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.640
Had Jesus previously spoken of Jerusalem?

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.860
Starting in verse 5 it refers to the temple located in Jerusalem:

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.210
Jesus then logically goes on to answer their questions.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.410
Remember their questions were:

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.710
When will the temple be thrown down?

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.840
And, what sign will there be when the temple is thrown down?

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.910
Continuing from verse 8:

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.639
First notice who Jesus said would hear of wars and commotions.

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:29.469
Jesus said "you", and when he said that he was talking to his disciples.

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:37.459
Specifically Peter, James, John, and Andrew as identified in the parallel account of Mark 13:3.

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.870
Then Jesus mentions "the end", but what end was he referring to?

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.749
Remember his disciples asked about the temple being thrown down, so Jesus is speaking of the end of the temple.

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:52.260
Continuing from verse 10:

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.719
After these disciples hear of the wars they will take place.

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.109
They would also experience various acts of nature.

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.379
How though did these take place?

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:27.219
Before the temple was thrown down the Jews had was civil war amongst themselves and commotions with the Roman authorities in Jerusalem.

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:31.939
First century historian Josephus has seven books that cover these events.

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:39.259
Just some of the nations and kingdoms that warred were the Jews, Romans, and Parthians.

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:48.000
Earthquakes, famines, and signs from heaven all occurred prior to the temple destruction and were recorded by first century historians.

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.209
Continuing from verse 12:

00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:32.949
Some of these disciples were to be killed prior to the destruction of the temple in 70 AD.

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.969
Was this actually the case?

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:41.319
Tradition tells us Peter, and both disciples named James died prior to 70 AD.

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:47.729
These men were put to death by the Jews and Romans which were the warring nations spoken of earlier.

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.610
Continuing from verse 17:

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.850
How does this verse make sense when the prior verse said how some would be put to death?

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.069
The key word there is "some".

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:15.680
The disciples who would not be put to death would be preserved from such physical harm.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:24.840
They would endure through persecution and would remain alive, or as the King James says "possess ye your souls".

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:32.879
Now in verses 20-21 Jesus begins to talk about Jerusalem where the temple was:

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:58.020
Notice here that Jesus uses the word desolation in regards to Jerusalem being surrounded with armies.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.360
Continuing in verse 22:

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.590
Im going to leave the context now only because this verse mentions "things which are written".

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.909
Is the destruction of this temple spoken of elsewhere in scripture?

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:39.330
Notice Daniel uses the phrase "the end" just like in Luke 21:9.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.509
Back in Luke 21:24 it mentions Gentiles trampling on Jerusalem.

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:49.000
Were Gentiles responsible for trampling down Jerusalem and it's temple?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.080
Yes, the Roman army was made up of Gentiles.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.559
Back in verse 22 Luke uses the phrase "the days of vengeance".

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:03.419
Who is bringing vengeance upon whom, and why?

00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:37.919
The times of the Gentiles began when the Roman army under emperor Titus surrounded Jerusalem.

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:42.409
The times ended when the Roman army knocked down Jerusalem's walls.

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:47.749
This is why both Daniel and Jesus used the phrase "the end".

00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:52.729
Some who would disagree with this teaching would jump to Revelation to explain this.

00:07:52.729 --> 00:08:00.259
Though the book of Revelation did not even exist until around 67 years after Jesus spoke these words.

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:13.000
Aside from the book of Daniel that Jesus specifically mentioned in Matthew and Mark's accounts, there in no need to jump out of context to understand the times of the Gentiles.
