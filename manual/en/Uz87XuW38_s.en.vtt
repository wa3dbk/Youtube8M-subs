00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.950
The key to all of this is the community, there
is no one thing that makes this make sense,

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:09.950
there is no

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.510
one thing that makes all of this work, its
everybody that is here, its everybody doing

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.510
something

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.099
and its not about thinking about things and
coming up with ideas, its about doing

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:25.070
and I always like to say, Edison didn't say
it was 99% inspiration and 1% persperation,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.320
its 1% inspiration

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.750
and a whole lot of hard work

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.340
&gt;&gt; I'm standing here at Maker Faire Detroit
at the Henry Ford, this is our 5th annual

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.690
Maker Faire where hundreds

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.120
of innovators and inventors and do it yourselfers
get together and share what they do, share

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.289
their knowledge and allow

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.019
our guests to put their hands on things and
invent with them

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:58.550
&gt;&gt; this couldn't be a better fit, not only
is Michigan the automotive hub of the world,

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.339
and this is a new type of vehicle,

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.300
but we're at the Henry Ford which is like
the house of vehicle invention and innovation

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.330
so when they told me it was at the Henry Ford
it just seemed like it was tailor fit for

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.820
the product, we're hoping to

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.820
leave on behind here

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:21.730
&gt;&gt; 
There's a big creative economy in Michigan

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.810
and as you know the history of Michigan is
a place where things are made

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.710
its all about hands on learning and immersive
and engaged opportunities and Maker Faire

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.810
is the perfect place for that to happen

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.670
&gt;&gt; I always said that the model T factory
was the first hacker space, because the model

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.280
T was designed to be, and the first car to

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.790
be designed in such a way that it could be
modified and added on, so you know that was

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.790
definitely a hacker space

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.560
and the village here, Greenfield Village is
a hacker village I mean, the metal shop, the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.990
tin shop, and the glass blowing and so on

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.290
its sort of sad that we think that making
is something that is new, when really its

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.570
something that is very old that we're getting
back in touch with

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:19.910
there is no better place in the country then
Michigan to be back in touch with this stuff,

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.610
because we've always been in touch with this
stuff

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.370
we're an industry-centric trade-oriented,
the amount of investment that we've made over

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.450
the decades in skilled trades means that we're
uniquely qualified

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.690
to be the place where a resurgence of industry
and trade should occur
