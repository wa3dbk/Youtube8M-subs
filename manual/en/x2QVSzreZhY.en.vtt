00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.240
Down on the reef, a fish trap has caught a handful of bony fishes

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.160
including a giant moray eel.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This is the largest of all morays.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.840
Despite their fearsome appearance,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.960
morays are not as dangerous to humans as they look,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.960
although larger morays can attack if provoked

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.360
and have been known to bite divers when being fed.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.560
The mouth contains sharp teeth for capturing and restraining prey.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.800
Once captured, a second set of jaws in the throat

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.360
is launched forward to grab the prey

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.120
and pull it down the moray's gullet.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.680
Anemone reef is home to several specimens of yellow-edged moray.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.360
Like many morays they feed on small reef fishes.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.320
Khao Lak's Boonsung tin miner wreck

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.200
has a particular concentration of honeycomb morays.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.800
This spotted moray at the Burma Banks is a close relative.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.880
Whitemouth morays are not at all common in the Andaman.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.600
This rare specimen was seen at Burma's Western Rocky Island.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.040
Another Myanmar speciality is the barredfin moray.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.600
When feeling threatened it adopts a very snake-like posture.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.560
Facial injuries are quite common amongst morays,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.800
and this palechin moray at High Rock bears the scars of past conflicts.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.800
The cartoon-like features of the greyface moray

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.040
are much more common throughout the area

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.320
and these eels are often found in pairs or small groups.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.720
This is a small and very energetic species

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.800
and when it attacks it moves quickly.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.520
Greyface morays don't just live with each other;

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.200
they often share their home with other species.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.800
In this case a fimbriated moray.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.720
And here we find a fimbriated moray with a snowflake moray.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.440
Whereas the previous species feed mainly on fishes,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.520
the snowflake moray feeds on shelled molluscs and crustaceans,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.880
so it's teeth are much more blunt.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.520
It's not difficult to see how the zebra moray got its name.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.800
This moray also feeds on crustaceans.
