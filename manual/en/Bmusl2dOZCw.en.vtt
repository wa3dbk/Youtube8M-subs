00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.740
let's sweetie i is a professor at
harvard issue with something really

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.730
strange way cheaper

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.719
will turn and she noticed that all of a
sudden and or these advertisements these

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:10.700
adsense

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.819
a google adsense advertisements

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:16.829
uh... for companies that can do
background checks to see if someone has

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:20.730
a criminal record now she thought that
that was strange because she thought

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.050
okay wire these advertisers assuming

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.590
but i have a criminal background

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.830
so she decided your own study to
basically see

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.270
whether or not white names have the same
results when it comes to the

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.690
advertisements and on if most black
names or you know traditionally black

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.110
names have the hot distant same result
that she had been she google turning

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.260
well she found out that uh...

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.610
white man's odds are black means our
twenty five percent more likely to get

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.980
that type of ad sweeney has evidence
that black identify names at two twenty

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.320
five percent more likely

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.750
to be served with an arrests related
that there is discrimination in delivery

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.480
of these ads is what she said

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.319
that's

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:01.430
super interesting

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.290
you know we talk often about

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.320
all the different disadvantages that
wineries have in this country

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.960
to interviews all yeah you know you up
to bring that up but

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.720
is approaching and which is to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.260
they should be addressed them and get
beyond that means that is really call

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.000
yet

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.770
don't feel even the president tree
university

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.890
progresses can argue with me about that
it's uh... so that's not for some

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.820
political goal this issue and what's
happening in the country

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.530
so that you know you you make informed
decisions and to look at that domain

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.409
you know we talked about in the case of
foreclosures and

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.309
loans and all the different in the get
charged more minority student targeted

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:41.610
more of by at bankers in the court will
get a loan to set up

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.860
now in use for starters of of
actividades

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.070
you're more likely to come up with ads
for

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.170
criminal related things it's just it's
madly yasir it's not a conspiracy to cut

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.910
you know i did

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.190
has contradicts that said hey don't like
to know if there are a lesser every look

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.300
tiny eventually put him out for
promoting their now that's not how it

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.829
works and d

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.759
these ads are based on what people click
for what people are more likely to click

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.309
four

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.949
when they're making searches so at one
time you guys are more detail into how

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.250
she did the study because i think that's
important

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.770
so sleepy gathered this evidence by
clicking over two thousand names

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.510
that was suggested sha suggestive of a
race

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.040
for example for same such as trade
bombing kisha and are now

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.949
uh... suggest owner is black

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:32.639
while names like lori brendan and today
suggest the owner's wife sweeney entered

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.279
these

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:37.659
plus surnames into google dot com in
reuters dot com in examine the ads

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:38.759
they've returned

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:42.409
most seems gathered as for public
records however black identify names

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.189
turned out to be much more likely than
white identify names to generate janet

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:47.719
generate ads

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.590
food the word arrests

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.430
okay now after this happened of course
people were contacting google to get

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.430
their response and they wanted to know
why this is happening is that really

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.860
their algorithm does it have something
you do a google adsense

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.700
and here's what their response was

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.970
adwords does not conduct any racial
profiling

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.849
we also have an anti and violence policy
out which states

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.499
that we will not allow ads an advocate
against

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:14.790
an organization person or group of
people

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.000
it is up to the individual advertisers
to decide which keywords they wanted to

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.349
use to trigger these acts

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.619
so that indicates that the advertisers
are choosing

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:28.959
black names to put their add something
about arrests and criminal records

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:29.999
etcetera

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:32.060
uh... they think it's going to work
better

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.899
but look at this sumptuous outlook you
know

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.789
i'd love to see their data to see what
they come up with

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:40.699
and i'm not prejudging that even okay

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.329
what is the real world the fact that
these kind of assumptions as they're

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.509
effects

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.809
trevor on mon as an example you chuck
now what no matter what you think about

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:49.100
the third place

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.520
what happens axis

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.919
for the black guy or seventeen-year-old

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.439
lying dead on the floor

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:55.519
they don't check

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.389
uh... i mean did you check his criminal
record even though he's dead the guy who

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.489
shot him dead dot was shot dead in by
the davis criminal record an outright

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.100
because what what's the assumption black
equals arrest criminal record

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.939
non-black does not equal that

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.119
and hence

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:14.169
we get what happened as an example in
the travel market so let me ask an

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.159
extremely inappropriate question 'cause
i'm curious to see what you think and as

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.389
i know people in the senate has been
wondering

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.919
if you know that you have these
disadvantages by naming your child

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.149
something that's considered a
traditionally black name

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:28.229
said you were afraid

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.389
from doing so but no i thought that's
absurd request was processed it right

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.580
and i'm not advocating for that i'm just
curious what everyone thinks because by

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.310
active i would not position for instance
if i knew

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.210
okay armenian sounding name will have a
disadvantage when it comes to the job

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.379
market right job for so whatever

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.199
uh... that i'm not i'm in a my daughter
laurie

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.340
or like t_v_ or whatever it is great

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.020
well look so this is something that
uh... camera system tribune dealing with

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.800
for a long long time and so for example
asian immigrants

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.509
i decided to throw that out some coin
you're crazy none of my kids ministry

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.709
yeah particularly steve those really
simple

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:11.979
predicts that your song restrict but
mighty you present enough for us to

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.619
richard just blue

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:16.320
appropriate for a good luck ten days

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.860
in in with the so-called americanized
way do you pronounce it is kind of

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.030
putting you in a disadvantage right

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.170
sure of corporate saying would you be
interested to set this mistake medically

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.460
there but uh... i don't regret it at all

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.270
but if you or your naked about your
career right

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.899
hardware like about it

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:36.929
i meant yes

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:38.370
i would certainly thing about it

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.780
and i would be reluctant

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.620
to me

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.340
my kid anything kidding us your specific
question after their name

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.780
another animated for media so idon't
know which records

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.620
forget the affect of abilities in terms
of

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.259
basement okay

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.009
perhaps you should answer

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:56.939
uh... among the do what you like

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:58.329
uh... sunday

00:05:58.329 --> 00:05:59.750
when people said not to

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.229
fifties is one of those consistent onset

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:07.289
an insult to actually finances community
about gennifer in our fifty

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:08.220
so you know

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.610
so is

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.789
i'm among one of having to

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.629
macdonald's moving with the hollywood
with the kids name

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:17.360
but then on the same time if someone or
if they make it

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.599
blacks on the name

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:22.539
and i have no problem that either but
there's no if you do you use all you

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.360
know what society we live in

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.799
you take is with the uh... facing so
they can be prepared

00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:31.349
to counteract that which is only works
in the region considered when you were

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.649
naming my

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:35.039
what i'd start another friend of

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:37.479
the court blacks on the names

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:39.469
but um... ollie north those would be

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:42.370
but i'm not going money but i think it's
this all seem

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.979
more for like women than than boys you
know

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:48.710
yet but i thought it was like we should
engage in wrestles with with girls made

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.120
more than boys names with the was black
some unethical in public we should

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.319
enough

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.209
it issued an old after acronyms like

00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:58.830
you know the most air time on frontline
right

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.469
uh... but that's not the problem of
liquid randomly that so there is a

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:07.069
really yahoo is a tremendous are needed
from a couple that the other detective

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:10.640
but now it is the third thing because
you know but i don't believe in

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.639
and trying to mel

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:15.199
and i'm not going to go for the hard
work sell enough but i don't believe

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.319
that i haven't tried changes you want to
be if you really feel you and they make

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:19.749
it whatever you want to

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:23.489
for that sake you just have to prepare
them mentally for work

00:07:23.489 --> 00:07:24.949
didn't have to do it

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:28.370
right for example he did indicate duane
and they could be pretty successful in

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.580
evening weekend low brockman

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.110
because of the commute any success
