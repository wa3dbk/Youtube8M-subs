[Opening jingle]

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Assalaamu Alaikum and welcome to Titli's Cheesecake Kitchen with me Titli Nihaan.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Bananas! Caramel! Cheesecake! What a fabulous combination!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.500
To make the base for my cheesecake, I've got 75 grams of melted butter

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.000
and a 180 grams of biscuits. These are Digestive biscuits but you could use something like Graham Crackers too.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.000
Put the biscuits into a bag.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now I need to crush these biscuits.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.000
Hmm... Excellent!

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Nice and warm too!

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.270
Put your finely crushed biscuits into a bowl.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.000
Add in the melted butter and mix.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.000
Spoon the mixture into an 8-inch greased cake tin with a pop-up bottom

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
or a springform tin.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Spread the mixture around, evenly.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.500
Press it down firmly

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.000
and smooth it off with the back of a spoon.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.500
Put this in the fridge for 30 minutes to chill.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.000
For the caramel, I've got a 125 grams of brown sugar.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.200
125 grams of butter.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.000
400 gram-tin of condensed milk.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.000
Melt the butter in a pan.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.000
Once the butter is melted and with the heat still on,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
add in the sugar and stir.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.000
Keep stirring and heating.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
When the mixture starts to foam like this, add in the condensed milk

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.000
Keep stirring and heating for about 5 minutes

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.500
After about 5 minutes, your caramel should go nice and thick.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.000
Now turn off the heat and leave to cool for about 10 minutes.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.000
When the caramel has cooled a little, pour it onto the cheesecake base.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Just keep a little bit back to decorate the top of the cheesecake.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.000
Spread the caramel evenly over the base.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Now pop this back in the fridge to set.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.500
For the rest of the cheesecake, I've got 450 grams of cream cheese. It could be mascarpone, it could be Philadelphia.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.000
300 grams of mashed banana. Ripe banana.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.000
I know what you're gonna ask. That's about 3 bananas worth.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.920
250 grams thick cream.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.000
Doesn't matter what type it is as long
as it's thick and a tablespoon of lemon juice.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.500
Put the cream cheese and the lemon
juice in a bowl

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.670
and give it a quick whisk.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.500
After 30 seconds, add in the banana purÃ©e

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.310
and give it a quick whisk.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.500
Add in the thick cream and mix well

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.030
and before anybody asks...

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.000
No, you don't need gelatine and no, you don't need extra sugar!

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Hmm... Lovely!

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.500
Once the caramel is set, you can spoon the mixture on top.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.000
Of course, if you just wanted to make a simple banana cheesecake,

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.000
you can leave the caramel out.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Spread the mixture evenly around.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Pop this in the fridge for a few hours to set.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.700
Once the cheesecake is set,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.000
we can remove it from its tin

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.000
and carefully slide it onto a plate.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.400
Take another banana and cut it into thin slices.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.000
Add all the juice of the lemon, minus the little bit that you've already used

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and just toss the pieces of banana in the lemon juice.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
This will help stop them going brown.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Put your bits of banana on top of the cheesecake.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Then take your leftover caramel and either heat it in a pan to melt it or I'm gonna pop mine in the microwave.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Then use a whisk or a spoon to dribble caramel across the top of the cheesecake.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.000
Ooh... Hm... Nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom!

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.500
Well. That was pretty easy, wasn't it? Next time in my Cheesecake Kitchen, I'll be showing you how to make my delicious

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.000
Spam and Spaghetti Cheesecake!

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Join me next time in Titli's Cheesecake Kitchen with me Titli Nihaan.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.500
Until next time... Khuda hafiz.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:53.000
