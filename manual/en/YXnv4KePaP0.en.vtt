00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.760
Hello on behalf of Expert Village I'm Kelly
Anne and I will be demonstrating beginning

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.500
jazz dancing for you. This is my friend and
partner Darryl; he will be assisting. The

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:25.199
last part, feet. The feet in parallel we have
releve and down. Releva and down. You are

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.710
just rising on to the balls of the feet. For
balance, squeeze the abs, squeeze the inner

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.910
thighs, squeeze your glutes, and then you
have control. Now, the longer you could hold

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.720
them balance that is however many turns you
are going to be able to do. So it is important

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:55.690
to develop a strong releve. Position of the
feet are first, turned out first, parallel.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:04.891
Hips with second, second turn out. Wide second,
wide second turn out. You want to be there.

00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:14.890
Third is use for modeling. Third heel toe
and step. Fourth is one foot in front of the

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.540
other. You can bend and straight. You weight
could be shifting on one foot, back foot,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.460
or both. Again, forth on the left is weight
equally disturbed, weight on the front, weight

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.890
on the back, or even turned out. Forth position.
Fifth position, like in ballet is heel to

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.549
toe. There is really not so much about the
feet it is squeezing and crossing of the upper

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.620
thighs. So you could pass a piece of paper
between that is fifth. Don't push it everybody

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.360
wants to get to here but you could injure
your body if you force that. That is why I

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.780
prefer third. Third is much more practical
and versatile. Fifth could be somewhere like

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.310
this cross. I hope you enjoyed it and thank
you for watching. I'm Kelly Anne of 56dance.com

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.569
with my friend Darryl. Special thank you to
Expert Village and the Goddess Store for letting

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.400
us use the studio.
