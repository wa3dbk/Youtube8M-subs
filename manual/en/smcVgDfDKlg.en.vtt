[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.810
Why is "Bioshock"
considered one

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.670
of the best games of all time?

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.960
Would it be cheating to say
that "Bioshock" owed its success

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.690
to a combination of factors,
because it definitely

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:18.980
had a lot going on.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.630
For one, there's the strong
philosophical component.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.090
Andrew Ryan's philosophy,
as well as his name,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.580
is based on Ayn Rand's
idea of objectivism,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.330
as obvious as that may be.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.340
"Bioshock" also marked
a big step forward

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.710
in graphics processing.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.780
Just look at the water
in its opening sequence.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.410
Still totally holds up.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.470
Then there's the audio,
which, I don't know.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.220
Just listen to it.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:42.490
See?

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.540
It's creepy.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.060
But I think "Bioshock" owes its
success to one specific reason,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.880
the setting.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.630
"Bioshock" was one
of the first games

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.690
to do environmental
storytelling well.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.360
The setting is a real
character in the game,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.560
in Bioshock 1 and 2,
much of the suspense

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.950
stems from the question of how
the Art Deco world of Rapture

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.570
came to be the ruins
it is when you arrive.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.850
It's impossible not to wonder
how it got to be this way.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.570
But puzzling settings
are just that, puzzles.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.340
So how does the
setting of "Bioshock"

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.347
actually make it the
great game that it is?

00:01:12.347 --> 00:01:13.930
Here's the thing
about a good setting.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.550
You know it's nice
when you never

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.650
have to think about why
it works, it just does.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.530
In video games, that feeling has
a lot to do with level design.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.810
Level design sets the
rules for how you move

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.090
through a video game space.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.630
It gives you both
purpose and constraints.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.380
We often talk about
game mechanics, things

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.010
like jumping,
shooting, or running,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.690
but level design is what
keeps you from just wandering

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.600
aimlessly about.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.040
When it works well,
it's in the background.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.260
It's wrapped in more
visible forms of art.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.270
For example, level design is
placing an object in your path

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.766
so that you can't move forward.

00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:45.140
But the art
direction of the game

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.950
dictates what that roadblock is.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.300
Is it a simple rock, like
in "Red Dead Redemption,"

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.810
or is it something more
ominous, like a downed dragon

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.060
in "Dark Souls"?

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.350
But in Bioshock 1
and 2, that roadblock

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.260
is likely to be in a particular
architectural style, Art Deco.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.460
Art deco is an art
movement from the 1930s

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.510
that tried to translate the
logic of machines into art.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.330
It focuses strongly vertical
lines and geometric shapes.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.729
Everything has a
machine-made quality.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.020
Its design is also aggressively
symmetrical, giving it

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.470
this inorganic quality, as
perfect symmetry does not

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.540
exist in nature.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.290
You can probably tell that this
wasn't exactly the most subtle

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.490
of artistic ideas.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.590
Art Deco often
purposely stood out,

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.920
using hyper-contrasting
colors to highlight

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.390
architectural details.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.240
So in case the geometric forms
weren't clear enough for you,

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.080
you add the colors.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.600
This is what the future
was supposed to look like,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.430
which, if you can't tell
already, didn't exactly happen.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.727
But you could still see Art
Deco all over the world,

00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:41.310
and especially right
here in New York,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.851
with places like
the Waldorf Astoria,

00:02:42.851 --> 00:02:45.140
the Chrysler Building,
the Empire State Building,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.760
or if you're willing to go
a little bit further afield,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.330
Rapture.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.000
But Rapture's Art Deco
architecture isn't just a skin

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.730
wrapping Bioshock's
level design.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.480
What makes "Bioshock" great
is that its visual design

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.800
and level design
work hand in hand.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.740
"Bioshock" utilizes the
signature features of Art Deco

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.530
to make the function
of its level design

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.390
more explicit to the player.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.580
And not only this, but
Art Deco quite nearly

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.570
tells you what you're doing
and who you are in "Bioshock."

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.670
This is no mere
aesthetic choice.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.330
The "Bioshock" Art
Deco is everything.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.820
It starts from the
very beginning.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.930
You only get a brief view
of Rapture's exterior

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.870
as you descend in
the Bathysphere.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.560
The towers have vertical
ridges and geometric patterns

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.720
pointing upwards.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.750
This means, from the very start,
the architecture in "Bioshock"

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.160
is guiding your eye.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.460
Everything is vertical,
and you're sinking.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.345
You know to spend the rest
of the game looking up.

00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:36.970
That's good to know, because the
first splicers that Jack meets

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.410
are spider slicers.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.830
They descend from the rafters.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.740
The vertical lines
are a warning.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.540
Or consider Rapture's
proving grounds.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.790
Take me to the angels
dancing in the sky,

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.200
the little sisters keep saying.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.450
And that's what Art Deco helps
the game's architecture do.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.790
All the columns have a
number of sharp edges,

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.230
creating verticality.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.650
Sunburst patterns
remind you of the sky.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.040
Everything points up.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.390
And all these Art Deco touches
are also Level Design 101.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.580
As Tito Pagan puts
it, in a game level,

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.530
a certain repetitive
motif, pattern, or texture

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.690
could help guide the player
through the experience

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.494
of movement.

00:04:10.494 --> 00:04:12.660
Moving or nudging the player
through the exploration

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.340
experience is one of the
most basic yet important

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.480
responsibilities that a
level design has to satisfy.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.279
But here's a twist.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.530
These game design ideas are also
Rapture founder Andrew Ryan's

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.030
ideas.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.900
He even says--

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.870
A man chooses a slave obeys.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.530
You're quite literally
obeying the environment.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.370
Would you kindly consider
Bioshock's twist as well?

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.870
It turns out, Jack's been
overestimating his agency

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.820
all along.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.880
He's basically living in a
machine that controls him.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.190
So it all comes full circle.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.560
Art Deco's vertical lines
and geometric shapes

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.040
make you obey the game's
logic until you find out

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.340
what's been going on all along.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.320
But that's not the
only Art Deco idea

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.180
"Bioshock" uses to
complement its level design.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.580
It also uses strong color
contrast in much the same way

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.290
as it uses vertical lines.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.310
Take the electric blue
of the Vita-Chambers.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.100
This color is completely out
of place in the decaying,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.610
gray environment of Rapture.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.540
That's how you know
they're important.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.000
Or consider a passage near
the end of "Bioshock 2," where

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.420
you play as a little sister.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.730
Suddenly, the colors change.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.000
Everything is vibrant.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.300
And like the vertical
lines, this use of color

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.020
is a really simple
level design concept.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.000
In his book on the
architecture of levels,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.090
Christopher Totten
notes color contrast

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.090
is an important factor in
leading players through a game

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.590
environment.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.280
How else would you find these
shimmering audio diaries

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.159
if they were gray,
like everything else?

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:33.825
But while many games
use this technique,

00:05:33.825 --> 00:05:36.686
the difference in "Bioshock" is
that it relates to an Art Deco

00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:37.185
principle.

00:05:37.185 --> 00:05:39.880
The Vita-Chamber is
a magnificent blue.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.910
But what really matters is that
the blue light it's casting

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.200
is illuminating the tall,
geometric rafters above it.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.930
The Vita-Chamber
anchors your eyes,

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.880
but the Art Deco architecture
then pulls you up.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.480
That's the beauty of "Bioshock."

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.080
Every level design idea is also
an architectural detail that

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.700
relates to the game setting.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.400
Art Deco isn't just
incidental to what "Bioshock"

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.590
was trying to accomplish.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.400
It's at the very core
of how the game works.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.040
In fact, I'd go so far as
to argue that Art Deco was

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.999
the only choice for "Bioshock."

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:10.790
Change the architectural
style of the game,

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.350
and it all falls apart.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.690
"Bioshock" changed a lot over
it initial development, as well.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.210
Little sisters used to
look way more demonic,

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.840
and enemies overall were
shifted in both style and tone.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.970
But even looking back at some
of those initial sketches,

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.160
the Art Deco world was
there from the beginning

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.562
and remained through the end.

00:06:28.562 --> 00:06:30.520
There are lots of games
with good level design,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.940
and there are lots of games
with interesting architecture.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.600
But "Bioshock" stands alone
in that both of these things

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.670
are the same, and that's what
makes "Bioshock" so special.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.160
Its setting does so much work
for the game and the player,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.950
but it's so harmonious
that it never

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.165
calls attention to itself.

00:06:45.165 --> 00:06:46.040
So what do you think?

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.070
Did you pick up on the interplay
between architecture and level

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.000
design in "Bioshock," or
did it not really thrill

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.110
you all that much?

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.526
