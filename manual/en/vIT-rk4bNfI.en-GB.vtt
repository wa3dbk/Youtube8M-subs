00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:10.996
from the latest manager at the lane.

00:00:14.187 --> 00:00:17.187
My name is Dim Tim and I manage the Spurs.

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:22.079
I love the Tottenham though I was a Gooner for years.

00:00:22.195 --> 00:00:26.195
God know how I got this job - you'll have to ask Levy.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.188
I think he fancies me (who can blame him really?).

00:00:30.188 --> 00:00:32.188
Glory, glory, Arse-

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.993
You mean Tottenham!

00:00:32.993 --> 00:00:35.813
I mean Tottenham. Glory, glory, Arse-

00:00:35.813 --> 00:00:36.780
You mean Tottenham!

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.253
I mean Tottenham. Glory, glory Arse-f*in Tottenham!

00:00:41.253 --> 00:00:42.984
And the Spurs...

00:00:42.984 --> 00:00:47.955
I've made a terrible mistake. Get him out. Get him out!

00:00:51.742 --> 00:00:57.410
You are my gilet, my only gilet.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.337
You make me happy, when scores are grey.

00:01:03.337 --> 00:01:09.474
But when I'm angry (just for the cameras)...

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:14.382
I'll go and throw my gilet away.

00:01:14.382 --> 00:01:17.025
Oh, look how angry I am!

00:01:17.707 --> 00:01:21.360
He's thrown he's gillet! Get him out! Get him out!

00:01:23.102 --> 00:01:32.205
Oh when my Spurs go on the pitch!

00:01:32.205 --> 00:01:41.306
I'm gonna be in the stands...oh, when my Spurs go on the pitch!

00:01:41.306 --> 00:01:46.590
Oh no, this is so embarrassing. Get him out! Get him out!

00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:54.189
Salute if you love Tottenham...

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:00.387
Salute if you love Arsenal...Tottenham, Gooners, Spurs!

00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:03.340
Oh, who do I support again?!

00:02:03.341 --> 00:02:04.870
You're fired!

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
