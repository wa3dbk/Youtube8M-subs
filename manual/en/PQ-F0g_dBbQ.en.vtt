00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:07.490
Alright now let's talk a little about how
to tune a guitar. There are several way to

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.000
go about tuning your guitar. First of all
you would need a reference pitch to get your

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.740
first string in to tune, and you are going
to use that string to as a reference point

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.020
to enable yourself to tune the rest of the
strings. So you'll want to get that from a

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:36.420
pitch pipe or you'll want to have some tuners
a lot of times will have it, if you get a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:46.800
tuner and you get one with a pitch comes with
an A, this gives you an A. Something like

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.829
that will do the trick. You're going to count
up five frets on your low E string. One, two,

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:04.019
three, four, five, and this is normally marked
by a dot or some kind of an inlay which will

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.050
be your second inlay on your or most guitars
as you see theres on here on the third fret?

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:25.610
and the fifth. And you play your note. Now
you are going to strike that note. You want

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:34.160
to listen to it, and you want to understand
the pitch is clear and what the pitch of that

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.540
note is. And then you are going to play your
A string along the side of it, and you'll

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:49.150
notice that that is quite a bit lower. Here's
the pitch we need, here's the pitch we hear.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:56.230
so we can bring it up until we hear it sounding
similar. Now you want to repeat the process

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:04.890
on the A string. One, two, three, four, five.
There's the pitch we need for the D string.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:25.569
Hear it's also a little flat. So we chum it
up and see if it matches. That's pretty good.

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.129
And go ahead and continue up the D string
one, two, three, four, five and now we'll

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:37.920
have a G. This is what our G string should
sound like. That's not good at all, it needs

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:47.959
to come way up. Also when you're doing this
you'll notice that when the tones are out

00:02:47.959 --> 00:03:09.349
of pitch with each other you'll hear a wavering
type of a sound. Notice that wavering sound.

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.469
And that's another thing you listen to when
you're tuning your guitar. So let's go ahead,

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:19.569
the G string is in fairly good tune. Now,
when you get to the G string, the first four

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:33.629
strings, E, A, D, and G are all tune to the
fifth fret. Now, when you get to the G string,

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:41.779
which is the third string from the floor,
you'll now switch to the fourth fret, and

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:51.180
this is the only time you'll do this on this
third string from the floor. You will go up

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.870
one, two, three, four frets and this is your
reference tone for your next string which

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:07.719
is the B.
Once the B strings in tune, you revert back

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:14.109
to the way you had been doing it previously,
which is the fifth fret, one, two, three,

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:27.310
four, five and you'll have your E note.
And you'll bring that up in tune with that.
