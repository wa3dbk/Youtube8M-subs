00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.409
Welcome to Revelation Unraveled.

00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:05.779
On this program I want to talk about

00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:08.238
where the Antichrist comes from,

00:00:08.273 --> 00:00:11.093
because I believe the Bible states very clearly

00:00:11.128 --> 00:00:15.382
that he will come from the city of Istanbul, Turkey.

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:18.889
As you know, the Bible predicted very clearly,

00:00:18.924 --> 00:00:21.416
that Jesus Christ would be born

00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:23.268
in the city of Bethlehem.

00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:25.160
So, we should not be surprised

00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:27.437
that the Bible also reveals

00:00:27.472 --> 00:00:29.756
where the Antichrist will come from.

00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:31.844
Most Bible scholars agree,

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.031
that in chapter number 7,

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:37.011
the great Old Testament prophet Daniel,

00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:39.286
reveals that the Antichrist

00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:42.201
will come from the revived Roman Empire.

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:44.718
But I believe in chapter number 8,

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:48.651
Daniel pinpoints this location much more exactly.

00:00:48.686 --> 00:00:51.308
Let's see what the prophet says

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:55.486
in chapter 8, verse number 8. And Daniel writes:

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:59.026
"and the he-goat became exceedingly great

00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:02.545
and when he was grown, the great horn was broken

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.087
and there came up four horns in its place

00:01:06.122 --> 00:01:09.436
toward the four winds of heaven"

00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:13.059
In the near time fulfillment of this prophecy,

00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:15.712
the he-goat is Alexander the Great,

00:01:15.747 --> 00:01:18.046
and the two horns on the ram,

00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:20.552
which he defeats, are Medo-Persia.

00:01:20.587 --> 00:01:22.893
But in the End Times,

00:01:22.928 --> 00:01:25.349
the he-goat symbolizes the Soviet Union,

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:28.248
and the two horns on the ram which it defeats,

00:01:28.283 --> 00:01:30.814
are Britain and America.

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:34.073
The four horns toward the four winds of heaven,

00:01:34.108 --> 00:01:36.381
in Alexander's case,

00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:39.331
indicate the four generals who succeeded him,

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:41.119
but in our own time,

00:01:41.154 --> 00:01:43.009
it refers to the city of Rome,

00:01:43.044 --> 00:01:45.305
and the four wind directions,

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.574
north, east, south and west,

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:51.739
indicate that the entire world will be taken over

00:01:51.774 --> 00:01:54.802
by the One World Communist Tyranny.

00:01:54.837 --> 00:01:57.755
In verse number 9 Daniel writes:

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.929
"and out of one of them came forth a little horn

00:02:00.964 --> 00:02:02.856
which waxed exceedingly great,

00:02:02.891 --> 00:02:05.160
toward the south, and toward the east,

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:07.263
and toward the glorious land".

00:02:07.298 --> 00:02:10.345
Now this "glorious land" refers to Jerusalem,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.465
and the "little horn",

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.613
in the near time prophetic fulfillment of Daniel,

00:02:15.648 --> 00:02:18.069
refers to Antiochus Epiphanes,

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:20.077
but in the End Times,

00:02:20.112 --> 00:02:23.026
this "little horn" refers to the Antichrist.

00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:24.958
Of course, the headquarters

00:02:24.993 --> 00:02:28.014
of the revived Roman Empire will be Rome,

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.428
and in Revelation Saint John writes

00:02:30.463 --> 00:02:33.544
that they "give their kingdom to the beast".

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.629
And since this empire is world wide,

00:02:36.664 --> 00:02:40.169
naturally it extends north, south, east and west,

00:02:40.204 --> 00:02:42.377
from the city of Rome.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.344
Of course, this means the Antichrist

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.794
could come from the entire world,

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.803
but if we draw a latitude and longitude

00:02:49.838 --> 00:02:51.875
through the city of Rome,

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.575
I think we can pinpoint the location a little better.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.378
There is the latitude;

00:02:56.413 --> 00:02:59.498
Rome is just south of the 42nd parallel,

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:03.505
and the longitude runs, of course, north and south.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.690
Out of one of these four directions

00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:09.269
will come the Antichrist,

00:03:09.304 --> 00:03:11.597
and Daniel pinpoints the location

00:03:11.632 --> 00:03:14.268
even further in the next verse,

00:03:14.303 --> 00:03:17.064
because the "little horn" waxes exceedingly great

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.785
towards the south, towards the east,

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.376
and towards Jerusalem.

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:25.385
Since Daniel writes that the Antichrist will come from

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.473
ONE of the four directions from Rome,

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:32.154
and since Jerusalem is located east of Rome,

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.891
I think it is pretty safe to assume

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:38.476
that the Antichrist will come from this parallel

00:03:38.511 --> 00:03:41.771
which is east of the city of Rome.

00:03:41.806 --> 00:03:43.995
Daniel writes that the little horn

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.142
waxes exceedingly great towards the south,

00:03:47.177 --> 00:03:50.499
towards the east, and towards the "glorious land".

00:03:50.534 --> 00:03:54.326
If we locate a point on this eastern parallel

00:03:54.361 --> 00:03:58.623
so that Jerusalem is due southeast of this point,

00:03:58.658 --> 00:04:01.532
we will discover that that location

00:04:01.567 --> 00:04:04.018
is a very important city,

00:04:04.053 --> 00:04:07.974
and that is the city of Istanbul, Turkey.

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:11.038
Istanbul fulfills all the requirements

00:04:11.073 --> 00:04:13.290
of Daniel's prophecy.

00:04:13.325 --> 00:04:17.582
It is almost exactly on the parallel that Rome is located,

00:04:17.617 --> 00:04:20.251
therefore, it is due east of Rome,

00:04:20.286 --> 00:04:23.653
and the "glorious land" (Jerusalem)

00:04:23.688 --> 00:04:27.607
is due southeast of Istanbul, Turkey.

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:30.675
It is interesting to look at the meaning

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.160
of the word "Istanbul".

00:04:33.195 --> 00:04:35.305
"Bethlehem", as you know,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.093
means the "house of bread",

00:04:38.128 --> 00:04:40.838
and Jesus is the "bread of life"..

00:04:40.873 --> 00:04:43.218
He referred to Himself as "the bread

00:04:43.253 --> 00:04:45.922
which came down from heaven".

00:04:45.957 --> 00:04:48.651
Would the meaning of the word "Istanbul"

00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:51.393
also refer to the Antichrist?

00:04:51.428 --> 00:04:54.924
But would anyone ever give their city an evil name?

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:57.394
But they might give their city a name

00:04:57.429 --> 00:05:00.666
that has no meaning whatsoever,

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:03.996
and "Istanbul" actually is a meaningless name.

00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:06.936
It does not signify anything.

00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:09.949
It simply means "in the city"

00:05:09.984 --> 00:05:13.449
We might express it as "downtown".

00:05:13.484 --> 00:05:17.188
"Istanbul", as far as meaning goes, is meaningless.

00:05:17.223 --> 00:05:20.644
And therefore, a very good indication,

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:23.666
that the Antichrist will come from that city.

00:05:23.701 --> 00:05:26.569
So, why is it important for us to know

00:05:26.604 --> 00:05:29.414
where the Antichrist comes from?

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.257
It is important because at the current time

00:05:32.292 --> 00:05:34.725
there are so many candidates

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.207
whose names are bandied about

00:05:37.242 --> 00:05:39.838
as being possibly the Antichrist

00:05:39.873 --> 00:05:42.906
when they cannot possibly be the Antichrist;

00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:46.476
people like Hilary or Bill Clinton, or Henry Kissinger,

00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:50.105
or Tony Blair, or Juan Carlos of Spain,

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.281
or, of course, our own Barack Obama.

00:05:53.316 --> 00:05:56.315
None of these people come from Istanbul

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.446
and none of them can be the Antichrist.

00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:02.651
In conclusion, we see that the Bible tells us

00:06:02.686 --> 00:06:05.367
where Jesus our Christ comes from,

00:06:05.402 --> 00:06:08.299
and where the Antichrist comes from.

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:11.902
But remember, God reveals the future to us,

00:06:11.937 --> 00:06:15.732
not to scare us, but to prepare us

00:06:15.767 --> 00:06:18.578
