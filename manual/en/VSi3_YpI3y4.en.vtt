00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.090
Hey youtubers, it's Charlie, this is gonna
be my Agent Carter episode 6 video

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.130
all about pushing deeper into the Leviathan plot, a little bit more about who they are.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.930
Just a quick reminder too: there's only
two episodes left, there's only eight episodes

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.590
in the season, so if they get picked up
a for season 2

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.980
which they totally could, it sounds like
they will, that will also probably be just 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.780
eight episodes. So, just careful for spoilers
from the episode if you haven't seen it yet, starting twith top five moments.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.560
Number 5: Leviathan flashback. This is
really more exciting as a Dottie flashback

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.070
just because she looks so awesome being
evil. We get to see the psychiatrist who

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.609
I actually that was the engineer,

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:37.850
I thought he told them that he was an
engineer so he may have just been lying to the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.370
Howling Commandos to infiltrate the SSR.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.479
Plans within plans within plans. Based on
this scene

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:47.179
it seems like Leviathan is a little
bit different from what they are the comics.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.559
The TV show's just using them as a straight-up HYDRA type organization,

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.260
so they're working within the Russian
government. Leviathan, in the comics,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.899
is really part of the Secret Warriors
storyline, during like Dark Reign Secret Invasion.

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.299
If you want to read more, just read
Secret Warriors, which is interesting because

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.740
Agents of SHIELD right now is borrowing a lot about aspects from the Secret Warriors storyline.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.180
Moving on to number 4: Angie, world's most amazing actress.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.729
So they said it up early in the episode she wants to follow her dreams but she's

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.860
getting really discourage, Peggy's like
'don't give up'.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.619
Cut to later in the episode where she's
like 'you're the world's best actor'. I mean she's just

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.259
able to distract Thompson by crying. It's a bit of a trope

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.059
that grown men can't handle women crying,
but it was kinda funny the way they used it.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.310
It's always funny watching actors
pretend to act, they go like way over the top

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.840
and then Peggy was like 'you are amazing, you shouldn't do anything else'.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.189
I mean of course she's a terrible
actress. What I'm really hoping develops,

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.439
at the end of the season,

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.789
is that Peggy inducts Angie into whatever becomes SHIELD.

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.049
In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, SHIELD
was created as a separate organization

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.189
and they just kinda roll the SSR into that. So we will see at some point in. I really

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.060
like Lyndsy Fonseca on the show so

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.860
hopefully they'll keep her character around, she'll become part of that too.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.819
Part of being a spy is being really great actress,

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.009
so Peggy just needs to teach her martial arts. Moving on to number 3:

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.390
Peggy takes down an entire department.
That fight scene was on par with anything

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.310
that Arrow's done.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.729
Arrow probably has the best stunts of any of the comic book TV shows just across the board,

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.370
but I feel like this fight scene in the
Automat was on par with anything they've done in

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.640
this season so far.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.780
Yeah, there's not as much blood, it's not quite as crazy, but if you like the scene as a

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.109
whole, it was just well constructed as
any of Arrow fight scenes.

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.780
Don't you just feel like the scenes though turn Peggy into a superhero?

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.170
Like Captain America style. She kinda has
some of the same moves that he has.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.500
Obviously he's like 10 times stronger,
but you get the idea. There's been this huge

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.700
shift in the way

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.790
fight scenes are filmed, especially on
television since the Bourne trilogy.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.209
It's all about the use of improvised
weapons. And my number 1 moment: Peggy gets captured

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.919
and now the SSR has Captain America's
blood. To be fair

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:49.129
they had his blood before, they just didn't know it was his blood. I'd be

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.290
willing to bet that 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.919
is what the psychiatrist is trying to
get, the Stark Tech he's trying to get.

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.010
Last week's episode, when they found
out about the weapon of mass destruction,

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.400
that kinda seem like the endgame but I think that they're also after the Captain

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.120
America blood so they can make their
own army a super soldiers.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.189
They ended things in a way that made it
seem like Peggy's in deep shit,

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.250
but I do think that Agent Sousa and Agent Thompson will help her.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.250
There's only two episodes left, so it's not
like they're gonna wait till like

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.879
the last 10 minutes of the final episode
for them to finally believe her and go after the villain.

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.999
But they still don't know that the
psychiatrist is a double agent, and neither does Peggy.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.729
If those who are wondering, that ring of his that he uses to hypnotize people,

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:28.019
I don't think that that special. I that's just something he uses the catch people's

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.229
eyes, something he uses to distract people.

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.090
They have that weird music queue that made it sound like it was giving off some

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.269
weird hum, but I I don't think that's
the case, I think it's just a normal ring.

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.629
Let me know though: what was your favorite moment? And here's my big question for you guys:

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.739
How do you think that the SSR is going
to help Peggy?

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.239
I mean, like at a certain point, either
Agent Sousa or one of the other

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.759
agents is gonna have to say 'okay we believe you, let's go get Leaviathan'.

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:53.120
Dooely seem like he was starting to come
around on Stark, like he's like 'okay

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.139
I'm starting to believe that he doesn't
have anything to do with this'. He let

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.639
Peggy go chase down some leads before he knew that she was involved with all of it,

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:04.179
which I think means that, as much as he's
a dick, as well as the other agents in the office,

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.599
they'll eventually come around. She'll just have to punch them a couple times in the face

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.030
to bring them to the senses.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.759
So there weren't a whole bunch Easter
Eggs in the episode, there were a couple

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.310
really awesome ones that I saw though.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.620
So first, whenever they're talking about
the Stark's special, like that the paryting

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.590
bracelet that Stark gives the women,

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.909
they mae the joke about Ginger Rogers being a secret Russian assassin.

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:25.510
Ginger Rogers actually played a double
agent in a movie with Cary Grant called

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.060
'Once Upon a Honeymoon'.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.900
Then when Jarvis said 'you should have
seen her eyes, the darkest gates to the abyss'

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.650
they cut to a shot of the Empire State
Building, so during the Avengers movie when 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.000
the Tesseract opened up a portal, it was right above the Empire State

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.590
Building like, that's where Thor was when
he was

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.860
firing his lightening up into the wormhole. I didn't really catch any other big Easter Eggs

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.520
but if you saw any, just write them below in the comments.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.419
I already talked about my favorite fight
scene but that slap montage that Jarvis went through,

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.570
that was so funny. Can you just picture like a modern version of Tony Stark

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.990
breaking up with a bunch of different
women and sending the Vision to go do it for him?

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.600
I didn't have any significant thumbs down about the episode, I mean it was pretty tight,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.110
it seem like they were trying to lead us
into a very obvious assassination

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.150
attempt from Dottie,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.220
but then they totally me pull the rug out
from under us. So what's gonna happen

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.660
next is I'm gonna be posting

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.010
a Q&amp;A for Arrow and the Flash this week
and then I'll post a separate Q&amp;A

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.250
for the Spider-Man Marvel announcement. We just have so much to talk about.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.560
It sounds like Dylan O'Brien is probably
gonna be casted as Spider-Man,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.919
he seems like the front-runner right now
Logan Lerman seems like the number two pick but

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.800
Dylan O'Brien is the one that's blowing it
up at the box office,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.860
so he just seems like the likely
candidate. You guys going let me know how

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.640
you feel about that.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.100
I'Il be happy with either choice, I feel like
it'll be fine. Really if you gonna worry about something

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.400
worry about the next solo Spider-Man
film script. So while you guys wait for all that stuff

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.180
to drop you can click here to catch up
on Agent Carter

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.140
and you can click here for the Spider-Man Marvel announcement.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.880
Thank you so much watching, so let's all
high five, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
