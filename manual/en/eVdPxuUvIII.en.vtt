00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.410
In this demonstration we appear to
change a base metal,

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.990
copper, firstly into silver, and then into
gold.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.550
The silver is actually just a layer of zinc
plating

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.460
and the gold is brass, an alloy of the
copper and the zinc.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.130
The first thing we need to do is clean
off

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.990
a copper coin. I'm going to use some wire wool to clean the copper coin off.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.190
Be careful when you use wire wool because the small pieces can break off

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.330
and get into the skin. You might prefer
to wear

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.570
a pair of gloves or to use a different mild
abrasive.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.129
So we need to get the copper coin

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.360
nice and clean. The next step is to make a
solution

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.199
of sodium zincate. I'm going to do that by
adding

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.400
five grams of zinc powder into 100 cm
cubed

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.500
of 6 mol per dm cubed sodium
hydroxide solution.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.800
I then need to heat the solution to boiling.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.740
The bubbling you can see is partly due
to the hydrogen being given off from the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.780
reaction between the zinc and the sodium hydroxide which is quite unusual

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.900
and shows the amphoteric nature of zinc, the ability to react with both acids and alkalis.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.540
Take the Bunsen out while
there's still some zinc left in the bottom of the beaker.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.660
That's important because the plating stage

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.459
of the process is actually an electrochemical reaction

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.079
and the copper needs to be in direct
contact with the zinc

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.059
in the bottom of the beaker.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:08.920
Pop the coin into the solution so it's in contact with the zinc at the bottom.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.020
After a few minutes

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.610
the copper coin will be coated in
a silvery grey layer

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.610
which is the zinc. If I just lift it out.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.450
The next step is to rinse the coin off

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.420
in some cold water. This cools the coin down

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.680
and gets rid of the sodium zincate
which is important for the next stage.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.820
If possible try and do this stage under a running tap

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.920
and then just dab the coin dry,

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.220
and we make sure that we

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.270
take off any lumps of zinc that have stuck to it.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.580
You can see that we've changed our copper coin

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.420
into silver

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.160
The silver is actually a plating of zinc which if
you think about it is quite unusual

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.120
because the electrode potentials,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.700
the order of the reactivity series of the
metals,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.300
would lead us to predict that zinc should displace copper from its compounds

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.750
not the other way around, but by complexing the zinc

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.330
we've actually changed the order of the
electrode potentials.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.860
The next stage

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.660
is to change the silver into gold.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.500
Put the coin in the top part of the Bunsen flame and very gently heat it.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.700
Don't overheat it because the
metal

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.470
will tarnish and you can see

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.840
before your eyes the silver

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.810
changing into gold. The gold is actually a layer of

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.170
brass which is formed by the zinc
diffusing or migrating

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.960
to the surface layer of the copper.
