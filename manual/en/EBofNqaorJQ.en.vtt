00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:11.066
New enemy type: Bad Bones. When low on 
health, drains the health of nearby enemies.

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:15.066
This draining element will be used to solve 
certain puzzles.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
New enemy type: Orange Bandit. A 'smart' 
enemy seen at the beginning of the game.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This enemy has a field of sight, allowing you to 
sneak up on him during plot-based missions.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
They can block attacks, run up to you and 
attack, and have better pathing than usual.

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:55.033
Here I activate a fire element. This allows me 
to throw faster, more damaging projectiles.

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:59.033
It also allows me to run faster, and create a 
mini-barrier that can explode on command.

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:30.033
Here I use a 'magic spell'. These spells vary 
pending on the weapon equipped.

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:34.033
The current effect summons a pillar of ice, 
which will freeze or greatly damage enemies.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:44.033
Here I activate a pierce element. It allows 
normal dagger throws to bounce and pierce.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Here I activate a freeze element. It turns 
dagger throws into a freeze attack.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Not all enemies can be frozen, but those that 
can leave pushable ice blocks upon freezing.

00:02:56.033 --> 00:03:00.033
New enemy type: Sarcatagus. An enemy worth 
a lot of exp, yet not always worth the time.

00:03:00.033 --> 00:03:04.033
They deal high damage, and are not staggered 
much by your attacks. Movement is erratic.

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:48.033
Here I begin to use the pierce element magic 
spell.

00:04:48.033 --> 00:04:52.033
This spell creates a slow moving ball of 
energy that deals damage to enemies.

00:04:52.033 --> 00:04:56.033
The spell will move at an angle towards the 
casting place, and will be used for puzzles.

00:04:56.033 --> 00:05:00.033
The spell bounces off walls, and gains speed 
the more it has bounced.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
New enemy type: Possessed Knight. Very 
durable, slow moving, and has high damage.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
This particular enemy will be involved in some 
'puzzle fights'.

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:12.033
Possessed Knights have the ability to 
summon more enemies.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
This is the end of my SMALL demonstration of 
the game.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Many more areas and elements to the game 
exist, but most combat gameplay was shown.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Thankyou for watching, I hope you enjoyed.
