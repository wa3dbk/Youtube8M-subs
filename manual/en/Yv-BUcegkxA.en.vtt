00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.509
Ok, we're back. We?re making Spanish omelets
this morning. What were going to do is three

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.260
variations of the omelet. So, let?s go with
the first omelet, which I call the standard

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:22.419
or regular omelet. So, we're crack three eggs,
you can go with two, you can go with one.

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:28.710
I'm a three egg omelet man, that's how I make
it. We are going to add a little bit of salt,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:42.510
just a tesh, black pepper (maybe half that)
and some ground cumin (just a little bit)

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.170
just about so much. Very nice, makes your
omelet unique plus this is a Spanish omelet.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:01:03.519
So, whip it up. Mix in your seasoning. Make
sure the yolk and the whites are thoroughly

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:12.570
mixed. Some people will add cream, milk or
water to their eggs to make them more fluffy,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:21.210
I choose not to. You can do whatever you like
as far as that goes. Doesn't make a big difference.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.460
So, now we have our whip, we have seasoned.
Now, it's time to make an omelet. We have

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:42.719
our omelet pan, heats on. Let's add a little
bit of butter (like so). Put it all away around

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:51.469
the pan. The key is make sure your pan is
hot. If the pan isn?t hot, if you start of

00:01:51.469 --> 00:02:04.229
cold your eggs will stick. So, here we go.
Pans hot butter melted, let?s add the egg

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.900
and what we are going to do is turn up the
heat a bit. We are going to let the eggs set

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.160
up a little bit, see it cooked around the
edges. I'm just going to stir it a little

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:29.380
bit going around and around (just like so)
nice and easy.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:37.190
Once the eggs are almost done then we will
give a flip. We will use the technique that

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.920
I showed with flipping the bread in the pan.
Once we get to this point I'm going to leave

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.860
the eggs a bit, going to let it set up. If
I continue to stir we will have scramble eggs.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.600
So, I'm letting the eggs set up. Now, shaking
the eggs around there's not a whole lot of

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.960
movement which, will make it harder to flip.
So, what I'm going to do is sneak a little

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:14.190
bit of butter under the eggs (just like so)
and I'll do the same on the other end. Put

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:26.820
it down like so let the butter get under the
pan. Now, it will slip better. Shake it around

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:34.620
and now are you ready for the flip, here we
go. Ok, just like the bread. Once that's done

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.900
cut the heat unless you like brown eggs cook
it a little more. Add a little more butter.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:55.470
I'm just going to work the butter underneath
and do it again on the other side

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.720
(just like so). Now we're ready for the filling.
What we're going to do is plate up variation

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.480
number one of the Spanish omelet.
