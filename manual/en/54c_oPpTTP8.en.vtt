00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.730
So, two words often
get thrown around

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.880
and confused for one another.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.600
And I thought we would take
a few minutes to clarify

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.390
the differences between
salts and sodium.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.060
And we know they're
related, but I

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.220
wanted to get exactly
what the differences are,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.930
and how to make sense of all the
different numbers I hear around

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.890
how much I'm supposed
to get every day.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.950
So, I always think for salts,
of my salt shaker at home.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.500
It sits right next
to my pepper shaker,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.790
and whenever I have dinner
I often reach for it.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.110
And sometimes I think,
am I eating too much

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.170
of it or am I putting
on more than I should?

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.460
And so I was thinking about
this in terms of a spoon.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.520
So if you have a spoon,
let's say a teaspoon of salt.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.770
And let's say I took
this teaspoon of salt--

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.530
here it is-- and I
weighed it on a scale.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.032
I would find that one teaspoon
of salt weighs about 6 grams.

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:07.990
Let me write that here.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.940
So it's about six grams.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.110
And six grams is the
same as 6,000 milligrams.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.710
So that's the weight of
one teaspoon of salt.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.910
Now, the question comes up, how
much of that is from sodium?

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.970
So, to answer that, we know that
sodium chloride, NaCl is salt.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.070
That is what salt is made of.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.730
And if I imagine there's
nothing in my salt shaker

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.900
except for sodium chloride,
no ants have gotten in there,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.720
no other stuff besides
the sodium chloride,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.410
then I can assume that all
6,000 milligrams of salt

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.440
is going to be either from the
sodium or from the chloride.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.930
OK.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.240
Now the Na, just be totally
clear, is the sodium part

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.010
and the Cl is the chloride
part, that's what that means.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.650
And they actually, all atoms
have a certain atomic mass

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.350
unit.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.470
So you can actually
weigh the atoms,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.350
and line them up by size, and
which is the largest in weight,

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.030
and which is the
smallest in weight.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.170
And sodium weighs out
at about 23 units,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.360
and chloride is about 35 units.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.459
So this is chloride right here,
and this is sodium right here.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.000
And so if I was to
sum it up, I would

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.320
get 23 plus 35 is 58 units.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.640
And units, just to say it again
or to write it out rather,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.160
is atomic mass units.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.000
So now that I have the
total atomic mass units,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.095
I can try to figure out what
proportion is from the sodium,

00:02:48.095 --> 00:02:49.970
and what proportion
is from the chloride.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.370
So for the first
part, the sodium,

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.110
I can simply take the 23
units over the 58 unit total.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.960
The units cancel out.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.420
And that works out to about 40%.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.540
So that means that about
40% of the weight of salt

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.520
is actually coming
from the sodium part,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.420
and the chloride part
is the rest of it.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.620
So I've got 35 units over 58
units, and that is about 60%.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.610
And again, the units
cancel out 60%.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.670
So I know that in
salt, 40% of the weight

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.750
is coming from the sodium,
60% from the chloride.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.660
Got it.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.400
Now, I have to go
back to my teaspoon.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.980
In my teaspoon I had 6
grams, or 6,000 milligrams.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.000
So in that teaspoon, I can
just multiply by these numbers

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.400
to figure out how much of the
weight comes from the sodium

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.680
and how much comes
from the chloride.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.928
So the sodium gives
me 40% of 6,000,

00:03:54.928 --> 00:03:57.680
which, when you multiply
those two numbers

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.950
you get 2,400
milligrams of sodium.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:11.910
And 60% times 6,000 is 3,600
milligrams of chloride.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.430
So now I know in
each teaspoon I have

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.209
2,400 milligrams of sodium.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.180
And now I've actually
looked and I've

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.690
seen that there
are recommendations

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.910
on how much sodium you
should get in your diet,

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.430
if you're not having any
medical problems in general.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.470
So I'll call that a normal daily
salts amount, or normal amount.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.710
And this is regular, this would
be a regular amount of salts,

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.530
and then there's
a low salt amount.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.420
So this would be
a low salt amount.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.360
So if you're on a
low-salt diet, we'll

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.350
figure out how much salt
you're supposed to take in,

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.820
or how much sodium you're
supposed to take in,

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.550
and the same for regular.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.880
How much you should be taking
if you're on a regular diet.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.520
And I'm going to do it both
from a salt perspective

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.910
and also from a
sodium perspective.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.750
So let's do the sodium
prospective first.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.970
So normal amount you
should get-- actually,

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.010
let me write "per day."

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:20.105
And let's do of sodium and
over here we'll do salt.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.420
So regular amount of sodium
you should get per day

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:34.410
is about 2,300 milligrams.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.380
And on a low-salt
diet you should

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.700
get about 1,500 milligrams.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.900
Now we know that 1 teaspoon
has 2,400 milligrams and 2,400

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.560
and 2,300, I think,
are pretty close.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.900
So in my conversion
I'm going to assume

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:01.890
that that means I can have about
one teaspoon per day of salt.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.210
And on a low-salt diet,
you're recommended

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.360
to have no more than about
1,500 milligrams of sodium.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.090
And if one teaspoon equals
2,400 milligrams of sodium,

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.980
then 1,500 is about 2/3
of it, so that's about 2/3

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.685
of a teaspoon of salt.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.380
So when I look at a
teaspoon of salt now,

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.950
I just remember that if this
is my teaspoon, that if I'm

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.990
on a regular diet I can
basically take one of them

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.510
each day, not each
meal but each day.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.050
And if I'm on a low-salt diet
I can only fill it up about 2/3

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.360
of the way, and I'd
have to stop there

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.560
because that's the limit of
sodium that I'm recommended.
