Hi! I am Michael Webb on behalf of Expert
Village.com. Right now we are going to be

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.760
making a falcon. In order to do this, you
want to start off by making a valley fold

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:33.620
diagonally, like so. Make a good crease and
you are going to measure about a centimeter

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.010
up from that edge that you just made and you
are going to pleat that edge back up to the

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:47.980
top, like so. From there you are going to
take each wing, and you are just going to

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:59.640
swing it in until this edge meets the crease
of the baseline which you just made.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.540
From there you are going to take just a little
bit or more than half way down; move from

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:13.100
there to this axis point and you are going
to swing this swing back up so that it kind

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:38.970
of forms outward; and you are going to do
just the same with the opposite side.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.500
Now that you have got that, you are going
to flip the whole thing over and you are going

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:57.590
to make a crease that is valley, point it
up like this and you are going to pleat that

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.700
edge back down, like so. So now you can see
it, it is going to start taking more of a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:16.040
bird type shape and to make the beak you are
going to pleat the head down and then back

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:26.100
up. Now we are ready to take the entire unit
and do a valley fold right along the baseline

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:36.530
and fold it in half.
Now from here you want to take each of these

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:52.530
wings and fold them down, like so. Make sure
that you do that on both sides;

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.950
and then you are going to give a little more
dimension to the head by taking the front

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:12.319
here and folding it down and again on both
sides and there you have a finished falcon.
