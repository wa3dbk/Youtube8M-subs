00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.530
Hi YouTube, Darth Here:
This last week I've been playing with the

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.600
PP-2000, and I've had the chance to get to
know the weapon pretty well.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.690
I also played with this gun on the CTE to
see if the changes to visual recoil, suppression,

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.150
and environment made a significant difference
with this weapon.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.400
Short story: they did not make much of a difference.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.039
So, should you be using the PP-2000: Yes,
or No?

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.090
No.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.820
There's no beating around the bush this week:
the PP-2000 is a weapon that I can't recommend.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.170
I almost want to like this gun, because there
are a number of features that I found to be

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.120
pretty exceptional:
At 45 rounds in the magazine, the PP-2000

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.920
carries a good load of ammunition.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.210
You can kill two or even three enemies, and
still have plenty of rounds left over.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.150
Even though it has the worst reload time among
the PDWs (which at 2.55 seconds is still not

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.940
that long), it's really not a factor.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.649
The first shot recoil of this weapon is only
1.6.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.390
That means that the bullets following up your
first are going to remain pretty on-target.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.260
Combine this with a low overall recoil, and
this gun's very accurate.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.219
The spread per shot increase is the lowest
of all the PDWs at .085.

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.239
In combination with everything else, this
means that you can lay on the trigger for

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.909
extended periods of time and still come up
with kills from this laser-firing PDW.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.960
Being a PDW, the hipfire is actually quite
good, even without a laser, and even while

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.110
on the move.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.780
So ultimately there are some serious detractions
to this weapon which put it in the no-go territory:

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.630
First and foremost, this gun has the second
lowest time-to-kill of all the PDWs.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.760
Its damage model is 25 max, 12.1 min damage.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.850
This means at ranges beyond sixty meters,
you're going to have to put nine bullets into

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.409
your target to kill them.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.670
Even at close range, this is still a lower
time-to-kill than even mid-rate rpm assault

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.939
rifles like the M416.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.299
At the root of the low time-to-kill problem
is the gun's low rounds per minute.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.630
The PP-2000 fires at only 650 rounds per minute.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.180
This is the second lowest of all the PDWs
and makes it one of the slowest firing weapons

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.220
in the game.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.759
On the flip side, this makes it extremely
controllable.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.750
As a PDW, the PP-2000 is in a class of weapons
that generally has a slower bullet velocity.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.290
The PP-2000 is no exception, and has a bullet
velocity of only 400 meters-per-second.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.000
This makes using the great recoil somewhat
difficult beyond close range, as you're going

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.369
to have to lead your targets.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.989
The PP-2000 ends up being in this strange
place for a PDW, where it's not very good

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.520
at close range, and it's okay at mid-range.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.891
This puts it up against the mid-range weapons,
and if you're playing in the mid-range, you

00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:22.800
should be considering a carbine instead of
a PDW.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.599
Or at the very least, instead of this PDW.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.660
On the other hand, if you're confident of
your ability to get two headshots in a row

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.320
as long as you have an exceptionally accurate
weapon, the PP-2000 might be for you, as it

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.400
is a laser gun.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.790
But one thing that's as true about this weapon,
as it is of all the PDWs, is that I think

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.390
its potential is somewhat limited by the fact
that the player has to decide between this

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.950
and the carbines.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.920
I'm still not really sure why the Battlefield
4 develop ers chose to reverse the Battlefield

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.920
3 model.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.790
In Battlefield 3, the PDWs were available
to all classes, and the carbines were limited

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.310
to the Engineer class.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.440
As I said, in Battlefield 4 this is now the
opposite.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.540
Because the PP-2000 is a strange PDW that
wants to be a mid-range weapon, it simply

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.360
gets outclassed.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.200
Ultimately the PP-2000 sits in this strange
grey area of not being a high enough time-to-kill

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.900
to compete at close range, and not really
bringing anything special at medium range.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.080
The PP-2000 is probably the easiest gun to
control that I've done on Yes or No.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.379
It's low RPM, combined with a low bullet spread
and minimal recoil in any direction means

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.030
that the PP-2000 is a very accurate weapon.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.880
Of course, that low bullet velocity means
that targets at long range are still going

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.010
to be somewhat harder to hit; this is because
you're going to need to lead them more.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.220
But let's look at the recoil pattern for the
PP-2000: it has a .24 upwards recoil, and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.110
a .3 left, and a .2 right.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.580
The recoil pattern for this gun is going to
look like it goes up and slightly to the left.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.860
To counter this recoil, you'll need to pull
slightly down and to the right.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.430
But again, the recoil isn't very strong, so
it's not going to be much of a fight.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.280
I found that the PP-2000 is a very binary
weapon.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.519
It has great accuracy at mid-range, and being
a PDW, it has great hipfire even on the run.

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.380
I'd often have to switch between which mentality
I was in depending on the location in the

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.380
map.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.629
ADS at close range meant I was slower on the
draw, and consequently meant I usually died.

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.129
Alternatively, hipfire at range is just not
something you ever want to do.

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.780
Another thing I found with this weapon, is
if I reacted at the same time as an enemy,

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.049
it'd usually come up in their favor as this
weapon's time-to-kill did me no favors.

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.419
So ultimately I started using this weapon
as a nice street cleaner.

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.050
It's good at cleaning up enemies in that mid-range
that you find in between buildings on Dawnbreaker,

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.160
Shanghai, and in some portions of Golmud.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.900
With 45 rounds in the magazine, it's a good
weapon for catching large groups of enemies

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.070
unprepared for you.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.470
So it's not a bad flanking weapon for Engineers,
either.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.690
Of course, beating enemies on your way to
that flank might be a bit difficult.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.071
I think beating enemies in that mid-range
sweet spot is ideal for the PP-2000, as you

00:04:43.071 --> 00:04:47.449
don't want to risk drawing in close range
against an enemy using a faster time-to-kill.

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.620
Most of the time you're going to just lose
that engagement, even when hipfiring.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.949
This was kind of strange weapon for attachments.

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.950
I found a great variety in attachments among
the top players.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.949
I also noted that the top players for the
PP-2000 tended to have comparatively lower

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.500
scores per minute to other weapons I've reviewed.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.300
Most players gravitated to the RDS (usually
the Coyote or Kobra), a laser, and the barrels

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.449
were almost split evenly between the heavy
barrel, suppressors, compensator, and muzzle

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:13.449
brake.

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.540
And while I think this gun might work with
a lot of setups, I believe the muzzle brake

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.240
in this case, with the low .24 upwards recoil,
is simply a wrong-headed pick.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.449
Ultimately, I broke with a lot of their choices,
and went in my own direction for my preferred

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.160
PP-2000 setup.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.419
For the sight, I found the most luck with
the PK-A 3.4x magnification scope.

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.410
This is one of the few times I've ever used
more than a 1x magnification on any weapon.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.220
However, for the sweet mid-range that this
weapon seems to work with, it was a good choice.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.430
As I said, it's a binary weapon so I wanted
to play to the strengths.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.740
Which is why for the accessory, I went with
the laser sight.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.880
This made the hipfire just that much better.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.910
Also, with the way that visual recoil is on
live servers, the laser helps to serve as

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.990
a reliable center-point for the sight when
ADS.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.480
My personal choice for the barrel attachment
was the suppressor.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.550
I should point out that the suppressor on
this weapon makes getting kills beyond 40

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.480
to 50 meters exceptionally unlikely.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.550
The bullets will fall out of your gun, and
slowly saunter over to your enemy at a leisurely

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.520
250 meters per second.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.050
This is why I also liked to switch it up and
go with either a flash hider or a compensator.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.710
So ultimately I ended up using the scope when
enemies were beyond hipfire range, which seemed

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.009
to work out pretty well.

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:25.949
Then whenever possible, I would hipfire enemies
as the slow rate of fire wasn't going to do

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:26.949
me any favors.

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:30.500
Beyond that, it's all about how well you feel
you can control this weapon with the barrel

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.500
attachment.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.530
This is why I still think it very strange
that players run this weapon with the muzzle

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.010
brake, as it's a very controllable weapon.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.910
In summary, the PP-2000 is one of the top
5 most used PDWs, but I don't think it's necessarily

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.060
a weapon your Engineer should be running.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.250
Particularly when there are so many better
Carbines to choose from.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:53.030
Some alternatives for you could be: the AK5C
if you like mid-range engagements, the SG553

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.240
if you want a weapon that is pretty adaptive
to anything in close-to-mid, or even the CZ-3A1

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.530
PDW if you feel you can control its monstrous
1000 RPM bullet hose.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.319
The PP-2000 is a very accurate weapon, so
I think it's one of those weapons that's going

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:08.560
to be much more useful to newer players.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.990
If you can control the more powerful weapons,
I'd definitely recommend going with those

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.410
over this weapon.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.040
By no means is the PP-2000 a bad weapon, it's
just a few steps shy of being good.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.680
I think that if the bullet velocity were higher,
or perhaps the damage model slightly different

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.660
at close range (for example, like the SR-2),
this would be a good gun.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.850
If you think I'm wrong about the PP-2000,
