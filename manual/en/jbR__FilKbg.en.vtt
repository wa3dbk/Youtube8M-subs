SHERRY SAMUELS: Yona is our 16-month-old black
bear cub, and she came to us on January 15th,

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.330
from the Appalachian Bear Rescue, and we noticed
pretty soon after her arrival at the museum

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.880
that she was doing some regular limping, and
our veterinarians checked her out and thought

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.960
it’d be a good idea to get her in for some
radiographs. And we did that and we noticed

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.419
that something wasn’t right, and we decided
to make all the calls and get her in for,

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.350
for anything that could be done—a CT scan,
more radiographs with the folks here at the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.281
NC State University Vet School.

00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:40.400
MICHAEL STOSKOPF: Even though Yona is a very
personable and relatively young bear, we have

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.160
to be careful about how we handle these sorts
of large, wild creatures. So when Yona arrived,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.339
we needed to give her drugs so that she would
be handleable. That’s sometimes a challenge,

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.300
getting the crate in position; we used a very
special anesthetic peanut butter to draw her

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.879
attention so we could make the injection.
Once we have her on the table, and intubated,

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.920
then we’re able to proceed pretty much the
same way we would with any other animal. The

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.320
CAT scan or the CT scan is a very useful tool
for diagnosing the kinds of problems that

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.320
Yona has.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.650
DENIS MARCELLIN-LITTLE: We were seeing Yona
today because of a problem that she is with

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:29.060
her front leg on the right side. She had an
injury at some point, and it’s not growing

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.789
like it should be, and we were assessing that
today. Our CT scan gathers information by

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.680
making cross-sections, making kind of little
slices—virtual slices—through the limb,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.000
but the software is powerful enough that we
can reconstruct limbs immediately when we

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.420
do CTs, which is very helpful to make sure
that we get a good CT, that there is no shift

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.570
in the position of the patient, or no void
in the data, and/or so to have an immediate

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.170
assessment, kind of a 3D assessment of things.
So we can see fragments on cross-sections,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.130
but we see them a lot better in 3D view, so
we can see where they are, and so our initial

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.510
assessment allowed us to kind of detect the
presence of that fragment and look at the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.440
general shape of the bone, the general fit
of the elbow joint; that’s very helpful.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.830
STOSKOPF: Well, one of the important things
that students need to learn when they’re

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.860
in veterinary school is how to work with these
unusual animals, so every opportunity we have

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.570
to look at animals that are beyond what you
would normally see broadens the perspective

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.020
of those future veterinarians that will be
out helping animals in their careers.
