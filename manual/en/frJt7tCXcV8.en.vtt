00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.780
I’d gotten the Sega Master System a year
earlier, and loved a lot of the games I’d

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.630
played, but nothing prepared for when I unwrapped
that copy of Shinobi.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.640
I LOVED the arcade game, and I knew it had
to be coming out on the Master System eventually,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.250
but back then games didn’t have release
dates.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.340
You didn’t know they were out til they would
show up at the local department store.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.790
My mom somehow was able to get a copy of this,
and I freaked out when I opened it on Christmas

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.950
Eve.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.950
Look at this picture.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.420
This is me, immediately after opening the
present.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.010
While this version comes nowhere near the
quality of the arcade game that I’d spent

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.210
tons of hours playing at the local bowling
alley every saturday morning, it was areally

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.190
about as faithul of a port that could be expected
at the time.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.410
Besides, i never even made it past the first
couple of levels in the arcade - now I could

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.790
see what was beyond that.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.790
Actually though?

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.640
I dont have a lot memories of Shinobi beyond
this Christmas.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.680
It was just ok...and was just a couple of
years away from being totally overshadowed

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:42.130
in every way by Revenge

00:01:42.130 --> 00:02:24.290
of Shinobi.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:03:05.590
I looooooved the 
first Zillion game, and was so hyped for this

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.590
one.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.960
WOW, what a disappointment.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.290
Which sucks because seriously - a motorcycle
that turns into a flying robot suit?

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.160
C’mon, there is no part of that sentence
that doesnt seem awesome.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.870
We unfortunately got something that is so
far from the original- which, to be fair,

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.319
was often par for the course for sequels at
the time - but it just doesn’t work here.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.140
They made it into an arcade style shooter
with none of the puzzle gameplay that made

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.200
the first game so great.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.790
It does look pretty good though, and has some
decent tunes but that wasnt enough to save

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.790
it.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.349
Look, the title screen never even says Zillion
2.

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.880
Almost like they just slapped the name on
the box after the game was done.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.780
This was such a disappointment that i barely
played beyond the first level and sold it

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.840
at a garage sale the next summer.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.590
I hunted down a copy just to see if I misjudged
it all those years ago and yeah… its still

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.590
pretty bad.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.901
Granted, its not nearly as bad as I remembered,
but the original still kills it.

00:03:59.901 --> 00:04:00.901
So, this one is pretty weird right?

00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:01.901
The sega CD launch was pretty devoid of any
real good games, but Sega decided that the

00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:02.980
full motion video genre was the way of the
future, they releasing both Night Trap and

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.980
Sewer Shark in the launch window.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.890
The latter was probably the better game, but
faced with a choice, whats a 14 year old boy

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.470
who was starting to discover late night HBO
horror movies going to pick?

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.470
Yep, Night Trap.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.470
And you know what?

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.470
I loved it.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.470
Everything from the creepy augers with black
panty hose over their head - love their theme

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.470
music - the cheesy floor traps, and the absolutely
awful acting.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.470
And who can forget that amazing theme song.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.190
Night Trap would be the very definition of
Guilty Pleasure...if I believed in guilty

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.190
pleasures.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.190
Its a really bad GAME - with almost zero gameplay
to speak of - but I think its something that

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.190
you had to be there for to really appreciate...or
not appreciate.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.190
Its pretty impressive that things seem to
be happening in the house at the same time,

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.300
so you can always kinda get a different playthrough.
