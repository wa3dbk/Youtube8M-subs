00:00:04.664 --> 00:00:11.533
What's this, my friends?
It's the future schoolbook.

00:00:11.783 --> 00:00:14.921
Why?
You take it along to school

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:22.283
put your notes in, and won't
even need a USB stick.

00:00:22.464 --> 00:00:32.228
It magically builds a network
connecting all computers.

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:37.368
And what does this
one run? Fedora!

00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:41.293
We have with us
Dimitris Glezos.

00:00:41.543 --> 00:00:43.833
- Dimitis.
- Hello!

00:00:44.303 --> 00:00:46.422
- I'm greatful. You brought
this little monster to us.

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.996
I love OLPC so much.
It will give poor kids

00:00:50.824 --> 00:00:57.567
the opportunity to own
a low-cost laptop.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.385
- Exactly.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.829
- Where should we start
Dimitris? So many topics!

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:09.603
I'll start from Fedora.
The most important thing

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.538
is the communities of people.
So, what is Fedora?

00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:20.245
- Fedora is a Linux distribution.

00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:23.709
An alternative operating system,
in a way similar to Windows

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.891
with a determinant difference:
It's free software.

00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:30.924
Anyone can copy, distribute it
give it to his friends

00:01:31.306 --> 00:01:34.829
One can install it on any
number of computers.

00:01:34.925 --> 00:01:39.798
The applications in Fedora
are also free software.

00:01:40.197 --> 00:01:44.226
No need to illegally download,
copy or crack.

00:01:45.413 --> 00:01:48.010
Fedora's and Linux's software
is free to copy and install.

00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:50.324
- But you're doing
something special

00:01:51.343 --> 00:01:54.732
quite unique internationally
compared to similar works.

00:01:54.744 --> 00:02:01.883
The way you handle translations.
- Right. In Fedora, we built

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.137
a new sub-system to manage
our big number of translations.

00:02:08.387 --> 00:02:11.887
We translate around
100 to 120 applications.

00:02:11.913 --> 00:02:18.434
- By translations we mean
translations of yoursoftware

00:02:18.684 --> 00:02:24.180
and their help files.
They'll be in Greek

00:02:24.208 --> 00:02:27.105
thanks to the work of
Dimitris Glezos and Fedora.

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:41.741
- We support more than
100 projects and 400 translators

00:02:42.204 --> 00:02:47.808
collaboratively translating the
interface, menus

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:54.358
and the software comprising
the Fedora Desktop.

00:02:54.584 --> 00:02:58.704
- A user can feel comfortable with
his system translated in Greek.

00:02:58.954 --> 00:03:03.780
- Exactly.
- How did this software start?

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:16.195
- As part of Google Summer of Code.
It sponsors Univesity students

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:19.698
to work on open source projects
for three months in the summer.

00:03:19.734 --> 00:03:24.595
- Wouldn't it be great if Greek
universities and componies did that?

00:03:24.797 --> 00:03:30.352
That is, sponsor summer
jobs for people?

00:03:31.057 --> 00:03:36.587
- Definitely. I'm very happy to see
that while in 2007

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:40.264
I was maybe the only Greek
student, this year we had

00:03:40.356 --> 00:03:44.992
around 6-7 students from Greece.
We promoted the project a lot

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:50.148
and talked about our work in
conferences and in the public.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:58.887
Summer jobs (internships)
are quite popular abroad.

00:04:00.408 --> 00:04:02.409
I'd encourage Greek companies
to consider adopting it.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.406
Especially if it will involve
free software.

00:04:04.831 --> 00:04:13.116
- Where can one find you Dimitris?
- Our website is fedoraproject.gr.

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:18.895
One can download Fedora there.
You take a file, burn it on a CD

00:04:19.611 --> 00:04:26.175
and boot your computer from it.
Fedora boots from the CD

00:04:26.292 --> 00:04:30.487
You can test it, surf the net
Run Openffice for your documents

00:04:30.764 --> 00:04:34.881
And if you like it, install it using
the shortcut on your desktop.

00:04:35.573 --> 00:04:37.489
We should note that
everything is free and legal

00:04:38.105 --> 00:04:40.473
and copying and distributing
Fedora is very much encouraged.

00:04:40.975 --> 00:04:42.849
- Dimitris, we owe you.
The guys from the control

00:04:42.932 --> 00:04:45.470
tell me you're fantastic
and glib, explaining things

00:04:45.607 --> 00:04:47.679
exactly the way we want
on Psifiaki Ellada.

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:52.333
Thank you so much.
Do stay with us.
