00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:26.140
Now, in order to give you a rest in between
the left turn, we called it the left foot

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.050
box,
we just going to show you a device call

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.780
sway, side sway; 1, 2, 3,
2, 2, 3;

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.940
1, 2, 3,
2, 2, 3; very simple, yeah.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.230
So, I could be doing
1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.730
side sway, side sway;
1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3,

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.400
side sway, side sway.
Something like this we give you a rest

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.030
in between left turning, so that you
can have time to think.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.249
From that, we are going to upgrade
to the proper reverse turn.

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:10.100
Once again, reverse means turning
left in dancing.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.969
And for this, I am just going to do the
steps myself because the lady’s steps

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.259
are the same as man’s steps.
We are just doing opposite half.

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:26.340
The forward half of a left turn,
reverse turn.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:35.350
Forward left foot – heel;
side right foot, using only the toe;

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.060
crossing left foot in front of right foot,
ball flat in the foot work.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.630
We do that again.
I am turning left gradually,

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.460
and I am going to make approximately
1½ turn, so I am going to go

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.509
forward, side, cross.
On the side step,

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.090
I want to make sure my right foot
is back a bit, so that I have room

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.659
to cross in front.
This is slightly less than half,

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.890
but that’s OK, less than half turn.
The back half of the reverse turn,

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.260
right foot back, 1;
keep turning left, left foot side using

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.390
the ball of the left foot only,
and then right foot closes to left foot,

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.530
body keeps turning to the left.
That will be 4, 5, 6.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.470
You notice important that I,
to notice I cross in the forward half;

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.610
I don’t cross in the back half.
So I am going to go

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.200
1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.720
If I continue, I will keep the body turning
and going in a straight line,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:00.170
1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.780
Lady steps will be the same as man steps
but for the sake of comparison,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.120
I am going to ask Wendy to step
beside here, beside me.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.710
As you can see from this demonstration,
Wendy will do the back half of the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:23.480
reverse turn while I do the forward half.
And 1, 2, stop.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.980
She is not crossing, she’s got her feet
close;

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.670
I am crossing.
Now she does the forward half,

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.980
I do the back half;
and 1, 2, 3.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.850
As you can see, she is cross, I am not.
Natural opposite.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:49.520
Put this together,
it is important that we stay on our own left

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.020
side;
fairly close together.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:00.830
I don’t try to avoid my partner, I go straight.
1, 2, 3,

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.400
it may not feel like you have room but you
do.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.530
And 4, 5, 6.
1, 2, 3,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.650
4, 5, 6;
1, 2, 3,

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.060
4, 5, 6.
What we just demonstrated to you is the ideal

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.310
situation where two people know the steps,
they can do by themselves and make

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.720
half turn on every bar of music.
But for you, new students,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.360
highly unlikely.
It will probably take you 2 or 3 times

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.370
repeating the Bronze I class before you can
do that.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.390
So what you do is don’t worry about
making half of turn.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:55.370
Let’s say you can only make half of that,
so let’s say I do basic.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.600
Side sways, side sways,
just get myself going with the music.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.850
I do a little bit of half turn,
a reverse turn but I don’t make it.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.070
Don’t panic,
just use side sways to adjust

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.220
to make sure the man is facing forward
along the line of the dance.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.120
And you can practice that way,
4, 5, 6.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.130
This is what we do in class,
using the side sways to adjust as we practice

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:36.370
the left turn.
I will demonstrate this to music

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.400
doing side sways to adjust
and then continue on dancing

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.960
the reverse turn properly
showing you what the ideal situation will

00:05:46.960 --> 00:06:31.370
be.
