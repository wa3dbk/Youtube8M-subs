Hey Cruisers, it's Sheri with CruiseTipsTV.
Welcome to our little

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.480
stateroom from Carnival Imagination.
Today we would like to invite you to

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.030
check out

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.390
our new investment we bought packing cubes and we packed with them

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.170
for the first time ever. So today we're
going to show you the difference between

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.600
three different brands

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.699
in pretty similar price ranges, the pros and
cons for each,

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.570
and at the end we will tell you what our
favorites at a packing cubes are.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.100
So first we're going to start with the
eBags and and keep in mind

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.309
all three on the sets were purchased on
Amazon.com

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.449
and will put price links and links to
the product in the notes for this video

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.780
rest assured. Anyhow, these are the eBags
and this

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.440
little set here that you see in pink was a set
of three bags.  We have a small

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.239
a medium and down here we have a large

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.449
bag, and what we decided to do with this
particular set

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.379
is packed my items in them and what I
like about eBags was that

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.049
okay let's be honest becoming a lot a
really really great colors so

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.690
I'm a sucker for pink, and I had to have
these these are great they have nice

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.820
little mesh windows

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.520
zippers work really really well and
they're just a nice standard

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.140
well priced set of bags, and they come in like
I said just tons of gorgeous colors

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.750
the next set that I'm going to show you is this
beautiful blue set here

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.400
this is a set from Eagle Creek, and the 
set that you're looking at here

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.130
the small the medium and down below the
large bag

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.260
was a set of three. Now one thing you'll
notice

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.080
about this set is there a lot smaller
than the other two that we're going to

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.400
show you any are actually a little bit
more expensive

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.430
I had bought these at the intention my
husband

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.370
using a set I like the blue color
thought it would work but it turns out

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.000
they were actually too small

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.680
so we had to supplement with this extra
little item here for things like

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.370
underwear sox items like that and this
was close to ten dollars not cheap but

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.640
these are very high quality.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.570
Nice little handles just like all the
sets. Nice mesh windows.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.900
And very very high quality and this is
the Eagle Creek set.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.009
I the last set that I'd like to show you
today

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.330
is the Shacke Pak set and the Shacke Pak

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.970
came in a set 4 unlike the other two
that came in a set of 3

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.670
and they have handles mesh windows and
all them very high quality

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.030
fabric and sewing

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.890
and this particular set like I said has
four bags. So this is the small

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.640
and then we have the medium the large

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.709
and the extra large.  So the Shacke Pak

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.240
is definitely the best value for
your money.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.020
They are spacious they're just as high
quality as the others and

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.490
really they have turned out to be our
favorite. We got so much

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.099
into these bags it's really unbelievable
and this particular

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.440
bit of luggage that you're looking at
right now was

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.090
what we packed for my husband myself
and her 5-year-old for four night cruise

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.780
so

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.440
you know, you might need a bit more you'd
probably have to get another set if

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.050
you're doing a seven or eight night
cruise. This is a pretty good start

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.020
You cannot imagine how much more
efficient packing goes at these things

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.620
We are

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.390
officially hooked, and we absolutely love
them. So we're gonna do a little bit more

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.300
on packing soon we're gonna talk
about the difference here rolling and

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.209
packing luggage

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.260
and go into a little bit more depth on
packing cubes but wanted to give you a

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.150
sneak peek

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.150
with our first experience with packing
cubes.
