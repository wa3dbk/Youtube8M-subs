00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.130
Hi this is Matt on behalf of Expert Village
and today we're going to learn how to make

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:12.990
my slow cooked chicken with garlic ranch potatoes.
As you can see I have a lot of stuff around

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.679
here. I have my waste bowl here, I got this
bowl, this Tupperware where I'm going to put

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:24.390
all of my ingredients together as I cut them,
so we'll just keep that covered for now. Right

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.999
now what I'm going to do is- I also got my
trusty cutting board here, a nice big one.

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:36.230
What I'm going to do is cut these potatoes,
like so, just like that. I'm going to try

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:45.360
to make three pieces out of these, so one,
two, three. Then I'm going to throw that into

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.120
my Tupperware bowl. With each have try to
make three pieces out of each half. On a slant,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.360
one, then right down the middle, two, then
you have three pieces right there, I'm going

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.830
to throw that in. Let?s do a few more of these.
We're going to cut this in half, like so.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:09.390
Now this is actually a little bigger, so we
may even get more out of this one, so we're

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.520
going to cut that on a slant like this, one
and then in half, I can even do this one in

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.490
half again, you see what I mean, and actually
even one more. We just want smaller pieces,

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:31.049
like so. Throw that in there and do the same
here, on a slant, one, two. These are pretty

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.100
good right here, good size. This one is a
little big, so I'm just going to go down this

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:44.240
one more time and cut that one in half. Let?s
do a couple more, in the middle, take one

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:53.200
half and put it on a slant, and right down
the middle of that one, if it's still to big,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:06.020
one more, just like that.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.580
It doesn't matter actually how you cut them,
you just want to get bite size pieces, like

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:37.760
so. Let?s do one last one here. There you
have it. These are the proper sizes that we

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.700
want for our garlic ranch potatoes. I'm going
to finish the rest of these potatoes and we

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.900
will see you on the next step.
