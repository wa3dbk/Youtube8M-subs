00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.580
Somewhere along the way games of the 'endless'
variety started the lose their way, opting

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.020
to focus on short, repetitive runs that often
feature missions to offset the lack of actual

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.510
gameplay and, at times, luck required to advance.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.670
Tiny Plane by PowPowGames and Chillingo harkens
back to a simpler time when endless games

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.860
played fair by quickly adjusting its challenge
to the individual player.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.530
Whether you're collecting fruit or coins,
in Tiny Plane your objective is to not run

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.610
out of fuel or crash for as long as possible.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.899
Along the way you'll have the opportunity
to run in to various bonuses, including the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.280
ability to switch to a new plane, while also
needing to hazards including not only lightning-filled

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.999
clouds and mines, but also anvils and balloons.

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:53.729
The last two are a surprisingly clever addition
as they disable one of the controls temporarily

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.030
(down and up for the balloon and anvil respectively).

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.539
This presents an obvious hazard when faced
with walls of mines to avoid, but a far more

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.860
subtle one when bonuses you want float by
and you instinctively attempt to fly towards

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.670
them... only to smack in to another hazard
you would have otherwise avoided.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.870
Fuel also presents another interesting modifier
to the gameplay as you'll slowly run out over

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.880
time, but if you time your decent just right
you can refill at an air-strip on the ground.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.720
Squeezing every last chunk of fruit or coin
in order to boost your score means you may

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.290
miss out and plummet to the ground.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.150
In a last surprising twist, despite featuring
an in-game currency to purchase new planes

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.690
there are no In-App Purchases to top-up your
coffers - everything has to be earned the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.390
old-fashioned way.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.870
There's something about Tiny Plane's simplicity
and honesty that makes it appealing - the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.810
fun and colorful vibe is infectious and despite
crashing and burning it's easy to hit replay

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.280
over and over.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.171
Of course the usual longevity problems associated
with repetitive play apply, but Tiny Plane

00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:57.260
proves to be a great replacement for any other
distracting game you might be playing right

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:04.920
now.
