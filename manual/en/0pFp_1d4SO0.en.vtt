00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.750
Kevin and I started Sustainable Surf because we saw a real need for the conversation about

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.690
sustainability to be taking place within surf culture and the surfing industry.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.240
(Michael Stewart, Co-Founder Sustainable Surf) Before this there was no one that was really focused on,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.960
“how do we make surfing and surf culture sustainable in and of itself?”

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.440
And we figured if we could get everyone talking about the same issue and getting that conversation started, 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.500
we could get surfers and surfing pointed in the right direction to become part of the solution.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.250
Sustainable Surf has been growing by leaps and bounds since we first started back in 2011.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.760
We started off with a Deep Blue Surfing Event program for surfing contests.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.420
We've added a Styrofoam recycling program, we’re now verifying the use of greener chemistry and better materials for surfboards 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.100
and the sky’s really the limit with where we’re going.

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.539
This last year was huge for us.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.020
We got a lot more press, and we added some great new athlete ambassadors 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:07.200
like Alex Grey, Greg Long, Rob Machado, Dave Wassel, who all help us tell the story of sustainability and surfing through a way more compelling lens.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.299
We started the Deep Blue Surfing Event program back in 2011 as a challenge to ourselves and to professional surfing.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.319
Was it really possible to run a world tour level surfing event in a way that caused minimal environmental impact, 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:22.799
while also producing a positive benefit for the local community?

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.119
Our relationship with Volcom started back in 2012 for the Fiji Pro.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.640
We took what we learned there back to the Volcom Pipe Pro 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.500
and that’s where we really raised the bar and were able to look at all the categories that we had in our standard.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.620
We met them and exceeded them, and what we learned at the [Volcom] Pipe Pro, 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.700
we actually took to the US Open, to the Quik Pro in France, to the Triple Crown Series,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:55.060
and what’s great to see is that this focus towards sustainability for surfing events has been growing and expanding and it’s now taking on a life of its own.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.800
We all need to start working together so that this transformation happens a lot quicker.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.990
Because the issues and problems that we actually face are that big, they’re that important.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.580
And what we’re trying to do is to catalyze
that change and the only way we can actually get this to go at the level of speed

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.840
 and the need is to actually get the industry to start working together and with us

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.340
and with everyone else, and to become an active player in this as opposed to a more passive one which is how it’s been.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:38.540
Sustainable Surf is focused on one big idea. It’s a transformed surf culture and everybody in it into a powerful force for protecting the ocean playground.
