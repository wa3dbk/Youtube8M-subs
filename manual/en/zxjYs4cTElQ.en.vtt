00:00:08.935 --> 00:00:11.851
Finally, the news they have been waiting
for arrives.

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:19.123
The Dr. Currie team
from Canada discovers a great fossil.

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:28.685
- What is it?
- Bone.

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:40.276
It's beautiful!

00:00:40.903 --> 00:00:44.608
The lower jaw of an adolescent
Tarbosaurus.

00:00:44.608 --> 00:00:49.369
A Tarbosaurus skull
is a very rare finding.

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:51.384
during our expedition...

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:59.600
Through leg or foot bones,
we were able to recognize its existence,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.504
but a skull wasn't discovered.

00:01:02.504 --> 00:01:06.576
Therefore, we're all excited about
the uncovered jaw and skull,

00:01:06.576 --> 00:01:13.277
as if we had discovered gold in a desert.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.646
The discovery of a jaw, a first in ten days,
encourages the team.

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:28.394
&lt;i&gt;Dr. Philip Currie, Dept. of Biological Sciences Univ. of Alberta, Canada&lt;/i&gt;
The bones in fact come out of cliff,
all along through here.

00:01:28.394 --> 00:01:30.156
And because of that,

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:34.093
we know that the skull had fallen apart
when the animal died.

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:37.716
And have been scattered little bit
in the stream.

00:01:37.716 --> 00:01:41.738
So now what we have to do is to try
to find as many bones as we can

00:01:41.738 --> 00:01:43.838
of the skull of this Tarbosaurus.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:51.337
The sediments that contain fossils
in this area are soft,

00:01:51.337 --> 00:01:54.421
so excavation with simple tools
is possible.

00:02:03.025 --> 00:02:04.762
To dig the scattered bones,

00:02:04.762 --> 00:02:08.213
they must dig through the surface
 as far down as possible.

00:02:13.345 --> 00:02:15.974
Seven members got stuck to the excavation work.

00:02:19.874 --> 00:02:25.030
A part of its neck vertebra is discovered
2m away from its jaw.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.722
&lt;i&gt;Dr. Philip Currie, Dept. of Biological Sciences Univ. of Alberta, Canada&lt;/i&gt;
These are big dinosaurs
when they grow up.

00:02:29.722 --> 00:02:34.577
This particular individuals of small one,
you can see that from a neck vertebra.

00:02:34.577 --> 00:02:39.136
But nevertheless,
it has a balance problem.

00:02:39.136 --> 00:02:43.828
It's walking on tiny legs like a titter tot.

00:02:43.828 --> 00:02:47.683
Its body is too heavy,
it's going to fall on its face.

00:02:47.683 --> 00:02:54.468
So tyrannosaurs and all relatives
had basically pneumatized its bones

00:02:54.468 --> 00:02:58.440
and it made its bones hallow
and air-filled.

00:03:00.157 --> 00:03:03.484
Didn't I tell you I'm quite heavy?
I weigh about 6 tons.

00:03:03.484 --> 00:03:06.096
I also have a heavy head...

00:03:06.096 --> 00:03:08.609
On top of that, I walk on two legs.

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.879
Thus, I emptied the bones from the neck
down to the ninth tail bone.

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.935
It was an attempt to decrease
my weight.

00:03:13.935 --> 00:03:17.020
It's just like how it is for birds.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.777
The excavation process continued for 5 days.

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:27.077
They dig aslope over 1 meter deep.

00:03:27.077 --> 00:03:31.065
Unfortunately, a complete skeleton
is not discovered.

00:03:34.565 --> 00:03:38.143
Instead, they secure Tarbosaurus' teeth,
neck vertebrae,

00:03:40.124 --> 00:03:42.872
and part of its skull.

00:03:56.404 --> 00:04:00.200
When it's time for the team to return,
the base camp becomes busy.
