00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.549
In this clip, we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure to replace your engine's

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.389
timing belt and water pump. In this step we're
going to talk about the proper service procedure

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.120
for removing your engine's harmonic balancer.
What I have laid out here in front of me are

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.369
the tools required in order to remove the
bolt, and pull the harmonic balancer off of

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.080
the end of the crankshaft. This is a harmonic
balancer puller, and I'll show you how that

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.199
works here in just a moment. What you're going
to do is take a ratchet with the appropriate

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:37.560
size socket, and put it on the nut or the
bolt for your harmonic balancer right there.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.780
What you're going to want to do is since the
engine will turn some is not try to use static

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.370
leverage. You're going to want to use an impact
with a hammer to take and break that bolt

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.280
loose, just like so. Once you have it broken
loose, most of the time they'll spin right

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:00.490
out by hand,
right there. That is the harmonic balancer

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.970
bolt. Now, you would think it would just come
off, but it doesn't. It's actually squeezed

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.010
on, just like a machine fit. So we're, that
we're, that is where our puller comes into

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.930
play. Now the puller, this is your typical
three jaw puller, it takes and hooks onto

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.990
the inside of the balancer, the drive through
will run through that way and apply pressure

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.600
on the end of the crankshaft, and as it tightens
it will pull that pulley off. We'll go ahead

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.710
and demonstrate that for you right now. Your
kit is going to come with some of these little

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.990
pegs, like so. They're going to slide inside
and bottom out. That's exactly what you're

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.550
going to be pushing against right there. You
can see how the bolt's hollow. You're going

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.960
to line right up on there just like so. What
you're going to do is go ahead and start our

00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:02.090
bolt.
All right, the three legs of the puller are

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:13.480
going to fit into the inside of the pulley,
and let's take and slip them into position.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.650
Once you have the three jaws of your puller
in place, you can go ahead and hand tighten

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.280
down the drive screw. Once you have your puller
hand tight, you can go ahead and slip on your

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.930
ratchet and the appropriate socket. Now, you're
going to use this same method for removing

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.459
it, or for pulling your pulley as you did
with removing the bolt. As you can see, I

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.940
can turn the engine over like so if I just
take a real easy turn on it. What you're going

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.140
to do is run it down, and eventually you may
have to begin tapping it or even using a small

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:52.760
hammer. All right, you're going to continue
tightening it down until the pulley is pulled

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:02.660
all the way off of the end of the crankshaft.
All right, you're going to continue tightening

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:11.190
down your puller until it's free, right like
so. Gonna' take and slip your puller off,

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.700
remove your pushpin, and slide the harmonic
balancer out of the way. That is the proper

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.060
service procedure for removing your engine's
harmonic balancer.
