Hello! My name is Denise Robinson, and on
behalf of expertvillage.com, I am here to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.970
talk about consignment shops and garage sales.
In this segment we are going to talk about

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:33.620
hats. These hats are found at a consignment
shops. We’ll start with this one. This is

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:47.449
a black hat that is kind of in the 20s style.
It is felt; any time that you find felt, you

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:55.980
want to make sure, because of the material,
it wears easy in small spots and starts to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:06.150
get like little holes. You just want to make
sure that you check the inside for the liner,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:16.600
to make sure that it is not nasty; just because
it is used items, that does not mean that

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:27.610
you have to buy nasty items. Just make sure
it is clean; and on the outside, if it keeps

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.140
the shape. With felt, people would like to
throw it in a washing machine, which is a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.990
no-no because it shrinks and it loses shape.
If you want to get this hat, you can put it

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.270
in the cleaners, and make sure that it is
clean and it retains its shape. For a straw,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:59.440
just want to make sure that it has its stiffness;
or if it is a floppy straw hat, that is not

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:10.110
worn in any spots. Again check the liner on
the inside, that is clean, and no sweat marks,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:22.141
this is a corduroy type hat, men’s style;
and again check for the shapes to make sure

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:34.819
it retains its shape, and inside it is clean.
And last but not least this is a vintage pillbox

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:44.469
hat, slightly higher to give that Russian
look, kind of circa, around Jacquelyn Kennedy

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:51.349
O’Nassis. Found this at a consignment shop
for $10; it is in mint condition, but it did

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:58.609
have a little slight wear hole. And it is
up to the buyer if they want to purchase something

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:04.669
that has a slight flaw in it; if you can deal
with that flaw go with it, if you cannot pass

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.069
it up, and maybe you could find something
else somewhere.
