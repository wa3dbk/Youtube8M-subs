00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.680
Marco, that's the third game out the way as well.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.480
And the 0-0 scoreline has no bearing on things because we were already through.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:15.520
Yes, we're still a bit disappointed though because the lads squandered a hatful of chances.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:25.360
That is a little disappointing but at least they went into it in the right frame of mind,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.720
they always tried to play good football against a team that really didn't do anything at all.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.040
Sometimes if you don't get that little bit of luck,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.040
or if you're not quite clinical enough,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.680
you can end up with a result like this.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.560
A quick assessment of these first three games?

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.520
Good. We know we're going into the knockout stage now where it really starts to matter,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:59.040
so we have to get our energy back and come through the games that will enable us to reach the final.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.720
So Daniele, you've reached your first goal.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.880
Qualification was already in the bag but you finished the group with seven points.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.680
Yeah, obviously it was important for us to go through as seeds.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.680
And we managed that, even though we didn't get the three points today.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:22.800
The 0-0 doesn't really do us justice but we achieved our target and that's the main thing.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.240
What shape are Juventus in going into the last 16?

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:36.720
We're fired up, definitely, and very ambitious because we want to go all the way â€“ and we're confident we can pull it off.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.040
We've got a good group of players here and we're totally up for it,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.120
determined to get through the next round and go as far as possible.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.800
So let's say we want the same Juventus team that we've seen over the last four months,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.680
when you haven't put a foot wrong.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:59.360
Yes, we have to keep on this path but without looking back too much,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.480
because what we've done up until now doesn't really count for an awful lot.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.440
What lies ahead is what matters, the games we have coming up, the last 16 and the ones after that if we get there.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.000
Last question, how are you finding it in your first year with Juventus Primavera?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.520
I'm really happy here. I've supported Juventus since I was a boy so... it's amazing.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:34.720
A dream come true. I'm enjoying it, even though I've had to adapt a bit tactically,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.960
because I always used to play in a four-man defence.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.680
But I quickly settled into the three-man system this year, whether I'm playing right, left or centre.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.920
So yeah, everything's going great!
