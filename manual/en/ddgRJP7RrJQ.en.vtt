I am Chris, an Australian who enjoys cooking and pair Aussie wines to my recipes.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But with my own personal twist, I'm going to cook it using Kangaroo meat I brought from Australia.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.900
Sisig - means "to snack on something sour"; usually refers to fruits, often unripe or half-ripe, sometimes dipped in salt and vinegar

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.500
Though its cheaper here, I'm still going to bargain anyways. :)

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Heat the pan...

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.900
First is the oil (I'm using olive oil)

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Then finely chopped salami

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.000
Next step is to fry the salami

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.900
...until its crispy.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.900
First is for the sisig to have its same texture with the original recipe.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Second is that the oil is already salami flavored.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
SautÃ© the garlic

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Next will be red onions

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.900
To add color to the dish..

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
then onion leeks

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.900
I just added this for a more appealing look. With a hint of green

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Its hot and I am really sweating. Haha

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Now I'm going to add the finger chili (green)

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.500
Its really important to cook the kangaroo meat well done

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Vegemite can be also used as a substitute of the soy sauce

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Last ingredient will be the lime.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Squeezing too much lime might over power the Sangiovese wine.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
....just to give a hint of the lime flavor into the dish.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.000
It really smells like Sisig now.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Now here's the Kangaroo sisig....and i'm looking at the wrong camera. Haha

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Taste time! and I always eat the finger chili :)

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.900
Its good, garlicky, and you can taste the onions..

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.900
I am really happy with this food pair.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Head of pork or pork head? Haha

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.800
You should join the tv contest "Foreignoy" (half foreigner/half filipino) in Eat Bulaga.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.000
...because you speak tagalog pretty well.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
...but they are so talented, they're much better at Tagalog than me.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
No. you really have a talent. You're so good at Tagalog.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
How much is the prize?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
150,000pesos!

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
My talent is cooking...

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
... here in my basket I have lots of vegetables..
