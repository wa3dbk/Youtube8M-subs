Hey folks welcome to my virgin kitchen it
is Barry here you are looking stonking I love

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.410
what you have done to your hair, todays recipe
is a meatball recipe the godfathers spaghetti

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.860
meatballs another movie food the last one
we did was the shrek gingerbread one which

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.820
a lot of you were loving and trying, we are
nearly there in terms of the kitchen renovation

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.980
this is going to be ripped out soon, how emotional
it is a little dangerous too, it is half term

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:31.670
there are kids running around there is one
here hello and another one here hello oh she

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.620
got so heavy, so once the kitchen is ready
I will be doing lots more cooking with kids

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.570
videos but at the moment it is a bit hazardous,
we are still going to plough through and do

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.440
these videos, including this amazing meatball
recipe so if you want to have a go hit pause

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.890
on the video when Phoebe goes �whah!��.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.829
�whah� ok they both did that cool.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.350
Alright so the kids have gone and sat back
down there hopefully you want to give it a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.230
go we have been joined by Boston right there,
what you do is put the garlic in the pan and

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.460
all that stuff the recipe straight from the
Godfather movie, give this a go.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.020
First thing you want to do is cook up your
meatballs and sausages ok so I used Italian

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.050
sausage which you can get in most uk supermarkets
it really does improve this dish no end, so

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.240
cook them in a pan with some olive oil until
nice and browned, rest on kitchen paper, if

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.180
you are a bloke watching this scene of snipping
the sausage is a little painful but just get

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.820
them into manageable bitesize pieces and leave
them to one side.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.530
Alright so using the pan we used for our sausages
there should be some oil leftover grab your

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.470
freshly chopped garlic and chuck it in there
keeping it moving for around two or three

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.880
minutes and as soon as you see it going brown
and releasing the flavours add in the tomatoes

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.900
we are using tinned whole tomatoes ok so dump
those in not chopped tomatoes ok they are

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.160
too watery we want it quite thick and also
our tomato puree, get it in there and give

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.460
it a darn good stir together.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.320
Tomato faste faste?!

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.640
Fest.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.600
With that all mixed in there you want to add
in the meatballs and sausage that we cooked

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.610
up earlier get it all dumped in there and
then coat in the tomato sauce looking so good

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.709
meanwhile to one side in a separate pan you
are going to cook up your spaghetti to package

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.819
instructions, that tomato mixture was looking
so good, I quickly turned the camera around

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.430
and caught boston dreaming about it.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.930
Haha caught you!

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:28.780
All we are going to do is simmer that mixture
for twenty minutes adding in some red wine,

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.730
do not worry that is just for flavour the
alcohol content does simmer off, so your kids

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.240
can have it, and also your sugar add that
in and mix it up until happy with the flavour

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.819
combination it should taste sensational, cook
your spaghetti off, then you basically need

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:43.819
to serve it up.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.570
Alright before we serve it up here are 3 shoutouts

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.329

dollop down big old piles of the meatballs

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.819

and let people see it there, so good, mixed

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.540
herbs on top and parmesan mixed together and
if you want a few basil leaves on the side.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.269
