00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.120
Hi.

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.120
It's Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.270
Today we're going to show you how to change
the water inlet valve on your washer and it's

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.019
a really easy job.

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.349
All we're going to need is a Phillips screwdriver
and a pair of slip-joint pliers.

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.200
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.510
Now before we begin this repair since we will
be working near some electrical circuits,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.890
we will need to disconnect the power to the
washer so simply unplug it.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.160
We are also going to have to pull it far enough
forward that we can access the fill hose connections

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.050
at the valve.Then we'll also need to turn
off the water supply for both hot and cold

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.210
and disconnect the inlet fill hoses.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.579
Then next on the front load model, we will
need to remove three screws across the back

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.510
of the console.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:01:02.199
There are Philips head screw.

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:09.320
The back cover for that console is held to
the main top with three little clips so may

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.670
or may not come off easily.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.480
You don't want to force it and potentially
break the clips.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.780
Just probably loose at the front and then
lift it up and away.You'll note there's three

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.200
little hooks that fit into rectangular slots
on the bottom.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.720
Then there are four tabs that engage the back
of the control panel on the top.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.540
We'll set that aside.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.320
Now next we need to remove three screws across
the back of the top panel.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:51.870
A hex head and a Phillips head, so you can
use the Phillips screwdriver to remove those.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:59.210
Then we're just going to pull back on that
top hole about an inch and it will lift away

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.460
from the cabinet.There are some keyhole slots
on both sides of that top panel that engage

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.289
two screws one on either side to hold it in
place.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.849
We'll set that aside.

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:20.760
We can locate the water valve.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.090
Now there are two sets of wire harnesses that
attach to that valve.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.969
We'll remove the wires from the terminals
on the valve.

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:48.109
Just take note the color of the wires so that
we can put them back on in the right position.Now

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.180
next we're going to remove a single Phillips
screw that holds the bowel to the back of

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.639
the cabinet.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:06.989
Then we're just going to slide that valve
to the right and that will unhook it from

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.170
the back of the panel.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.510
We can pull it through the opening.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.550
You can access this little spring clamp that
holds the outlet hose.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:27.159
Using our pliers we'll remove and slide that
spring clamp down onto the hose.

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:34.049
Just twist the valve free of that hose.There
may be a little water comes out of here.

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.670
We can discard the old valve.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.640
Now to install a new valve.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.669
We'll first start by inserting the outlet
of the valve into that hose.

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:55.620
We want to make sure that we rotate that on
the hose before we put the clamp on so that

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.139
we don't get any twists in it.

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:08.730
Next, take our pliers and slide that clamp
up onto the outlet portion of that valve.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:16.250
We'll slide it through the opening in the
back.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.610
Line it up and then push it to the left so
that it hooks on the left side.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:47.790
We'll reinstall the screw 
and the wire harness.Now we're ready to put

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.030
the main top on.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.560
Now when reinstalling the top, I want to make
sure that we line up the two keyhole slots

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.710
with those two shoulder screws on the side
of the cabinet.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.490
Just keep that front edge back all about an
inch from the back of the console and it should

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.960
sit right in place.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.770
Slide it forward and slide it forward.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.259
Then we'll install the three screws across
the back.

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:26.860
These are the hex head screws.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:49.060
Make sure we tighten these securely.Next,
we'll put the back of the console on.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.840
Now when installing the back of the console,
we want to line up these three hook tabs with

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.870
the rectangular openings in the main top.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:08.880
Make sure it's sitting flush on those and
slide it in at the very top into the back

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.919
of the control panel.

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:26.220
Install the three Phillips screws and hold
it in place.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:32.360
When tightening these screws make sure that
the edge of that back panel is flush against

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.080
the back of the control panel.I don't want
to force those clips.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:44.960
It should slide easily into place.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.340
Now we're ready to reconnect our fill hoses.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.419
Turn on the water supply to check for leaks
and then reconnect our power and our repair

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:53.419
is complete.

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:54.849
I told you it was an easy job.

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:57.219
Thanks for watching and good luck with your
repair.
