00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.340
The first step in making your Italian Panzanella
Salad is to start off with your bread. You

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.320
want to make sure that your oven is set to
400 degrees. We are going to toast the bread

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.680
and get out all that moisture from that bread.
So if you have stale bread or old bread, that

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.580
is good bread to use for this dish. What we
are going to do is I've got a really great

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.160
loaf of sour dough here. I am just going to
cut it in half so it is a little bit easier

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:34.350
for me to work with. I am going to cut good
size chunks of this sour dough bread here.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.280
And this is kind of a rustic salad. It is
really kind of what you have on hand. If you

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.179
don't have sour dough, then you can use Ciabatta,
you can use pekosa, white bread, wheat bread

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:53.699
really anything that is white. Alright we've
got that going and we are going to cut it

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:03.170
into chunks here. Again, the sizes doesn't
have to be the same. They are going to shrink

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:13.271
up a little bit when they bake. I am going
to place them on my sheet pan and use the

00:01:13.271 --> 00:01:18.630
other piece of my pekosa bread. I like to
use the bread knife when I cut the bread because

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.100
it has a serrated blade and it makes it easier
to cut through and saw through the bread instead

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:32.719
of just pushing it down like you would with
a chef's knife. And now we are going to cut

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:52.509
the other half of the French Sour Dough bread.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.549
The part of the purpose of the salad is we
are going to dry out all the moisture from

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.389
the bread and what we are going to do is replace
that moisture with the dressing and the bread

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:09.310
is going to soak up the flavor of the bread
and give it a really nice flavor. So it will

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.210
be kind of soft and a little flavor burst
of dressing as we take a bite into it with

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:27.060
the rest of your salad.
Okay now our bread is all nice and sliced.
