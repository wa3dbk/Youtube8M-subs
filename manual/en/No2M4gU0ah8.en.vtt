00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.350
Okay, right now we are ready to do our third
braid and have no worries about the thickness

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.549
up here and the thinness down here. It is
going to be just great. Always keep in mind

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.520
to keep your hair really tight and that is
going to help keep it centered. So we start

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:26.660
it the same with the three pieces and going
under make sure you get everything nice and

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:35.030
separate so that the braid will stay nice
and smooth. And cross under and really try

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.989
to keep your fingers nice and close to the
scalp. That is going to help you keep a good

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:46.879
grip and a good position. So just grab it
right there and keep grabbing right next to

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:53.940
the braid where it was. If you grab too tight,
your client will always let you know. So have

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.070
no worries about that. Just keep grabbing
and going underneath. Get all of that hair

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.619
out of your way. We will just keep working
down and as long as you keep all of your hair

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.939
held on real tight, you will see that it stays
centered going all the way down and as long

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.272
as it is in the middle, you have no worries
when you get to the thinner section of the

00:01:20.272 --> 00:01:30.670
hair. It will be right where it is suppose
to be. Just keep adding. The key to this hair

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.840
style is really in the parting. All braids
are the same. They are all done the same way.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.072
So, just keep this. Remember on that bottom
one to really pull that tight so that this

00:01:41.072 --> 00:01:51.890
can grab all of it. We are going to go ahead
and braid all the way down. And you see we've

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.500
got our nice third braid. And we are going
to keep doing this throughout the whole bottom

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.320
section. We are going to have a little bit
more fun on top. This is great for a base

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.649
for it to have braids hanging over these nice
straight braids on the back of the head.
