00:00:00.213 --> 00:00:02.548
&gt;&gt; But how can you break up with me?

00:00:02.548 --> 00:00:03.958
I love you!

00:00:03.958 --> 00:00:05.289
&gt;&gt; Shut up!

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:09.889
&gt;&gt; Anthony and Ian accidentally did a dance that was supposed to kill whoever did it.

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.719
They now believe they are dead.

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.528
And this is their life as ghosts.

00:00:18.048 --> 00:00:19.539
&gt;&gt; What's the matter, man?

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.196
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:00:21.196 --> 00:00:24.365
I just don't know how I'm going to deal with the fact that I'm dead.

00:00:24.365 --> 00:00:25.026
You know?

00:00:25.026 --> 00:00:25.847
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:00:25.847 --> 00:00:29.695
Well, I mean, whenever I have a problem, I just ask the big guy up there.

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:30.556
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:00:30.556 --> 00:00:31.455
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:31.455 --> 00:00:32.915
Hey, Dr. Phil.

00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:34.026
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:35.986
&gt;&gt; How do we cope with being dead?

00:00:35.986 --> 00:00:38.557
&gt;&gt; I think you guys need to talk to your loved ones.

00:00:38.557 --> 00:00:41.946
You know, get some closure and get on with your lives.

00:00:41.946 --> 00:00:42.867
&gt;&gt; You're right.

00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:44.487
I should go talk to my girlfriend.

00:00:44.487 --> 00:00:46.257
&gt;&gt; Well, that's a good place to start.

00:00:46.257 --> 00:00:47.717
&gt;&gt; Bye, thanks!

00:00:47.717 --> 00:00:50.077
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I got to see someone, too.

00:00:50.077 --> 00:00:51.620
Bye, Phil!

00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.396
&gt;&gt; Oh, no, I can't make it.

00:00:54.396 --> 00:00:55.429
I have work Saturday.

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:56.479
&gt;&gt; Masie!

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:58.020
Masie!

00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:00.050
Masie!

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.636
&gt;&gt; Oh, God.

00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:02.980
It's Anthony.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.307
I don't really want to talk to them.

00:01:05.307 --> 00:01:06.197
You know what?

00:01:06.197 --> 00:01:07.837
I'm just going to ignore him.

00:01:07.837 --> 00:01:11.396
Oh, did I tell you my puppy ran away?

00:01:11.396 --> 00:01:12.199
&gt;&gt; Masie.

00:01:12.199 --> 00:01:15.397
&gt;&gt; I miss him so much.

00:01:15.397 --> 00:01:17.836
I have not stopped crying since he left us.

00:01:17.836 --> 00:01:19.488
&gt;&gt; I miss you, too, Masie.

00:01:19.488 --> 00:01:22.986
I just wish I could hold you in my arms forever!

00:01:22.986 --> 00:01:26.265
[ Crying ].

00:01:26.265 --> 00:01:30.417
&gt;&gt; Listen, I know we've only known each other for such a short time.

00:01:30.417 --> 00:01:34.484
But you've touched my heart in a way that no one ever has.

00:01:34.484 --> 00:01:39.847
I just had to see you one more time, just to tell you how much I care for you.

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:43.983
&gt;&gt; There were couple things that I really didn't like about him, though.

00:01:43.983 --> 00:01:49.263
Like, first of all, he had really, really bad breath.

00:01:49.263 --> 00:01:53.784
And last week, he pooped on my new rug.

00:01:53.784 --> 00:01:55.685
&gt;&gt; How did she know that was me?

00:01:55.685 --> 00:01:56.713
&gt;&gt; You know what?

00:01:56.713 --> 00:02:00.423
Now that I think of it, I'm actually glad he's gone.

00:02:00.423 --> 00:02:03.272
I can finally get some peace and quiet.

00:02:03.272 --> 00:02:05.344
&gt;&gt; Thanks for breaking my heart, Macie.

00:02:05.344 --> 00:02:10.464
I hope your stupid Afro catches on fire and you're bald for the rest of your life.

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:12.718
[ Crying ].

00:02:12.718 --> 00:02:14.603
My life is ruined!

00:02:14.603 --> 00:02:17.183
[ Crying ].

00:02:17.183 --> 00:02:20.565
&gt;&gt; Look, you've been such an influence in my life.

00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:23.055
And you were there for me when no one else was.

00:02:23.055 --> 00:02:26.755
I just wanted to tell you how much I love you, Fabio.

00:02:26.755 --> 00:02:29.677
Shh, shh, don't say it.

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.746
Your perfectly blond flowing hair says it all.

00:02:34.427 --> 00:02:35.914
Oh, who am I kidding?

00:02:35.914 --> 00:02:38.034
Come here, you big lug!

00:02:42.513 --> 00:02:43.652
Fabio.

00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:48.734
&gt;&gt; Will Ian and Anthony ever get on with their lives?

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:51.660
Will Ian ever make out with the real -- oh, my God.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.577
That is -- that is -- I hope that is photoshopped.

00:02:54.577 --> 00:02:57.545
Tune in next week to find out.
