Welcome To Bachelor's Cooking

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.900
Today we will make you learn how to make " Egg Fried Rice"

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.480
For egg fried rice we will use some vegetables, eggs and cooked rice

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.360
So, what all we need for this Cabbage, Capsicum, Spring Onion, Ginger,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.717
Garlic, Black Pepper Powder, Salt, and since it is egg fried rice then we have eggs

00:00:28.717 --> 00:00:34.350
Apart from this we have Chilli Sauce, Soya Sauce, Vinegar. You can use Red Chilli Sauce if you want.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.120
So, let us start making Egg Fried Rice, First of all take almost 1 Spoon of oil in a pan

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:47.822
And as i have to told you that Chinese cooking is done on high flame

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.800
So, always put your flame on high volume

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.900
And the vegetables we use in this cooking we don't need to cook them completely or over

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.700
they should bit crispy then only it gives taste

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.600
So, let the oil get heat up and then we will proceed further

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.540
Oil is heat up and now first of all we will add this finely chopped ginger almost 1 spoon of it

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.900
along with add almost 1 Spoon of Garlic

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.860
Ginger-Garlic is cooked now we wilt add  Cabbage

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.360
almost 3-4 Spoon of Cabbage and then we have to toss it

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.060
after tossing the cabbage , add capsicum

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.400
almost 2-1/2 spoon of capsicum and give it a toss

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.800
and now add some salt

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.560
along with some soya sauce

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.140
almost 1 Spoon of Soya Sauce

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.860
and some Chilli Sauce

00:02:26.177 --> 00:02:30.957
now we will add 1 Pinch of Black pepper powder

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.480
and along with some vinegar just to add some sourness

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.360
Few drops are required only, and give it a toss

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.540
after tossing, the egg is to be break like this

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.600
after breaking it , it has to be mixed

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.360
so here i have added the egg and now give it a mix like this

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.900
similarly we will add the second add in it

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.980
after adding egg we have to mix it

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.880
and now we will add these cooked rice

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.540
and give them a mix

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.940
and after mixing give some more toss

00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:45.791
and give it a perfect mix

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.260
and now we will add some more salt

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:04.500
and along with some Spring Onions, will add some now and some will use for garnishing... give it mix once

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:15.780
and after mixing, put the flame off. And the very simple Egg Fried Rice is ready

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.420
Isn't it easy, so must try this.
