00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.090
[Music]
[Becca] Hi, I'm Becca.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.090
[Joe] And I'm Joe.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.090
[Jenni] I'm Jenni.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.140
[Monica] And I'm Monica.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.880
And we're here to tell you about
writing your interview questions

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.210
and a script for your interview.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.720
[Joe] In the last podcast we
discussed how to approach doing

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.330
research on your narrator and
any topics that may come

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.810
up in the interview.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.470
Now you are ready to write
your interview questions.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.320
[Jenni] These are the steps
you're gonna need to follow.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.260
Take a quick look and we're going
to review them in more detail.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.420
[Music]
[Jenni] You want to start by

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.510
brainstorming as many questions
as you can think of.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.370
Sometimes interviewers do
this individually and sometimes

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.610
it is done with an entire class
or group of people.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.489
The more questions you can generate,
the easier it will be to put

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.880
together an interview script
that fits your specific narrator.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.649
[Monica] Let’s start with some
general guidelines for writing

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.810
good questions for an interview.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.450
The first thing to remember
is that questions should be

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.540
short and easy to understand.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.190
[Becca] Although your questions
should be short, you want

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.030
the answers to be long.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.300
The idea is that your narrator
should do most of the talking.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.760
With that in mind, ask questions that
will require more than a one-word answer.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.610
Don’t ask questions that can be
answered with a simple yes or no.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.840
[Joe] For example, instead of asking,
“Did you become a citizen?” you could

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.910
ask, “Why did you become a citizen?”

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.380
[Jenni] You want your questions
to be open-ended beginning with

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.450
one of the five W's and an H.
Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.380
Or with statements like,
"Tell me about" or "Describe."

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.149
[Monica] Make sure you are
asking neutral questions.

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.630
Neutral questions are phrased in
such a way that the narrator does

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.429
not know what your personal views
are, and does not feel pressured

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.310
to answer one way or another.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.399
This interview is a chance for the
narrator to tell his or her story

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.690
without being influenced by what the
interviewer, that's you, thinks.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.620
[Becca] You will have done
research on many topics related

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.970
to experiences that your narrator
had in his or her lifetime.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.160
Use that knowledge to ask questions
that will allow your narrator to

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.920
talk about how his or her life
intersected with major things going

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.210
on during that time period.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.340
[Joe] And make sure to
get specific details.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.120
Ask questions that establish
the narrator's connection to

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.530
important events in history,
and ask for specific names,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.890
dates, and places.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.000
[Jenni] In addition, people
generally think chronologically

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.060
about their life, so you should
try to ask your questions

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.379
in chronological order.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.370
[Monica] Once you have a long list
of possible interview questions,

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.050
you want to review them and organize
them into logical categories.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.519
This will help you narrow down
your list and select those questions

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.160
that you think would be best
for your interview script.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.769
[Music]
[Becca] It is also a good idea

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.221
to send the list of possible
interview questions to your

00:03:07.221 --> 00:03:09.870
narrator before the interview.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.349
This allows him or her to think
about the questions ahead of time,

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.170
and to pull out any artifacts
or photos that might be

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.489
relevant to the interview.

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.519
[Music]
[Jenni] Any interview is basically

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.420
broken into three separate parts:
the beginning, the middle, and the end.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.750
The beginning section will include
simple questions like those

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.420
relating to narrator's background.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.750
These questions should be easy for
the narrator to answer and will

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.500
set your narrator at ease as you
move on to more difficult questions.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.859
You can always use memory clues, like
photos, to help the narrator get started.

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.060
When looking at a photo, ask the
narrator to first describe a person’s

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.989
appearance, and then ask for a
description of the person’s

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.319
character or personality traits.

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.090
[Monica] Next you will move on to
the middle part of your interview.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.170
The middle section is where you will
ask most of your interview questions

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.689
following the script that you created.

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.620
The middle section is also where
you ask the deeper questions to

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.359
really get at the narrator's story
and how it related to important

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.370
events and eras in history.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.850
[Becca] Finally, the end section
of your interview will be mostly

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.580
thought questions.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.610
These thought
questions ask the narrator to

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.080
reflect on experiences that give
their views about things that have

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.250
happened in their lifetime.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.840
You'll probably have covered a lot
of different topics by the end of

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.400
the interview so this is a chance
to the narrator to sort of summarize

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.290
his or her life experiences by
answering questions like, "Of

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.130
all the experiences that you've
had in your life, which do you

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.850
think shaped you the most?"

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.800
[Joe] Always remember the purpose
of your interview is not ask

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.639
your narrator for information that
you could find in other sources

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.639
like newspapers and books.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.100
Instead, you want to record
information that will add to

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.099
what is already out there.

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.580
This is the purpose of oral history.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.349
To add this person's first hand
accounts to our historical records.

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.169
[Jenni] Let's review some of the
main points on writing interview

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.830
questions and a script.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.220
Interview questions should be
brief and easy to understand,

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.150
neutral, non-controversial.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.060
Open-ended questions that start
with things like, "Tell me about"

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.060
or "Describe."

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.240
Interview questions
should also require more than a

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:40.220
one word answer, begin with who,
what, when, where, why and how.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.440
Establish the narrator's connection
to important events in history.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.660
Be asked in chronological order.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.100
Ask for specific names, dates, places.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.669
[Monica] Follow this basic outline for
assembling your questions into a script.

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:02.100
The beginning, which is your introduction
and simple questions about the narrator,

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.789
the middle, which is most of your
questions and deeper questions about

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:10.020
the narrator's experiences, and the
end which is the thought questions.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.729
[Music]
[Becca] In the next podcast we'll

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:16.480
be discussing tips for conducting
the interview itself.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.830
[Joe] You've got some great
questions.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.419
Now you need to
figure out how to ask them.

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:22.419
[All] Goodbye!
