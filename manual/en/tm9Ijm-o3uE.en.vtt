00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:26.146
Dr Anna Reading : I think there are a number of advantages

00:00:26.146 --> 00:00:28.514
to students doing our particular courses.

00:00:28.514 --> 00:00:31.881
The first is that its project centred so it’s not that

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:37.268
we are delivering a prescribed body of knowledge in sort of set packages,

00:00:37.268 --> 00:00:41.819
its rather that applicants come to us with a particular project in mind

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:45.349
that they want to do and then they have the resources of the university

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:49.667
both in terms of tutorial support and in terms of media

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:52.640
and theatre facilities to help them with that project.

00:00:54.404 --> 00:00:57.702
Andi Studer : I’m Andi Studer and I completed an MA in creative media

00:00:57.702 --> 00:00:59.420
at the London South Bank University.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.110
I did initiative arts projects and music projects on the side of studying

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.754
so I had a practical experience as well as a theoretical experience

00:01:08.754 --> 00:01:11.819
with the course and that helped me to get employment.

00:01:13.816 --> 00:01:15.488
Chris Christodoulou : My name is Chris Christodolou,

00:01:15.488 --> 00:01:19.343
I’m doing a PhD in the Faculty of Arts and Human Sciences.

00:01:19.343 --> 00:01:22.547
My PhD is on the London Drum and Bass Scene

00:01:22.547 --> 00:01:27.005
so it’s within the area of Pop Music Studies, Music Sociology and Culture Studies.

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.908
South Bank was kind of ground breaking actually

00:01:29.908 --> 00:01:33.716
in terms of opening up that kind of area for academic research

00:01:33.716 --> 00:01:40.260
and Pop Music Studies is certainly a developing area at London South Bank,

00:01:40.264 --> 00:01:43.650
so that was my reason really for doing the PhD here.

00:01:43.654 --> 00:01:45.560
Chris Mitchell : So thank you all for being here

00:01:45.558 --> 00:01:49.780
this is my final dissertation performance show...

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:55.870
Dr Anna Reading : What’s you know very positive about this particular department

00:01:55.868 --> 00:02:02.420
is that the staff that teach our students 
 are all professionals in their own right.

00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:05.850
They are professionals who are active in their own industries

00:02:05.852 --> 00:02:10.870
as well as being, many of us sort of world class

00:02:10.868 --> 00:02:14.350
in terms of the levels of research activity that we do.
