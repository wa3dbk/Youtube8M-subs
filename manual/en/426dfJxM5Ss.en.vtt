The 5 Top Internet Search Secrets When Shopping
for Houston Storage Units.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.700
These five top internet search secrets let
you tame the ferocious internet beast when

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.339
shopping for storage in the Houston area.

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:25.439
Storage Search Secret #5
Houston Self Storage "Web Portal" sites are

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.999
generally incomplete.

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:32.320
They usually don’t include the large players
like public storage, private mini storage,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.140
security self storage or uncle bob storage,
and there are other concerns as well.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.330
“Web Portal” sites are websites that aggregate
data from many different self storage businesses

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.690
and websites across the internet.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.120
While they promot themselves as providing
a “one-stop-shop” for locating a storage

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.120
facility near you,
don’t be misled too quickly.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.280
While these websites do offer a wide range
of facilities, they by no means, offer a complete

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.640
list.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.940
Here is why.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.110
First of all, Storage businesses must pay
to be listed.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.510
Because these “portal” websites are in
the business of making money,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.420
they charge storage businesses a good deal
of advertising fees to be listed on their

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.530
websites.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.860
Many smaller storage companies cannot afford
the high price that is charged to be listed

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.840
on these sites and so they are omitted.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.580
You may miss out on a nearby facility that
would have been perfect for you.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.280
And for some of these portal sites, they “favor”
storage businesses

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.560
that are willing to pay even higher advertising
fees, and list those businesses higher in

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.970
the search results.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.580
So the search results you receive on these
sites may not, in fact, be the best facilities

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.390
for you or the ones nearest you.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.700
They may simply be the businesses that were
willing to pay the highest fees to the web

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.850
portal owner.
