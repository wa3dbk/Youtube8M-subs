[ Silence ]

00:00:09.136 --> 00:00:11.836
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Jess Chen,
Class of 2012 and I'm here

00:00:11.836 --> 00:00:14.226
with Yolanda Griffith,
the new assistant coach

00:00:14.226 --> 00:00:16.016
for Dartmouth Women's
Basketball Team.

00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:19.466
She won 2 Olympic gold
medals and a WNBA title

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.456
and is considered one of
the best players ever.

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:24.626
So why don't you teach me a
thing or two and she's smooth.

00:00:25.136 --> 00:00:26.326
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'll do my best.

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:30.426
&gt;&gt; So when you were making your
decision to move into coaching,

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:31.536
what attracted you to Dartmouth?

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.136
&gt;&gt; What attracted me

00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:36.086
to Dartmouth was the
winning tradition.

00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:38.176
I'm always known
about the Ivy League.

00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:41.206
Went to 17 Ivy League
championships,

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.146
get into the NCAA 7 years,

00:00:43.386 --> 00:00:45.156
I think it's time
for us to give back.

00:00:45.676 --> 00:00:47.916
&gt;&gt; As a new coach, what
are you trying to instill

00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:49.726
or teach the Dartmouth
players on the team?

00:00:49.906 --> 00:00:50.446
&gt;&gt; Discipline.

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:54.086
The things that you do
on the basketball is all

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:58.476
about discipline, defense,
offense, hard work, dedication,

00:00:58.476 --> 00:01:01.056
the things you learn on the
basketball court will help you

00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:04.476
in the long run in life
and prepare you in school

00:01:04.476 --> 00:01:05.876
and prepare you as
you get older.

00:01:06.176 --> 00:01:08.176
&gt;&gt; You've been here for
a full 2 months, so far,

00:01:08.176 --> 00:01:10.646
what's impressed you about Coach
Wielgus and the team so far?

00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:14.226
&gt;&gt; What impressed me about
Chris Wielgus is, you know,

00:01:14.226 --> 00:01:16.526
being a veteran,
the old school style

00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:19.066
and the new school
style of basketball.

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.286
She teaches me a lot of
things on and off the court.

00:01:21.426 --> 00:01:23.336
I mean I played basketball
for so many years,

00:01:23.406 --> 00:01:27.226
but the transition for me to
become an assistant coach,

00:01:27.636 --> 00:01:29.166
she's helped me a
lot and Aaron--

00:01:29.306 --> 00:01:31.656
even Aaron our other
assistant coach,

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:33.696
they've been showing
me the way with data.

00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:37.256
I mean it's so much outside of
basketball that you have to do

00:01:37.256 --> 00:01:40.996
as an assistant coach and as a
head coach and we gel together,

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:44.736
we connect with each other,
and I'm in a good situation.

00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:45.346
I love it.

00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:47.436
&gt;&gt; The first game of
the season is coming up,

00:01:47.436 --> 00:01:48.666
what have you enjoyed
about working

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:49.636
with the Dartmouth players?

00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:51.606
&gt;&gt; It's been a blast.

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:54.166
The reason why I enjoy these
players is because they're

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:58.446
like bug-eyed, open minded,
so eager to learn a game

00:01:58.846 --> 00:02:00.026
on the level that I've played.

00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:03.066
Just play-- all these players,
they're like absorbing,

00:02:03.316 --> 00:02:05.616
engage in the things that we're
teaching them and practice

00:02:05.616 --> 00:02:06.536
in a shooting practice.

00:02:06.646 --> 00:02:08.436
We got a shoot around
2 o'clock and it's--

00:02:09.086 --> 00:02:11.156
I got so many different drills
for them and they're like--

00:02:11.326 --> 00:02:14.206
it's like I'm feeding them like
some candy and they're taking it

00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:15.526
and they're drawing
it right now.

00:02:15.916 --> 00:02:17.876
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for
taking the time to talk to us

00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:19.586
and good luck with the
rest of the season.

00:02:20.136 --> 00:02:21.566
Come out and cheer
for the Big Green

00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:28.496
on November 30th during their
first home game versus UNH.

00:02:29.356 --> 00:02:30.846
&gt;&gt; Booyah, good job.
