00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.609
Hi. I'm Andrea and I'm the senior designer
here at Beadaholique.com.

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:16.939
In this video I'm going to show you how to wire
wrap a briolette.

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:18.910
To make a wire wrapped briolette,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.660
first start with a piece of wire

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.349
that's about three and four inches long.

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.949
Here we're using twenty four gauge silver
colored craft wire.

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.789
Thread your briolette on

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.740
so the it's about midway.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.520
And you're going to bend both

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.850
pieces of wire

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.520
towards the center

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.690
until they cross.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.430
Like this.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.790
Taking your chain nose plier,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.329
bend the top of the wire upward

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.010
so that it's

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.090
standing 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.580
straight up.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.220
Then you're going to bend

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.340
the other wire

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.940
sideways so that it's at a ninety degree
angle

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.710
from the top wire.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.590
Using your fingers

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.090
or if you prefer

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.340
your chain nose pliers,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.420
hold the briolette

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.320
and wrap

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.320
about two times.

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.760
And you can trim off

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.660
that excess wire using your flush cutters.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.380
Now you have

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.380
what looks like this.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.780
You're going to take your round nose pliers.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.780
You're going to create a wrapped wire loop.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.610
You're going to wrap the wire around until it meets up

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.739
with the other

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.059
wire wraps.

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:14.969
Then you can trim

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:19.449
that off with your flush cutters.

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.359
And tighten any loose ends

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:28.409
with your chain nose pliers.

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.609
That's the simple

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.579
variation.

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:32.750
Now some people

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.429
like to wrap the wire

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:37.549
around and around and around

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.469
so that it covers the entire top part of the briolette.

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.049
To do that

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:49.049
you would start with a longer piece of wire.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.939
Thread you're briolette on,

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.939
You're going to do the same thing.

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.499
You bend both

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:06.499
parts upward.

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:11.989
You still have your top part that becomes
the loop

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:12.779
but then

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:15.159
the other part,

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.279
instead of wrapping upward,

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:20.799
you're going to start wrapping

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.899
downward.

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:27.559
You're going to continue wrapping

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:29.609
and it doesn't have to be neat.

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.329
This is kind of a

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.409
natural look.

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.819
You just wrap and wrap

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.929
until you get

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:47.899
to where the hole is in the briolette.

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:52.949
And you start working your way back up.

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.299
The you would just complete it the way you would

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:55.989
complete

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.249
a regular

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:06.249
wrapped briolette. 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:14.529
Make one more wrapped wire loop at the top.

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:29.909
Trim off excess wire.

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:35.629
And there you have it.
