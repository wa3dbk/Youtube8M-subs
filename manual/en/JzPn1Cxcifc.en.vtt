00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.560
Welkomen to Jerez.
Bienvenuti Jerez.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.239
Bienvenudo de Jerez.
Welcome to the Red Bull Rookies Cup.

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:30.199
I'm so excited but also nervous because it
is the first time ever to be in the GP Paddock

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.620
to be honest and the KTM bike is fantastic,
the Team. I can't believe everything is happening.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.820
It is all a dream. To ride a KTM on the MotoGP
circuit is absolutely amazing.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.580
Beautiful day here in Jerez for the first
round of the 2010, Red Bull MotoGP Rookies

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.680
Cup. And what an exciting race we have got
in store.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.280
Same Qualifying as last year and last year
I managed to put off two podiums.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.049
My plan is to just maybe follow the group
and then like maybe like the last two laps

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.450
try to get up to first and just to like hold
it.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.450
Always mistakes start. So tomorrow I will
good start.

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:34.969
The first race of 2010. The lights go out
and away they go. 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:43.729
There are at least 10 guys battling for the lead now. Still 12 laps
to go. So they are now touching. Now touching

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.619
and that is taking the first 3 of them ride.
That is taking the first three of them out

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.329
of contention. Well that really is messing
each other up. Hiura takes the advantage and

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.329
behind him comes Danny Kent. He is going to
pay dearly to Daniel Ruiz for that mistake.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.200
Out on the main street they are all on the
slipstream there. Who has got the metal to

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.060
get it together. To get himself in the position
for that last corner breaking maneuver into

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.209
the hairpin. It looks to me as though Danny Kent
has just done it, he is out

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:19.209
And down goes another rider and that is Vavrous the Czeck rider. He has lost
it out. It is Danny Kent that leads across

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.040
the line from Hiura to win the first race
of the Rookies Cup season. Ruiz it is that

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.510
is the third ahead of Binder, Gagne, Alt and
Antonelli.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.640
Yeah it was a real hard race. There was about
6 or 7 of us running up front.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.640
The race was pretty hard. The start was okay
but after mistakes and losing

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:45.810
positions. And the people was in front of
me they were like breaking me. And I couldn't

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.629
go forward.
It was a crazy race. I'm glad just I finished

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.810
it. Some guys out there just didn't have brains.
It was just crazy.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.129
My race was shut off finished like 8th. I
mean I was looking at battling for first

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:07.030
but then again people were just going totally
wild like T-boning each other and stuff. So

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.030
then I finished at like 8th place. So I am
not happy.

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:24.909
Now we have got another thrilling 16 laps.
Can we really have the same 11 men battle

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.200
for the lead. It is the same grid. Same guys
starting from the same row but who will have

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.269
learned what. Will they bump a little bit
less this time. Will they get strung out.

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:41.989
Will somebody make a break for it. We will
just have to wait an see.

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:48.989
16 laps. 24 Rookies. They are out. Not a bad
start from Daniel Ruiz but it is Scholtz that

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.760
leads on the rush down to the first corner.
Beautiful. And I think it is Ruiz into second

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.480
place. Oh and Daniel Ruiz comes up the inside.
He can't do it. And just as he did in the

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.540
first race Mathew Scholtz is brilliant on
the breaks. Very very hard to pass going into

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.499
the corners. Ruiz goes underneath Kent. Great
move on the fast right hander. But he keeps

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:14.340
it on this race track. Brilliant stuff using
a little bit too much road. They are up the

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.450
curve. And up the inside comes Hiura. He can't
do it. Ruiz it is that is going to lead out

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.820
from the start and finish from Hiura, Kent.
Absolutely great stuff. Half a lap to go.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.250
Still with Ruiz from Hiura, from Kent, who
is latest on the breaks. Who is the bravest.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.270
It is Hiura up the inside. Ruiz is strong
though. Ruiz holds it wide. He holds it but

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.530
he gets pushed out wide as they pull down
the start and finish line. The three guys

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.180
side by side. It is Daniel Ruiz that is going
to win it from Danny Kent. Ruiz it is from

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.320
Kent, from Hiura, from Scholtz, Stafford,
Gagne and Antonelli. Well what an absolute

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.280
superb one.
In the beginning of the race I tried to pull

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.000
away a little bit. But it was too hard. Then
the group caught me again and we started fighting.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I think my mind was clever. And I knew more
how is going to be the race and I knew that

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:14.610
I could go fast if I want so the sensation
of winning is so so high. I didn't think it

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.640
was like that. When I crossed the checked
flag I was like: "Did I win?" No, yeah. And

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:29.640
then I was so happy. I was like with the bike
and doing wheelies. Ah so funny. I'm happy.
