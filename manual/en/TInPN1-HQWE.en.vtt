00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.210
It's finally my favorite day of the week,
Friday!

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.049
Which can only mean one thing, you're watching
the Weekly Loot.

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.170
MMOAttack's news show that not only brings
you today's mmo news but also recaps the news

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.400
of the week and gives you a chance to win
some loot of your own.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.029
Last week's lucky $20 steam gift card winner
was Chetapaw, congratulations!

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.029
I hope you get exactly what you want from
Steam.

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:31.800
Everyone else, stick around until the end
for your chance to score some of that loot.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.629
NGames is pleased to announce a massive addition
to their magical MMO Tales of Solaris.

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.040
Now players can look forward to the wonderfully
competitive Colosseum to feature the game's

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.780
newly added pet battle mode.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.980
In Colosseum mode, players will have two arenas
to choose from.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.910
The Joy Colosseum will focus on using a local
server and just one companion.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.719
The Zeal Colosseum requires a bit more character
progression to enter the tactical cross-server

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.449
encounter and it will allow players to use
up to three pets.

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.129
NetMarble has just announced that their most
recent endeavor, Arcane Saga, will cease services

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.879
on September 16th.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.850
Arcane Saga just went into open beta testing
this May; it's sad to watch it approach the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.790
end of its' short lifespan.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.280
Netmarble plans to offer special packages
to players who also play their other PC online

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.040
titles like District 187 and Uncharted Waters
Online as a thank you, we'll keep our eyes

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.900
peeled for that announcement.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.780
The MMORTS game End of Nations has been rebranded
as a new type of MOBA according to the official

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.780
website.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.170
The site was updated with a new description
detailing the game's features and future goals,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.280
and it's not what players expected.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.890
The changes started occurring during the end
of last year.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.450
Since that time, the beta has been under heavy
fire from players and critics, all but dooming

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.260
the game before it's release.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.110
Re-branding the game and reopening the beta
sign ups could potentially work, we just have

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.110
to wait and see.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.870
And the week's news recap is as follows- On
Monday TERA Rising release new PVP features

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.430
in their latest update, Tuesday is went Firefall
entered their Open Beta, on Wednesday Riot

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.770
released a preview video for League of Legend's
3.9 update, and Thursday is when Dota 2 was

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.430
finally fully launched on Steam.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.920
Now onto the best part, the loot giveaway!

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.130
This week I have yet another $20 steam gift
card.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.229
Which is my favorite loot because you can
get whatever you want!

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.310
For your chance to win, tell me, how do you
feel about games in prolonged, extended betas?

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.999
Like Dota 2, for example; they were in beta
for like... over a year.

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:19.069
