00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:07.250
Alan (Lecturer):&nbsp;My rule of thumb would be,&nbsp;do&nbsp;at
least say for every hour from my list of contact

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.280
I’ve got to do two hours of work outside.
So my twelve hours of contact is actually

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.500
a 36 hour university week. Now that is going
to vary from student to student as some students

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.039
may say that’s too much, others may say
it’s not enough but a rule of thumb.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.620
Warren (Postgrad Tutor):&nbsp;At University, you
will find you have a lot of time to yourself

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.929
and you’ll have to decide what you want
to do with that time. I've often found that

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:38.180
if you, you&nbsp;treat University like a job,
then you get so much more done with, with&nbsp;that

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.340
time and its hard, it’s a real skill to
learn to be able to, to&nbsp;make&nbsp;best use of

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.310
the time and get that study done. Its something&nbsp;I
struggled with.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.250
Alice (Postgraduate student):&nbsp;When you go
to the tutes and you don’t know what people

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.399
are talking about you realise that you probably
have to do a bit of work outside of the class

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.829
yourself and it think it really makes a big
difference. You can really tell when you have

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.640
done the reading and&nbsp;you go to the class
having done the&nbsp;reading, you can really tell

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.070
that, you know, you&nbsp;are on the ball, you
know what’s going on and&nbsp;it makes it more

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.070
enjoyable.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.810
Alan (Lecturer): It’s not -&nbsp;twelve hours
and that's all I have to do, and this is a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.890
common mistake and in fact one of the mistakes
I made when I was a first year undergraduate

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.540
as well. I thought “Yippee, I have all this
time on my hand[s] there’s the union bar

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.270
and my friends and I’ll get to the library
later.” Well the reality is the twelve hours

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.070
is the tip of the iceberg. You’re all familiar
with the iceberg principal that there’s

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.800
more under the water than above, well University
study is very much the same.&nbsp;

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.630
Philip (School Leaver):&nbsp;So if I have a two
hour lecture and a one hour tutorial then

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.149
I will pull a - six hours of time at home
for the reading and, and even, I consider,

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.990
you know -&nbsp;sitting on a couch thinking about
it or even talking to one of my friends about

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.829
it, that's still study time but you have got
to make sure you give it that time otherwise

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.190
you are not really engaging with the Unit.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.230
Yasuko (Mature Age Student):&nbsp;Basically I
try to do about a&nbsp;few hours -&nbsp;two or three

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.530
hours every day and then [almost the] whole
weekend, almost the whole weekend&nbsp;because

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.410
I take much longer than probably anyone else
because [second]&nbsp;- as second language, and&nbsp;as

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.560
well as, I am not&nbsp;really good&nbsp;at reading
so...

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.580
Nadike (International Student):&nbsp;I would say,&nbsp;say
put in about...an extra ten to twelve hours,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.220
[which is really] its sufficient I would say,&nbsp;I
would say sufficient.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.300
Philip (School Leaver):&nbsp;I had to organise
a diary and start marking out when I needed

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.380
to do the reading when I was going to do it
and allocate time in my day around work, home

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.080
life and actually coming to Uni as well to
find time to do the readings.
