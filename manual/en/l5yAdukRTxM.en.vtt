Next thing you have is a PFD, which stands
for a Personal Flotation Device. Now there’s

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.250
a whole variety of different PFDs out there,
you need to make sure that you have a Coast

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.929
Guard approved PFD. If you’re rafting you
tend to be on bigger water than you would

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.650
be as an entry level kayaker for instance
or canoeist. So you want a PFD that’s going

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.029
to float you well, this has four buckles you
need to make sure all of them work. They’re

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.490
adjustable in the sides so you can fit it
so it’s nice and tight on you. Make sure

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.769
the pillow’s on the outside, this floats
you right side up, conscious or unconscious,

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:43.140
that’s what you’re looking for when you’re
out there. Fit is an important consideration,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.760
and so we have PFD’s out there now that
are designed specially for different body

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.829
types too. This is designed for a woman and
it has a slightly different cut, gives you

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.960
more maneuverability while you’re out there
so that you’re able to paddle while wearing

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.860
the PFD. You’ll notice that this is sort
of a bulky, more of a defensive swimming vest

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.840
and a little restrictive and then you have
the PFD such as this that gives you lots of

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.180
maneuverability, lots of protection, protects
you on the sides a little here and is an all

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.350
around great vest. Has lots of compartments
for storage, attachments for knives, whistles

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.539
and so forth. You also have footwear as a
consideration while you’re on the river,

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:39.630
typically on the river there are a lot of
sharp rocks, often glass and other debris.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.360
Any cuts you take to the feet are going to
bleed a lot so it’s nice to avoid them from

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.420
the start. A nice booty like this would be
fine, very simple, has a good sole to give

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.890
you some traction getting to and from the
river, keeps your feet warm when it’s cold

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.710
out there. It’s neoprene here, put a nice
pair of neoprene socks inside this and you’ll

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:07.719
stay toasty. It just unzips and you slid your
foot in there. During the summer a pair of

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:13.660
sandals such as these would work fine, they’re
adjustable, they’re comfortable, they keep

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.750
the water flowing around your feet rather
than your feet trapped inside a wet booty

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.800
or a wet shoe. So it’s a little healthier
for your feet and quite comfortable.
