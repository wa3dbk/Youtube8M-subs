00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.670
Well, one of the secrets on set that we use
is already in your medicine cabinet probably.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.339
Now, a lot of times we have celebrities that
come in, and they partied a little to hardy

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:13.829
the night before, or maybe they are just a
brand new parent and the baby, or the puppy,

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:20.050
kept them up too late. So we do what's called
an emergency aspirin mask. Yep, I said aspirin.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.089
So, it's the same kind of aspiring that you
take everyday when you have a headache, or

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.490
sore throat, or whatever. This is just a cheap
little bottle that I found at the drug store

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.560
for ninety-nine cents, and what we're going
to do, is you're going to take the aspirin,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.830
you're going to take it in a little bowl,
and then we're going to crunch it up, and

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.520
you want to try and get it as fine of powder
as you can. Ok? So now that I've got it that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.469
micro-powder that I like, very nice consistency,
all you need to do is add water. So if you've

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.940
got about, I would say this is probably about
a teaspoon, so you're going to add double

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.540
that consistency, and just keep adding till
it floats up to about right there, and you're

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.990
going to mix. Now this isn't something that
you use every day. Remember this is not an

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.040
everyday facial mask, this is the emergency,
I have a date, my husband just got a raise,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.170
we have to go out, we're celebrating something
and I need a pick-me-up mask. So there you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.440
go. I want you to see the consistency of that.
Ok? So then your going to mix it, and as you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.119
can see it's got bubbles in it because it
has oxygenation, and that is going to bring

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.329
instant oxygen to your skin, for an instant
tightness, and instant kind of firming and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:49.759
pick-me-up. Ok? With the cotton ball, you're
just going to swish it around, make sure that

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.780
you get a good drop, and look, the cotton
ball ate up most of the water, so that's why

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.520
you always have a little bit more water than
you do aspirin. And then you just apply. All

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.770
over. Let it dry, and once it dries you're
going to feel a tightness and a firmness,

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.320
that's the pick-me-up part. Once it dries
you just rinse it off, and you've got instant

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.440
glowing skin. Where's my towel, I'm ready.
