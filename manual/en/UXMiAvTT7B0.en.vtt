00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.830
Thank you and greetings to all the accomplished
men and women here. A salute is in order to

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.830
us, the Class of 2014, as well as the graduates
of the School of Theology. We've done things

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.180
and accomplished stuff.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.790
On the last day of classes this semester,
a humbling unexpected experience happened

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.280
to me. At the epicenter of existentialism
— during the who am I, where am I going

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.500
phase in our lives as seniors — I walked
into my last collegiate course and my professor

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.960
handed me a blue notebook. I had left it behind
in a course I had taken with him three years ago.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.110
ago. He found it in the midst of an end-of-the-year
clean sweep and put it on his desk, meaning

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.610
of course, to return it to me. But in the rush and business
of academia, it disappeared under piles of

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.280
books, papers and other lofty objects.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.259
Two weeks ago he found it again and handed
it to me. The notebook in question was the

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.260
journal and collected works from my intro
to creative writing course, an exploration

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.150
in writing essays, short stories and poetry.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.040
The notebook, filled with melodrama and the
occasional stick figure doodle, belonged in

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:29.000
a fireplace to be reduced to ash and never
read from again. But after opening these pages

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:36.119
I didn't want to burn it nor erase its existence:
I wanted to remember.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.240
Reading it had the effect of looking at an
awkward high school photo. A cringe-worthy

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.619
but ultimately delightful glimpse at a time
long ago that was dominated by braces, puberty

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:51.619
and angst. This process of looking back at
the good, the bad and the pubescent allows

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.030
for reflection.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.030
Those pages captured my story as a freshman.
Who were we then? What did we think about,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.920
what were our concerns, what was going to
happen? Many of us hadn't chosen majors yet

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.540
or been able to grasp the meaning of the abundant
acronyms used by our school.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.310
Many of us had not met each other. I re-read
my experiences, able to recognize what my

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.890
next three years would bring. So-and-so weren't
dating yet, we haven't left the country to

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.890
study abroad, I hadn't broken the window in
the entrance of Lottie. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.209
It was just a clumsy accident, no alcohol was involved or anything like that.

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:44.209
We had not been offered jobs, bought plane
tickets, leased apartments. "Star Wars Episode

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.400
VII" wasn't real yet, Snapchat didn't exist
and President Hemesath wasn't here.

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.270
Had the notebook found its way to me any earlier,
it would probably not have caught my interest

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.819
nor inspired such significant nostalgia. These
things just have to happen at the right time.

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:09.629
What has transpired in our time at St. John's?
I've heard many classmates say "freshman year

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:16.599
feels like only yesterday." We might not feel
like we've been here very long at all. Time

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.780
is hard to measure and understand while attempting
to stay in the now.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.900
As seniors we're afforded the opportunity
of looking back but find it bittersweet to

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.830
do so knowing our time here is over. Recognition
of what meant most to us comes a bit too late,

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.010
but never late enough to prevent our appreciation.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.060
St. John's allowed us tremendous opportunity
and even greater rewards if we were willing

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.209
to immerse ourselves into its diverse community.
Our opportunities on campus — in and outside

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.489
of the classroom — expected us to present
our own thoughts and ideas passionately and

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.940
honestly. Seniors in our class answered that
call.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.159
Collectively, we have organized and performed
charity work, filmed documentaries on the

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:10.099
nature of our diverse world, competed in national
athletic competitions, rallied to save club

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:17.099
teams and communal spaces of living, confronted
issues of gender, sexuality and discrimination,

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.099
created works of theater and art, and done
much more that impacted the student body and

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.110
other communities, as well.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.979
I don't need to explain the unique and prideful
attachment we have to our school, and I don't

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.969
need to pass any wisdom or lessons learned
onto you either. I simply need to thank you

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:44.610
and to challenge you. A Johnnie is more than
a courteous door-holder; Johnnies support

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.020
each other's efforts to impact the world around
them.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.610
You've all left a profound impact on me as
an individual, on our community, and on the

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.589
world at large. The challenge doesn't end
when we leave, and the memory and gratitude

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:07.589
shouldn't fade either. We can continue to
support each other and the home we once shared

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:13.080
by continuing to cherish it by fostering its
continual growth.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.110
My time at St. John's is one of the greatest
experiences I will ever have. I've had the

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.490
good fortune of knowing some of the bravest
and most honest friends I could ever have

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:30.490
naively hoped for. I thank you for your time,
I thank you for the memories. I wish you all

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.160
the best of luck.
