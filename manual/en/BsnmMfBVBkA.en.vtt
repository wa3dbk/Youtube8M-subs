00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.180
So, oftentimes we're asked, "How do I
flower my camellia?"

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.169
And the answer is: Camellia's flower by themselves. It's just the gardener that needs to

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:24.970
encourage

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.460
the conditions that actually help induce
the bloom,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.500
and bring the bloom into flower. Here we
have a young plant. This is one that has

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.320
been grown in the house for many years.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.660
It's been restricted in its size, mainly by

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.560
the lack, or the lower levels, of
fertilizer, and by dryness to it's watering.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.280
And you can see we have blooms that have opened up; this is in the wintertime.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.469
And here we have, in the top of it,  a
young bud that's about ready to open. It

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.570
will probably open the next couple of weeks.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.089
So, how a camellia grows is, it puts out
a flush of new growth;

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.179
and, during the summertime, that growth
hardens off. And as we go into

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.409
midsummer, sometime just before June,

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.080
the growth starts hardening off; the plant
decides to flower.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.220
And buds form down at the leaf axis,
although

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.729
you, the gardener, can't see them. Then as
the season progresses, and we go into

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.860
fall, these buds began to swell.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.280
And that all happens under normal
temperatures

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.120
of Summer, going into Fall. As we get into
late Fall,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.090
temperatures start to cool down; the light
level shortens,

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.520
and the plants get triggered into, yes,
it's time for

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.960
blooming. And so the buds begin to
swell,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.250
and swell, and that continues until they
open.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.480
Now, camellias are classified as early,
mid, or late season.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.290
And those camellias that are early, will often flower for us in November,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.760
around Thanksgiving. The late ones will
flower for us in late February or March,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.180
here in the greenhouses.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.820
The thing that disrupts that is warm
temperatures.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.390
If the plant is given too much warmth,
which would be room temperature

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.840
in contemporary homes, the buds will
blast. They will dry up and fall off.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.940
So, you just have to remember, as you see those buds forming,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.690
be sure to keep them as cool as possible
during that flowering period.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.750
Thank you for watching today. Weâ€™ve talked a little bit about how to grow

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.620
Camellias.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.930
They're quite easy to grow. You just have to
remember to

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.270
be easy on the feed, and grow them in a
cool condition during the wintertime.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.640
If you have any interest in

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.780
culture of them, we have an article on
