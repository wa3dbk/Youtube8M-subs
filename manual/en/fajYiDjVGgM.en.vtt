00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.910
Why?

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.470
To transform ourselves
and change the world

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.870
through big dreams, big
opportunities, and big impacts.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.620
And we did it.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.040
Because of you, big dreams,
opportunities, and impacts

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.980

can afford their
flight training.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.970
Because of you,
public school teachers

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.420
can refresh their
creative impulses

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.760
by pursuing a graduate
degree in studio arts.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.580
Because of you and the Prairie
Island Indian community,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.870
archaeological
digs near Red Wing

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.700
continue to provide a
unique real world experience

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.510
to students and faculty.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.750

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.940

world experience working

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.330

can continue to offer
real world learning

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.280
through the innovative
Integrated Business Experience

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.790
program.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.110
Because of you,
our students have

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.288
been able to pursue their
big ideas at Minnesota State

00:02:24.288 --> 00:02:25.960
Mankato.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.271
It was a life or death
situation, it felt like to me.

00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:32.640
It was either I
stay where I was at,

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.620
or I make the decision to
not only further education,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.370
but make a life change.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.976
And that's what Mankato did.

00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:44.420
It changed my life
for the better.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.160
I know that we have a couple
of really good internship

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.500
on campus, like FPX
Project, Maverick Project.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.310
And I know that those
internships can really

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.330
impact my future career.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.090
I'm planning on opening my own
dental office in the community

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.440
and give back what
I got from them.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.080
Well, my time here at
Minnesota State Mankato

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.580
has changed my life.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.200
It's helped me decide what
I want to do with my future

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.020
and where I want to go.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.350
It's helped me grow
personally and become

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.970
the person I want to be.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.190
And it's helped me see how
I can impact the world.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.790
We have-- our saying is big
ideas, real world thinking.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.240
And so it's kind
of helped me see

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.190
that I have these big plans.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.450
And I have a way to
affect the future.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.080
Finally, because of you, we have
some very big news to share.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.090
We have not only reached the
goal of the Big Ideas Campaign,

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.280
bit surpassed it.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.620
As of August 31, 2013,
we raised $77.8 million,

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.420
the largest in the history
of Minnesota State Mankato,

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.840
and the largest in the history
of the Minnesota State Colleges

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.505
and Universities System.

00:04:09.505 --> 00:04:11.690
And most important,
those dollars

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.910
are helping students translate
their big ideas into reality.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:17.740
Thank you.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.290
I just want to thank you.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.829
I would tell them thank you.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.560
I would love to thank them.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.560
I'd say thank you.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.100
I couldn't thank them enough.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.090
You know what?

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.610
We can't wait to see what
big ideas will take shape

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.020
in the future at
Minnesota State Mankato.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.120
And we know they
will because of you.
