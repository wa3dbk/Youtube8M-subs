00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:07.870
Everybody is talking about the World Cup,
but who should we be putting our money on?

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.810
We met up with betting giant William Hill
to find out.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.710
Who are the favourites of this year?

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.470
This year's favourites are the host nation
Brazil. They're 3-1 to win the tournament.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.779
Argentina, close neighbours to Brazil. 11-2,
second favourites with European duo of Germany

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.659
and Spain close behind.

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:26.369
And where is your money going?

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.640
My money's going to be on the two South American
sides at the top of the betting - Brazil and

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.210
Argentina. They'll adapt to the climate perfectly.
Brazil are slight favourites because of the

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.289
home advantage, but I think they'll both go
far.

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.239
How much impact do you really think climate
will have on how well England will play?

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.399
I think it'll be quite tough. I think England
are, they're quite fortunate in that they've

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.429
got a relatively young squad, so they'll be
able to perhaps adapt to the conditions a

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:54.839
little bit better, but they'll never have
the same advantage as the likes of Brazil

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.929
or Argentina or even some of the southern
European countries like Portugal.

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:05.040
With this in mind, we agreed to take part
in William Hill's experiment to test the effects

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.580
of climate on fitness, and I was nominated.
The guinea pig. Great.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.400
With my sweat collector pads on, I was ready
to go.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.500
So are we ready to go? I'm going to put on
some music to make this more bearable. I'm

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.170
guessing we don't have surround sound in here.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.100
Thirty minutes of cycling in a moderate environment,
and another thirty minutes in high temperature.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.800
The beginning's the most painful, isn't it?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.800
-You've done...
-Six minutes.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.101
Six minutes.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.640
Admittedly, even after just 20 minutes, I
was finding it pretty tough.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.780
How are you feeling now? Are you okay?

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.480
Not gonna lie. I'm quite tired.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.940
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.289
Definitely uncomfortable.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.160
Okay, you're done there then. Well done.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.780
Yay!

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.619
The box steps followed, and then I had to
sit down for tests measuring reaction times

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:07.390
and memory.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.910
First one we have is a reaction test.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.960
Test complete.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.580
Excellent. We have one more for memory and
one for attention.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.220
Okay.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.600
Okay, so we're going to do the memory test.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.940
My memory is probably better than my attention.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.900
Yeah, this is spatial memory specifically,
so it may be used for team sports. If you

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.450
can remember very well...

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.230
Where everybody is.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.260
After a break that wasn't long enough, I was
back in the room to redo the sequence, but

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.790
this time in temperatures equivalent to what
England will be playing in.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.250
So now we're going to repeat the test, Poppy.
So it's going to be 30 degrees instead of

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.470
20, where we were before. So this is a little
bit hotter. It's also a little bit more humid,

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.060
so the humidity's around 70 per cent. Relative
humidity compared to 30 per cent relative humidity.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.920
And it got harder and harder.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.400
So how are you feeling now? You're ten minutes
in.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.720
Stefan, I'm so tired, and I'm so hot, and
I'm so sweaty. And I... How long have I got left?

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.480
-15 minutes.
-Ugh!

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.959
-How hot do you feel?
-Very hot.

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.549
-So eight?
-Yeah.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.240
-Very uncomfortable.
-Five.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.860
Okay, we're going to keep that at 16.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.580
After a grueling hour of exercise, I was ready
for the results.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.239
You can see even after ten minutes here in hotter
conditions, your heart was already beating

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.989
faster than at the end of the colder condition.

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:33.560
Yeah.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.900
So even though you kept the exercise up quite
well, your heart and your body had to work

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.320
much harder for it.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.319
So this shows us that the England team when
they perform, they'll be working doubly as

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.619
hard to keep as fit as they would've been
in the usual game if they were here.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.360
Their internal physiology will be working
quite hard to make up for the extra heat and

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.340
humidity. So there you have it. Proven evidence
to take into account climate change before

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.480
placing your bets. Good luck.
