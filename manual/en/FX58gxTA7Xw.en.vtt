Hey guys, has your truck's Tonneau cover lost
its luster and shine?

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.049
Maybe doesn't look as good as it did when
you first got it?

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.360
Well, we've got a product here from TruXedo
called Pro-Tex that we're going to use to

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.960
show you how to bring that back.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:23.710
Hi, I'm John with RealTruck.com and let's
get this Tonneau cover looking like new again.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.730
Some of the great things about this product
is that one, it's non-toxic.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.570
You can spray it on, it's not going to hurt
the environment if it gets washed off or whatever.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.590
Also, it's got a nice UV protectant added
to it, which will help keep the sun from damaging

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.730
your Tonneau cover.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.650
And it also has a non-static formula added
to it.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.190
I'm going to show you how to use this, and
like with any product, you should always read

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.050
and follow the directions on the label.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.260
The first thing you're going to do is take
it and you're just going to spray it on.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.600
And you want to spray a liberal amount onto
the Tonneau cover.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.899
Now when I say liberal, guys, I don't mean
like, soak it down.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.759
I just mean spray enough on to cover it.

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:09.759
Okay?

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.780
Then we're going to take a soft nylon bristle
type of brush, and we're just going to scrub

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.569
this in.

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.899
Once we have that scrubbed in, then what we're
going to do is we're going to take a paper

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.880
towel, something of that nature, and we're
going to wipe off all the extra that's on

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.310
here.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.740
And as you can see here, I'm only doing part
of this Tonneau because I want you guys to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.420
be able to see how this stuff really works
and makes a big difference between what it

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.240
looked like before and what it's going to
look like after we're all done here.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.659
You can kind of see by the rag how well that
this Pro-Tex actually cleans.

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.749
So what we're going to do now is we're going
to let this dry and then we'll move on to

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:00.350
the next step of bringing the life back to
our Tonneau cover again.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.610
So we've given our first coat time to dry
and so now what we want to do is we want to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.259
do the finishing coat.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:17.440
And we're going to just do a spray of a light
coating onto our Tonneau cover.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.611
And then, we're going to allow that time to
dry, and then I'll show you what to do, once

00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:24.611
this is dry.

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:27.659
Okay, guys, we've sprayed our second coat
on.

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:28.659
We've let it sit and dry.

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:34.180
So now what we're going to do is take our
microfiber cloth, clean dry microfiber cloth,

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.990
and buff this up.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.470
That's how simple and easy it is to bring
the shine and the nice luxurious look back

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.579
to your Tonneau cover, even when they've become
dull and not so good looking anymore.

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.690
Grab yourself a bottle of Pro-Tex from TruXedo.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.230
Follow the directions.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.819
Put it on your Tonneau cover, and your old
Tonneau cover can look like brand new like

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.049
this one again.

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.879
Also, I'm going to let you guys in on a little
secret.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.680
You can see the difference between what we
did and what we didn't do with the Pro-Tex.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.310
This Tonneau cover went through a carwash
before we brought it in here.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.569
So that's how much better this product works
than just simply washing your Tonneau cover.

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:24.010
Plus it has conditioners to help keep the
Tonneau cover in good shape for years to come.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.959
So there you have it.

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.640
Get yourself some TruXedo Pro-Tex.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.099
Get your Tonneau cover back in good shape
again or keep it that way.

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.519
And remember until next time, happy motoring.
