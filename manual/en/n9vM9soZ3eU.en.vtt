00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.460
For many reptile keepers, their journey starts
with a very simple animal: simple to keep,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.460
small size.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.849
And that certainly, for me, was the green
or brown anoles.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.820
These are very common animals in the pet trade.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.150
I hesitate to say they're disposable, but
sometimes with the lack of proper knowledge,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.840
animals don't make their journey.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.970
So, green and brown anoles are simple to keep
because of their small size.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.200
They're insectivores, so it's a lot of fun
to watch them eat.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.430
You keep them in maybe a 10-gallon fish tank.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.930
They need very minimal light, but they love
to eat those insects.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.710
So, watching the feeding time is certainly
a lot of fun in the household when dad comes

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.030
home with a bag of crickets from the pet store.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.750
The anoles look almost like Velociraptor when
they come out of their trees.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.600
They are arboreal by nature, meaning they
stay up in the air of the terrarium.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.600
They are in the leaves.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.280
They are hanging in the lid of the tank.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.410
Sometimes you can't see them very well.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.140
But when the crickets come out, they come
diving down like the little dinosaurs they

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.210
look like and, wham, they've nailed the crickets
one after the other.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.170
So, I can think of a lot of people who are
professional herpetologists that have started

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.410
their journey in their lives by catching green
and brown Anoles in the Southeast or by buying

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.750
them at the local pet store.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.190
This is the one that's about under $10 to
start with.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.450
Again, we want to stress that people do their
homework before they buy a pet such as this.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.560
Unfortunately, it's a very short-lived animal.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.640
Three to five years is its entire lifespan,
so you can't get too upset after a few years

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.300
of having the anole if it meets its demise.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.461
If you're smart enough to get a pair of them,
a male and a female, you'll find that they

00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:43.729
are very simple to breed.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.979
They'll lay eggs in the substrate and sometimes
you'll see Junior popping out of the bedding

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.409
after a couple of months.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.100
So, green Anoles are one of our starter animals
in the reptile world.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.100
We love these.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.100
They are animated.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.590
You do not have to spend $500 to get into
the hobby.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.250
It is an excellent little pet, particularly
for families with young children.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.310
The brown and green anole.
