00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.017
(Dr. Karla Kennedy-Hagan). 
Hello.

00:00:02.017 --> 00:00:03.070
My name is Dr. Karla
Kennedy-Hagan with the

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.043
School of Family and
Consumer Sciences

00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:07.070
at Eastern Illinois University.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.080
Today, we're going to add
some caffeine to your diet

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.023
in a healthy way with
this diet soda cake.

00:00:12.023 --> 00:00:15.087
Sit back, relax, and
enjoy the show.

00:00:15.087 --> 00:00:17.050
(Jennifer Burnham).
Hi, my name is

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.067
Jennifer Burnham and I'm
a senior dietetics major

00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:22.080
at Eastern Illinois University.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.000
Today, my assistant is Lindsay
Wilson and she's going to

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.093
help me make diet soda cake.

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:29.027
It's quite simple.

00:00:29.027 --> 00:00:31.053
You can take any
flavor of cake mix,

00:00:31.053 --> 00:00:34.057
today I've choosen chocolate.

00:00:34.057 --> 00:00:38.097
What we're going to
do is add diet soda.

00:00:38.097 --> 00:00:40.063
(Lindsay Wilson). 
And what is

00:00:40.063 --> 00:00:42.063
the diet soda replacing?

00:00:42.063 --> 00:00:44.020
(Jennifer). 
It's replacing all the other

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.000
wet liquids you
normally would use

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.003
which would be the
oil and the eggs.

00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:50.000
(Lindsay).
Can you use any type of soda?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.090
(Jennifer). 
Yeah, there are

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.013
lots of combinations
that you can find.

00:00:54.013 --> 00:00:57.030
Instead of if this is just going
to take like regular chocolate.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.010
If you wanted to you could
add Cherry Coke to make

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.030
a little tang or Vanilla Coke.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.060
You can also do Mountain Dew
with like an orange cake

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.097
or lemon with an angel
food cake, give it lots

00:01:10.097 --> 00:01:15.093
of variety at the function
you're going to do.

00:01:15.093 --> 00:01:18.000
So what we're going to do
is we're just mixing it up

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.090
like you would a normal
cake, make sure we get

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.090
all the lumps out of there.

00:01:32.023 --> 00:01:36.013
By adding the diet soda, we're
taking out a lot of the fat.

00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:38.097
A normal cake would
have 15 grams of fat

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:44.083
and doing this now
we only have 4.7.

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:49.037
Today, I choose a bundt pan
just to make it pretty.

00:01:49.037 --> 00:01:52.013
So I've already pre-sprayed
it and we're going to

00:01:52.013 --> 00:01:54.030
just dump it right in.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.067
(Lindsay). 
Can you use another size of pan?

00:01:56.067 --> 00:01:58.020
(Jennifer). 
Yeah, just like any cake,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.043
you can use cupcakes or
a nine by thirteen pan.

00:02:00.043 --> 00:02:02.017
Just follow directions
on how to cook it at

00:02:02.017 --> 00:02:06.017
what temperature on the box,
everything's the same.

00:02:12.057 --> 00:02:15.010
For the dark pan and the bundt
pan, it's going to cook

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.010
about 325 for about 45 to 50
minutes so the box says.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.053
And there we go, just
make it nice and even.

00:02:30.053 --> 00:02:34.067
And here is our finished product
after it's come out of the oven.

00:02:34.067 --> 00:02:38.050
And today we're going to
sprinkle icing and all this is

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.057
is a cup of powdered sugar, a
tablespoon of milk, and a little

00:02:43.057 --> 00:02:49.017
bit of vanilla just to give it
some color and variety.

00:02:49.017 --> 00:02:51.087
So this is a very simple cake
to make and it cuts out almost

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:56.003
more than half of your fat
and calories and carbs.

00:02:56.003 --> 00:03:01.000
Thank you for watching today.
