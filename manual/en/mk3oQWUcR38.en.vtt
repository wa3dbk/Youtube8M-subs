00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.920
Located just a few miles from the centre of Manchester.
The Salford Sports Village is a state of the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.779
art football centre, which offers some of
the finest football facilities in the area.

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:51.950

32 station fitness suite. Modern changing

case you should need it, we can help you source

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.980

Hi there, he would like to come swimming for

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.980
a session please. He s doing some recovery.
Alright thank you. Accommodation can be arranged

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:41.739
for you with a local English family or alternatively
you can stay in a hotel or guest house. Our

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.840
location also gives you the exciting opportunity
to watch some of the best teams in the English

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.840
Premier League. 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.329
I'm Mel Eves, former professional footballer. I now represent players internationally and from the UK. 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.659
I m here at the Manchester International Football Academy and I am
really impressed with the facilities both outside 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.439
where they've got the latest 3G (3rd Generation) pitches
and inside where they ve got a great weights room,

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.829
and conditioning suite. I m also impressed
with the quality of the coaches; they ve got

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.349
experience from the premiership all the way
down to non-league. So if I m going to bring

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.939
any players from abroad or from the UK, I
want to make sure that they're looked after

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:37.200
in a way I would be happy myself. I can say
that I'm more than happy with the one to one

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.549
attention that each player gets. They're analysed,
they're assessed and they're given their own

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:49.549
program to follow. So that if they follow
that, clubs from any level will be interested

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:56.189
in them if they re good enough. My
name is Andre Jakobsen, I am from Norway,

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:03.079
I'm training for the academy, it is a very good
facility and I recommend it to everyone. 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:10.079
My name is Jetmir Bushaj, I m a midfielder,
I came to the MIFA programme. My first week

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.510
I spoke to Ross Johnson about my football
situation and my first week got a trial at

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.269
Blackpool. Trainings really high standard
and I'm really happy being here. It's really good.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.880
Hi Everyone. I m Akporobaro
Emmanuel, a football scout from Nigeria. 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.560
I'm here visiting Manchester International Football
Academy. I must tell you the environment is

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.220
great. The pitches are very very very perfect.
The gym is excellent so I highly recommend

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.040
this to every young footballer in Africa.
So I m more than happy to recommend the

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:52.040
Manchester international football academy
to any of my players and any of my contacts

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.780
both in this country and internationally to
bring them here because I know they will be

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.780
looked after as I would look after them myself.
The Manchester International Football Academy;

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.680
Professional training today for the footballers
of tomorrow.
