00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.060
There's many different filters that you can
simply screw onto the end of your lens to

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.280
create some really interesting effects. The
most basic of all filters is a standard UV

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.340
filter. As you can see here, a UV filter screws
right onto the edge of the camera like any

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.260
other camera would. The difference with a
UV filter and some other filters is that a

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.140
UV filter is just clear glass, and the main
purpose of it is to protect your lens from

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.470
being damaged by dirt or the elements or anything
like that. So if you're buying a camera and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.520
some lenses, the first thing you need to get
is a UV filter. There are some other filters

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:44.999
that open you up to some creative techniques.
One of those is a blur filter. A blur filter

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:49.260
has it set so that there's only one small
portion of the filter that's going to allow

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.709
everything to come through crisp and clear,
and everything else, it's going to put a sort

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:57.920
of a blur on it. This is going to create some
neat effects if you've got like a picture

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.579
of a person standing in the middle of a garden,
maybe you can have the person in focus and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.690
everything around them all blurry. And it
can just really make certain things stand

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.540
out. Another type of filter to create effects
is called a starburst filter. These come in

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.320
like four point, five point, six point, and
what this does, is if you're taking a picture

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.050
of a single light source it will turn it into
a star shape. So like a four point one, instead

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.890
of just showing a single glowing light up
in the distance, you'll see four major points

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.390
coming off of it. These are used a lot in
the filming of sporting events. You'll notice

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.940
that when they show the lights at night, that
they're making these nice lines coming out

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.960
of the lights. That's created from a starburst
filter. Another filter that's commonly used,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.890
not so much for effects, but just for getting
a stronger exposure, is a polarizing filter.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.140
These look a little blue in hue, and what
they do is they'll help the sky and water

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.951
and things of that nature show up with a little
bit more color to them, and you'll just get

00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:05.530
a richer stronger image. So there's certain
filters, like the UV filter, that's basically

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.229
there to protect your camera. And there's
other ones like the polarizing filter, they're

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.969
going to help you get better exposures, and
then there's some filters that are going to

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.659
create some effects like the star burst and
blur filters.
