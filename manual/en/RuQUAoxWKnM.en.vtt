00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.200
Hi! This is Dodger and you're watching my show!

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.400
So this episode is gonna be a little bit interesting because my smoke detector has been chirping all day

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.720
I've done all the things, I've tried resetting it, I've tried turning off the breaker and resetting it

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.080
I've replaced the batteries.. I don't know what to do

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.280
*Chirp*

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.300
But it's all good, because tonight I am trying out a new ramen place with Crendor!

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.300
It's gonna be awesome

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.040
So for our first piece of news, a little bit of fluff, the Year of Luigi is finally ending

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.840
And some of you might be thinking, didn't the year of Luigi end when the year ended?

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:50.740
Turns out it doesn't end officially until March 18th. They had a whole team, they had a Year of Luigi team that is going to be shutting down..

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.020
.. Forever.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.900
And there might even be some of you who are like, it was the Year of Luigi?

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.200
Yeah they put out a lot of Luigi games last year, so

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:07.480
It's officially done. It's officially over, we've celebrated the 30 year anniversary of Luigi and now we can all move on to.. whose next?

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.600
I dunno, Toad's been around awhile, Peach has been around awhile, although she used to have a different name

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.160
How old are the Koopa kids? Hmm?

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.880
Any of you EVE players out there might have heard that Dark Horse Comics is putting together an EVE comic book

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.040
That's based on real, actual player's experiences inside of the game

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.080
The first "EVE True Stories" is released, and it's called "Thieves Among Us"

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.840
It's 17 pages and it's free on Dark Horse digital

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.500
Now here's the.. *Chirp* Ugh..

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.400
Now here's the thing, is that there are going to be three other stories, the other three are going to be released periodically

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.420
And then they're going to be free on Dark Horse digital until the beginning of June

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.040
At which point, all four will be shoved into a hardback thing, and then you have to buy it

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.100
So if you wanna read them and not pay the money, make sure that you read it while it's free

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.360
But, it would be a good way to show not only Dark Horse but also EVE, that they have a lot of supporters if you were to buy it

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.620
Some of you might remember that in 2012, Valve announced that they were going to be doing a doc called "Free To Play"

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.900
Now Free To Play is a full on documentary about Dota 2 players, which is awesome

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.980
It's finally going to be released March 19th on Steam, as a free to play title

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.680
So you can watch it for free, and not only is called Free To Play but you can watch it for free

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.400
Now the story of Free To Play is we follow three players, "Dendi," "hyhy," and "Fear"

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.720
As they get ready for the international championships of 2011

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.640
And for those of you who don't remember, the Dota 2 international championships, the very first one, the prize was $1 million dollars

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.060
Which was unheard of at the time

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.480
Just need you to not mess with the tripod that's all

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.180
If you can resist.. resist the tripod! I'll be so proud of you

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.480
It follows them not only training for the internationals, but also talks to their families, talks to their friends

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.360
It covers a lot of bases. And! There is a Free To Play collector's pack that you can buy on the exact same day that Free To Play releases

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.940
So you would.. you would buy that one

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.760
But if you buy it 25% of the proceeds go to the actual players and anybody else who was involved in the film.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.420
Which is cool

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.440
If you, sirs and madams, play Killer Instinct you might have noticed that there have been some consistent crashes ever since their last update

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.000
So when they released the new character, they also released what's called 'jail'

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.940
Which basically means, if you go into an online match-up, and you consistently drop out of games because of your internet

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.140
Then you get put into jail, and that means you are only paired up with other people that are in jail

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.160
So bad internet.. goes with bad internet, you fight each other with bad internet.. It's sad

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.520
But the thing that I love about this, is that

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.120
In that update, when they updated that, and put in jail

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.500
They suddenly made it so that everybody was crashing

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.480
And everybody was leaving their matches and it wasn't their fault

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.220
And it's not just that, there are all sorts of issues with Spinal's moves, which

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.940
There's one character left to release and hopefully there aren't as many glitches with that character

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.420
But, just lots of things that are freezing the game, crashing the game, bugging the game out

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.880
And I think they are working on a patch right now.. that is going to fix everything question mark?

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.760
As a final bit of news, the Oculus Rift has run into some issues

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.540
Now by that I mean that the Oculus has a lot of components that it uses, that are suddenly

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.920
Going out of production, which is very weird

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.940
Now no one knows if these are components that are lens-based

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.360
Any components that really can't be made out of plastic

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.620
Right, because if that's the case then you can give somebody the piece and be like

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.640
"Hey.. duplicate this, use your 3D printer?"

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.180
Right now supposedly they are 'running out' of Oculus Rifts which is very weird

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.980
The person who leaked all of this information works at Oculus and was saying, you know, it's incredible

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.140
Because they never expected so many people to jump on board, and to be interested in the Oculus

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.320
And to be utilizing it, and it's amazing it's so great

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.360
But that also means that they didn't prepare in terms of.. how many they were making?

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.520
*chair squeaks*

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.500
What?

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.000
What?

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.040
You meowing at me for something?

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.840
Yeah?

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.120
So yeah, now they're looking for replacement parts so that they can keep making the Oculus as it is

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.520
And it must, they must not be simple parts at all, right?

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.360
Hi..!

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.460
And for our final bit of news, I really wanted to tell you guys that we can finally do

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.400
An update on the charity stream this week which is exciting

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.180
Watcha looking at? Oh the jawa? You love the jawa..

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:37.720
So this week I can finally make a video being like, this is how much we raised, this is how much we're giving to each place

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.100
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah..

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.980
Which is awesome because I would love for these companies to actually get the money, that would be nice

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.980
So anyway we'll make a video about that *Chirp*

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.300
*sigh*

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.940
And I will try to fix my smoke detector by then, apparently Jesse had this problem not too long ago

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.080
Should ask him how he fixed it.. he probably just called a guy.. I can't call a guy

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.080
Anywho! That is my show, thank you so much for watching

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.500

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.540
Bye, muah!

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.200
Resist the tripod!
