00:00:03.895 --> 00:00:08.062
- This is a brief introduction
to supraspinatus pathology.

00:00:10.264 --> 00:00:13.315
We will begin by describing
the bony anatomy,

00:00:13.315 --> 00:00:15.874
covered by the articular hyaline cartilage

00:00:15.874 --> 00:00:18.175
shown here in blue.

00:00:18.175 --> 00:00:20.795
Illustrated here is the long
head of the bicep tendon

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:23.761
passing through bicep groove

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:27.178
to insert at the superior glenoid labrum.

00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:32.510
Illustrated next is the
supraspinatus tendon

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.527
as it attaches to the greater tuberosity

00:00:35.527 --> 00:00:37.543
at the anterior portion.

00:00:37.543 --> 00:00:40.209
Posteriorly, the infraspinatus tendon

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:44.353
wraps around the posterior
surface of the humeral head

00:00:44.353 --> 00:00:45.990
to attach to the remainder

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.157
of the greater tuberosity's
lateral and posterior margins.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.400
As the infraspinatus tendon

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.124
attaches to the posterior aspect
of the greater tuberosity,

00:00:57.124 --> 00:01:00.125
take note that about
1/3 of its tendon fibers

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:02.094
share an insertion point

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:05.567
with the supraspinatus's posterior 1/3

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:08.096
of its tendon as well.

00:01:08.096 --> 00:01:12.406
Due to the oblique nature of
the infraspinatus's insertion

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:14.703
relative to the supraspinatus's insertion

00:01:14.703 --> 00:01:16.910
to the greater tuberosity,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.315
special care should be taken

00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:20.143
while scanning through this section

00:01:20.143 --> 00:01:22.643
to avoid false positive tears.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.097
Enveloping these lateral
rotator cuff structures

00:01:27.097 --> 00:01:30.514
will be the subacromial subdeltoid bursa.

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:34.131
This illustration shows a cross section

00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:36.679
of the supraspinatus
proximal to its insertion

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.846
of the greater tuberosity.

00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:42.905
The primary focus of this
video will be the relationship

00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:45.735
of the supraspinatus tendon
with the bicep tendon

00:01:45.735 --> 00:01:48.152
at its intracapsular segment.

00:01:49.044 --> 00:01:50.661
This is the corresponding image

00:01:50.661 --> 00:01:54.894
of the supraspinatus
tendon in cross section.

00:01:54.894 --> 00:01:56.592
Highlighted here is the humeral head

00:01:56.592 --> 00:01:58.696
proximal to the supraspinatus insertion.

00:01:58.696 --> 00:02:02.023
The black rim is the articular cartilage.

00:02:02.023 --> 00:02:04.672
The lateral deltoid muscle
will run in cross section

00:02:04.672 --> 00:02:06.505
as well at this level.

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:11.538
The anterior supraspinatus
tendon is well visualized

00:02:11.538 --> 00:02:13.277
while the posterior supraspinatus tendon

00:02:13.277 --> 00:02:15.293
is less identifiable

00:02:15.293 --> 00:02:18.195
due to its merger with the infraspinatus.

00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:20.398
Highlighted in this image
is the bicep tendon,

00:02:20.398 --> 00:02:21.764
also in cross section

00:02:21.764 --> 00:02:26.104
with the supraspinatus
tendon's anterior margin.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:28.309
From the transverse or
cross section image,

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:30.558
we will now switch to the long axis,

00:02:30.558 --> 00:02:34.350
or sagittal cut of the
supraspinatus tendon

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.227
at the anterior margin of
the greater tuberosity.

00:02:39.227 --> 00:02:41.791
Here's the corresponding long axis section

00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:43.292
of the supraspinatus tendon

00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:45.375
as it inserts to the greater tuberosity.

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:47.558
Highlighted here is the humeral head

00:02:47.558 --> 00:02:49.944
and greater tuberosity in profile.

00:02:49.944 --> 00:02:53.085
It is not uncommon to see
a long axis deltoid muscle

00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:57.510
in relation to the long axis
of the supraspinatus tendon.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.180
Highlighted in the next
image is the long axis

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.747
of the supraspinatus tendon

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:05.308
as it inserts to the greater tuberosity.

00:03:05.308 --> 00:03:08.141
Supraspinatus pathological images.

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:12.077
This image demonstrates an
anterior full-thickness tear,

00:03:12.077 --> 00:03:15.304
as well as a bursal
surface mid-segment tear

00:03:15.304 --> 00:03:17.637
of the supraspinatus tendon.

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.793
Here we have multiple tear sites

00:03:20.793 --> 00:03:24.960
with no volume loss identified
in the transverse image.

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:30.045
Here we have anterior
articular surface tearing,

00:03:30.045 --> 00:03:33.197
demonstrating volume loss
as hypoechoic absence

00:03:33.197 --> 00:03:34.614
of tendon fibers.

00:03:35.774 --> 00:03:38.258
Here we have postoperative re-tear

00:03:38.258 --> 00:03:40.555
of the anterior supraspinatus tendon.

00:03:40.555 --> 00:03:43.607
Locating the exact site
of this tear is difficult,

00:03:43.607 --> 00:03:45.163
as the bicep tendon is not

00:03:45.163 --> 00:03:48.117
in its normally-situated bicipital groove.

00:03:48.117 --> 00:03:51.539
Scanning from the empty
biceps groove posteriorly

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:54.003
will reveal our first and best landmark

00:03:54.003 --> 00:03:56.986
of the lateral greater
tuberosity in profile.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:59.143
Scanning too posteriorly may reveal

00:03:59.143 --> 00:04:03.732
a falsely normal rotator
cuff as demonstrated in blue.

00:04:03.732 --> 00:04:06.077
Here is a corresponding
normal rotator cuff

00:04:06.077 --> 00:04:09.388
with a normally-situated bicep
tendon highlighted in blue

00:04:09.388 --> 00:04:11.403
where the dislocated is in red.

00:04:11.403 --> 00:04:13.839
In this case, a long
axis greater tuberosity

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:16.089
would be a better landmark.

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:21.386
Subtle intrasubstance tearing
is often harder to identify.

00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:25.979
There is a hyperechoic layer
over the subacromial bursa,

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.717
called peribursal fat,

00:04:27.717 --> 00:04:31.516
and a lubricating layer that
is the actual bursal void,

00:04:31.516 --> 00:04:34.139
followed by the
supraspinatus tendon itself.

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.466
Area of interest here is
the dip or the concave

00:04:37.466 --> 00:04:41.633
in what would normally be a
convex-appearing bursal layer.

00:04:44.548 --> 00:04:47.355
In long axis, this normally
convex-appearing cuff

00:04:47.355 --> 00:04:51.338
may actually be flattened instead
of rounded as we see here.

00:04:51.338 --> 00:04:55.287
Again, take care to scan
through the entire cuff

00:04:55.287 --> 00:04:58.869
to avoid any false positives
as we have demonstrated here

00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:01.619
as a falsely-normal cuff in blue.
