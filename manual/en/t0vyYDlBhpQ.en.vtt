00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:13.875
10 reasons not to play League of Legends

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:22.860
impairment of the time estimates

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.220
yawn

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.100
so now we have gambled enough

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.040
how much is it actually Clock

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.760
What? It's been 5 Clock

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.280
at midday?

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.940
Saturday?

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.120
Expensive proposition or save time-consuming

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.180
And then Catherine that are 790 RP

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.980
A total of 8820

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.480
What pack then I would need?

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.720
No, not enough

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:06.535
50 euros?!

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.220
And then Catherine that are 1350 EP

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.040
These are 50550 EP

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.240
If I assume that I get 120 per game experience...

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.020
...equals

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.760
420 games?!

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:38.360
the queue

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.220
So now is first gambled

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.580
crapgame, hangs again, restart

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.960
28 minutes later

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.360
Queue position 1

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.100
Even a 10 minute drive

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.920
Not received a response from the server try again

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:25.080
The eternal dispute in the lobby

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:51.040
Neglecting the important things in life

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.100
Ernie how are you? Greets him a little further the Cookie Monster...

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.400
Would you like a cookie?

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.660
Yes?

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.680
Yes, I 'll be right there

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.860
Good night!

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.680
And who brings me to bed now?

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:25.240
bitching on the lane

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.540
Player has left the game

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:03.560
Long running time without a break

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.120
So now people once again gambled hard

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.200
Are you coming to bed? I'm waiting...

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.040
Hey I just started a new round

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.140
Then just pause the game

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.620
Promotion of aggression

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.320
An enemy is legendary

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.020
Heaven ass and thread

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.060
I won't play this fucking game anymore

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.020
Well, how was your day? Tell me!

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.000
My day was so awesome

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.960
we had such a awesome round in league of legends

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.615
It all started crappy...

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.420
Our Anivia was harassed all the time by the opposing Fizz

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.414
The Jungler always came at the right time

00:05:34.414 --> 00:05:36.035
And after four ganks Anivia had no pleasure anymore

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:37.325
ragequit!

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.455
we, the four remaining, farmed there's no tomorrow

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.684
I have made well last hits as carry 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.860
And then we see the opponents at the warded baron

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.835
I slam my ulti absolute mid

00:05:47.835 --> 00:05:49.352
The rest got easy chased

00:05:49.352 --> 00:05:50.152
My support took a stun

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.060
I got a penta

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.100
We destroy the Nexus in peace with our minions

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.080
Ey, so awesome!

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:16.120
Progressive development to emotional zombies

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.380
Victory!

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.240
Yes! Victory!

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.295
Victory!

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.280
YES!

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.400
[singing]

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.560
Victory!

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.640
Well, I'm just so good I should do that shit professionally and earn money with it

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.060
Defeat!

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.415
lost!

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.480
Hey please not again! Second already lost.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.700
Anyway, I didn't want to play the game anymore. I start something new.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.360
Noooo! Craaaaap!

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.960
