00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.050
I am B-Girl Ling from Unique Style Crew,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.030
Hong Kong's first ever B-Girl dance crew.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.230
Hong Kong is a place full of culture and people with different mindsets.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.100
This is where I grew up.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.090
This is my hometown, Hong Kong.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.220
Unique Style Crew started out with six b-girls,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.200
but over time a few dropped out of the group

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.070
and only four core members remained.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.020
We were very active in Hong Kong and Mainland China

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.363
and competed in many dance battles.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.150
Unique Style Crew won many awards in these competitions.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.060
This time at BC One

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.190
I'm not competing as a crew member, but rather I'm going alone to battle.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.250
But I can feel the support of my crew,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.200
they're all behind me on this head-to-head battle with these b-boys.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.100
So this is my moment

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.150
And it has nothing to do with just winning an award.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.120
I'm playing an important role on the dance floor this time

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.000
I'm representing all the b-girls.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.150
The venue is great, the vibe is awesome,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.090
the stage is setup under the highway bridge.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.150
I'm feeling quite calm at the moment.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.260
I'm well aware of what I need to do later

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.040
so hopefully I'll perform well in the competition.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.020
B-Boy Bigki is the most inspiring person to me in Hong Kong.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.020
He made a lasting impression on me with his quick power moves,

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.100
his body looks so light, his movements are perfect.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.290
This time at Red Bull BC One

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.180
Bigki happens to be one of the judges while I'm a competitor on stage.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.170
My challenge is to do a really good routine

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.280
one that would actually impress him.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.270
Whether you're a b-boy or a b-girl

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.000
the main focus when battling is to be yourself.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.090
Only then can you have your own thoughts

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.070
which translate to having your own moves and your own flavor.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.250
Sure I get pressured about my age and gender

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.000
But as one of my friends once told me as encouragement:

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.260
"Never let anything stop you.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:56.020
Don't think you have to stop because you have to get married or form a family.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.100
When you enter into the next stage of life

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.170
you need to have even more love and courage

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.200
to pick up what's in front of you and bring breaking into life's next chapter."

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.110
B-girl Ling's performance was eye-opening.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.000
It made me realize I too need to continue working hard and keep on breaking.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.130
This was an amazing experience.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.230
Breaking is not a matter of competition

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.050
it's a life long journey.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.100
You battle, reflect, practice, then repeat.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.240
I feel I achieved what I set out to do for this competition.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.120
At every competition, there's only one winner, but a bunch of runner ups.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.160
How do you balance between winning a prize and gaining an experience?

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.220
And under what circumstances would you say: "Yes, you've achieved your goal"?

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.060
I'm very happy about my performance here

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.190
Being here was an accomplishment itself

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.170
because I was the only girl standing on stage

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.220
making through 2 rounds of qualifiers.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.000
And a lot of friends are here to support me

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.100
including my crew mates.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.000
My b-boys who practices with me are all very proud of me.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.200
I am truly grateful - this was my prize.
