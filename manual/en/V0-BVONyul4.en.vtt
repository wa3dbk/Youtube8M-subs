00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.497
CHAOTIC CHRONICLES

00:00:12.035 --> 00:00:14.523
Here is what happens when you don't pay enough attention to radar

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:16.684
while working at home.

00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:19.950
Nice storms develops just to the west of the city

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.613
but you leave too late and you're stuck in a traffic jam...

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.865
I hope I'll be able to get out of the city to observe it more confortably.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.235
It looks like there are pretty bases.

00:00:33.953 --> 00:00:35.360
It won't be easy...

00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:40.159
As crazy as it sounds, I managed to reach the highway.

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:44.012
Now I'm driving east towards the blue sky.

00:00:44.363 --> 00:00:47.178
Trying to reposition myself just in front of the cell.

00:00:53.777 --> 00:00:57.269
THE CELL EVENTUALLY WEAKENS...

00:01:02.923 --> 00:01:08.852
THEN IT STRENGHTENS AGAIN WHILE GOING AWAY.

00:01:11.114 --> 00:01:13.074
June 11th, 52Â°F

00:01:13.194 --> 00:01:15.435
FROZEN STORMCHASER

00:02:00.773 --> 00:02:04.467
LYON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

00:04:06.294 --> 00:04:09.938
