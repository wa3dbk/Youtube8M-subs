00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.400
I can't quite understand the truths of the world.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.350
I can't reach them, between us a great distance.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.550
Somewhere, buried, an unnoticed history,

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.750
but when I stood over my feet I saw the far side.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.000
The world is filled with sorrow,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.650
the evidence is just at sight,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.150
it's wounded but still standing,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.250
still resisting, and sticking to its vow.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.800
The weak shows no mercy for others.
still resisting, and sticking to its vow.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.150
To build up...
still resisting, and sticking to its vow.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.950
To build up...
~

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.400
To build up an eternal paradise!

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.800
What is the right thing

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.200
(Get Wild!)
What is the right thing

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.800
(Get Wild!)
and what the wrong thing to do?

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.600
and what the wrong thing to do?

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.950
(Get it!)
and what the wrong thing to do?

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.600
(Get it!)
Don't give in yet,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.350
Don't give in yet,

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.750
(Don’t Stop!)
Don't give in yet,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.350
(Don’t Stop!)
don't give up, little girl.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.150
don't give up, little girl.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.550
(Let’s Fight!)
don't give up, little girl.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.150
(Let’s Fight!)
Being imprisoned but wise

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.950
Being imprisoned but wise

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.350
(Get Wild!)
Being imprisoned but wise

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.950
(Get Wild!)
or being free to face the worst,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.750
or being free to face the worst,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.150
(Get it!)
or being free to face the worst,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.750
(Get it!)
What will the world choose?

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.500
What will the world choose?

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.900
(Don’t Stop!)
What will the world choose?

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.500
(Don’t Stop!)
Where will I go to?

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.700
Where will I go to?

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.200
The world will eventually become
the place I wish for but,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.100
which will be the price for it?
I don't know.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.750
Get Wild!

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.450
Get It!

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.250
Don’t Stop!

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.100
Let’s Fight!

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800
Get Wild!
