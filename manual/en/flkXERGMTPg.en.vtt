Hi, I'm Alex MacRae, a social dynamics instructor,
on behalf of expertvillage.com I'll be talking

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.490
today on the topic of picking up women in
bars and clubs. I'd like to say a few words

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:20.100
about topics of conversation that work well
in bars and clubs. Always remember the golden

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.090
rule of bars and clubs is that people are
out to have a good time, be social, and meet

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.989
people who are of equal or higher energy than
them, that give them energy in the interactions.

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:40.170
A few topics of conversation that work very
well are things like gossip and current events.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.719
If there's a big movie that just came out
that half the people in the bar or club want

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.629
to talk about that or would be willing to.
If there's a celebrity that recently got arrested

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:57.980
for something crazy, talk about that. A few
other things you can talk about are big stories

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.239
from your own life that you remember that
we're amazing. You can say, Oh my gosh one

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.870
time I was skinny dipping and then this shark
came by and I don't know why there was a shark

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.670
in a fresh water lake and blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah. A lot of the time if you are in

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.400
the right mood and you're relating to people
well, you can fib a little in your stories

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.070
and people will understand you're fibbing
for the sake of entertainment. In other words,

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.360
of course there was never actually a shark
in a fresh water lake, but if I'm fibbing

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.080
with people, if we're both having a good time
and if we're both trading fun stories, then

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.770
I can get away with saying something like
that and it's fun, flirty, and exciting. A

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.600
few things to never talk about in bars and
clubs are pretty simple, politics, religion

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.630
and family. You can bet that with politics
and religion you'll meet someone in the group

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.170
that will have a different view with you or
that just won't want to about it at that moment.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:05.060
And as far as family goes, families are generally
not the type of people that go to bars and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.219
clubs. They're not family environments. People
sometimes are there to escape their families

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:14.510
or they might have negative experiences with
their families. So remember, keep things fun,

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.129
light, and exciting. Talk about gossip, current
affairs, things that are fun that you just

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:28.579
heard in the news, exciting bits of commentary
that you just heard and also talk about yourself.

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:34.379
Fun exciting things that maybe happened last
week, maybe happened a year ago but you can

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.129
still relate to here and now. Thanks for listening.
