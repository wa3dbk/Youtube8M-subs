00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.569
I am wearing Marmot's Super Mica jacket, one
of my favorite backpacking shells.

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.550
At 8.7 ounces it is really, really light weight.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.300
It is really packable, but it has got some
really smart features that are perfect for

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.780
backpackers.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.680
The jacket is constructed of Marmot's proprietary
nanopro membrane fabric so you have got a

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.460
waterproof, breathable jacket.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.020
All of the seams are taped so you know you
have got the protection you need even when

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.349
the weather turns nasty.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.710
With weight in mind you can see it is a pretty
trim fit on this jacket.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.910
I have got a t-shirt underneath it.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.270
You could have some light weight base layers
underneath it, but all in all, like I said,

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.490
it is a pretty close fit.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.860
It does have Marmot's angel wing movement
construction so you really can move around

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.730
inside this jacket without it riding up on
you and that is certainly a nice fea-ture

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.870
for on the go usage.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.720
As far as adjustability is concerned on the
Super Mica, you do have some Velcro cuff treatments.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.530
I can kind of cinch that at the wrist.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.250
You also have a single pull draw cord at the
hem so you can pull that jacket, snug it in

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.530
at the waist.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.000
It also is a hooded jacket.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.470
There are dual points of adjustability on
the hood as well, back and also at the sides.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.810
You do have two front pockets.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.200
They are set high so that if you are wearing
a backpack or even a climbing harness, for

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.810
that matter, you would still have access to
them even if that backpack or harness were

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.009
in place.

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.439
They are open in the back so there is some
mesh netting there that actually gives you

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.070
some breathability when those are open.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.640
You also do have integrated pit zips on the
jacket so if you do warm up, things start

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.470
to get stuffy, you can let some of that hot
air out.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.960
That is a really, really nice touch on a jacket
that weighs all of 8.7 ounces.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.359
A lot of time when you are dealing with a
jacket that is that light weight you are not

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:11.420
getting pit zipped.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.529
You may even need to skimp on pocketing as
far as that goes.

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:20.519
Another feature that certainly needs to be
touched on with this Super Mica jacket is

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.609
some of the texturing that you are seeing
here on the shoulder and also at the side

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:27.609
of the jacket.

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.970
Can you imagine me wearing a back pack?

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.950
That waist belt comes right across that textur-ing
here, as does the shoulder harness and just

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:37.950
bolsters that.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.260
So we have got light weight fabrication all
throughout, but a little bit more durability

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.900
at those key wear points.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.909
So it is that mix, that combination of light
weight construction, packability and then

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:58.540
backpacking friendly features that certainly
make this a jacket I throw in a pack whether

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.419
I need it as an emergency shell or I know
I am going to be running into rain and definitely

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:07.290
going to be taking this in or out of the pack
during the trip.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.659
It is the Marmot Super Mica jacket.
