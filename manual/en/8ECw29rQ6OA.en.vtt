00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:08.950
And this is one of the units for the five-pointed
star. Make five units exactly the same, and

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:15.789
we are going to assemble it just like the
five-pointed the regular five-pointed star.

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:28.289
Lift up the triangle, and tuck this section
right into the rabbit ear.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:54.239
Collapse it, and take another one. Tuck it
right into that rabbit ear; collapse it,

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:08.060
take another one. Tuck it into that rabbit
ear;

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:20.819
collapse it. And the final piece, which is
always the trickiest,

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:25.920
collapse it. Now we have one, two, three,
four, five points. Now we are going to bring

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:54.740
it around, and tuck this section right into
that rabbit ear. Turn it over, and shape it.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.219
And there is your slender five-pointed star.
