da Vinci Jr.1.0 - Printer Quality Maintenance

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.100
If the print quality of your da Vinci Jr. 1.0 3D printer is not desirable,

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.100
it may be due to the following

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.100
Multiple prints may cause damage to the print bed tape.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.600
When this occurs, the printed product may not be able to attach onto the print bed

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.900
To replace the bed tape, first move the print bed forward to an appropriate distance

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.000
Next, take your new print bed tape

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.700
Peal the relase paper from the tape by by about 3 cm

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:38.000
And then slowly fasten the tape onto the print bed

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.700
Note: The print bed tape is reusable

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.800
But must be replaced when worn out

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.500
Over time, carbon and dirt may accumulate as you print

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.300
This may also impact your print quality

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.700
It is recommended to clean the nozzle after every 25 hours of printing

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.400
Select “UTILITIES”

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.500
Then, select “CLEAN NOZZLE”

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.900
At last, select “YES”

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.300
Wait for the extruder to heat up.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.900
As the temperature rises to the target temperature, the extruder will automatically move to the center of the machine.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.400
When the temperature is reached, your screen will then read +READY FOR CLEAN+

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.900
To avoid burns, please grip the cleaning wire of the nozzle with needle-nosed pliers.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:33.400
Insert it into the hole of the nozzle carefully and clean it up and down.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.800
After cleaning, press the +OK+ button to exit this function

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.200
In addition to cleaning the nozzle, we also recommend regularly cleaning the gear as well.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.200
Insert the gear cleaning brush into gear hole.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.800
Brush up and down to clear any dirt that may be in the gear

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.100
If the extruder is too old, it may be clogged and unable to extrude filament

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.500
When this occur, replacing the extruder is recommended

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.600
Before replacing the extruder, please be sure to unload all materials first.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.000
Select “UTILITIES”

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.500
Then, select “CHANGE SPOOL”.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.800
At last, select “UNLOAD FILAMENT”

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.500
Wait for the extruder to heat up.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.200
Manually turn the spool when unloading the filament

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.500
to ease the unloading process.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.500
Select “UTILITIES”

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.400
Select “HOME AXES”

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.900
Press+YES+

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:47.700
Wait for the extruder return

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.800
Shut down the power

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.200
Press the rear white button and remove the extruder module.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.400
Take off the cable

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.400
Press the springs around the feed port

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.800
Take off the filament guide tube

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.600
Note: If the end of the print guide tube is flattened after removing the tube,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.100
this may make feeding and extruding filament difficult

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.500
When this occurs, cut the deformed section using a blade

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.100
The minimum overall length of the tube has to be 50 cm after cutting.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.900
Insert the guide tube into the new extruder

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.800
Connect the cable and new extruder connector

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.300
Reinstall the extruder to the printer

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:55.800
Note: Make sure the wire has been fastened securely into the wire slot.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.000
You have now completed replacing the extruder

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.600
If the print quality has not improved,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.200
Please adjust the print module by using the “Z OFFSET” (print module adjustment) function

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.300
Select “UTILITIES”

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.300
followed by selecting “Z OFFSET” (print module adjustment).

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.100
This function is used to adjust the gap between the print nozzle and the print bed.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.700
Before adjusting the Z axis, record the original Z OFFSET value first,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.500
adjust the Z OFFSET based on this initial value

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:33.600
The recommended distance between the nozzle and print bed(with bed tape securely fastened) should allow two sheets of A4 paper to be drawn out smoothly

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.800
Increase/decrease the value based on a scale of 0.1mm.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.900
Increasing the value will increase the gap between the print module and print bed by 0.1mm

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.200
Decreasing the valube will also decrease the gap between the print module and print bed by 0.1 mm

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.500
Perform test prints before considering further adjustments

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.400
Press +OK+ to end adjustment of print module.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:59.200
Quality maintenance of the da Vinci Jr. 1.0 3D printer is now complete!
