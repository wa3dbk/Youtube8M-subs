00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:04.167
- WELCOME TO A LESSON
ON COMPLEX NUMBERS.

00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:05.867
THE GOALS OF THIS VIDEO 
ARE TO IDENTIFY

00:00:05.867 --> 00:00:08.000
IMAGINARY AND COMPLEX NUMBERS

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.533
AND ALSO TO SIMPLIFY IMAGINARY 
AND COMPLEX NUMBERS.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:18.933
SO IF YOU WERE ASKED TO SOLVE 
THE EQUATION X SQUARED + 1 = 0,

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.400
YOU MAY TRY TO FACTOR THIS.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.300
BUT THAT WOULDN'T WORK,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.367
BECAUSE IT'S NOT A DIFFERENCE 
OF SQUARES.

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:26.300
THEN YOU MAY RESORT 
TO THE QUADRATIC FORMULA,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.833
AND THAT WOULDN'T WORK.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:29.533
BUT WE COULD ALSO JUST 
SOLVE THIS EQUATION

00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.400
USING SQUARE ROOTS,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.767
MEANING IF WE ISOLATE 
THE X SQUARED BY SUBTRACTING 1

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:40.633
ON BOTH SIDES, 
WE WOULD HAVE X SQUARED = -1.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:44.533
NOW, WE CAN TAKE THE SQUARE ROOT 
OF BOTH SIDES,

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.033
AND WE COME UP 
WITH A SOLUTION THAT SAYS

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:50.933
X = + OR - THE SQUARE ROOT 
OF -1,

00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:54.633
OR X EQUALS 
POSITIVE SQUARE ROOT -1,

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:59.667
OR X EQUALS 
NEGATIVE SQUARE ROOT -1.

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:02.573
THIS IS ACTUALLY 
A NEW TYPE OF SOLUTION

00:01:02.573 --> 00:01:04.507
WHICH LEADS 
TO A NEW SET OF NUMBERS,

00:01:04.507 --> 00:01:07.673
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT USED TO HAVING

00:01:07.673 --> 00:01:09.107
THE SQUARE ROOT 
OF NEGATIVE NUMBERS.

00:01:09.107 --> 00:01:13.073
BUT IN FACT IF WE SUB THESE INTO 
THE ORIGINAL EQUATION FOR X,

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.507
REMEMBER IF YOU SQUARE A SQUARE 
ROOT, THEY UNDO EACH OTHER,

00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:18.507
SO THESE ARE SOLUTIONS 
TO THIS EQUATION.

00:01:18.507 --> 00:01:20.140
THIS LED TO A NEW SET OF NUMBERS

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.240
AND TWO NEW DEFINITIONS

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.207
THAT "I" IS EQUAL 
TO THE SQUARE ROOT OF -1

00:01:26.207 --> 00:01:29.373
AND "I" SQUARED IS EQUAL TO -1.

00:01:29.373 --> 00:01:31.873
SO AGAIN, THIS LED 
TO A NEW SET OF NUMBERS

00:01:31.873 --> 00:01:33.840
CALLED THE IMAGINARY NUMBERS

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.307
WHICH THEN LED TO THE SET 
OF COMPLEX NUMBERS.

00:01:37.307 --> 00:01:39.140
FIRST, 
IMAGINARY NUMBERS ARE THOSE

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.207
IN THE FORM OF THE SQUARE ROOT 
OF "A" WHERE "A"

00:01:42.207 --> 00:01:45.473
IS A NEGATIVE REAL NUMBER.

00:01:45.473 --> 00:01:48.973
HERE ARE THREE EXAMPLES 
OF IMAGINARY NUMBERS.

00:01:48.973 --> 00:01:51.073
WE CAN SIMPLIFY THESE 
VERY SIMILAR

00:01:51.073 --> 00:01:53.307
TO HOW WE SIMPLIFY SQUARE ROOTS

00:01:53.307 --> 00:01:55.373
EXCEPT NOW WE 
HAVE A NEW DEFINITION

00:01:55.373 --> 00:01:57.573
TO DEAL WITH THE NEGATIVE.

00:01:57.573 --> 00:02:04.613
SO WE COULD REWRITE THIS 
AS THE SQUARE ROOT OF -1 x 64

00:02:04.613 --> 00:02:08.380
WHICH IS EQUAL TO THE SQUARE 
ROOT OF -1 x THE SQUARE ROOT

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.213
OF 64.

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:13.213
WELL NOW BY DEFINITION, 
THIS IS EQUAL TO "I,"

00:02:13.213 --> 00:02:14.880
THIS IS EQUAL TO 8,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.047
SO THIS SIMPLIFIES 
TO THE IMAGINARY NUMBER 8I.

00:02:20.047 --> 00:02:27.347
ON THIS NEXT ONE, THIS IS -2 
x THE SQUARE ROOT -16 IS -2

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:32.080
x THE SQUARE ROOT OF -1 x 16.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.780
SO REALLY IT'S VERY SIMILAR 
TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.180
IN THE PAST WITH SQUARE ROOTS,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.247
WE JUST HAVE AN EXTRA FACTOR
OF -1 WHICH GIVES US AN "I."

00:02:40.247 --> 00:02:43.613
SO YOU CAN PROBABLY 
SEE THIS WOULD BE -2 TIMES,

00:02:43.613 --> 00:02:47.580
THIS WOULD BE EQUAL TO "I," 
THIS WOULD BE EQUAL TO 4,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.247
SO WE'D HAVE -2 x 4I 
WHICH IS EQUAL TO -8I.

00:02:54.247 --> 00:03:01.587
THE SQUARE ROOT OF -27 
IS EQUAL TO -1 x 27.

00:03:01.587 --> 00:03:07.453
27 IS NOT A PERFECT SQUARE, 
SO IT WOULD BE 3 x 3 x 3.

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:11.987
SO THE SQUARE ROOT OF -1 
SIMPLIFIES TO "I,"

00:03:11.987 --> 00:03:15.220
THE SQUARE ROOT OF 9 
SIMPLIFIES TO 3,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.853
SO THIS WOULD GIVE US A 3I,

00:03:17.853 --> 00:03:21.587
AND THEN WE'RE LEFT 
WITH SQUARE ROOT 3.

00:03:21.587 --> 00:03:23.053
NOW IF WE TRIED TO SOLVE 
THE EQUATION

00:03:23.053 --> 00:03:26.387
X SQUARED - 10X + 34 = 0,

00:03:26.387 --> 00:03:29.587
THAT ALSO DOESN'T FACTOR 
SO WE WOULD APPLY

00:03:29.587 --> 00:03:31.420
THE QUADRATIC FORMULA,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.620
AND I'VE ALREADY DONE THIS 
TO SAVE SOME TIME.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.753
BUT WHAT'S NEW ABOUT THIS IS

00:03:34.753 --> 00:03:36.620
WHEN WE SIMPLIFY 
THE DISCRIMINANT,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.720
WE END UP GETTING THE SQUARE 
ROOT OF -36,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.820
WHICH LEADS TO PART 
OF THIS ANSWER BEING IMAGINARY.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.620
SO WE HAVE 10 + OR - 6I, 
ALL DIVIDED BY 2.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.320
WE DIVIDE BOTH TERMS 
AND NUMERATOR BY 2,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.953
WE HAVE 5 + 3I.

00:03:53.953 --> 00:03:57.487
SO THERE IS AN IMAGINARY NUMBER 
AS PART OF THIS SOLUTION.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.220
BUT THERE'S ALSO A REAL PART

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.260
AND THAT LED 
TO ANOTHER SET OF NUMBERS

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.027
CALLED THE COMPLEX NUMBERS.

00:04:04.027 --> 00:04:05.893
COMPLEX NUMBERS 
ARE THOSE NUMBERS

00:04:05.893 --> 00:04:10.160
WRITTEN IN THE FORM OF "A" + BI 
WHERE "A" AND B ARE REAL NUMBERS

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.227
AND "I" IS THE SQUARE ROOT 
OF -1.

00:04:12.227 --> 00:04:15.260
SO WE HAVE A REAL PART, 
THAT'S THE "A" PART,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.727
AND WE HAVE THE IMAGINARY PART, 
THE BI PART,

00:04:18.727 --> 00:04:21.393
AND "A" + BI 
IS CALLED THE STANDARD FORM

00:04:21.393 --> 00:04:24.493
OF A COMPLEX NUMBER.

00:04:24.493 --> 00:04:27.627
SO IF WE WANTED TO SIMPLIFY 
THESE COMPLEX NUMBERS

00:04:27.627 --> 00:04:29.893
IN THE FORM OF "A" + BI,

00:04:29.893 --> 00:04:33.627
WE STILL NEED TO SIMPLIFY 
THE IMAGINARY PART.

00:04:33.627 --> 00:04:39.993
SO WE'D HAVE 7 - SQUARE ROOT 
OF -1 x 4.

00:04:39.993 --> 00:04:41.860
WE KNOW NOW 
THIS WILL GIVE US "I,"

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.593
WE KNOW THE SQUARE ROOT OF 4 
IS 2,

00:04:44.593 --> 00:04:51.960
SO THIS WOULD SIMPLIFY 
TO 7 - 2I.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.893
AND AGAIN, 
IT'S IN THE FORM OF "A" + BI.

00:04:56.893 --> 00:05:00.967
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ONE MORE 
HERE.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.033
AFTER YOU DO THESE AWHILE,

00:05:02.033 --> 00:05:04.467
YOU PROBABLY LOOK 
AT THAT AND SEE 3I.

00:05:04.467 --> 00:05:06.300
BUT FOR THE PURPOSE 
OF SHOWING WORK,

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:14.367
LET'S GO AHEAD AND REWRITE 
THIS AS -1 x 9/4,

00:05:14.367 --> 00:05:17.233
SO WE'D HAVE 6 PLUS,

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.100
NOW THE SQUARE ROOT OF -1 
WILL GIVE US "I",

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.800
THE SQUARE ROOT OF 9 
WILL GIVE US 3,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.500
THIS IS EQUAL TO 3I x 4.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.200
THAT WOULD BE 12I 
ALL DIVIDED BY 4.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.600
NOW, BE CAREFUL 
SIMPLIFYING HERE.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.600
WE CANNOT JUST SIMPLIFY 
THE 6 AND THE 4.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.233
WE CANNOT SIMPLIFY 
ACROSS ADDITION.

00:05:35.233 --> 00:05:38.067
SO WE SHOULD REWRITE THIS 
AS TWO SEPARATE FRACTIONS,

00:05:38.067 --> 00:05:43.233
6 DIVIDED BY 4 + 12I 
DIVIDED BY 4,

00:05:43.233 --> 00:05:52.233
THIS GIVES US 3 HALVES + 3I, 
AGAIN IN THE FORM OF A + BI.

00:05:52.233 --> 00:05:54.267
LET'S TAKE A LOOK 
AT HOW THE SETS OF NUMBERS

00:05:54.267 --> 00:05:56.633
RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER 
WITH A VENN DIAGRAM.

00:05:56.633 --> 00:05:59.633
HERE WE HAVE THE NATURAL 
NUMBERS, WHOLE NUMBERS,

00:05:59.633 --> 00:06:05.140
INTEGERS, RATIONAL, IRRATIONAL 
NUMBERS, REAL NUMBERS,

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.040
THEN THE NEW SETS, 
THE COMPLEX NUMBERS

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.973
AND THE IMAGINARY NUMBERS.

00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:11.673
AND NOW THAT WE KNOW 
THAT COMPLEX NUMBERS

00:06:11.673 --> 00:06:14.607
HAVE BOTH A REAL PART 
AND AN IMAGINARY PART,

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:15.573
YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS IS GOING

00:06:15.573 --> 00:06:18.973
TO BE THE MOST ENCOMPASSING 
SET OF NUMBERS.

00:06:18.973 --> 00:06:21.140
SO THE COMPLEX NUMBERS 
WOULD BE OUT HERE

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.440
IN THE FORM OF "A" + BI.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.073
NEXT, SINCE THE COMPLEX NUMBERS 
ARE MADE UP

00:06:26.073 --> 00:06:28.973
OF A REAL PART AND IMAGINARY 
PART, THESE TWO SETS

00:06:28.973 --> 00:06:31.773
WOULD BE THE REAL NUMBERS 
AND THE IMAGINARY NUMBERS.

00:06:31.773 --> 00:06:36.773
SO THE REAL NUMBERS, 
DENOTED WITH A CAPITAL R,

00:06:36.773 --> 00:06:40.007
WOULD BE HERE AND THE IMAGINARY 
NUMBER WOULD BE OVER HERE.

00:06:40.007 --> 00:06:41.207
THEY DO NOT OVERLAP.

00:06:41.207 --> 00:06:43.640
NOW, THE REMAINING SETS ARE ONES 
WE'VE ALREADY BEEN WORKING WITH

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.840
THROUGHOUT OUR STUDY OF ALGEBRA,

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.773
SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND START 
WITH THIS INNERMOST RECTANGLE.

00:06:49.773 --> 00:06:51.640
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK 
AT THE REMAINING SETS HERE,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.773
WE HAVE NATURAL NUMBERS, 
WHOLE NUMBERS, INTEGERS,

00:06:54.773 --> 00:06:56.873
RATIONAL AND IRRATIONALS.

00:06:56.873 --> 00:06:59.947
WELL, THE NATURAL NUMBERS ARE 1, 
2, 3, OR THE COUNTING NUMBERS.

00:06:59.947 --> 00:07:02.413
THEY WOULD BE THE INNERMOST SET.

00:07:02.413 --> 00:07:03.813
NEXT, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE

00:07:03.813 --> 00:07:06.580
BETWEEN WHOLE NUMBERS 
AND NATURAL NUMBERS

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.347
IS THAT THE SET OF WHOLE NUMBERS 
INCLUDES ZERO.

00:07:09.347 --> 00:07:13.947
SO THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT SET.

00:07:13.947 --> 00:07:15.780
NEXT COMES THE INTEGERS.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.047
INTEGERS CONSIST 
OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE

00:07:18.047 --> 00:07:23.480
NATURAL NUMBERS AND ZERO, SO 
THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT SET.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.113
AND NOW, WE'RE LEFT 
WITH TWO SETS

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:27.213
AND THAT'S GOING TO CONSIST

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:30.247
OF THE RATIONAL 
AND IRRATIONAL NUMBERS.

00:07:30.247 --> 00:07:33.980
NATURAL NUMBERS, WHOLE NUMBERS 
AND INTEGERS ARE RATIONAL,

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.180
SO THEY WOULD BE WITHIN THE SET 
OF RATIONAL NUMBERS

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:42.447
WHICH LEAVES THIS SET OVER HERE 
TO BE THE IRRATIONAL NUMBERS.

00:07:42.447 --> 00:07:44.480
SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW 
THE SETS OF NUMBERS

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.980
RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER,

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.447
SO YOU MIGHT CONSIDER 
SKETCHING ONE OF THESE DIAGRAMS

00:07:48.447 --> 00:07:50.880
INTO YOUR NOTES.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.913
WE WILL COVER THE OPERATIONS
OF COMPLEX NUMBERS

00:07:52.913 --> 00:07:55.013
IN THE NEXT VIDEO.

00:07:55.013 --> 00:07:57.247
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.
