00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.500
Capture One Pro 7 includes a new 
processing engine developed by Phase One. 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
This new engine improves on our 
existing reputation for image quality 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but now with superior results.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Every digital image file needs to be interpolated
from the raw data to create the full color image.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is the job of the processing engine.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.400
With this new processing engine 
the out of the box results have been 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.000
improved with even better color 
rendition, noise reduction and detail.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Together this gives you better 
results with less time and effort.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.200
In this tutorial we'll have a 
closer look at the highlights 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.500
of the improved processing engine.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.000
Each camera supported by Capture One Pro 7 
has been individually optimized to minimize 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.500
the effective noise without reducing details.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.000
Noise reduction settings are applied here 
by default for your particular camera.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The methods we use have been improved 
to give better out of the box results,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
giving you a head start in production 
and saving valuable time.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.500
Particular attention has been 
paid to higher ISO images,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.000
meaning that you can shoot at 
these speeds with more confidence.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The HDR tool, High Dynamic Range,
has been further improved to give 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.500
better control over the highlights 
and shadows in an image.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.500
A better separation of the highlights 
and shadows is now possible whilst 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.000
maintaining good contrast in the 
shadows and detail in the highlights.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.500
The clarity tool has a new option called 'punch'.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.000
This option boosts color saturation as well 
as reducing haze and increasing contrast.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The neutral option can still be 
used to preserve color saturation.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.300
'Punch' also includes the new structure slider.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.000
Use this to add greater detail to complex 
structures such as foliage and textiles.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The new lens tool now includes lens profiles 
for popular lenses from multiple manufacturers. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Where possible the lens 
selection will be automatic.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Distortion, chromatic aberration, light 
falloff and purple fringing are all corrected.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
In Capture One Pro 6 the lens tool 
also included the LCC option.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
LCC is lens cast calibration. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Now LCC has a dedicated tool in Capture One 
Pro 7 with a simplified and improved workflow.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.000
Many of these new tools 
contain an auto-adjust feature.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Simply click on the A icon in the tool 
for Capture One Pro to apply the settings.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
These can work as a great start point. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
In Capture One Pro 7 the white 
balance tool is also included.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Images can be automatically 
adjusted as they are imported to. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.500
Finally, Capture One Pro 7 can export images at 
expedited speed thanks to open CO processing. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.500

tools, watch the individual videos about them
