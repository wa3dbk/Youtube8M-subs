00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.670
Any additional ways to stimulate hair growth
post FUE?

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.510
I had 1500 grafts at the end of July and my
hair is growing, but only certain hairs.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.640
I was wondering when I will see hair growth
in the areas between these seemingly dominant

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.640
hairs?

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.070
And what I can do to help?

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.710
I have been using Rogaine for a month now,
with no result yet, as expected.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.660
Not sure if this matters, but I wear a hat,
a lot.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.670
I know that I am probably jumping the gun,
by asking this so early, but any comments

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.049
will be very welcome.

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.239
Best Regards.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.410
Thank you for your question!

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:15.670
It has been about 4 months since you had your
hair transplant where you've gotten 1500 hairs

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:24.170
and your expressing your concern about the
growth in between the dominant hairs and that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.380
you've been using rogaine.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.740
It seems that you are nervous about where
things are going or whether things are going

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.740
well.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:43.759
First of all, in hair transplant surgery,
there are a lot of factors to understand when

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:50.790
it comes to the anticipation of the amount
of growth that you will have.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:02:00.280
But simply stated, this is still very early
in the course of your hair growth after transplant.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:08.649
In my practice, even with a lot of advanced
methods and hair regenerative technology that

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:19.560
we employ, we still say that the full result
is approximately one year after the transplant.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.080
So let's understand some of the things that
are happening.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:32.580
First of all, when hair is grafted, in other
words whether it's FUE method or strip method,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:40.130
you're literally taking the whole plant with
its root and placing it in another place.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.600
When this happens, there's something called
shock loss that happens.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:56.390
Now shock loss can describe the impact of
the effect of swelling, trauma of actual surgery

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.830
resulting in shedding of the part of the hair.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:09.510
but the root of the hair or the dermal papillae
and the complex around it is intact.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.930
So therefore, after that shedding of the hair
and this can apply to both the grafts as well

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:25.370
as existing hair that is adjacent to the area
where you had the transplant done, that can

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.160
result in an area looking even more bare than
it was prior to the transplant and that naturally

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.370
makes people nervous.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:46.820
In our practice, one of our standard approaches
of helping minimize that transition phase

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.210
has been the use of hair regeneration technology
which we developed combining it with a material

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:02.070
called extracellular matrix derived from pig's
bladder and platelet-rich plasma.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:10.480
The idea is that with the advance regeneration
technology, it appears from our clinical experience,

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:18.699
that the hair grafts tend to heal a little
bit faster and the results starts to kick

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.250
in or starts growth a little bit sooner.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:33.060
In addition, it appears, not only we are protecting
the existing hairs from the shock loss or

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:41.720
telogen effluvium, but in addition, we are
also helping these thinning hairs become thicker.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.180
And that's the real big distinction when it
comes to hair transplant surgery.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.400
Hair transplant surgery is ultimately limited
by the donor area, in terms of the number

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:05.990
of hairs you can place, as well as the area
that is being treated in terms of how fast

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.009
is the existing hair going to thin out.

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:18.360
So when we look at somebody for a hair transplant,
clearly that is a dominant thought and what

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.050
we are able to do with hair regeneration is
address that thing very successful.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.490
But as far as your question is concerned,
I think it's very important that you speak

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.449
with your doctor or speak with your staff
at your doctor's office.

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.770
That is the most common concerns people have.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.009
In our practice, we see our patients very
frequently.

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:49.430
Understanding that even though full hair growth
will not occur to its fullest extend until

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:58.400
about a year, it's important that we see our
patients pretty every 3 months minimum and

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.159
the door is very much open for them to come
in within that time frame.

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:11.139
But we will also do microscopic examinations
and we will see how things are progressing

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:20.289
so that the patient understands that this
is a natural process and ultimately, the success

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:25.060
of the surgery will be determined after approximately
one year.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.949
So for now, I think it's fine that you are
using the minoxidil.

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:36.169
There are some evidences that a minoxidil
topical will help move things alone or help

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:44.349
synchronizing the hair growth cycles but understanding
that throughout the process, there are hairs

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:50.319
that shed and hairs that start to grow in
until you reach that equilibrium somewhere

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:52.639
at the 1 year point.

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:57.280
So I hope that was helpful, I wish you the
best of luck and thank you for your question.
