00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.350
Human interactions with the fragile
dune can enhance erosion processes.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.130
It is important that people look after
dunes as they are the home to endangered

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.469
shorebird species such as the New
Zealand Dotterel that lay their eggs there.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.590
For example this part of Muriwai is
a designated Road. 4-wheel drives and

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.990
dune buggies are daily driven on the
beach

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.629
making tyre tracks that can enhance
erosion.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.500
In many parts of the coast vehicles have done considerable damage.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.820
Horse riding is also a popular activity

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.430
that has the potential to erode the beach.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.390
Councils fence off walking tracks to
prevent people walking on the dunes.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.530
However erosion can happen on the tracks and be enhanced by wind funneling.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.400
Vegetation is essential for stabilizing
dunes.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.000
The vegetation traps the sand and holds it in place.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.400
If vegetation cover gets removed wind will remove the sand leaving a blowout.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.240
If natural vegetation cover is removed dunes can advance inland.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.800
Originally the coastal land at Muriwai was covered in native vegetation.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.740
But by the 1870s sheep and cattle grazing began, causing problems.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.440
Damage to vegetation by grazing animals caused the dunes to migrate inland,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.600
with some dunes being
reported to have reached as high as 90 meters,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.000
like these ones at Te Paki in Northland.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.886
In 1880, 46,000 hectares of land was covered by dunes.

00:01:52.886 --> 00:01:58.300
By 1909 this area had grown to 120,000 hectares.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.000
In 1903 Parliament (NZ) passed the Sand Drift Act.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.440
But little was done until the 1920s and 1930s when there
were attempts to stabilize the sand

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.480
through the planting of exotic marram
grass which is native to France.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.200
In 1932 the planting of pine seedlings began
creating Woodhill Forest.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.000
This was successful at turning the tide of the
encroachment by the sand.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.519
Since then attempts to save the frontal
dunes have involved the planting of native species.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.400
Today you can see many
plant species growing in the dunes at Muriwai.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.000
Ranging from native species such
as spinifex,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.300
Pingao grass,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.500
Bunny tail grass

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and the Karo tree,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.550
as well as exotics like ice plant.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.270
I hope watching this documentary has
enhanced your understanding of coastal

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.300
processes and its relevance to people.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.350
Thank you for watching.
