00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:22.649
The Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series has long
been a divisive entry in the famous franchise.

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:27.229
On the one hand, it’s the same roguelike
gameplay that’s been trod by Torneko, Shiren

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:29.659
the Wanderer, and any number of Chocobos in
the past.

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:34.920
On the other hand, it’s an opportunity to
explore a completely fantastic Pokémon world,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.859
untainted by human trainers trying to be the
very best like no one ever was.

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.350
These games take an entirely different viewpoint,
where Pokémon are left to their own motivations,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.940
as observed by a human transformed by mysterious
forces.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.680
AND SO, LET US JOIN THE ADVENTURES OF SMUGLEAF
AND BACON, ALREADY IN PROGRESS.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:02.070
Awright, so it’s the same old randomized
dungeons, but with Generation V Pokémon!

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.170
This time, though, you have a side-goal of
transforming this rocky, barren plot of land

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.240
into a haven for adventurous souls like yourself,
through the use of various items and a particularly

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.500
energetic band of contractors.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.969
The usual mission-based gameplay returns,
with treks through mysterious dungeons to

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:25.250
deliver items, rescue lost friends, and/or
bludgeon evildoers for justice and cash and

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.320
building materials.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.940
While you’re getting your SimCity on, though,
there’s deviousness afoot, as some strange

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.400
occurrences and stranger Pokémon have been
showing up near Post Town and your partner’s

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.490
just the kind of dope to go sticking his nose
into it.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.700
Unlike earlier games in the series, you get
to choose which Pokémon you control from

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:51.450
the outset, and can take a team of up to four
along for the ride.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.729
But the new shiny feature - the ability to
search for Magnagates in the real world - deserves

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:56.850
its moment in the sun.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.490
You can find dungeons all around you - pretty
much any circular object will do, like my

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.329
coffee here - which will become a dungeon,
based on its color and size.

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.390
These are separate from the main quest - so
you can play them if you get knocked out in

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.110
the actual campaign and you’re waiting for
a friend to streetpass you back to life - and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.450
any items you manage to obtain will transfer
over to your party’s deposit box upon completion

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.379
of the mission.

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.870
These one-offs are nice, especially since
you don’t actually have to deal with the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.209
glacially slow pacing of the story or the
non-adjustable text speed.

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.700
You’re getting a decent tale, don’t get
me wrong... but these hindrances, combined

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.450
with the fact that you can’t do multiple
missions in a single run as in earlier entries

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.090
in the series, prevent Gates to Infinity from
being all it could’ve been.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.541
Fortunately, with the abundance of Instagram
users documenting everything they eat, no

00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:48.310
one will look at you strangely when you make
Pokémon jump into your pancakes at Denny’s

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.310
and start exploring.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.450
Also: no crappy photo filters.
