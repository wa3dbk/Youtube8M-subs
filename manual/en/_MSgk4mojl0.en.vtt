00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.105
We had decided on the adoption route after having four failed pregnancies.

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:12.817
And after speaking with a specialist we found out that I 
 have an auto-immune problem where I cannot sustain a pregnancy.

00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:20.248
We do have some treatment options that we can explore, but at this point 
 in time we decided that we wanted to do the adoption route

00:00:20.248 --> 00:00:26.958
just to save ourselves a little heartache down 
 the road, and to start our family.

00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.796
My name is Sara, I live in Lodi, California.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:34.737
I'm nine months pregnant and my baby is going up for open adoption.

00:00:34.737 --> 00:00:38.174
I have a three year old son named Thomas. 

00:00:38.174 --> 00:00:44.164
I chose open adoption because I do not have 
 the means to take care of another child.

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:53.104
I chose Glen and Julie because they're in their forties, and they 
 tried to have children of their own and were unable to.

00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:57.980
And I feel that they should be able to be parents.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.273
Really when we just started investigating options to growing 
 our family, we weren't able to conceive.

00:01:04.273 --> 00:01:09.497
After our last failed IDF we looked into adoption pretty immediately.

00:01:09.497 --> 00:01:12.272
We knew that that was going to be a guarantee.

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:16.997
We knew we were going to have to wait, but we were going 
 to have a child, we would be able to start our family.

00:01:16.997 --> 00:01:24.915
I did a lot of research on the internet and found the agencies in 
 California that were licensed, and that kind of led us to IAC.

00:01:24.915 --> 00:01:28.236
I think they were down to earth, they made us feel comfortable.

00:01:28.236 --> 00:01:34.575
They made us feel more comfortable about what open adoption 
 is, and how its going to benefit the child.

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:42.660
 I looked at multiple agencies but when I came across Independent Adoption 
 Center I did decide that open adoption was best for me.

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:46.870
I think that people have to consider that this process is about the baby

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:51.080
its not about me and its not about anybody else.

00:01:51.078 --> 00:01:56.050
Its mainly the concern of how the baby is 
 going to feel when they grow up.

00:01:56.053 --> 00:02:05.220
The one thing I really wanted to get out of open adoption was just 
 for him to not feel like he wasn't wanted, because he was.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:08.430
Open adoption, for us, is the best way to go.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:15.700
Its the best thing for the child because 
 all of their questions can be answered.

00:02:15.697 --> 00:02:26.100
I believe that its the best thing for the healing process for 
 the birthparents, they know the family that's raising their child.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.190
They can feel better about it.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.970
I believe that open adoption is great for the adopting family

00:02:33.972 --> 00:02:41.960
because it allows us to have a special connection with 
 the person who gave birth to our child

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.350
which is so absolutely important.

00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:47.490
I have actually gotten to be pretty good friends with the adoptive family.

00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:50.970
 I think its kind of like having an extended family.

00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:56.590
It does feel like you're giving the adopting 
 parents a gift that they can have.

00:02:56.588 --> 00:03:02.230
You know, since a lot of times they're not able to 
 have their own children and they're ready to have children.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.850
I think the child will have a great 
 opportunity, he'll have a really good life

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:12.390
He'll have the family support, the chance to do things, experience horses

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:15.330
Being on a farm and all that good stuff.
