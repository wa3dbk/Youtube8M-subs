00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.009
You probably already know that there are not
seven colours in the rainbow. Isaac Newton

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.559
picked out seven colours because it was mystical,
it resonated with seven musical notes, and

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.269
the seven days that he believed God took to
create the earth.

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.150
You probably also already know that colours
are continuous. Unlike that projection artwork,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.870
there isn't one pure red, one pure orange.
In a real rainbow you see all the wavelengths

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.810
of light in between.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.289
But what you might not know is that a rainbow
doesn't fade out at red and at violet. The

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.920
EM wavelengths from the rainbow extend just
a little way into the invisible bits of the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.340
spectrum. Not far: water will absorb "proper"
infrared and ultraviolet. But you can see

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.989
on what's called an absorption spectrum that
liquid water will let through -- and therefore

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.470
refract into a rainbow -- wavelengths slightly
outside the ones we can see.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.780
If you take a photo of a rainbow with UV-sensitive
film, you will see another bright band below

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.890
violet. And there are people out there who
don't have lenses in their eyes. They can

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.489
still see, with strong glasses on, but the
UV filtering that the lens provides is gone.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.070
So they can see that extra band too. Over
there, in the National Gallery, are paintings

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.000
by Claude Monet, who late in life had a cataract
operation that removed the lens of his eye

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.270
-- and there's a strong argument that his
paintings after that were brighter and bluer,

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.970
the result of the near-UV light he could then
see.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.479
There's one more question, then: why does
water happen to let through just the light

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.650
we can see? If it was set up any differently,
water would be opaque to us, we might be blasted

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.299
by hard UV light all the time, and life would
be... well, very different. The answer, of

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.610
course, is that it isn't chance at all: over
hundreds of millions of years, our ancestors

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.500
evolved those abilities. Our physics means
that water happens to be transparent at some

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.549
wavelengths, so sensing those wavelengths
is an enormous advantage to life. The species

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.840
we came from were much more likely to survive
with the ability to see those wavelengths.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.159
Imagine if you couldn't see through rain.
So those who couldn't see those wavelengths,

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.360
well, they died more easily. Repeat for an
unimaginable number of generations, and here

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.120
we are: creating our own rainbows.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.040
