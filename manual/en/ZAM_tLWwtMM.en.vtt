00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.069
model carman russell gave a really
interesting ted talk about how she's

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.190
been extremely beautiful model and
because of that she often gets things

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.320
that she doesn't deserve okay so it's
really really difficult for a woman to

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.580
come forward and say that because
oftentimes people will criticize you for

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.000
that they'll say all you're just getting
all these great uh... opportunities in

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.730
life because you're beautiful but
there's not much more to it uh... and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.160
and she's completely honest about that
in fact let's watch a little snippet up

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.359
here to talk

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.750
i want to genetic lottery

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.750
and i and the recipient of a legacy

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.540
frick the past few centuries we have
defined beauty west tall slender figures

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.220
and femininity

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.440
and white skin and this is a legacy that
was built for me and it's a legacy that

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.470
i've been cashing out on

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.100
so she makes a ruling simply it you know

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.640
there are certain things that we get the
biologically respond to in terms of

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.790
purity so symmetry is one of them health

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.810
uh... and honestly being young right

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.730
slender has not missile had been part of
that equation abut over the last however

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.410
many years in modern times it has

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.159
become a part of the equation because of
societal expectations of saturn

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.810
shes like and genetically i happen to be
skinny

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.980
so i went a lottery even device in the
one

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.670
and i happen to be tall and paul was in
the silly

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.200
part of our d_n_a_ that were attracted
to twelve women but for whatever reason

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.510
in the modeling world

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.730
and it's mainly because they want to
close to hang offer them in you know

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.990
at that's

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.140
uh... she winds up already has made a
point com

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.930
race that i thought was really
interesting yes

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.750
she says look you know you have a tire
banks in the army and and all the stuff

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.319
in

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.419
although you know the white did to
succeed in modeling suspect them of the

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:48.910
problems

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.490
only four percent of them are minority
and not letting you know that that's

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.930
amazing unalloyed that's actually based
on to say that was done by then why u

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.909
p_h_d_

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.460
uh... this as didn't look at six hundred
seventy seven models that were hired

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.300
in the year two thousand seven and only
four percent of them outward not not

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.090
white

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.510
stunningly six percent white now

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.270
while cell obviously this astonishing
within the modeling community but also

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.680
really want to

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.079
giver props for it you know

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.669
in many something that's not be easy to
admit it's hard to do that and by the

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.639
way she's really intelligent she
graduated from columbia uh... any

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:29.340
graduates from colombia and any division
is really smart

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.510
uh... but if you listen to her whole
tent auctions extreme really articulate

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.499
very intelligent popping your you could
tell she's hard working but nobody

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.259
notices any of that because the first
thing that they notice

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:43.259
is the way that she looks and she says
it's unfair because you know she gets

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:47.809
her ted talk begets millions of hits but
you know colin powell said talked into

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:51.789
you as well and she's like why is it the
people are more interested to hear what

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:56.049
amato has to say as opposed to what
someone like colin powell has to say and

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.869
i think that that's very symbolic of
what our society is into oftentimes we

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:04.089
get heat for covering so-called
celebrity stories when we come in

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:07.829
celebrity stories because you guys and
loving you guys love to click on it you

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.430
leg as left a comment on it no decided
one day we can we try to put

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.499
are stamp on it meaning that we don't
cover like every other cigarette if

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:18.039
there was a slight reserves like it

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:24.769
did you see cardiac she's misled it
whereas in whatever we do correction we

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:25.890
try to have a point

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.140
rate we try to have

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.129
the reason why we're trying to make a
point about society culture et cetera

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.379
maybe we don't always succeed but let's
work going for but but you can

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.620
we fall prey to the correct article it
was really interesting

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.630
and she mentioned colin powell specific
because that is to give a speech the

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.410
same time and she got four times the
number of users that are now there are

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.359
other factors you see colin powell often
is a but you know what happened

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:50.280
by some of those

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.619
we got here on the show

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:54.109
when i was a great worry if you don't
ship

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.069
because you know and i think he's right
now is that they had so much is that i

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.979
think that

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.459
instinct was

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.379
it'll be an interesting guess this is
really smart and has a really

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.850
interesting point plus she's super hot
keep it real ight now right

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.760
yes please

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.419
into any such as the hotness to it said

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:15.789
he's

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.640
the category we wouldn't expect

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.969
you know ice expect of a

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:23.249
political conversation or interesting
cultural conversation from

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:26.449
someone from the nation or alternet or

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.469
political figure but since it's a model
since there for

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.990
right right yes it is leasing a quandary
two sec

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.050
do i accept all these offers

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.120
when it's kind of unfair that they're
asking me why they should be asking more

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.169
qualified people i don't think that
without a doubt she should accept the

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.009
offers and one huge misconception is
that

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.810
people were attracted get these great
opportunities right

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.150
but oftentimes when it's a real
substantive opportunity let's say like

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.229
co hosting a show for instance rain okay
you can get hired based on your lucks

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.639
but your intellect is what heating going
that's what keeps you on michelle you

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:06.539
can't be a moron in costa show emulate
cut too much better okay get man but you

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.639
know what i mean like oftentimes people
get those accusations if yours if you're

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.220
a cable to handle whatever the job that
is take it and your abilities will help

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.910
you pursue whatever that is uh... some
no not and i've always thought that have

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:20.610
been

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.199
in august kind of obvious that people
hired me for my looks

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:30.409
and so you know what i'm i think i ever
did over these years together doctor so
