00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.910
Century Arms has long been known as the leading
importer of surplus firearms all the world

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.910
over.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.920
And while Century Arms continues that legacy
of importing, they are flipping the script

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.650
by manufacturing and bringing in some brand
new firearms of their very own design.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.039
ìThis is the Century C39 Rifle, itís the
finest AK rifle made in all the world.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.810
The reason isÖitís made from hereÖto hereÖall
in the United States of America.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.759
Every cap, screw, turn, itís all assembled,
all made here.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.410
The other great thing about it is we are making
it milled, like the original AK when it was

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.410
designed.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.140
This receiver gives the rifle a lot of strength
and increases its accuracy.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.570
With bad ammo weíre still getting 2 MOA out
of this gun.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.420
Weíre really really excited to bring this
to marketplace because there is absolutely

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.579
nothing else like it and it has an MSRP of
$799.î ìThis is the Century Arms Fury 1.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.300
Itís a semi-automatic shotgun.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.170
We designed this shotgun and had it brought
in.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.539
Obviously it looks a lot like the AK47 and
some other shotguns on the market.

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.629
A couple of differences in this gunÖstarting
from the front.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.240
This gun comes with 3 removable screwout chokes
that you can remove with your thumb.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.310
It has an adjustable gas port from the factory.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.430
You can shoot high brassÖlow brassÖruns
well on everything.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.640
We have the site forged in to the actual trunnion,
that way you canít break or lose anything

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.479
ñ this is a heavy duty use gun.

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.880
There is a rail attached to the front of the
gas block for a lie or bipod, however you

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.880
want to use it.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.680
It does take a removable AK-style magazine,
rocks in, rocks out.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.240
Semi-automatic.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.300
This mag holds 5 rounds, we have 10 rounders
available.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.939
Built in rail on top for optics.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:46.020
GreatÖgreat shotgunÖî Leading the way in
surplus ñ and changing the game in new manufacturing.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.299
Itís not too hard to see just where Century
Arms is heading in the coming year.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.340
ìÖmore and more domestic manufacturing.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.719
Weíre sourcing products that still are unique
overseas for opening up our hunting line,

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.609
on top of opening up AKs in different calibers.

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:06.780
But we are expanding US production ñ we have
some fantastic new models coming out in 2014

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.790
ñ 3 to 4 unique models this year.î And just
like years past, we couldnít be more excited

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.450
to see what Century has in store!
