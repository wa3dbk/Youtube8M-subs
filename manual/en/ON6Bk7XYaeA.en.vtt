Music playing in the background.

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:08.069
Welcome back to Thailand!

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.240
We're back in Chiang Mai and the first thing
I'm showing you is my grimy filthy hands.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.599
My bike just broke down in the middle of the
road.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.779
We're planning on doing a food video at one
of our favorite vegetarian restaurants but

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.810
the first thing I'm showing you is my messed
up bike.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.350
Background music.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:38.870
For lunch today we biked all the way out to
a restaurant called 'Salad Concept' On the

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.449
way here Sam's bicycle kind of died, so we
had to leave it behind but we finally arrived

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.180
and we're going to show you what this place
is like.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.469
So the cool thing about this place is that
you can build your own salad or build your

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.840
own wrap and that's what we're going to be
doing today.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.910
All kinds of different ingredients you can
choose.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.690
Let's get a wrap with pumpkin.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.690
what else?

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.690
feta cheese.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.690
Where is the feta?

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.630
It's a premium topping.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.520
Music in the background.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.820
Alright, I've got my order picked out for
my wrap.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.390
Let's see what is on it.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.170
Croutons, pasta, carrots, tomatoes, bell peppers,
pumpkin, raisins, grilled bacon, avocado and

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.780
feta with Caesar dressing.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.011
How does that sound to you?

00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:34.670
So you get a whole bunch of free toppings
(I think five) and then you can add extra

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.040
toppings to that for a few more Baht.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.860
After that bike incident I'm splurging right
now.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.220
Background music.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.470
Well, it's berry berry good!

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.680
This is a berry shake.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.400
Hahahaha
I think I have shake envy.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.869
It looks better than the juice I got.

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.530
So this drink over here is guava, apple and
passion fruit and it is so refreshing and

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.880
tangy.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:18.860
MMMMM, oh, it's a little sour and crunchy
because of the seeds but it's still good.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.880
So I've been noticing a bit of a interesting
phenomenon in the last few months of travel.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.480
I often order things that Audrey doesn't seem
to want.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.919
I don't think I want that, I don't think that'll
be good and then as soon as it is brought

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.769
to the table Audrey has food envy and tries
to eat half of it.

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:36.769
I do.

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.930
So this time around I've ordered exactly the
same thing that you are getting.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.609
So I'll have my own.

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.940
Now does that look good or does that look
good.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.600
I think mine looks better.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.190
Check this out.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.910
It has avacodo, pumpkin, pasta, bacon, olives,
feta cheese.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.169
Let me take a big bite.

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:06.980
It's going to be good.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.980
Mmmmmm.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.980
Amazing!

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.980
So happy.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.410
It almost makes up for the bicycle incident.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.410
Dig in.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:24.790
Wow!

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.920
These are some of the best wraps I've ever
had anywhere.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.340
So for me there are two star ingredients in
this wrap.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.060
First of all, the pumpkin - it just makes
it nice and sweet and also this wrap has raisins

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.100
which is something I've never had in a wrap
or sandwich before but it seems to be quite

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.840
popular in Thailand, so let's take another
bite because I mean the first one was soooo

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.840
good.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.079
Oooh, it's falling apart - oh my.

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.823
Can you give me a little bit of that?

00:04:03.823 --> 00:04:04.823
No!

00:04:04.823 --> 00:04:12.260
So the two ingredients that really make this
wrap amazing for me are the Caesar salad and

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.419
the feta cheese.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:18.080
The Caesar salad actually has a little bit
of Dijon mustard and it gives it a real kick.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:24.160
And the feta, well what doesn't taste good
with feta?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.800
Background music.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.580
Well, you know us we're not really big on
dessert, so well I guess we're just going

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.180
to have to have them.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:45.570
Here is the peanut butter brownie cheesecake
and if that didn't look decadent enough take

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.570
a look at this one.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.020
This is apple strudel cheesecake.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.300
That looks amazing.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.510
Audrey doesn't like cheesecake so I'll be
having all of it.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.650
Oh, please.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.790
You wish!

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.180
So this is a pretty nice brownie.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.880
It's very dark, heavy, chocolaty and on top
it has a little bit of cheesecake and then

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:15.230
some chocolate mousse.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.310
So much chocolate.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.340
Each bite is chocalier than the next.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.220
Is it like a chocolate explosion in your mouth?

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:32.710
Okay, cheesecake strudel.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:39.170
Wow, I mean apple strudel on its own taste
good.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.500
Cheesecake on its own is really good.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.830
Putting them together - thats like a superpower
dessert.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.340
So, overall that meal was a bit of a splurge
for us.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.390
It came to just over 600 Baht, which is roughly
$20 USD.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.510
Oh my!

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.380
In SE Asia that is a real splurge.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.500
Ten dollars per person.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.520
Normally we'd would spend half, 1/3 or if
we were having a local Thai meal even a 1/4.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.560
But it was worth every Baht because it was
tasty.
