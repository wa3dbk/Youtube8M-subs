00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.010
{guitar music}

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.020
All of the students, and Mr. Parker, that were involved in the accident

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.050
will always be a part of our department. 
I know that they will always be remembered

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.100
and that their legacy really will be 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.160
carried on by both our past and our future students.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.960
Described as a gentle giant, Steven Bair loved horses, 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.980
and had a special relationship with his grandfather, who told him, 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.290
"If I leave this earth before you return, 
I'll saddle up the horses and be ready

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.790
to ride with you when we meet again."

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.210
A skilled marksman and an avid angler, Dusty Furhiman was a lifelong

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.470
learner, who wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty. His friends and family

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.590
rememer him as witty, friendly and generous. He would 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.530
give anyone the shirt off his back. 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.600
"Plow it to the end of the furrow" was 
Justin Gunnell's motto in life. Gentle, kind

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.660
courteous and thoughtful, Justin was always eager to work

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.720
whether it was with fertile soil, beef cattle, John Deere tractors

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.770
in the dairy or just playing with his dogs.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.790
Justin Huggins was an angel in the outfield, but church was first

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.840
and baseball was second, but it was a close tie.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.900
Justin had his feet on the ground and his heart in the land.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.940
Jonathan Jorgensen enjoyed football and wrestling, but his

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.940
dream was to become a rancher with his brothers. 
He had a special way with animals

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.980
he was always bringing home. All the kids knew Jonathan, he

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.040
would turn them upside down, rub their heads, and make 'em laugh.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.050
We looked forward to these young men
 going through the program, because

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.090
it's hard to find, ah, anymore it seems like, young men

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.140
with a great work ethic and want to do this sort of business. It's a tough

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.200
business to be in. And to have that many at once

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.270
leave, ah, it'll hurt us all.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.590
{music- "There's a special place where the river bends,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.370
just outside of Logan. There's a thousand memories

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.430
that take me there."}

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.460
{music - "And when I look up in the sky at night,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.500
and wonder if you'll be alright, I close my

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.240
eyes and say a little prayer."}

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.550
{music - "'Cause there's a hope and there's a love,

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.570
someone watching from above,

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.610
and heaven knows you're out there waiting,

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.620
smiling down on me. And through the earth,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.450
across the fields, you'll be with us still,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.670
a legacy we'll never take

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.240
for granted. Thank God for what you planted."}

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.740
With a love of life and a winning smile

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.790
Curt Madsen loved target shooting, but he didn't have the heart to hunt.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.820
He enjoyed history and fishing, John Wayne movies

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.450
and music. Kurt raised award winning hogs, but the biggest

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.860
prize of all, was the legacy he left for us.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.540
"We're not here to plant seeds, we're here to harvest" are words

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.910
Ryan McEntire lived by. Ryan was most at home outdoors

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.910
whether hunting or playing baseball, he was happy and helpful,

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.430
and filled the lives of those he knew with love. 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.960
A farm boy through and through, 
Bradley Wilcox often took machines apart

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.980
just to see how they worked. He loved anything outdoors

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
from motorcycles to rodeos, to helping his family on the farm.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.960
Brad's quick and hearty laugh cheered everyone around him.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.020
Known for his dedication to his students and 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.030
his family, Evan Parker was a leader, role model and friend.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.040
Never too busy to help someone in need, the benefits of his

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.300
service and influence will be felt for generations. 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:04.020
Grounded in the earth, he inspired young minds to reach for the sky.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.280
You know, he'd stay 'till 9 sometimes

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.280
and just fix tractors, it was good times.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.290
{music- "Growin' up he was curious, never 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.320
took himself that serious, yeah we loved to watch

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.330
him learn and see him grow."}

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.340
{music- "And he could fix up just about anything

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.050
from the tractor to that backyard swing, 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.730
yeah he was building more than he would know."}

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.430
A lot of questions that a lot of us have

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.490
that probably won't be anwered, uh, at this time

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.530
for us. But I'm sure that, uh,

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.580
there'll be a grand reunion and an opportunity for answers

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.530
to those questions.  

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.130
I don't have any concern or worry about where

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.470
these young men have went. I know that they all 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.800
had a very strong faith in God, and
 where they were going after this life."

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.840
They're grounded in their faith, they're grounded in
 family, they're grounded in hard work

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.860
and doing what you believe in, and

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.880
that really came through. 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.900
I think one of the most touching things for me, as

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.910
president during this whole process
 was when we had the opportunity

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.920
at each of the viewings, to present the families with something like a 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.480
diploma, a certificate of academic achievement.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.360
And many of the families said to us either at the time, or in letters

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.980
or emails that have come later, "My son has 
now graduated from Utah State University."

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.060
{guitar music}

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.140
I just know, I know that they're um...

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.220
that what they're doing now is uh, 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.290
probably more important than the

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.460
than anything they could have done here.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.400
The alumni recognized that those students had a 
love for machinery, and they came back to help

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.440
those students complete their projects
 and get these tractors put back together.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.450
{music - "When I'm broken down and tired, wishing for

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.480
something more to give, I can feel

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:20.040
a voice inside me saying, don't forget to live."} 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.500
A child is a reflection

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.510
of their upbringing and the their parents, and

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.040
you should be very proud of these

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.530
young men that were involved in there, because uh, 
they were outstanding.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.530
I hope that the, that the families can find that amount of faith

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.600
that uh, 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.930
that they can know that their boys 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.260
are being taken care of. 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.110
{music- "Thank God that there's a hope,

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.770
and there's a love, someone's watching from above.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.770
Heaven knows that you're right there waiting,

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.780
smiling down on me. And through the earth,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.460
across the fields, you'll be with us still.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.800
The legacy we'll never

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:20.150
take for granted. Thank God for what you planted."}

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.050
{music- "Well there's a special place

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.880
where the river bends, just outside 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.920
of Logan. There's a thousand memories

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.960
that take me there...."}

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.000
