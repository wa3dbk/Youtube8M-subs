Cucumber masks are incredible if you have
spent too much time in the sun and need to

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.440
really calm down your skin, or you just feel
like your skin has had a bad reaction to a

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.369
product, or you just feel like you had an
allergic reaction to something.

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.930
So very soothing mask.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.470
So, I'm going to start out with cucumber,
preferably peeled because it's easier to work

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.470
with.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.240
You'll only need half of a cucumber, and a
handful of fresh mint, which smells amazing.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.820
And it's very cooling for the skin.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.530
And aloe vera gel.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.399
I started out smushing my half of a cucumber
into my bowl.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:58.409
I just used a fork to mush it, but you can
also throw it in a blender if that's easier

00:00:58.409 --> 00:00:59.409
for you.

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:06.870
And then I chopped some of my mint, which
I'm going to sprinkle in now, into the bowl.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:21.800
Now I'm going to add my tablespoon of aloe
vera gel into the bowl here.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:31.490
So you can just quickly mix this together.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.790
Like I said before, the mint is really cooling,
so if you do have a sunburn and your skin

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.990
feels like it's burning, the mint is going
to be amazing.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.450
The cucumber actually has a lot of cooling
properties as well.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.470
As you know, there's lots of water in it.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.040
But it also has silica in it, which is great
for your elasticity, so if you feel like you've

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.620
really damaged your skin from being in the
sun too long, this is going to make you feel

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.660
like you're really healing.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:06.130
And of course, aloe vera gel, everybody knows
the aloe vera plant is very healing for the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.780
skin and very calming and soothing.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.670
So, we mix this all together.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.709
And this is going to be the consistency basically
of water on the skin.

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.099
It feels very cold to the touch.

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.879
And you're just going to put a very thin layer
of this on your skin, and I would leave it

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.510
on for, if you have a sunburn, leave it on
for 20 minutes to a half hour.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.819
Same with an allergic reaction to something.

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.129
You want to leave this on for as long as it
takes for your skin to really feel cooled

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.019
down again, because that's when you know you've
healed your skin enough.

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.810
Rinse it off with tepid water.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.739
Don't use warm water when you've had an allergic
reaction or a burn because that will just

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.769
bring it back up again.

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.500
And you should really feel like your skin
is less inflamed.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.569
It's less red.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.999
And you'll feel even more hydrated, which
will be really nice for recovering from any

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:03.999
of those things.

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:05.629
And that's it.

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.129
Enjoy it, because it smells great.
