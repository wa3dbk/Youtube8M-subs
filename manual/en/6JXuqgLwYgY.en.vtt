00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.509
Triple?

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.610
Truffle?

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.700
Shuffle?

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.800
Trouble.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:25.300
Let’s leave the Elizabethan wordplay out
of it for a moment and take a look at a Sonic

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.990
game, a bit closer to that heyday of Sonic
3, that managed to push the Game Gear to the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.400
breaking point.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.160
Put aside the fact that we actually saw this
game in the states a month before its Japanese

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.410
release, which was unheard-of in ‘94.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.820
Disregard the strange history of developer
Aspect Digital Entertainment, a company primarily

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.199
concerned with making Sonic games for the
8-bit systems (Master System and Game Gear)

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.339
well into the ‘90s, as well as porting Fatal
Fury to the Genesis a couple times, producing

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.869
various Disney and Coca-Cola-flavored licensed
games for the Game Gear, and creating a Wonderswan

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:01.719
version of Makai Toushi SaGa, AKA The Final
Fantasy Legend.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:02.719
Forget all that.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.219
Here’s the important part: This is a Sonic
game, on admittedly constrained and unwieldy

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:11.020
hardware, that manages to be exactly what
a Sonic game should be.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:22.060
Just fast enough, just complex enough, and
able to riff on the very mechanics that typified

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.060
the series.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.649
No 3D, no fighters, no racing, none of that.

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.330
This is just original Sonic the Hedgehog (or
Tails if you so choose) platforming, with

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.649
all the innovations up through Sonic 3 (and
this title’s direct predecessor, Sonic Chaos)

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:34.649
intact.

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:35.649
There are rocket shoes.

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.200
There are spring power-ups, where you’re
effectively just riding a huge bouncy platform.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.539
There’s huge levels, rivalling what the
Genesis had to offer, despite this being a

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:44.539
Game Gear title.

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.390
Hit a Chaos Emerald box, and if you’ve got
50 rings, a warp appears to take you to another

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.210
huge platforming section, where you can wrest
one of said gems away from series newcomer

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.740
NackFang the Sniperweasel.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.979
(Once Sega settles on a name, so will I.)

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.619
But best of all: There’s one button.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.109
One lonely button, because that’s all you
need for a Sonic game.

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.979
This is exactly the gameplay that made people
like the series in the first place, and what

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.140
would survive only in the fantastic Sonic
Advance series for the GBA.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.750
Case in point: The end of Sunset Park zone
2.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.319
You hit the sign, as you’ve done a bajillion
times before... but then you just keep running.

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.849
No score-tallying screen, no explanation;
the game just starts scrolling and you’ve

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.150
gotta keep up, and dodge pits, and knock down
weird spike-ball-carrying bat things.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.120
Then you catch up to the engine, realize you’re
at the front of the train, and that you’ve

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.280
already transitioned into Act 3: the boss
fight.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.180
That’s a well-designed transition.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.189
I’m completely willing to stomach some slightly
less-than-responsive controls for a game with

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.310
that kind of confidence.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.629
If you don’t feel like buying a Game Gear
and eleven thousand batteries, you’ve got

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.830
two options for playing Triple Trouble today:
Either on Sonic Gems Collection on the GameCube,

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.090
or on the 3DS Virtual Console.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.459
I’d lean toward the latter, as the GameCube
version might happen to have a problem with

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.079
this boss right here.

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.450
I remembered him as taking about a dozen hits
to enter raining-fiery-death-mode, but today

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.090
I spent the better part of five minutes just
mangling him and getting nowhere whatsoever.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.090
Still.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.230
If you must blow up Game Gear games onto your
big ol’ plasma telemabob, Sonic Triple Trouble

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.250
is among your best choices.
