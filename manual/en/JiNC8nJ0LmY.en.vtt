00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.880
video be doing at this make a blog right
here this one is perfect for back to

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.380
school and might be a little bit
overboard for some people but i just

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.200
think that it's really pretty and it's
something that I would wear if I knew

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.460
how do my makeup when I was in high
school and I really wanted to do that

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.170
because when I was in high school there
was no way that I was going to go and

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.170
spend $20 on eyeliner or you know a
certain amount of foundation anywhere

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.270
fun you should also not only did I use
drugstore products but I also used the

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.399
products in different ways just even get
more out of your makeup so say you only

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.940
have a couple of products on the show
you multiple uses for this video thumbs

00:00:50.940 --> 00:01:00.730
up if you do and let's go ahead and get
started

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.130
so I'm starting with the face this is
the magic Lumi face primary from L'Oreal

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.810
and it smelled really weird but this is
just a duster and was wiping it all over

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.470
my face and then blending it in with my
fingertips at the passages give you a

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.970
luminous to finish the skin and so far I
really liked it and I'm using a very

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.850
mattifying foundation and first I'm just
checking to make sure the color was

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.110
right because the last one I had with
super orange and this is the Loreal

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.770
infallible foundation and this color was
perfect it's the second latest one and

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.800
I'm just blending it and with my makeup
geek flat top kabuki brush this gives a

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.149
really full coverage and even using it
for my under eye area I didn't conceal

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.289
because I still have yet to find a
concealer that I really like from the

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.780
drugstore so instead of you showing you
guys something that I don't like I'm

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.050
just gonna use this as my computer
because it is a really full coverage

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.789
foundation and this worked really well
then I'm using this Maybelline fit me

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.340
think it's technically a foundation
stick an amusing at two contour you

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.179
don't have to take all these steps but i
just want to show you some of my

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.270
favorite so if your endocrine contouring
you can use this but if you're into

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.410
powder I'm gonna show you something
later and if you want to do all of them

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.380
you can totally do all them so I just
want to show you all these different

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.380
products that you could use that I would
recommend from the drugstore I'm using

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.920
this crown brush to blend this and and i
cant toward my cheekbones airlines all

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.849
in all that jazz now I'm using this
Rimmel Stay Matte powder and I'm just

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.640
fucking it in with this big fluffy brush
from Sigma I really like this because it

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.390
really did leave me Matt throughout the
day and I didn't get super oily or

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.560
anything like that

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.800
next time using this powder and I'm
actually using it for a broader it's

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.440
from the covergirl Queen collection and
it's in the clerk you want an iPad this

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.440
for a very long time and I'm using this
Real Techniques fresh to basically just

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.090
brands makes can give me a little bit of
color and a little bit of one right so

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.150
if you're into the whole contouring and
highlighting think this is something

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.920
that I would recommend this is from wet
and wild and amusing the latest color to

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.000
set my under eye area and kind of given
highlighted a fact and then I'm gonna

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.560
take the darker color and use it to
contour this is Anna colored Dolce Dale

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.960
H A I got from Walmart and I really do
like it at the great color selection

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.780
and they have I think to other color
options like this if that makes sense

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.420
now for bush I'm using this Milani rose
d'Oro / I have a luminous 0 from them

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.250
and I really like that one so I want to
go and get another one and so far so

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.410
good as just a really pretty rose color
and now for highlighting I'm using this

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.610
hard candy Tiki brother but it's
technically a highlighter and it's like

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.760
a light gold kind of color this is
pretty fun suffer the drugstore so is

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.430
the foundation there like 10 or $13 like
geez at that point you might as well

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.700
just get something from like Sephora but
when I was in high school

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.900
drugstore items weren't experts and
using this Maybelline quite I've had

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.820
this for all really long time before I
even started YouTube and I'm using the

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.030
lightest shade over me I area and even
under my brown brown brown bone to

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.720
highlight and then halfway through here
comes a puppy had to see him get him

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:12.080
some low key aides a Pomeranian and he's
a bug you ok and now into Makris and

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.630
using the thermal Annie I shadow and the
color Bella cappuccino it is a satin

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.570
match it's not completely matt has a
little bit of a sheen to it but that's

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.470
ok because you can't really tell that
much and it's really perfect for the

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.460
crease area it's a really great neutral
brown shade right now we're gonna go

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.830
back to that powder from cover girl and
a 35 brush from Sigma I'm going to put

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.570
this increase this is one of the ways
that you can get more out of your

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.250
products you can always view their
blushes your browser's your face powder

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.260
powders anywhere else on your face your
eyes anything so always keep that in

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.700
mind here I'm using the Tiki bronzer
highlighter for underneath my brow bone

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.930
so that technically for your eye area
but who cares I'm using it and that we

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.830
can get more than your products instead
of having to go out and buy like every

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.850
single individual thing for what it says
its poor ok so for my eyelids and using

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.370
this Loreal infallible eyeshadow with
the compressed pigment basically and

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.290
it's in the color amber rush this is so
pretty it's like a rose gold high-shine

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.700
kind of color and then blending it out
with whatever is left over i MiEV 35

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.300
brush

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.440
for my eyeliner and using this
Maybelline gel liner and it's in the car

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.139
at the plant it's like a deep purple
kind of color you can use whatever color

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.789
you want but I'm only focusing this on
the outer part and animal use the

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.120
darkest brown shade from that maybelline
quiet help lend it out and then go back

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.139
in with your fluffy brush brush and
planted out even more

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.409
this is just really going to elongated
make your eyes look bigger on the other

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.710
corner and expand a little bit of smokes
if you want a little bit of drama you

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.080
can even add a deeper color in the outer
corner whatever you feel I'm using the

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.789
L'Oreal voluminous mascara and carbon
black this is actually one of my

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.719
favorite mascara is not even just from
the drugstore just in general I've been

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:04.430
using this since I was a teenager and
then in my waterline and using the room

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.270
all eyeliner a thing called scandal eyes
or something like that but this is a

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.020
great new liner for the waterline and
yeah a friend once my eyes water and

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.099
then I'm taking that med brown shade
again from that maybelline quad and just

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:21.259
bluffing this underneath the last night
I'm moving on to the lips I'm using this

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.500
lip liner in the color East and this is
from rebel and then I'm topping it off

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.330
with this matte lipstick from Milani in
the color innocence and then to add a

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.310
little bit more color I used another
Milani matte lipstick and it's like a

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.430
pinky purple kind of color just to add a
little bit of color but to be honest and

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.750
we noticed much of a difference when I
was looking back at the footage so you

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.360
don't really need to up sticks and then
I don't have a lot of drugstore glasses

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.979
so this is the next beautiful of class
I'm just not a fan of how it taste

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.229

00:06:56.229 --> 00:07:01.219
