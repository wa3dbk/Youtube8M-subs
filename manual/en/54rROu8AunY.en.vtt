00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.270
Justin: Hey, guys.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.000
Here at the 2014 American Muscle Mustang Show.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.719
We're at the Bama booth here.

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:11.969
The Bama fleet's representin'.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.600
We got the Cobra, the 2014 GT500 and the Raptor.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.801
We got the dyno behind us.

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:19.480
We have three amazing Mustangs that are going
to be dynoing today.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.200
Now in fact I'm here with Calvin and his absolutely
stunning 2002 GT.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.420
Sir, how you doing today?

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.420
Calvin: Good.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.190
Justin: Tell us a little bit about the car
and of course this beautiful power plant.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.119
Calvin: It's a 2002 Mustang GT I bought brand
new.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.260
I did a lot of things to it over the years.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.710
Last year I decided to Coyote swap it.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.980
I put the VMP blower on it.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.800
Justin: What you guys can't see right now,
I know Blake is going to get some shots of

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.570
this, is just the amount of detail that Calvin
put into it.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.660
He shaved the entire bay, tucked all the wires.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.500
I mean, it doesn't get much cleaner than this,
guys.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.020
I can't wait to see this thing on the dyno.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.170
Let's let her rip.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:05.040
Justin: I'm with my buddy Paul here from Bama.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.040
Paul, good to see you man.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.040
Paul: What's going on, man.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.040
Good to see you.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.040
Justin: Quite a day so far, huh?

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.040
Paul: Yeah, it's incredible.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.040
The amount of people here, the vendors.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.040
It's amazing.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.100
Justin: It really is man, and I think a lot
of the focus has been around the Bama fleet

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.100
so far.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.389
You see we do have the Bama Terminator over
here.

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:20.939
Guys, if you haven't seen this yet you definitely
have to check this thing out.

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:21.939
It's going to be nuts.

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.670
Click the link below if you're watching this
on YouTube, or if you happen to be watching

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.959
this on Facebook just cruise on over to our
YouTube Channel, American Muscle Videos.

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:29.779
You will not be disappointed.

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:33.329
This thing's going to be nasty but we have
this beast lurking behind us as well.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.420
What's this thing all about?

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.570
Paul: That's one of our next project vehicles.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.079
It's gonna be sort of our street slayer.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.750
A little bit of elegance with some carbon
fiber accessories and a ton of power.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.920
Justin: That's what we like to hear.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.759
Now you guys have obviously gotten into the
GT500 tunes so this is right up your alley,

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:49.759
right?

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:50.759
Paul: It is.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.009
GT500 tunes, we've perfected them.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.049
We listened to what everybody had to say on
the forums.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.719
We listened to people here so we're really
excited about that.

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.971
Justin: And now with the 2015 just around
the corner I can assume Bama's going to have

00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:01.999
full support for that?

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:05.429
Paul: Yeah, we've already started working
on some of the 2015 stuff so you can expect

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.259
that we're gonna be right there when that
car is released.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.259
Justin: Nice.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.259
Ecoboost stuff, even?

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.259
Paul: Oh, yeah.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.259
I'm really excited about that.

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:12.259
Justin: You and me both, buddy.

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:13.690
And I notice you have a pretty snazzy tow
vehicle down there too, right?

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.970
Paul: You gotta have something to tow the
race car with so why not a Raptor?

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.970
Justin: Awesome, man.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.970
Awesome.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:19.970
Well, everything looks great Paul.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.180
You guys are doing a hell of a job over there,
man, and let's enjoy the day.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:40.470
Dave: Well that was Stephanie's Coyote E85,
a corn fed car.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:48.170
Just put down with a Paxton supercharger,
745 horsepower at the wheel.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:03:10.340
Dave: To the wheel, this 5.0 just put down
926.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.560
Ridiculous.
