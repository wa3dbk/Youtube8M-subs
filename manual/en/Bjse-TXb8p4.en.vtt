00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.729
now that we've completed with the
installation of these cabinets and all

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:11.219
of the doors and drawer fronts are now
reinstalled on these cabinets is level

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.110
and aligned it's now time to move on to
the top moulding that goes along the top

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.039
of all of our wall cabinets

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.060
the first thing that needs to take place
is on the left side of this wall cabinet

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.310
we need to remove the scribe

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.460
associated with our wall cabinet

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.939
the reason we need to do this is it was
ordered without minimal scribe on the

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.809
left hand side of that cabinet

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:31.910
you're gonna start with a chisel

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.210
hold the chisel level with the line
where you wanna mount the moulding on the

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.950
top of the wall cabinet

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.200
take the chisel put it on that line

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.490
and bump it softly either with the palm
of your hand or with the end of a soft

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.380
hammer

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.050
this is going to dent into the scribe on
the side of that cabinet and then you

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.230
will proceed to knotch out that cabinet
from the top of it removing that small

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.460
scribe that's associated with the left
hand side of that cabinet

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.469
once this is done you are then able to
mount moulding

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.779
across the side of that cabinet and not
have a gap between the face frame of

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:01.640
that cabinet

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.600
and the side of the cabinet

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.520
another trick of the trade is when doing
miter joints

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.570
you can go back with your touch up pen
that came with your touch a kit and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.180
color in the end of those miter joints
as you're putting them together with

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.860
this being done when those two miter
joints come together there is color on

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.560
those mitre joints so you're not able to
see into those joints as easily as if

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.930
you wouldn't have applied that touch up
into that inside joint

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.860
once you get that miter joint

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.140
touched up you can go back and put
the two joints together and continue to tack

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.220
that rail on down the line until you've
completed with the rail around your

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.370
kitchen

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.170
the last thing and the installation of
the kitchen is applying the toekick cover

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.390
and doing so cut it to the necessary
length you need to cover the

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.250
available toekcik in the kitchen and simply tack it in
place using your brad nailer as you

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.220
go along

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.250
the last thing in adding that finished
touch to your cabinets is to go back and

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.280
add the decorative hardware to both the
drawers and the doors

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.580
after the decorative hardware has been
installed make sure to go back and vacuum

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.970
out the cabinets for a nice clean
finished look appearance to the end

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.510
consumer last but not least place the
shells into the cabinet it's these small

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.180
details that will let the customer enjoy
their kitchen
