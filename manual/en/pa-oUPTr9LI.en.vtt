00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:13.072
Radio Raheem!

00:00:13.144 --> 00:00:14.577

What's happening?

00:00:15.847 --> 00:00:17.281

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.782
Where you headed to?

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:22.253

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:25.621
On the rebound.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:26.625
You bet.

00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:28.093
All right.

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:29.595
Oh, shit!

00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:31.632
Let me check it out.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.133
That's the hype!

00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:34.259
Newest latest.

00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:38.273
Let me tell you the story
of right hand&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;left hand.

00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:40.775
lt's a tale
of good and evil.

00:00:40.843 --> 00:00:41.935
Hate.

00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:45.948
lt was with this hand
that Cain iced his brother.

00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:47.609
Love.

00:00:47.686 --> 00:00:49.620
These five fingers,

00:00:49.688 --> 00:00:52.658
they go straight
to the soul of man.

00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:54.283
The right hand--

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.225
the hand of love.

00:00:57.363 --> 00:01:00.458
The story of life
is this...

00:01:02.035 --> 00:01:03.503
Static.

00:01:04.906 --> 00:01:07.807
One hand is always
fighting the other hand,

00:01:07.876 --> 00:01:10.743
and the left hand
is kicking much ass.

00:01:10.813 --> 00:01:15.251
l mean, it looks like the right hand--
love-- is finished.

00:01:15.318 --> 00:01:17.286
But hold on.
Stop the presses.

00:01:17.353 --> 00:01:19.254
The right hand's
coming back.

00:01:19.323 --> 00:01:22.759
He got the left hand
on the ropes now.

00:01:22.827 --> 00:01:24.261
That's right.
Yeah. Ooh!

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.264
lt's a devastating right,
and hate is hurt.

00:01:27.332 --> 00:01:28.766
Down! Ooh! Ooh!

00:01:28.835 --> 00:01:31.429
Left hand, hate,
K.O.'d by love.

00:01:33.674 --> 00:01:36.768
lf l love you,
l love you.

00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:40.105
But if l hate you...

00:01:41.683 --> 00:01:44.152
There it is--
love and hate.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.653
l love you, brother.

00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:46.949
Bet.

00:01:47.022 --> 00:01:49.150
Radio Raheem,

00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:50.625
Peace.
