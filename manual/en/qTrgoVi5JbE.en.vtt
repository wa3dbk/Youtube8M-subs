00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.510
Now I am here on Expert Village today to talk
to you about interchangeable lenses. So you've

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:18.240
got a digital or a single SLR camera. One
of the key advantages of having an SLR camera

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.340
is the fact that you can change the lenses.
Changing the lenses on your camera will give

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.159
you the ability to zoom or to shoot wide angle
or to shoot natural photography. I just happen

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:33.290
to have small sampling of interchangeable
lenses for my SLR system. The first one I

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.330
kind of want to show you about; this one is
really one of my favorite lenses. It's a 70

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:48.910
to 210 zoom Nicor Lens. It's a fairly slow
lens. It only stops down to F4 to a 4. I really

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.930
like this lens because it is pretty old. It
is razor sharp for SLR but it is like a pretty

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.550
kind of standard lens and it gives me everything
that I need when I am in the studio shooting

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.970
strobes. The second one I want to talk about
is also a zoom lens but the focal length on

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.479
this lens isn't as long. This is a 35 to 70
and this is probably a little bit more of

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.820
a flexible lens. It allows me to get a little
bit closer to my subject but to still be able

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.220
to shoot wide, kind of wide angle and to be
able to zoom and play a little bit. The third

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.649
lens that I want to talk to you about. This
is probably a little bit more of a specialty

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:30.299
lens. It is a 75 to 35 millimeter zoom and
I really kind of use this. It's right on the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.229
border line of being a fish eye but not really
a fish eye because there is a magnification

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.209
factor and a digital thing and it is 1.5 but
that is for another time in store. But it

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:42.649
pretty much gives me the ability to shoot
wide angle shots. If you ever see those shots

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.659
you could see way to the left and way to the
right and everything in the middle is pushed

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.469
really far back. They probably shot it with
a fish eye lens and that is pretty close to

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:58.399
what this one is but not really. Also I've
got what is probably a dinosaur in the modern

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.469
era of shooting. This is a fixed focal length
lens. This is a 50 millimeter lens. It doesn't

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.939
zoom and what I will do is I will kind of
open this aperture up. You will see if you

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.240
can actually see through there, maybe see
how that thing opens up. This is a fixed focal

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.520
length lens, 50 millimeter lens. Kind of decent
for macro, photography. The thing I like about

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.660
this lens is that it is super fast. It stops
down to a 1.4 which means I could shoot in

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.790
the dark with it with a long kind of exposure
speed. So the true beauty of getting into

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.220
an SLR is the fact that you can change lenses
to get different affects in cameras. Go out,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.540
copy a few lenses, get some glass, make sure
you keep it nice and clean and keep it in

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.720
your bag. I'm Joey Gunz. Check me out on line
