Hello, Mridu Parikh, your personal life organizer.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.040
And today I want to start by asking you a question.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.760
How does 5 o'clock feel for you every day? 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.860
If you're anything like me, this is a major stress time in the house;

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.611
dealing with the kids, the homework, my work stuff and trying to get dinner on the table. 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.480
And this is usually the time I start doing something pretty irrational, like praying to the menu God.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.700
Mridu: (praying)... Oh food God, please tell
me what to make dinner for tonight

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.520
and I pray to you that I actually have the ingredients in my pantry and fridge.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.260
Well that was before started implementing
some more efficient ways to make my meals run much smoother. 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.060
And I'm gonna share 3 really awesome tips with you today.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.460
STRATEGY#1: Menu Plan.
I cannot stress this one enough, it has changed my life. 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.420
What you need to do is plan out your
menu on Sunday and for the entire week what you're gonna have everyday.  

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.480
Then this will help you a lot with your grocery shopping time to spend a lot less time because you know exactly the ingredients you need, 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.840
plus you'll save money because you won't be buying things in abundance or in duplicity.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.540
I recommend spending 15 to 30 minutes every Sunday morning to plan out what your menu

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.460
will be for the week, and then to your grocery shopping like Sunday afternoon or Sunday evening so you're prepped entirely for the week.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.980
STRATEGY#2: Cook in abundance.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.140
When you're taking the time to chop up your onions and garlic and throw on a package of meat, 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.080
why not add on another onion or another garlic or another package of meat. In that
way you'll have enough for maybe left overs

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.820
later in the week or to freeze it. I love
to freeze my food for those chaotic nights

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.010
when just to know the time to cook, I can
pull something out of the freezer.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.560
It's a lot easier to just cook while you're
cooking, and a lot less daunting that having

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.340
to start over from scratch every single night.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.600
And STRATEGY#3: This strategy combined strategy #1 and #2. 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.500
Use the same ingredients so you can create left-overs for another night.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.880
So here's an example:

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.280
When you're menu planning, you can plan that one night you can have pasta with meatballs and another night you're making tacos.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.440
So you can use that same main ingredient, maybe the beef for the turkey, or gonna use the meatballs and the tacos and cook it all in one night.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.260
So on Monday night you would cook in abundance but you have the main ingredients already

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.720
prepared for your Wednesday or Thursday night meal.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.440
So here's this week's challenge:

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.300
I'm sure that you have at least one quick
and easy recipe and I'd love if you would share it in the comment box below.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.220
If enough of a share them will have enough
for a whole week of new recipes.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.260
If you don't want to share the whole thing, just send us the link to where we could find it.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.640
And of course if you know anyone else who could benefit from this tip, don't be shy to pass it along.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.660
And I'll see you next week with another awesome tip on how to take control of your life.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.460
BYE!
