Hi, this is Tom. This is for Expertvillage.com.
These are shortcuts to playing the electric

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.990
guitar for rock and roll. We talked about
in our last session a lead pattern. And I

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.321
just want to go over that slowly so you get
the feel of it. With this one pattern--a pattern

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:21.980
meaning where to put your fingers, it's almost
in a box arrangement, you'll be able to pretty

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.300
well improvise and play lead guitar, it'll
surprise yourself, your family, and any girlfriends

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:36.700
that you're trying to impress. If I am playing,
say in the key of G, the G chord is where

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:47.070
my bar finger is. So, there's a G bar. If
I was playing the key of A, there's an A bar.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.540
Wherever my index finger is, that's the chord
or that's the root of the song. So let's say

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:01.120
we're playing the key of A, there's my A.
If I have to play a lead over that, that also

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:09.110
tells me where to start my finger, which is
right there. And this pentatonic scale is

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:19.970
a finger there, and then you go up three frets,
then you move over to the next string, skip

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:28.530
a fret, same thing on the next string, same
thing on the next string, and then on the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:37.210
following string, you're skipping two frets,
and on the highest string you skip two frets.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.979
So, basically, everything starts on this fret,
and then you're either putting your finger

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:50.340
here or here. And if I look on this lowest
string, it's there and then the next three

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.979
in a row is there, and then the last two strings
I skip again so it's like the lowest string

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.549
here and here. And that is a pentatonic scale
pattern.
