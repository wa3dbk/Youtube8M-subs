00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:06.196
Oh, hello there! Would you like to be one of my little helpers?

00:00:06.456 --> 00:00:13.946
How well do you know the engines on Sodor? Let's play "Who's That Engine?"

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:19.374
If I give you some clues, can you tell me who this is?

00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:25.263
This engine has a tall, black funnel which is puffing steam.

00:00:25.562 --> 00:00:28.373
That means it's a steam engine.

00:00:28.373 --> 00:00:34.663
It has four small driving wheels and is painted green.

00:00:34.913 --> 00:00:41.815
This little engines starts its day very early. Its favourite job is to deliver the mail.

00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:43.585
Have you guessed yet?

00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:48.185
It has a very shiny brass whistle that sounds like this...

00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:50.224
[ENGINE WHISTLES]

00:00:50.224 --> 00:00:53.735
And its my number six engine on the railway.

00:00:54.014 --> 00:00:57.327
So, who's that engine?

00:00:58.727 --> 00:01:01.888
That's right! It's Percy!

00:01:01.888 --> 00:01:04.158
Well done!

00:01:04.358 --> 00:01:05.630
[PERCY WHISTLES]

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.710
I think you deserve one of my really useful certificates.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.090
I love the Christmas holidays. There are lots of exciting deliveries for the engines on my railway.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.273
One winter, Percy was helping Thomas with a special.

00:01:23.273 --> 00:01:29.702
They were taking me, dressed as Santa Claus, to switch on the Christmas lights in the Town Square.

00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:37.825
But snow on the tracks can be tricky as Percy discovered when Thomas accidentally covered him in snow.

00:01:37.825 --> 00:01:42.256
Percy was stranded, but Thomas soon had a great idea.

00:01:42.476 --> 00:01:51.508
He brought me and all the children to see Percy who pretended to be a very special snow engine and made all the children laugh.

00:01:51.508 --> 00:02:00.098
And that's why Percy is a really useful engine and you are a really useful little helper!

00:02:00.098 --> 00:02:00.789
