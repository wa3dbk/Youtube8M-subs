00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.900
This trek starts out with a hop from the town of Nepalgang

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.040
to reach the trailhead village of Jumla.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.400
Jumla is a market town.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.180
After breakfast I hit the trails.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.560
My first day was short.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.540
I spent the first night with a local family in a village called Patmoka

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.940
250 Rupees, for dinner, tea and a bed.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.400
I was up early the next day to follow a trail over a pass.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.020
Then followed trails that hugged the many narrow valleys.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.360
Money, money sure.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.180
Tomorrow I have to go up there

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.000
Late in the day I reached the tiny village of Chotha

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.540
That boasted of a hotel.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.340
Basically a bed in the attic storage room.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.660
The third day would be even longer.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.760
It started by exiting the subsistence farming valley

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.700
I crossed a pass

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.200
After lunch I headed I headed for the high ridgeline pass

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.860
that separated the two valleys.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.220
The drop from the pass wound through a confusing forest.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.700
At a small creek kids directed me to the next valley

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.640
I’m tired

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.200
By late afternoon I’d reached another dusty village.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.060
Mushrooms. You eat? Yes

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.160
Little gnats are driving me crazy.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.620
I crossed over a final plateau

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.860
Guarding the bridge

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.560
On the 3rd day as the sun approached the horizon, I reached Rara lake.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.520
Now that I’d reach my objective

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.000
it would take me another 4 days to escape.
