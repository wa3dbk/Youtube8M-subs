00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.530
Playstation has always been looking for its
own kart racing series to rival Mario Kart.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.940
They had it with Crash Team Racing and tried
coming back with ModNation Racers, which many

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.760
people thought played like Little Big Planet,
but as a racer instead of a platformer.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.150
So instead of a game that just feels like
that, why not actually make a Little Big Planet

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.280
racer, so they did, and the results are just
what you would expect.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.420
It is a super happy, super creative, and most
importantly unbelievably fun game.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:09.360
The 
game takes place in the world of Little Big

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.950
Planet, the place where all your ideas go
after they have left your head.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.090
It is a wildly creative world filled with
imagination.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.600
But the world is being invaded by The Hoard,
a group that just wants to collect things

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.860
but not actually create with what they collect.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.520
They just want to collect for the sake of
owning it all.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.710
Maybe a comment on fans of the series who
don't want create their own levels?

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.860
Maybe.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.380
The way you stop The Hoard is by racing against
them in kart races.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.020
The racing feels a lot like ModNation Racers,
which is pretty simple but also effective

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.090
and fun.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.329
But it also has a distinct Little Big Planet
feel, which is impressive by how different

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:59.000
the genre is.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.240
The races are pretty standard kart races,
with power-ups, long drifts and boost pads

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.570
on the tracks.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.800
The weapons are super fun and can be used
either offensively or defensively, which adds

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.299
a layer of strategy to the whole thing.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:19.280
But the weapons are also just cool.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:28.250
And the look of everything is that handcrafted
appearance that you would expect.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.700
The tracks have prize bubbles laid across
them that you can pick up, with can be used

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.530
to customize both your sackboy and your kart.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.560
The level of creativity is incredible, having
the ability to turn your kart into... whatever,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.360
even a hoverkart.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.000
And that is really one of the biggest parts
of all Little Big Planet games.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.310
You create your characters, create your own
tracks, and then publish them for the rest

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.860
of the world to enjoy.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.870
That means the game is ever growing.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.880
There are more modes than just races, including
weapon battles, treasures hunts and score

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.880
attacks.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.370
Plenty of diverse ways to enjoy the world.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.870
Little Big Planet Karting takes everything
that was good about ModNation Races, mixes

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.880
it with Little Big Planet and ends up with
not just a great karting game but a community

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:27.670
driven game about creativity and racing.
