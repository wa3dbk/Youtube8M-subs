Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.670
Today we’re going to show you how to change
the thrust spacer on your washer.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.080
It’s a really easy job.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.349
All we’re going to need is a 7/16ths socket,
extension, and a ratchet.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.539
We also should have some dual action agitator
grease as well.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.300
Let me show you how it’s done.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.019
The first step with this repair, as with any
major appliance, we should disconnect the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.199
power supply, just pull out the cord.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:35.410
We need to get the agitator out of the washer
to do this repair; most of these models will

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.700
have some kind of fabric softener cup on the
top of the agitator, just simply grab hold

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.050
of that and pull it off.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.900
Next we need to remove the inner cap &amp; seal;
it’s a clear plastic device located just

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.880
down inside the dual action agitator.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.949
Just reach down in there, hook your fingers
in it, and pop it out.

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.739
The seal may or may not come out with it.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:05.040
Next we’re going to take our ratchet with
the 7/16ths socket, locate the bolt in the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:19.700
center, grab the base of the agitator to keep
it from turning, completely loosen that bolt.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:38.340
Once we have the bolt completely loosened,
reach down pull the agitator from the base.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.990
Close our lid.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.850
With the bolt completely removed you should
be able to pull gently up on this top portion

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.880
of the agitator to separate it from the base;
if it doesn’t come off easily you can set

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.270
that on the floor and put your feet on it
to hold it down and pull up on the top.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:07.470
This exposes our thrust spacer, simply remove
this and discard.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.230
We should clean this portion of the agitator
just in case there’s any old soap scum on

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:20.450
there; we’ll clean that up and we’ll apply
the dual action agitator grease mainly around

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.950
the top portion here.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.069
Also note, that on the inside there’s a
couple of tabs here, those are for factory

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.360
use only so you can break those off as they
will get in the way when you go to reinstall

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.330
the top portion of the agitator.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.581
Take our new spacer and you’ll notice there’re
two slots on it, line those up with the two

00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:50.610
slots on the barrel of the agitator.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:59.349
Apply a liberal amount of the dual action
agitator grease to that bearing surface.

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.670
Then reinstall the top portion of the agitator.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:14.440
Now when reinstalling this what we should
do to make it easier is to take the agitator

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:23.000
bolt, put it in your socket, hold it upright,
and line it up from the inside.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.560
It just makes it easier when you go to put
the whole thing back together.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:44.180
Now the agitator is ready to install, center
it over the agitator shaft, seat firmly, tighten

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:58.480
up the 7/16ths bolt, the top portion of this
agitator should turn clock-wise, but not counter

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.480
clock-wise.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.150
Ok, everything is working good there.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:11.260
Now to put our cap back on we should clean
up the groove that the o-ring sits in, install

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.510
our new o-ring.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.150
It helps to put a little bit of dish detergent
on that before you slide it into the agitator

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.310
barrel, it’ll snap in a lot easier.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:29.280
Lower it down into place, press it in, make
sure the gasket stayed in place, put our fabric

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.410
softener dispenser back in, and our repair
is complete.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.620
That’s how easy it is to put a thrust spacer
on your washer; thanks for watching, and good

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.490
luck with your repair.
