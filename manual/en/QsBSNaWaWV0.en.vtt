00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.920
Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.910
The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 is Sony Ericsson's
first Android phone, featuring a very large

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.650
4" touchscreen display and an 8.1 megapixel
camera, plus WiFi, GPS and 3.5G support.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:34.010
Unlike the Motorola MILESTONE (and DROID),
the XPERIA X10 is running Android 1.6 instead

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.390
of Android 2.0.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.290
Sony Ericsson have enhanced the standard Android
offering with something they call the "UX

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.899
platform" which stands for "User Experience".

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.270
This adds some ghastly-named features called
"Timescape" and "Mediascape" to organise communications

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.970
and multimedia files in a seamless way.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.020
Sony Ericsson say that UX will evolve and
add new features as it goes along.. all very

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.680
well if Sony Ericsson stick to their word,
but owners of older Sony Ericsson smartphones

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.630
often complained of patchy support after purchase.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.630
The display is the most obvious feature of
the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.470
The large 4" panel displays 854 x 480 pixels
in 262,000 colours.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.060
This type of large display is ideal for web
browsing and video playback.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.190
Unlike other XPERIA smartphones, the X10 does
not come with a slide-out keyboard.. so everything

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.570
has to be done on the touchscreen.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.810
On the back is an 8.1 megapixel camera with
autofocus, dual LED flash and geo-tagging

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.350
support.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.110
One interesting feature is that the X10 can
be trained to recognise people from photographs,

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.660
and can associate them with contacts already
stored in the phone.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.300
The X10 can record video, but Sony Ericsson
have given no details of the handset's video

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.330
capture resolution and frame rates.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.890
GPS is included, and that will work either
with Google Maps or a trial version of the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.720
Wisepilot turn-by-turn navigation system.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.110
It's possible that a future upgrade to Android
2.0 might add free turn-by-turn capabilities

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.270
through Google Maps, but don't hold your breath.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.800
Android 1.6 (codenamed "Donut") comes with
pretty decent support for multimedia playback,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.810
web browsing and email (including support
for Microsoft Exchange).

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.030
There's a YouTube application and a whole
host of other Sony Ericsson and Google branded

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.610
apps to go with it.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.420
New applications can be downloaded from the
Android Market or Sony Ericsson's PlayNow

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.930
service.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.610
Inside the XPERIA X10 is 1 GHz Snapdragon
processor, making this one of the fastest

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.260
handsets of its class.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.950
Additionally, there is 1GB of internal memory
plus an 8GB microSD card in the standard sales

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.240
package.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:03.370
This is a 3.5G device available in a 800/850/1900/2100
MHz version for the US market and a 900/1700/2100

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.490
MHz configuration for the rest of the world.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:13.480
HSPA high-speed downloads and uploads are
supported, plus WiFi and quad-band GSM.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.890
The large screen on the XPERIA X10 means that
this is a fairly big device, measuring 119

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.470
x 63 x 13mm.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.470
However, the 135 gram weight is quite good
for a phone like this, helped in part by the

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.490
lack of a keyboard.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.100
Other features include a 3.5mm audio socket,
stereo Bluetooth and an accelerometer.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.010
In fact, the only significant feature that
we can see missing is an FM radio, although

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.090
the new MW600 Bluetooth stereo headset that
has been launched at the same time does add

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.140
a radio to the mix.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.610
Sony Ericsson say that the XPERIA X10 should
start to be available during Q1 2010 with

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.210
other markets following in the first half
of the year.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.319
Available colours are "Sensuous Black" and
"Luster White" which give the X10 a classy

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.319
appearance.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:09.080
We do not have any guidance on pricing at
present, but rivals are priced roughly around

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.430
â‚¬500 or so.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.269
The XPERIA X10 is a useful addition to Sony
Ericsson's range which has recently been a

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.769
bit short of smartphones.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.970
However, the company has a reputation for
being late to market with unreliable devices,

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.990
something that it must shake off if the X10
is to succeed.
