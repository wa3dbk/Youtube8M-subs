00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:31.505
Today we were able to take a dip
into Ford's cookie jar.

00:00:31.506 --> 00:00:35.132
They've got all kinds of cars in
their heritage centre.

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.577
From the Fiesta MK1 to the more intense cars.

00:00:38.612 --> 00:00:43.620
Today we're doing a combination of
the two supercars that Ford has build.

00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:50.566
The original Ford GT, nicknamed GT40
which isn't the original name.

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:53.374
The 40 represents the height,
which is 40 inches.

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:56.397
That's about a meter, which is quite low.

00:00:56.398 --> 00:00:59.956
This is also the problem with this car...

00:00:59.957 --> 00:01:02.168
... it's impossible for me to fit into this car.

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:08.274
I'm able to fold myself in and then the pedals are
at the same height as my knees.

00:01:08.275 --> 00:01:10.244
Because you do have some space available down there.

00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:16.879
I'm not able to drive it, but we were able to find
somebody who volunteered to take the car out for a spin.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.842
So I decided to drive the Ford GT.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.886
In the Ford GT from 2005,
I don't fit that good either...

00:01:32.887 --> 00:01:34.657
... because I need to sit a little bit slumped.

00:01:34.658 --> 00:01:36.714
So if you where thinking,
wow he's got a big belly....

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:41.301
... then you're right, but it's also because
I needed to tilt the seat a little bit...

00:01:41.302 --> 00:01:46.539
... so I'm sitting astride, I'm able to drive
but it isnâ€™t very spacious.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.897
You also need to look out
whilst getting in because...

00:01:48.898 --> 00:01:52.090
... especially whist getting in, getting out is a
little bit easier.

00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:55.675
When getting in, you need to close the door and
this is also part of the roof.

00:01:55.676 --> 00:02:00.409
This is because Ford GT originally
was designed to drive at Le Mans.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:09.113
A small compact car, but you'll need to get out
quickly to change drivers during Le Mans.

00:02:09.114 --> 00:02:13.176
Thats why part of the roof also opened.

00:02:19.568 --> 00:02:22.601
The comparison between the
two cars is quite funny.

00:02:22.602 --> 00:02:25.706
There's quite an age difference between the cars,

00:02:25.707 --> 00:02:29.028
... so you'll notice that technologically 
it's improved quite a bit...

00:02:29.063 --> 00:02:31.341
... but there are some quite some resemblances too.

00:02:31.342 --> 00:02:37.801
Same basic layout, both a V8,
RWD of course.

00:02:37.802 --> 00:02:41.401
But those are about all similarities.

00:02:41.402 --> 00:02:47.638
Because the original GT is only 2000 lbs,
and only had 335 bhp.

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:54.374
The new one is quite heavier due to
the safety equipment and increased space...

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:58.778
... the engine is much bigger and more powerful,
especially the latter.

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:08.725
Because combined with the supercharger it
has 550 bhp and a torque of almost 700 Nm.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:18.158
I noticed that I shifted at 5000-5500 rpm,
whilst for the maximum power you'll need 6500 rpm.

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:27.001
Because you're so impressed about the
acceleration and the sound of engine...

00:03:27.002 --> 00:03:32.646
... I just shifted because I thought,
do I need to go much faster?

00:03:32.647 --> 00:03:34.693
At the end you should of course.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.427
But it shows that it's a different category
than other fast cars.

00:03:54.966 --> 00:03:59.299
I did ride along in the GT40, which just fitted.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.377
This version is only one out of seven
made, MK III GT40.

00:04:04.412 --> 00:04:10.377
Because only seven where made to drive on
public road, it's quite a unique car.

00:04:10.378 --> 00:04:15.386
Then you'll notice that the modern car has
become quite a bit harder.

00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:19.659
The tires are flatter making it
more stable at high speeds.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.129
The old car moves around a little bit more.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.928
The new GT cuts corners very well.

00:04:28.929 --> 00:04:32.362
Still reasonably comfortable,
not a disappointment there.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:37.450
And as long as you know what you're doing
quite a friendly car to drive.

00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:42.710
Also when you'll get some wheel spin,
which happens quite easily.

00:04:49.672 --> 00:04:52.757
Then you feel the rear side
trying breaking out...

00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:56.527
... but it doesn't do anything crazy like
suddenly going to the left or right side.

00:04:56.528 --> 00:05:00.027
It has become a nicely balanced car.

00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:06.409
Then the "patented" advise from autoblog.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:13.391
If you're smaller than 1.75m and
got 1.5 million Euros laying around...

00:05:13.392 --> 00:05:17.635
... I would choose the Ford GT from 1969.

00:05:17.636 --> 00:05:22.834
And if you have some spare money, you
should buy the modern Ford GT as well.

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:27.064
All others should buy the modern version
and nothing can go wrong.

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.542
To the neighbours you'll tell that
you bought "just" a Ford...

00:05:29.543 --> 00:05:32.586
... and to the enthusiast
you'll tell which type.

00:05:47.585 --> 00:05:51.487
I can hear you think, which one is faster,
the old one or the new?

00:05:51.488 --> 00:05:53.998
This is something we tested.
