00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.699
In this video I'm going to show you how to make a magnesium oil and how to

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:07.049
apply it to raise your magnesium levels. but first what I want to talk about

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.179
is the function of magnesium because it is so important for your body

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.349
for so many reasons one of the main
things that does is

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.000
it directs the calcium where to go in your body so if you're just taking a calcium supplement

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.970
without an equivalent or better amount of
magnesium in it

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.080
you're going to want to stop that right way  because what happens is

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.480
when you're not taking it with magnesium it stays in your veins

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.910
which can become dangerously for you. It clogs your arteries, as well as makes problems

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.020
for your joints

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.280
and also it can help to calcify your
pineal gland

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.820
in doctor thompson's book, "The calcium lie," he explains that if you focus on calcium

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.399
alone

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.309
you will likley weaken your bones and
increase your risk of osteoporosis

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.219
when you take it with an equiviliant or  better amount of magnesium

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.770
that's 1:1 or 2:1 ratio with magnesium 2 and

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.800
the calcium ,1 what it does

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.260
it directs it out your veins and into your bones where you want it.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.869
so it's very important to have the ratio

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.130
actually just take magnesium by itself without taking any calcium

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.729
and it's a powerful anti-anxiety mineral
it's essential for your brain

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.340
and organ health and many other
functions which I'll also included the blog

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.060
now the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.759
magnesium also serves many other functions your body and it's important to know that 80%

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.180
of people actually have a magnesium
deficiency. And the reason that is, is because

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.479
is very easily lowered through stress, or drinking

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.250
alcohol, consuming sugar, caffeine,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.380
antibiotics, birth control pills, fluoride in the water and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.810
toothpaste, sweating excessively

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.700
and many medications. And the standard
American diet

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.600
is almost completely devoid

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.020
of magnesium. If you have this magnesium deficiency

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.060
you'll have many different problems such as muscle cramps

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.979
like a Charlie horse or something like that. Bad odor in your sweat

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.820
fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, migraine,

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.399
and you get your magnesium levels in check you'll be able to avoid

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.640
a lot of these issues. Now the best way that I know of

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.290
to absorb magnesium into your body is just by making a magnesium

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.900
oil, so you're going to take about 1/2 cup of magnesium bath

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.440
flakes and put it in a pot with an equivalent

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.310
amount of pure water. Then heat that until it simmers

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.420
a little, but basically what you want to do is

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.200
so that the water absorbs all of the bath flakes

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.000
Then put it in a cup or a spray bottle

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.630
then take a couple fingers and put it in there and wipe it around this

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.830
this part of your body. Your mid-section or your torso

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.450
the fatty areas, or underneath your arms here, and leave that on for

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.100
about 20 minutes to absorb. Now with
that you'll have a kind of dry

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.750
kind of salt on there almost

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.980
what you can do is just shower or wipe that off afterwards. You only need a little bit.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.380
and I usually do that once a day and what happens is your body absorbs it

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.109
right through your skin and it gets directly into your bloodstream it will really help to

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.160
increase your

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.209
magnesium levels, which is like I said so easily lowered from different

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.790
things like stress. I hope this works
well for you and you can find out all
