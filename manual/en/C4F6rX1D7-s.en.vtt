00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.950
To enhance your feminine figure, we're going
to keep it real simple. First of all you need

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.140
a space. You need to be somewhere where you're
comfortable where you can get a good workout

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.020
and where you have minimal interruptions.
Right now, I am at beautiful Topanga Canyon

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.000
Park, which is a great place to workout. If
you have a great park that's near you, workout

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.400
there, it's an excellent start. You're going
to need a mat. Now a Yoga mat will work or

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.469
an exercise mat will work, this is an exercise
mat so its a little thicker than a Yoga mat

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.690
and it provides more support for the lower
back for me when I'm outside in the park.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:45.379
So whatever type of mat you want and that's
comfortable for you, you're going to need

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:52.309
that. Also, we're going to need weights. Now
I have two different sizes of dumbbells, you

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.100
can use two different sizes for this workout
because you'll need a lighter size for things

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.589
that we do higher reps with and then a heavier
size for when we just want to have more of

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:07.060
a challenge and sometimes you may be stronger
in certain areas and you can handle more weights.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.780
I have a five pound and an eight pound weight
right here. So you can use anything just make

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.150
sure the increment is not too heavy and not
too different from your minimum and maximum

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:26.950
weights. Next, you're going to need water.
Water is so important, it's like a building

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:34.229
block to exercise. It's important to be hydrated
before you exercise and to hydrate before,

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.530
during and after any exercise program that
you have. Water is very essential so you want

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.960
to make sure you have that. Next you want
to be sure that you're dressed comfortably.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.810
Now you want to wear something that is nice
for your environment so I'm outside and it's

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.380
a warm day so I'm dressed in a way where I'm
not too hot and I'm not too cold, I'm pretty

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.030
comfortable right now. You want to make sure
your athletic shoes are nice and supportive

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.500
and comfortable for you so whichever shoes
you choose, just be sure that you're comfortable

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.700
in them and you can do different activities
without feeling any foot pain and then the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.720
most important thing that you want is a great
attitude. A great attitude goes a long way

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.940
and it will keep you and support you in your
exercise program. So with that positive, good

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.860
attitude, we'll start with how to enhance
the feminine figure.
