00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:06.740
recoil off my 1990 
polaris indy 500

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.739
first thing you need
 is a 10mm socket 
or wrench to take 
the nut off

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.517
next lift the top
 strait up and place 
to the side

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:55.522
now slowly lifting the
 recoil up turn it back
 and forth more clockwise.
 then it will pop free

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.759
next examine the spring
 make sure its not broken 
or bent

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:33.660
next unwind the old sting

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:55.248
the easist way is to cut the
string. or you can pull it 
strait. then remove

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:38.525
now feed the rope up through 
            the rope guide

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:42.762
now feed the rope through
 the hole into the recoil
              and knot

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.768
next pull the knot down into 
          the reoil tightly

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:38.241
then proceed to wind the 
coil clockwise untill theirs
about 1 foot of rope left

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:21.261
after placing recoil back 
on the mast turn counter
clockwise untill it drops 
            into place

00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:41.514
once back on do a test 
pull useing your hand to 
hold the recoil in place

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:59.532
do not loose the spring 
for the love of god

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:04.237
do not
loose the 
spring

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:19.753
bending the spring back
slightly you can then
place the catch into 
its place with the pring
 on the outside

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:53.190
flat spot on top to flat
spot on mast. check it
to make sure its not worn

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:36.996
after tightening the nut
pull the rope carfully to
make sure the rocoil still
functions. properly

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:45.705
now carefully pull the sting
all the way out to make sure
you are not going to over
pull your spring.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.221
let it back in easy to not
accedently have the rope
wind all the way in and
break the coil

00:07:08.228 --> 00:07:12.732
tie the bow so that when you
run the rope up through the
guides it wont accedently
let loose and wind back in
