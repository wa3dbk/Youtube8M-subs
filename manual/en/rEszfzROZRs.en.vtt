00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.900
Okay, let's have a little look here and see
if we've got anything.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.900
Click.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.360
Let the liquid go down.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.360
Need to give that sufficient time to activate.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.390
And see whether or not - it looks nice and
shiny - however, I always say, it's the hidden

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.730
dirt we are worried about.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.160
It's the cleaning for presentation that worries
me.We need to be cleaning for presentation

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.160
and hygiene.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.570
So if we take this now and pop it into our
little machine, which is ready.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.280
Pop it in there, close it, press OK and let's
see what we get.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.130
We would preferably like to see a reading
of less than 50, so as we approach 0, we'll

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:56.610
see whether or not the bath requires re-cleaning.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.710
Oh my gosh!

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.489
That's 3,578.

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:15.380
That is actually 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:02:31.530
totally unacceptable.
