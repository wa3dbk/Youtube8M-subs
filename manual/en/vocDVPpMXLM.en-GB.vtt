00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.760
In Watchdogs, everything is connected.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.099
ctOS brings everything into one network, keeping
the people of Chicago safe - under the watchful

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.830
eye of those with access.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.590
This power grants the ability to do many things:
for one, you can invade people's privacy with

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.140
the profiler,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.160
or wiretap a phone conversation.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.969
You could hack a security camera,

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.340
hack some shutters,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.410
or an electronic sign in order to display
a tired and unfunny meme,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.850
hack a drinks machine,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.120
steal cash from unsuspecting folk by hacking
an ATM,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.690
hack a kinect to watch someone work out,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.280
hack a car,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.860
hack a horsey ride,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.350
hack a horsey ride... FROM HELL!

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.030
Kick back, relax, and buy a coffee,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.320
buy a soft drink,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.350
buy a beer,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.340
or take your drinking to the next level by
playing a drinking game.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.280
Afterwards, you could hit the club,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.119
or visit the arcades -

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.289
play the slot machines and hope for a jackpot,

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.209
or keep things cerebral with a game of chess.

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:31.569
Wager some cash in a game of cups,

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:36.270
or clear the table with a hand of poker.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.289
See the city's impressive public art installations,

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.420
or sample some home-grown junkyard art instead.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.670
Hang out with hobos,

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.299
check in at your location,

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.249
and get someone to take your photo.

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:58.249
If you're in a playful mood, you could battle
space invaders in an augmented reality game;

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.389
or practice parkour while collecting coins
in a cross-city course.

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:08.959
Take a 'digital trip' and unleash your inner
fury,

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.450
or stealth takedown robots in an apocalyptic
future.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.120
Take a psychadelic trip through the city,
bouncing high on blooms,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.099
or pilot a spider tank and destroy the city.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.280
Visit a pawn shop,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.349
buy some new clothes,

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.680
buy some meds,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.870
buy a gun,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.739
order a vehicle to go,

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.129
or obtain illicit items on the black market.

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.360
Flagrantly flout a sign's rule,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.099
jump on a police car,

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.459
drive into the river.

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.500
Break up a strike,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.250
break up a yoga session.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.329
You wouldn't download a car,

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.170
but you might smash someone's phone if they
call the cops,

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.049
stick up a store,

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.680
then make your getaway by carjacking someone...

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.709
...then running them over.

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.390
Whether you take the scenic route,

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.349
or take a shortcut -

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.640
To get where you need to go, you could catch
the L,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.969
or catch the L... on a bike,

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:28.409
race the L,

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.040
what the 'el?

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.439
Steal a car,

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.469
steal a firetruck,

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.590
steal a boat,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.290
steal a limousine...

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.060
...and jump a bridge with it:

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.060
Steal an ice cream truck...

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.859
...and fight crime with it.

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:57.680
Use ctOS's crime prediction ability to take
the law into your own hands:

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.409
scan for possible crime,

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.280
stop a mugger,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.650
break up a fight,

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.219
chase a ne'er-do-well down on foot,

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:13.749
and put paid to an arsonist's plans... almost.

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:15.739
Chase a car,

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.019
hack the traffic lights,

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.090
smash a bus stop,

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.710
hack a steam pipe,

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.260
jump a bridge,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.140
or hack a barrier to bring things to a sudden
stop.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.010
Get chased by the police,

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.420
pop your tyres on spikes,

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.050
and ride on bare rims.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.810
Create a blackout to escape,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.220
jam communications to block any signal,

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.450
or hide in your car until the heat is off.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.690
Hack a forklift,

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.800
hack a gate,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.150
hack a conveyor belt,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.230
hack a transformer to make it explode,

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.970
hack a grenade for similar results:

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.100
hack the system;

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.380
hack the city.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.790
You could even hack a novelty fish.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.220
Take down an enemy with a well-placed headshot,

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.320
or just give 'em a shotgun surprise.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.360
Kill a hacker invading your space,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.290
and make an explosive comeback.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.770
Slow down time to secure a kill,

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.890
or simply cause mayhem,

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.160
and blow up a truck with an IED.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.000
shoot a police man in the knee

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.720
noob tube a helicopter...

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.370
...and explode a petrol station.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.930
You can watch traffic,

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.300
watch the news,

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.630
you can watch people idling by,

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.500
or instead you could watch them die:

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.210
and after all this, if you're still bored
-

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:06.210
why, you could even watch a dog.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.160
Thank you very much for watching.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.550
Until next time, farewell.
