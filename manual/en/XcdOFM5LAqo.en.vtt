hi I'm Todd from Sony and I'm here to show
you how to take still photos using the

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.269
burst mode feature on your Sony digital camera

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:14.889
for my demonstration

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.580
I'm using the DSC-TX10

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.269
which is a touchscreen model

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.070
and the DSC-WX10

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.539
which has a dial wheel

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.189
each camera is slightly different so be
sure to check the owner's manual or

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.050
visit us at esupport.Sony.com

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.940
for your specific features and menu options

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.300
some digital cameras have the ability to
take multiple images using a single

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.120
press of the shutter button

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.159
this burst capability

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.669
can be useful for getting several slightly
different shots of the same setting

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:52.800
allowing you to select which of those
images you like best

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.050
for example

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.440
a golf swing

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.770
both models have the capability to take
bursts of up to ten photos with a single

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.800
press and hold of the shutter button

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.620
here are the steps to activate the burst mode
for the touchscreen camera

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.570
press the menu button

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.950
then select burst settings

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.020
you will see three options

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.720
off high and low

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.080
setting burst mode to high will allow you to
press and hold the shutter button to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.080
take a burst of up to ten images in
as little as one second

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.440
setting burst mode to low

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.620
allows you to do the same but will take
the images at a slower rate

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.620
up to two images per second

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.939
here are the steps for the dial wheel camera

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.500
go to the intelligent auto setting

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.140
press the menu button

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.350
and use the control wheel to scroll to
burst setting interval

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.710
you will have the option to choose either
high or low

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.499
using the control wheel to make your choice

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:16.959
your camera will continue taking images
until you let go of the shutter button or

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.579
until it is taken ten consecutive images

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.459
