00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:07.330
I am wearing the Outdoor Research men's Helium
hybrid jacket, really slick piece, ideal for

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.770
highly aerobic pursuits of trail running,
perhaps cross country skiing, but anything

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.830
where you are going to be on the move.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.390
You need some weather protection, but you
also need a high level of breathability.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.880
So you have got dual fabrication going on
in this jacket, definitely a high level of

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.740
breathability as you would want, again, for
high aerobic activities.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.550
You have got that in the nylon rip stop body
of this jacket.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.730
But sometimes you need some weather protection,
too, so in those key areas, the shoulders,

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:47.440
the hood, you actually have a 30 D Pertex
shield fabric so it is waterproof, breathable

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.640
protection again in those key areas most exposed
to the elements.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.579
Definitely an athletic cut to this jacket,
which, again, makes a lot of sense when you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.690
think about what it is being used for.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.500
Not going to get a lot of other layers beneath
this, only the most low profile based layers,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.500
certainly over a t-shirt.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.020
It leaves a lot of room to put layers over
top of it, so it is an interesting mid layer.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.160
Again, I think of this more as a really light
weight outer wear piece.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.940
It does have elasticity at the cuffs, which
is nice, keep those sleeves from rolling up.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.060
Also keeps it wear you want it to be.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.880
A single point of adjustability on the hem
so a single pull cinch that jacket in and

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.920
get that much better of a fit because of it.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.460
Definitely some adjustability on the hood
as well.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.600
More of a stream lined fit than you are seeing
on some jackets, more alpine style jackets

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.000
that are more accepting of a hood.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.030
This is a better fit for your actual head
in keeping with that streamlined athletic

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.200
fit throughout the jacket.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.670
So you can see the Helium hybrid jacket stuffed
into that chest pocket, really slim, compact

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.729
design.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.390
Weighs next to nothing.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.370
Definitely throw this inside a pack, you have
back pack, a day pack, a running pack, have

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.700
it when you need it.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.000
The Outdoor Research men's Helium hybrid jacket,
personally really looking forward to running

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.170
in this piece.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.560
I think it is just that perfect combination
of breathability and just enough weather protection.
