00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.060
Derek&gt;&gt; It's cold!  - I wanna be back in Florida!

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.980
Britney&gt;&gt; Yeah!  Go down to Florida again!

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.460
Derek&gt;&gt; But we're really focused here in the water.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.260
But we are also a really tight team.

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:25.215
So we spend a lot of time together in and out of the pool.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.500
Spiotti&gt;&gt; As the intersession plan started to roll
out, we started to look at what

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.320
the impact is going to be - positive and
negative.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.860
And, you know, there are
are some negatives in it. 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.820
The negative to it is

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.120
assuming the burden of the cost for feeding
our teams and housing our teams.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.470
There was some trepidation about
that because

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.530
there's upwards of two hundred
student-athletes on campus.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.230
To train them, prepare them, feed them...

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.040
make sure that they're getting proper
rest and supervision...

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.760
during that period of time.  We actually have
capitalized on it.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.250
So there are a number of things that
they do together

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.400
that are training... and things that

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.620
coaches love to do but they don't - at a
place like RIT that is so academically

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.750
driven, students are so busy,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.230
they don't have a chance to do those
things.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.020
Markus&gt;&gt; Feels nice having practice and then no class
after - so you have more time

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.580
to rest.  And you don't really have any homework or classwork to worry about.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.620
Reed&gt;&gt; They spend a lot of time together off
the court.  Today were doing a

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.979
community service project over at school
35 in the city.  It has kind of been an

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.270
ongoing thing. And then,

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.500
if we're not having dinner at my house they're
having dinner at each other's house,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.640
and just trying to stay as close as possible. So,
I think it translates onto the court.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.000
[shoes squeaking on floor]

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.030
Jessica&gt;&gt; It's great!  It's fun. We have a lot of time off.  We go into the gym.
It's really cold... but

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.230
we work with it.  It doesn't really affect us that much because we are in the gym.

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.130
Or, as Freshmen, we live in the hotel.  So  it's awesome. We meet new people.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.320
We meet all the other teams that are on campus, that don't have other friends here. 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.140
Reed&gt;&gt; I think it's great. I'm in the past we've started school
right at the beginning of January so

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.420
most of our other competitors were not
in session, so they had opportunities to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.590
come in and maybe work on their game a
little bit more...

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.860
have two practices a day... have team bonding.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.020
Whereas we were in school, we were going to class... and then we
have midterms when everybody else is

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.560
kinda relaxing.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.040
So, I think it's been
beneficial for us in terms of like

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.910
us being able to work on our game a little bit more.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.180
