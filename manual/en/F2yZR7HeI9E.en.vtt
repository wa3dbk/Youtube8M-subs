It's Old School inspiration

00:00:55.652 --> 00:00:57.317
It's Old School inspiration

00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:06.567
Foiled like by the judge's decision

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.564
Cocaine summer, in the sun too, we sledge

00:01:09.564 --> 00:01:11.668
Flood of flame for the most odious

00:01:11.668 --> 00:01:15.472
I have the Ice age, of the cold blood behind the icy weft

00:01:15.472 --> 00:01:18.918
Bad boy dealing drug to a change of air but

00:01:18.918 --> 00:01:22.534
The waves strike the cliffes like in FinistÃ¨re

00:01:22.534 --> 00:01:25.420
Original Gangster, we fully fuck the ministry

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.683
And fuck the wallets and the rappers end up shuting up

00:01:28.683 --> 00:01:31.781
They don't want us to undertake, they take us for shits

00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:34.650
I invest in a CD bringing out on my owm label

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.792
Xplosif, descendant of the waste land

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:39.420
We do all in the things we keep

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.956
Always at the waste reception centre

00:01:40.956 --> 00:01:42.528
The luck doesn't everything

00:01:42.528 --> 00:01:44.124
All is built step-by-step

00:01:44.124 --> 00:01:47.103
Look Barack Obama and think to Rosa Parks

00:01:47.103 --> 00:01:50.496
You want the revenge, start to dig 2 graves

00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:53.544
In our ghetto, it's an eye for an eye, everything goes on crap in 2 seconds

00:01:57.846 --> 00:01:59.669
It's Old School inspiration

00:02:10.354 --> 00:02:12.200
It's Old School inspiration

00:02:21.824 --> 00:02:25.033
For cash, we sleep late and wake up early

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:27.091
My way looks like the Carlito's

00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:31.979
That comes from the poor districts, games of soccer between the car frameworks

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.418
The street hates, Carglass-sponsored

00:02:34.418 --> 00:02:37.441
If the failure follow me, I speed up

00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:40.449
I switch on my headlights full on a night infant

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:43.638
It's Vampires against Lycans with Vodka-Redbull

00:02:43.638 --> 00:02:45.793
I write my rage on paper

00:02:45.793 --> 00:02:48.933
We don't measure the water dept with our 2 foot

00:02:48.933 --> 00:02:52.471
Always in the crossfire, 1000 flames, millions of grams

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:56.411
On the sales in naira or in dirham

00:02:56.411 --> 00:02:59.129
Dub motivation for an Old School inspiration

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.739
You don't always have to believe the TV

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.564
Culture has no borders, I sing until Detroit

00:03:05.564 --> 00:03:08.442
Here, it's Derek Martin featuring the 9.3

00:03:12.723 --> 00:03:14.580
It's Old School inspiration
