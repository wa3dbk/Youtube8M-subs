Rating websites with WOT is simple, fast and
fun.

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.660
Once you have installed the WOT add-on, you're
all set to start rating websites and leaving

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.940
helpful reviews for other users.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.150
To rate a website click on the donut-shaped
icon next to the URL. This will bring up the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.750
WOT rating window from where you can rate
the site for trustworthiness and child safety.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.900
Select the color that best represents your
experience of the website for each category.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.270
A green rating means that you believe the
site is trustworthy, reliable and overall

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.960
you 've had a good experience. A red rating
means that you want to warn other users to

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.680
stay away from the site because it poses severe
issues or threats. A yellow rating indicates

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.370
that you have found some issues you'd like
other people to be aware of when visiting

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.829
the site.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.820
Once you have given your rating, you are asked
to select a category to explain the reason

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.280
behind the rating. First choose the type of
reason like positive, questionable or negative

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.280
from the left column and then choose at least
one category that supports your rating.

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.270
You can choose to see the full list of categories
by ticking the "Show Full List" box under

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.799
the categories.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.030
You can now either save your ratings or leave
a written review to help other users decide

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.280
whether they can trust a site or not. You
can do this by clicking the "Add a comment"

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.229
button under the categories.

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.850
Keep your comments straight to the point,
clear and informative, but don't go over the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.709
top by writing too much.

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:42.759
After you have written your comment press"save".

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.439
You can change your ratings or comments by
moving the indicator across the rating bar

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:53.439
or by clicking the "change option". Alternatively,
you can click the "x" icon next to the rating

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.979
bars and cancel your previous ratings. Along
with the ratings you can also edit your comments

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.979
by choosing the "Edit the comment" option.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.940
You can also rate through the scorecard. The
process of rating and commenting in the scorecard

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.200
is similar to the process followed in the
rating window.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.040
