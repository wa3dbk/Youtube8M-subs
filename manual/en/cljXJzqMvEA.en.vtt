00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.840
-Hey, everyone.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.750
I'm Mindy from Cute
Girls Hairstyles,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.280
and today we're going to
film the awesome Hunger Games

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.930
braid worn by Katniss.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.270
Now everyone's been emailing me.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.070
The movie's not even out
get for a couple of months,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.310
but everyone wants to
know what this is already.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.980
So I've done a bunch
of research, looked

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.771
at all the trailers
that are currently out,

00:00:23.771 --> 00:00:26.290
and all the pictures,
and this is what it is.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.370
It's basically a Dutch braid,
but it's going to start on this

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.830
corner of your head
and go to this corner--

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.390
so if you imagine
like a diagonal line .

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.987
So we're going to start.

00:00:35.987 --> 00:00:38.320
And just so you know, I'm
wearing a few of my extensions

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.900
today, just to give
my hair some length

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.380
so that I can get a nice
braid over the shoulder.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.890
But you can in fact do
this hair with shorter.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.210
You just have to finish
it a little different.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.300
So I'm going to start by
picking up a section of hair,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.255
just above my ear.

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:56.630
I'm going to leave my bangs
out, because in the movie

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.250
she has bangs.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.700
And I'm going to begin
an outie French braid.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.310
Dutch braid, outie French braid,
whatever you want to call it.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.180
Reverse French
braid, and we're just

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.830
going to start adding
in hair like you

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.395
would on a very
regular French braid.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.460
And remember, we're
going to imagine

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.945
working in a diagonal line.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.010
And braid it all the way around.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.790
Just pick up hair as you go.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.220
Now we're adding hair
in, on both sides.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.120
This is a very
traditional French braid.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.570
And I have, I do have a
better tutorial on how

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.330
to do a reverse French
braid, if you're not

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.660
familiar with this hairstyle.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.420
You can check that
video out, and I

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.440
will link it from this video.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.520
So we're just going to
continue taking up hair.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.220
Make sure we get
it smoothed down.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.250
Now remember, in the
movie she's playing

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.950
in the Arena for her
life, so the hair

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.360
isn't supposed to
be too perfect.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.770
It's supposed to
look a little messy,

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.526
like she's been running
around, and jumping over trees,

00:02:35.526 --> 00:02:38.640
and things like that.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.622
When you get to
this side, I'm first

00:02:47.622 --> 00:02:53.510
going to take it and
add in the last chunk.

00:02:57.366 --> 00:03:00.032
Then I'm going to switch
my handholds, just so

00:03:00.032 --> 00:03:02.500
that I'm on the right
side of my head, which

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.970
makes it easier to braid.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.360
Now you can see hair, where
my hair ends, my real hair.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.420
You see this little pop-outs.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.100
So if I were doing
this on my real hair,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.641
my braid would end
there, which would

00:03:13.641 --> 00:03:17.410
be kind of short, which is why
I've added a few extensions.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.040
But you could in fact do
that, and leave it short.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.580
And I actually
probably will later

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.920
post a video on how to do this
same hairstyle on medium length

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.360
hair, and you just
finish it different.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.675
OK, and then you're done,
secure it with a rubber band.

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:44.025
And I'm going to go
and just tug and pull,

00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:50.810
so that it looks loose
and kind of a little more.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:59.320
Now I'm just going to go and
pull, too, here and here, so

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.640
that It looks like she's
been running around.

00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:09.220
And there you go.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.990
And then she just kind of
leaves her bangs messy.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.720
On one picture I saw,
they were a little softer,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.990
and on another video I saw they
looked like they had wet them

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.450
down, and kind of
scrunched them.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.774
So either way you'd finish
your bangs off is totally fine.

00:04:22.774 --> 00:04:23.690
But this is the braid.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:31.580
It's just a wraparound, outie
French braid by Katniss.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.140
So tell me in a comment below
which one you like better,

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.970
if you're in team
Peeta, or Team Gale.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.350
I haven't quite decided yet.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.200
I think I'll wait and
see the movie first,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.220
before I make a final decision.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.410
But I hope you love
the Katniss braid,

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.970
and I will see you guys later.
