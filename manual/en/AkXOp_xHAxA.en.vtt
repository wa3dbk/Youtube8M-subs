00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.959
Alright, first question: This is AAPC and
AHIMA certification.

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:11.910
We have had this one before, actually we got
this question two or three times this week

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:37.120
alone so I thought maybe we had better revisit
it again.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.690
So here is one of the sample questions:

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.670
“Hi, I have an associate’s degree for
coding and billing but haven’t worked for

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.969
the past two years and am looking to get certified.

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.670
My question is this: What is the best certification
to get, which one is preferred by companies,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.629
CPC or CTA?”

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:03.290
Let me take you to the answer: Basically,
what I jotted down here is hospitals tend

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.000
to prefer the AHIMA credentials, the CPS,
the RHIT and if you don’t know what those

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.660
are you can go to AHIMA.org I think it is
and check them out but the junior coding credential

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.660
is the CPA which is what this questioner was
asking about.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.830
Physician’s offices, tend to prefer the
AAPC credential but mainly I find physician’s

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.060
offices - they just want to know that you
are certified.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:27.500
So if you have a CPC or the CPST which is
the Credential compared to AAPC, they are

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.830
normally satisfied with that.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.030
The other thing you want to consider as far
as which one is preferred is look in your

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.189
local classified.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.920
What are the want ads asking for?

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.430
Do you see more of one than the other?

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:54.310
Location: If you are in a big city like Philadelphia,
New York City, there are a lot of hospitals,

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.781
so there might be more jobs in the hospital
setting versus in a rural area like me, there

00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:03.420
isn’t, there are only two main hospitals.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.689
So you are probably going to have a better
chance landing job as a new coder in a physician’s

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:11.730
office.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.480
And of course, what do you like?

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.349
Can you picture yourself working in a large
hospital type environment like a little more

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.840
kinda rank and file almost like military grades
and things like that.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.620
There may be a smaller intimate physician
office setting.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.659
You can probably tell by my answer which I
prefer so I do have to preface this with - I

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:39.939
am bias, I am a physician out-patient girl,
I have worked in hospitals as an occupational

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:48.340
therapist but not doing coding. it’s a whole
different world and my comfort zone is a physician-based

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.340
world.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.689
So take my advice with that in mind that I
am a little bit bias and I do tend to steer

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:00.290
prospective students toward the physician-based
world because I feel it is easier to break

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.089
into than in the hospital.

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:13.269
I also had on the slide AHIMA vs. AAPC comparison
grid that I did when I covered this question

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:21.799
before, let me see if I can enlarge this a
little bit….So, what I have here is different

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.389
variables and then the AAPC column and the
AHIMA column.

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.579
The first variable is the physician based
exam.

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.189
What is the credential for their physician
based exam?

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:38.709
So, for the AAPC it is the CPC, certified
professional coder exam.

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.719
For AHIMA, it is certified coding specialist
physician based credential.

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:50.930
If you are looking for outpatient hospital
based exams, for the AAPC, that is going to

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:59.469
be your CPCH and for AHIMA, the outpatient
aspect is part of their CCS exam.

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:05.400
For inpatient hospital base, the AAPC doesn’t
have a credential for inpatient.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:13.069
They leave that to the AHIMA folk and this
is the lead credential AHIMA for coding is

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:19.810
CCS and this is your inpatient and outpatient
it’s a comprehensive exam, very difficult

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.000
in my opinion compared to the others.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.970
I think it’s the most difficult.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.349
I did want to emphasize that the CPCH - because
“H” means hospital, throws a lot of people

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:38.520
off, it only means outpatient hospital so
be aware of that because I took my CPC first

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.050
and then I took my CCSP And then I took a
CPCH and I really put off taking the CPCH,

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.960
I was like, “awww I have to do all that
inpatient type coding and studying for it

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.860
then when I took the exam I was like, “wow!

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.120
This is a lot like the CPC exam”.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.290
So the difference between the two, you still
need to know all the CPT coding, surgery coding

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:06.509
and all of that, are covered in both exams
but you do have outpatient reimbursement stuff

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.820
being asked of you in the CPCH.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:36.060
Entry level credentials, the AAPC has the
CPCA for apprentice and AHIMA has the CCA.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.740
Cost of the exam: AAPC charges $300 and you
must be a member.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.889
AHIMA charges $299 for members, $399 for non-members
so pretty much they are the same.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.540
What is different is that the number of exam
attempts per fee.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.050
AAPC lets you have two whereas AHIMA you only
get one shot.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.120
So if you don’t pass the first time, you
have to pay another $300 to take it again.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.849
AAPC gives you two tries which is a good thing
because a lot of people need you two tries

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:13.199
and if that is your case, its ok.

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.870
Format: The AAPC is all multiple choice.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:24.460
it’s 150 multiple choice questions whereas
AHIMA has 88 multiple choice questions, 18

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.499
are un-scored.

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:34.790
If you look at their candidate handbook, they
tell you that they actually put in some kind

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.969
of throw-a-way questions that aren’t even
going to get graded, just so you know that

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:46.389
and then 8 multiple select, two of which are
employed and 13 fill-in-the-blank.

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:49.020
Majority of it is multiple choice.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.419
And that’s why I teach technique about process
of elimination and multiple choice draw out

00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:01.169
two of the four answers because of them have
a lot of multiple choice questions.

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:10.810
The AAPC exam is proctored normally through
local AAPC chapters so you have to go in-person

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.100
where AHIMA uses a testing center.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:22.900
Length: AAPC exam is 5 hours and 40 minutes
and AHIMA is 4 hours.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:29.230
Books allowed: Approved coding manuals only
for the AAPC, AHIMA allows you to add a medical

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.060
dictionary as well..

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:50.069
So hopefully that will help you as a little
comparison to AAPC vs. AHIMA credentials.
