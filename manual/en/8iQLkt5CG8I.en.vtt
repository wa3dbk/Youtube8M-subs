[Office noises, phones ringing]

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:13.355
What is social media?

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.469
Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, LinkedIn, Yammer

00:00:16.324 --> 00:00:18.324
But that's not all

00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:21.528
Social media covers many other digital tools

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.600
[Logos of various social media tools]

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.440
Even email and SMS are social media tools

00:00:33.205 --> 00:00:35.205
We spend around 20 hours each month online

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:38.502
Victorians are some of Australia's biggest users of the internet

00:00:39.753 --> 00:00:41.753
accounting for 25% of the national online population

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:44.771
Email use is decreasing

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:46.443
social media rising

00:00:46.626 --> 00:00:48.626
Four in five use social networking

00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:50.576
accounting for 20% of our time online

00:00:52.013 --> 00:00:55.013
This means that almost all employees use social media

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.920
We need to know how to use these tools safely

00:01:04.644 --> 00:01:08.644
The lines between our professional and personal lives are blurring

00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:10.661
We are taking our work home with us

00:01:11.123 --> 00:01:13.123
and bringing our personal lives to work...

00:01:13.027 --> 00:01:15.027
So to help...

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.439
There is a social media policy to protect you and the department

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:26.708
it is every employee's responsibility to read and understand the policy

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:28.587
So what can we and can't we do?

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.166
Let's take a look at the 10 most important points...

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.560
Just like the telephone, using social media at work takes a commonsense approach.

00:01:37.176 --> 00:01:41.180
Personal use should not be excessive and interfere with your work

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.720
When posting, remember your comments are public for all the world to see

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.560
Treat online comments the same way you would 
 at a meeting, BBQ or public forum

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.280
This means, donâ€™t discuss confidential or classified material

00:01:56.564 --> 00:02:00.560
Highly protected, protected, Cabinet-in-confidence, commercial-in-confidence, legal advice, staff-in-confidence

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.040
respect Copyright

00:02:04.738 --> 00:02:06.740
respect privacy

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
be polite

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.680
Employees are expected to treat their peers with respect 
 both in the physical workplace and online

00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:28.570
The Anti Bullying and Worplace Conflict Policy still applies

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.300
if it's clear who you work for

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.600
be clear your views are your own

00:02:44.095 --> 00:02:46.100
Avoid perception of deception

00:02:55.287 --> 00:02:58.290
Be clear and transparent

00:02:58.724 --> 00:03:00.720
Using government logos or insignia

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.070
may imply you are authorised to speak on behalf of the department.

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:07.020
You're probably not.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.320
On your social media networks, you only represent yourself

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.890
You need special training

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:15.420
and prior approval

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.280
to post, tweet, blog, comment for the department

00:03:20.202 --> 00:03:22.200
But official or not

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.600
inappropriate remarks could damage the department's, or a colleagues, or your reputation.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.840
Would you want your manager seeing this?

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.560

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.040
What happens in Vegas stays on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Yammer...

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Always think twice

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.960
In short...

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.720
Protect privacy

00:03:45.373 --> 00:03:47.370
Respect the policy

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.720
and remember your public servant responsibilities

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
and let people know if things go wrong

00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:57.690
so get started today at www.justice.vic.gov.au/socialmedia

00:03:57.494 --> 00:03:59.490
and get to know social media at work

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.280
