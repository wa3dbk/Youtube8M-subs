00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:06.359
 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.549
 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:16.549
 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.120
We were headed for the edge of sanity...

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.059
like we were apparitions...phantoms

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.050
 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.170
trust gave way to doubt...

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.710
 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.970
hope to superstition...

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.500
 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.180
The tragedy of the Essex is the story of men...

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.080
and a demon.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.050
wow, Chris Hemsworth sure is busy
these days!

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.340
yes it seems even ol' Marvel doesn't
have any faith in a Thor 3

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.069
nor do I think they should, Hollywood is
still willing to take a

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.180
a gamble with mister Hemsworth who
certainly does look

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.190
every inch the movie star - even if he has yet to really deliver movie star

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.319
box office. I think is biggest non-Marvel hit to date

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.610
his ONLY non-Marvel hit to date, is Snow White and the
Huntsman but I think Charlize Theron had

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.200
a lot to do with the success there

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.010
that film but also whole fairy tale I
live action fairy tale trent played into

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.370
that

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.970
heavily on this this reminds me a lot of
russia now I love russians are my three

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:46.910
favorite films

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.040
last year and this of course is Chris
Hemsworth redeeming

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.730
with Ron Howard directed that movie and
rush was really I think such incredible

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.630
achievement just

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.780
not only is it on itself but in terms of
ron howard's career

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.560
really was at the top of his game as I
said when I reputed that he was

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.380
%uh you know I'm he was directing is it
for the first time as if he was an indie

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.049
director was something to prove not

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.070
one of the most well-known names in
hollywood I which

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.049
course Ron Howard is pretty is run into
some trouble his career he almost is

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.540
a new director trying to prove himself I
think he proved himself quite well

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.700
rush but the box office and the awards
circuit

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.970
as I something different to say about
that obviously it wasn't much a

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.519
contender there don't see

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.320
this from being much a contender I think
marge is a great release date for it

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.500
because I think it's gonna have a hard
time that both

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.579
I would audiences and you know the
industry terms as the word sec

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.140
I also surprised that he would redeem
Daniel Bruhl

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.250
I love Daniel Bruhl so much in that film
%uh rush

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.750
I thought he was the break at Town team
swirling bait that film

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.940
I you know rev its engines and he just
has really got nothing yet which is so

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.769
disappointing

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.769
it I guess that if the state really
called cool off is our reputation in

00:03:58.769 --> 00:03:59.400
Hollywood

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.480
which unfortunately came around the same
time is rush but I really feel it and

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.810
will ship got more out

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.030
fell a bigger sums it seems to be the
only one doing

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.080
I sideline victory lap now disaster this
film itself it looks

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.740
looks beautiful that reminds me a lot of
Master and Commander which I'm still not

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.640
over I know somebody like to say oh
that's a great fell

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.260
she of course poem is subjective and i'm
glad you enjoyed Master and Commander

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.800
but you know what couldn't even clear
100 million in the United States only

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.390
made a little over 200 million worldwide
and a $250 million dollar budget so

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.260
it no cocaine or close to making its
money back huge money loser actually

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.610
and of course again not recognized even
critically

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.430
I'm certainly not during awards season
certainly not really any way it's

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.670
so you have to wonder what's the point
in making a movie like this

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.310
I if it's not going to have any 1c and
no one's gonna recognizes birds

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.480
for its achievements I do think it looks
like a beautiful will be

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.010
and I became what we're interested in it
with that kinda actually montage into

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.980
the trailer I was like oh that's cool

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.490
whatever I've never seen whaling before
it's kind of interesting and

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.500
other way the wheels coming into the
water that's pretty scary

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.370
but they know makes me think that the
%uh this is a true story but yeah

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.810
there's a similar true story with the
sun read please call the indianapolis

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.020
other I know that a lot of people in
hollywood trying to make robert downey

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.350
junior's even circling

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.040
that project trying to get it I made
although i think is pretty busy these

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.169
days to school here

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.030
realize nobody wants to see him outside
the Iron Man said after the judge's box

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.530
office

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.700
but I'm thinking if you want to make a
movie about it but you guys stranded in

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.740
the water curing with the harsh elements

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.710
that's your movie The Indianapolis a
very famous story of course we counted

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.210
in just the first Joss are famously on a
boat

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.560
up but then you also i watch this movie
I'm like you

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.440
while you just make Moby Dick Moby Dick
there's all its Gregory Peck version for

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.430
a long time ago certainly not can
capabilities we have dangers filmmaking

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.000
and I think the very least people will
be like you know what I should see Moby

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.020
Dick I should be familiar with the story
and I sure as heck don't wanna read a

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.390
book

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.090
I've read the books require reading I
believe in most educational systems

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.380
I it's obviously classic but I think
it's a very rich classic that could

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.070
really benefit from a good adaptation
and I think that seeing based on what

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.070
I'm saying here

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.080
%uh this might be a team that could do
it so I just

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.970
fired producer and ron howard said to me
hey I'd like to middle ground hard to

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:17.510
resist

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.880
this is Brian Grazer so I guess a fire
the studio and he said I want to make

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.500
this movie about whaling

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.260
I'd be like

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.730
just go make Moby Dick you know I mean I
think that I

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.070
again to quote skull becoming quite
quickly becoming one of my favorite

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.810
quotes from inside Llewyn Davis cuz

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.430
just so on the nose and we're F murray
Abraham says

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.360
I just don't see a lot of money here and
that's my biggest cheap problem with

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.280
this trailer even though it looks
beautiful I just come to understand

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.330
Ron Howard is still acting yes all the
town tallest getting a

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.750
all the skill set although resources he
could possibly what obviously based on

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.520
the way this looks

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.140
but I just don't think he's using them
properly and it's a shame to see such

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.930
wonderful

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.760
elements here that are really expressed
a kingdom the whole

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.720
I think not used to their best text to
the best their capabilities

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.320
I to reach the widest audience and to
make the biggest impression

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.280
but we'll see we'll see a change to what
you guys think do you think this is

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:10.850
another

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.720
Master and Commander sis Master and
Commander two only to please a few

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.920
die-hard fans

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.430
are you think this has some shot and
being successful

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.560
are or do you think I you know Ron
Howard is just making another mistake

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.970
after rush what should have been a
mistake but I think largely

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.940
kind was in state considering how little
traction really got for anybody involved

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.580
in the picture

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.110
