[music]

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:02.459
Hello

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:03.459
I'm Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:04.459
[pause]

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:07.400
And welcome to DermTV.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.120
In honor of May being Skin Cancer Awareness
month,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.570
I’m going to give you a few tips and reminders
for easy

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.869
and effective sun protection.

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.810
But note that I didn’t say anything about
sun avoidance.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.710
I never tell my patients not to go in the
sun.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.710
I

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.009
nstead, I tell them how to protect themselves
while they’re in it.

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.470
And this is SO important because unprotected
sun exposure

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.149
is the ONLY way you can get premature skin
aging,

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.809
whether it’s lines, wrinkles, brown spots,
broken capillaries,

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.129
or even skin cancer.

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.940
The first and most important rule of effective
sun protection

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.550
is that you need to wear sunscreen all day
and every day,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.550
rain or shine, winter or summer.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.800
You see, even on a rainy or overcast day,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.999
30% of the damaging UV rays comes through
the clouds.

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:57.499
And the other reason you need it all day,
every day,

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:00.420
is because, if you will, imagine that there’s
a little meter

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.800
in your skin that records every second and
every minute

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.720
of sun exposure… and it’s always running.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.770
UV damage adds up.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.040
5 ten minutes walks to work

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.399
without sunscreen is the same as 50 unprotected
minutes at the beach.

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.710
Second, the sunscreen needs to have an SPF
between 15 and 30,

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.360
which tells you that you’re getting between

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.740
88 and 95% protection from the burning UVB
rays.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.119
It also needs to be labeled either “with
UVA protection” or

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.430
“with broad-spectrum protection”, which
means

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.829
it’s protecting you against UVA rays that
contribute to

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.240
skin cancer and premature skin aging.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.719
For example,

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.450
these Garnier, Eucerin and Neutragena sunscreens
–

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.909
going from SPF 15 to 30 – all fit these
criteria.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.070
Third you need to reapply your sunscreen every
two-to-three hours,

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.719
and immediately after sweating or swimming.

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.820
And last, make sure you put enough on:

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.759
if you’re using regular, traditional carbon-based
sunscreens,

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.049
it takes about an ounce to cover your entire
body.

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.540
And if you’re using chem-free sunscreens
with zinc or titanium,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.720
you need less… probably a third as much.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.520
Now in the spirit of reminding you to use
sunscreen everyday,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.940
I want to try something new.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.530
Head over to my DermTV Facebook page -

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.000
which you can find at Facebook.com Slash DermTV
-

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.660
and share a tip on the wall explaining how
you

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.420
take care of your skin during the summer.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.360
Then on Friday, we’ll randomly select contributors

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.860
from each day and award prizes, which have
been

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.640

Lands End Beach Package,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.640
a $50 Gift Certificate to Sunglass Hut,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.220
and some Eucerin products.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:54.550
