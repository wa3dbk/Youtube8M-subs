We're gonna do a couple of things today,

00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:34.640
we're gonna do something special that we

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.267
haven't done before.

00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:38.234
Alright, so what we're doing out here, we're gonna

00:00:38.234 --> 00:00:40.254

MUSIC

00:01:13.257 --> 00:01:14.984
Today we are going to be talking about etiquette.

00:01:14.984 --> 00:01:18.358
And I know you are all just leaning forward in the

00:01:18.358 --> 00:01:19.922
front of your seats saying "yes, I've been waiting for

00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:21.809
this all semester!"

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:23.588
Just to start, when will you need etiquette?

00:01:23.588 --> 00:01:26.490
CRICKETS CHIRP

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.137
Every single day you'll be needing to know how to

00:01:30.137 --> 00:01:33.100
handle situations.

as congressman, and I want to introduce

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.150
Dr. Tom Osborn.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.759
APPLAUSE

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:04.059
A world view really has to do with how you see and

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:06.637
interpret the world... what is your purpose in life...

00:02:06.637 --> 00:02:10.375
what makes things tick.

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:14.904
I really loved his parallels with athletics to academics.

00:02:14.904 --> 00:02:19.219
I loved hearing about all his stories, really inspirational.

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:23.055

00:02:23.055 --> 00:02:24.700

he's a motivational speaker for BSAD 101,

00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:28.492
business leadership development.

00:02:28.492 --> 00:02:30.253
How are you? Going good, how you doing?

00:02:30.253 --> 00:02:33.057
I want you to find two people you don't know,

00:02:33.057 --> 00:02:36.402
two people you don't know, whoa, whoa, whoa...

00:02:36.402 --> 00:02:38.387
she's like "oh my gosh, OMG, I cannot wait."

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:43.254
You must want to meet my man back there...

00:02:43.254 --> 00:02:47.007
two people you don't know, I want you to ask them

00:02:47.007 --> 00:02:49.286
one question: What's your name, where you from.

00:02:49.286 --> 00:02:50.605
Actually that's two questions: what's your name,

00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:51.822
where you from?

00:02:51.822 --> 00:02:53.468
I'm from China

00:02:53.468 --> 00:02:55.123
I'm from Iowa

00:02:55.123 --> 00:02:56.805
Bloomfield, Nebraska

00:02:56.805 --> 00:02:58.809
I came from Millard South in central Omaha

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:01.193
We're from Omaha, Nebraska.

00:03:01.193 --> 00:03:05.108
It helps them meet each other as one group as a class,

00:03:05.108 --> 00:03:07.937
and they also learn about the various and ten academic

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:10.401
disciplines that we have here in the College of Business

00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:12.724
so they all have an opportunity to see what's available

00:03:12.724 --> 00:03:13.775
for them.

00:03:13.775 --> 00:03:15.403
Get to know as many people as you possibly can,

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:17.574
I can not stress that enough.

00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:21.089
I feel like I fit in more than I did in my high school.

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:25.441
MUSIC

00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:27.451
I'm gonna share some handshakes with you.

00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:29.657
And then you get to go meet somebody in the circle.

00:03:29.657 --> 00:03:33.999
I'm Tyler... I'm Fritz... Nice to meet you...

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.269
Trying to lay the foundation for these guys to know

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.800
a lot of people by the end of their collegiate career.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.957
Because that's one of the big things in CBA, right, yeah.

00:03:46.957 --> 00:03:49.286
I'm from out of state, so it's kind of hard for me to

00:03:49.286 --> 00:03:50.409
get to know people.

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.115
It was a really great way for me to experience

00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:53.433
new cultures.

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:55.642
Hi I'm Clark, I'm from Arizona.

00:03:55.642 --> 00:03:58.009
Are you from Germany, that's so cool.

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.637
It's a new way to meet new people.

00:04:01.637 --> 00:04:03.799
I think it's gonna be a good year.

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.686
I'm really excited to be on this campus and I've just

00:04:05.686 --> 00:04:09.060
had a good experience so far being here.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.669
Get to meet people; we're all doing something that's

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.059
new to us; we're all in this new environment;

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:14.032
I thought it was fantastic.

00:04:14.032 --> 00:04:16.008
Look at that connection...
