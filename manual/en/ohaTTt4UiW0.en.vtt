00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.430
So Czukty is the cultural centre of the universe

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.009
Since we do Art with a capital A

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.430
and artists from allover Poland come here to join 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.009
the locals in performing Hamlet in a barn 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.000
It is the most amazing thing in the world!

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:32.000
Czukty it is my place

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.400
My myth, my legend

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.000
my fairytale

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Don’t put the mirror too close to the face

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
hand, you should write poems

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to make dreaming easier…

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.400
I want to have a job so I can work with people

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.500
so I can perform. Everything for the people

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.300
on a stage

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.000
How about that nice neighbour of yours?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
She want's to be an actress

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I see. So let's go to Elk

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
They flooded my Boltryki

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
They expropriated us, they threw us out

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Boltryki it is also my family name

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I can't get away from that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Well, that's why I had to start wearing red throusers

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
to become a stork

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Small sons of great poets

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
will never be understood

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
by great sons of small poets

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.400
