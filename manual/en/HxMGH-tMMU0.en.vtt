00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.810
Motorola FLIPSIDE.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.010
Expected Q4 2010.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.309
The Motorola FLIPSIDE is the latest variation
on the Motorola CLIQ / DEXT platform, and

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:24.250
it forms another addition to the ever-growing
range Android handsets offered by Motorola.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.609
Sitting towards the lower end of Motorola's
smartphone range, the FLIPSIDE sports a 3.1"

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:39.059
320 x 480 pixel display, a 3 megapixel camera,
3.5G support, WiFi, GPS and an FM radio, plus

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.479
it comes with a slide-out QWERTY keyboard.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:51.799
Initially, the FLIPSIDE will be offered in
an 850/1900 MHz 3G version for AT&amp;T in the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.780
US only, but Motorola's press statement indicates
that perhaps there are broader plans, as they

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.940
say that the "Motorola FLIPSIDE with MOTOBLURâ„¢
will be available in select regions around

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.010
the world beginning in Q4 2010."

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.780
Annoyingly, Motorola are launching the FLIPSIDE
with Android 2.1 rather than Android 2.2,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.330
although we suspect that most customers won't
really care. The FLIPSIDE does everything

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.860
that every other Android phone does, plus
it has access to Motorola's MOTOBLUR service

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.350
which offers useful social networking and
synchronisation features.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.120
The keyboard is a lot less cramped and altogether
better thought out than the one found on the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.530
DEXT, and currently there are not a lot of
QWERTY-equipped Android devices about. Inside

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.800
is a very respectable 512MB of RAM and a 720MHz
processor which should take care of most applications

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.110
that you might want to run on it.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.310
The Motorola FLIPSIDE should be available
to AT&amp;T customers from 17th October for $79.99

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.770
when taken with an appropriate data plan,
