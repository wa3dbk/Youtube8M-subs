Jan: I am a Southern girl, and as a Southern
girl, we love sweet tea around my house. I'm

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.980
going to show you how I make a raspberry sweet
tea. This stuff is awesome.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.939
Over here, I've got about 3 or 4 cups of water;
that's all you need. Four family-size teabags,

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.500
and you can get this all over the place, look
for the ones that say they're specially bended.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.080
Over here I have 2 cups of water and 2 cups
of sugar, which is the makings of simple syrup.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.660
It's a 1:1 ratio of sugar and water. I have
1Â½ cup of raspberries.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.680
If you happen to have a good inexpensive source
of fresh raspberries, knock yourself out.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.970
Where we live, they're hideously expensive.
For this, you're going kick the fire out of

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.960
them anyways so it doesn't really matter.
What we're doing here is making a raspberry

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.851
simple syrup. I've got this on medium heat.
I'm going to bring this up to a boil and I'm

00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:12.820
going to let it simmer for and probably 5
minutes or so. We're going to get the raspberries

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.280
nice and squishy; we're going to dissolve
all the sugar. Over here, all I'm doing to

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.559
these teabags is I'm going to bring these
up to a boil and let them sit. I know that's

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:25.940
a lot of tea for that amount of water, but
don't forget, you got a lot more water over

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.281
here. Then we're going to add ice to the whole
thing. Bring this to a boil, cut it off, let

00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:37.840
it just sit there and steam. Bring this tool
boil; give it 5 minutes. I'll show you what

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.590
looks like after that.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.899
I brought my teabags tool boil and I let them
come off of the heat immediately, but I let

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.500
them steep for about 5 minutes or so. You
can see that's some pretty dark tea. You don't

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.900
want to steep any longer than that because
then your tea gets bitter, but you do want

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.830
a nice strong base for this, and that is.
I don't know why I poured that through the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.860
strainer, but I did. This is what you need
to pour . . . get out of here. This is what

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.720
you need to pour through the strain. I'll
start smacking you. That's what mamas do with

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.430
wooden spoons.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.380
This is our raspberry simple syrup. If you
don't like tea very, very sweet, cut the sugar

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.510
in half, cut it down to 1 cup. Like I said
we're super Southerners, you can get more

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.840
sugar in there for us, enough sugar in there
for us. Now I'm going to make a mess. This

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.130
part you do want to strain. Look at the . . . can
you see what's floating on the top of the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.900
liquid? Those are the raspberry seeds. You
really don't want those in there. They're

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.860
not going to hurt you; they might get in your
teeth and drive you nuts. If I had a dental

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.720
floss sponsor, we could promote the ingestion
of raspberry seeds. Actually, there are a

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:11.730
couple of illnesses or conditions where you
don't want to eat those. Not many.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.670
You think you can stand over there and whisper,
and nobody's going to hear you trying to get

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.670
my attention?

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.670
Male: I about ruined your video when I smacked
my hip on the doorknob.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:27.380
Jan: I'm glad you didn't cuss camera. That
was my oldest trying to let me know he should

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.350
be commended for not cussing on camera. He
was trying to sneak the laundry in.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.300
Male: I smacked my hipbone.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.250
Jan: Pardon me. All you do here is run that
through the strainer. You want every last

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:50.920
drop of raspberry goodness. You really do
want to work it through. Raspberries are . . . they're

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.410
so good. We're getting down to the . . . it
doesn't have a whole lot more to give up.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:09.730
Have you fogged up the camera yet? That was
smooth. Give me half a second. Let me do a

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.020
little cleanup and I will be back.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.920
Male: We're on film.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.979
Jan: All right, fine. Thank you.

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.039
Male: You can cut it out.

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.479
Jan: Now can I go?

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.479
Male: Yeah.

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.360
Jan: Normally, I would tell you to fill the
rest of the container up with ice and stir

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.490
it, and then you can serve it, except we use
all of the ice a little while ago and I didn't

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.040
realize it. We're down to that much, which
is probably not enough. Anyways, I put cold

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.900
water in here to bring it up to about a gallon,
because you're going to end up with a gallon.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:48.332
Normally you would fill it up part with ice.
This is great. Watch this. It's nice to have

00:04:48.332 --> 00:04:56.070
relatives two doors down. Normally you would
fill that up with ice. It's still pretty warm

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:15.280
so it's going to melt our ice. I don't care
because I'm going to have it anyway. Watch

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.270
me spill it because I don't have the lid on.
Yep, that's all pretty.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.050
Child: Can I get that glass?

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.710
Jan: You might want to make 2 gallons because
it goes pretty fast. That's how you make raspberry

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.930
ice tea.
