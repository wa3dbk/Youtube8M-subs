00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:04.581
- Good afternoon, my
name is Malcolm Bevin.

00:00:04.581 --> 00:00:06.596
I'm the Production
Manager for All About Tea

00:00:06.596 --> 00:00:09.278
and today we're having
a little presentation

00:00:09.278 --> 00:00:13.061
on the teabag making
machine for All About Tea.

00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:15.234
So, when you place your
orders for your teabags,

00:00:15.234 --> 00:00:17.737
this particular machine is what we use

00:00:17.737 --> 00:00:20.092
to actually produce them.

00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:22.043
It has a practical use,

00:00:22.043 --> 00:00:26.210
it can be used for various
teabags doing various sizes,

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:28.306
and normally what we would do is

00:00:28.306 --> 00:00:29.973
wait for your order to come through

00:00:29.973 --> 00:00:33.273
and produce your teabags
hopefully on the same day

00:00:33.273 --> 00:00:34.893
as you require them.

00:00:34.893 --> 00:00:37.845
At its capacity it does around about

00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:40.622
12,000 teabags per hour,

00:00:40.622 --> 00:00:43.875
so you can imagine, in an
eight hour shift that's 96,000.

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:46.831
So that's quite a good shift out on these.

00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:49.204
It's one of the older types of machines,

00:00:49.204 --> 00:00:51.689
I believe I've been
reliably informed that this

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:55.439
particular machine was
actually made in 1948.

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.590
So what we're gonna do now is
just go through the process

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.995
of actually how it
operates and how it works.

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:04.843
The first important thing
is obviously the hopper.

00:01:04.843 --> 00:01:07.337
In the hopper we actually put your tea,

00:01:07.337 --> 00:01:10.276
to actually go through the
chamber, into the bags.

00:01:10.276 --> 00:01:13.441
The hopper must be kept full at all times

00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:16.606
to make sure the required
tea for the weight of the bag

00:01:16.606 --> 00:01:19.980
comes through the actual mechanisms.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.667
What I'm pointing to now is the

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:25.022
actual teabag roller/producer,

00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:26.898
which actually makes the bags,

00:01:26.898 --> 00:01:29.088
and actually heat seals them off.

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:32.415
After that we have,
obviously, the out trays

00:01:32.415 --> 00:01:35.863
where the teabags, when
they are made, comes out.

00:01:35.863 --> 00:01:37.757
We'll demonstrate that in a minute.

00:01:37.757 --> 00:01:39.581
Over to the right of my side here,

00:01:39.581 --> 00:01:41.684
there's obviously the on/off controls,

00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:44.479
and I will see the speed for the chamber

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.235
for the number of bags
that are coming through.

00:01:47.235 --> 00:01:51.402
That is obviously again according
to what teabag you require

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.436
it is obviously changed to
the speed and the weight

00:01:54.436 --> 00:01:56.312
of the tea coming through.

00:01:56.312 --> 00:01:58.920
So all that in mind, it's
a very short presentation,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.827
we're going to make some bags now.

00:02:00.827 --> 00:02:04.397
The first thing we do is
actually turn on the mechanism

00:02:04.397 --> 00:02:06.880
or timer for the tea bags,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.875
then we turn on the hopper
chamber and these come through.

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:12.748
As we can see, they're coming through,

00:02:12.748 --> 00:02:14.759
they're nice and clean.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.945
As I said we can produce in the region

00:02:16.945 --> 00:02:18.945
of 12,000 bags per hour.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.500
We make sure that the right amount of tea

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.667
is in the bag.

00:02:27.973 --> 00:02:30.001
We also check the sealing make

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:31.310
to make sure they're sealing and

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.803
there's no seepage on the bag,

00:02:32.803 --> 00:02:36.177
so the quality bag comes
to you, our customer,

00:02:36.177 --> 00:02:39.094
is at the highest level we can get.

00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:45.625
As you can see these bags
are coming very nice,

00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:48.895
nice and neat and nice and nice and clean.

00:02:48.895 --> 00:02:50.349
So there you go, you've actually seen

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.766
your teabags being made in All About Tea.
