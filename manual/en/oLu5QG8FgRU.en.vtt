00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.770
Oh hello everybody. At the top of last week's
Ask Cristen, I asked if anyone had cures for

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.840
spring fever because I had a major case of
spring fever and you know what the universe

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.360
did? It made it 73 degrees outside and I'm
getting over a cold. Literally I caught spring

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.840
fever. Spring food poisoning to be more specific
but that's disgusting. Thanks a lot nature.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.880
Your questions and no more of my complaining
after the intro.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.320
Last week on the show the question was whether
or not millennials are scared of commitment.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.949
A couple of comments that jumped out to me,
Kalliste said, 'I don't see why being married

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.350
is what you need to do to be considered "committed".
I don't know if my partner and I will ever

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.549
get married but it doesn't mean we're not
committed to each other. We just bought a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:56.570
house together! If that doesn't say "I want
to spend the next 20 or so years of my life

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.909
with you" I don't know what does.' At the
thought of buying a house Kalliste I think

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.420
my spring fever just went up a couple of degrees.
Laila Kaasik also weighed in, saying, 'There

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.210
used to be the norm of getting married when
you wanted to have sex. Now we really don't

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.840
have this pressure and I like it. People are
not forced to be tied together so strongly

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.399
if they're not ready so probably when people
are ready and find the right person to marry,

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.409
those marriages will be happier.' One can
only hope that if we're waiting longer that

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.960
we're being wiser and more prudent about this
massive legal decision that we are making

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.450
that is marriage. I clearly win the award
for the most romantic woman on the face of

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.409
the planet. This week's Ask Cristen question
actually did not pop up in the Ask Cristen

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.390
comments but from another Stuff Mom Never
Told You video last week but I still wanted

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.689
to talk about it. The question was how healthy
are long-distance relationships? First up

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.719
lets talk about research on long-distance
relationships versus geographically close

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.090
relationships. What I found was a surprisingly
mixed bag of study results. Generally speaking

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.509
researchers assumed that long-distance relationships
were beneficial in the sense that they didn't

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:09.509
necessarily come with the day to day frictions
that closer proximity relationships can involve.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.180
It's the whole absence makes the heart grow
fonder theory. Scientific side note, there

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.629
was one study I found looking at women in
long-distance relationships and it found that

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.330
their levels of testosterone are elevated
in the days leading up to when they're going

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.700
to go meet up with their long-distance lover.
That's a signal of that hormonal anticipation

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.620
of like oh my god I'm finally going to get
to go make-out with you already. There's also

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.370
this idea that if you're in a long-distance
relationship you have a greater investment

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.370
in the positive outcome of that relationship.
You have to make a choice to be in a long-distance

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.670
relationship and maintain that long-distance
relationship for however long it has to be.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.760
That also right there is the downside that
researchers often point to. That long-distance

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.480
factor can actually make it a little bit tougher
to readjust once you are finally living in

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.530
the same space or living in a closer proximity
to each other. For people who have what psychologists

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.610
term anxious attachment style--the clingier
people in relationships--long distance relationships

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.860
can be really tough. You're not getting that
more regular face to face feedback. One anecdotal

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.379
note though, a few years ago Stuff Mom Never
Told You the podcast did an episode on long-distance

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.900
relationships and we heard from so many people
who were in long-distance relationships that

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.959
were successful. They all shared a common
theme of making that decision to go long-distance

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.980
but only for a specified amount of time. If
they were able to make it work, they more

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.569
committed to each other than ever before because
they had to get through that period. I do

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.159
think that here are certain ground rules that
go into long-distance relationships that might

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.700
be a little bit different from face to face
relationships. You need to be able to be radically

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.950
honest about what you want and expect in terms
of monogamy. How do you move the relationship

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.379
forward while you are not living close to
each other? It's absolutely possible but there's

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.760
got to be a lot of trust there and a light
at the end of the tunnel. Either scenario

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.489
whether long-distance or close proximity comes
with its own pros and cons. It just depends

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.500
on what you and your partner want out of the
relationship for the long term. Whether you

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:33.000
are sharing an apartment with someone like
I am or in another country, it's usually all

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.290
about communication. I want to know if anyone
watching is in or has been in a long-distance

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.610
relationship. How did you make it work or
if it didn't work out what were the pitfalls?

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.970
Lend your long-distance relationship advice
below and if you have any questions for next

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.200
time, let me know in the comments as well
and I'll get right to 'em. Where'd that voice

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.720
come from?
