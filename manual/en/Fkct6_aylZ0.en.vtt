00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.210
LifeProof is definitely the go-to case when
it comes to waterproofing your iPhone.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.770
They offer outstanding protection for your
mobile devices without the bulk you might

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.969
expect from other products.

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.039
This is the long awaited LifeProof Nuud for
iPhone 6.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.120
In this review we'll put this case through
it's paces and see if it lives up to the LifeProof

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.120
name.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.949
The Nuud series of LifeProof cases was the
first case on the market to provide complete

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.800
waterproof protection while not obstructing
the screen.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.409
Other cases put a plastic screen protector
between you and your phones screen.

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.710
The LifeProof Nuud however uses a gasket to
seal the edge of the case to the screen to

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.150
keep dust and moisture out.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.280
I've never been a huge fan of screen protectors
because of smudging, rainbowing, and interfering

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.570
with the touchscreen responsiveness.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.480
The idea of waterproofing your iPhone without
covering the screen is pretty amazing, but

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.620
it definitely has it's downsides.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.399
LifeProof provides a plastic test unit inside
of the case and a note assuring you that your

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.710
case has already been water tested.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.649
To give you extra confidence that it works
they recommend you put the case under water

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.859
with the plastic test unit inside and place
a coffee cup over the case to keep it submerged

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.230
for 30 minutes.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.720
If after the test there's no water in the
case then you can reasonably assume your iPhone

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.780
will fair the same.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.750
If you plan to purposely get your phone wet
you'll want to take the case apart and inspect

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.580
the seal for debris that may interfere with
it's ability to block out moisture.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.540
I've used a LifeProof Nuud case on my iPad
Mini for several months and the few times

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.030
I've taken the case apart I have found debris
between the gasket and the glass that probably

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.560
would degrade it's waterproofing ability.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.450
You'll also want to be careful when disassembling
the case that you don't pull the gasket out

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.620
of the case.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.780
If it does come out just carefully place it
back in the groove of the case to reassemble.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.880
Otherwise it's a really great design and ultimately
what makes the Nuud series the top pick for

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.210
a waterproof iPhone case.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.640
Of course since there's no built in screen
protector your iPhone is subject to screen

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.080
scratches.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.210
LifeProof does include a screen protector
that covers only the parts exposed outside

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.210
of the case.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.970
If you choose to use this you'll definitely
want to install it with the case on.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.230
If any of the screen protector gets between
the gasket and the screen your iPhone is no

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.230
longer waterproof.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.230
That goes for any third party screen protectors
as well.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.230
It's possible that some of the glass screen
protectors would still provide a decent enough

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.230
sill to block out water but chances are they'll
make your device too thick and I wouldn't

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.230
recommend using them.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.230
You install your iPhone in the case by placing
the bottom of the phone into the front of

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.230
the case and firmly pressing down.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.580
You then snap on the back making sure the
entire case is snapped down all the way around.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.149
I usually go over it twice just to be sure
all the sides are snapped.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.819
When finished close the flap for the Lightning
port.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.460
When installed correctly you should notice
the O-ring pressed between the screen and

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.939
the case.

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.659
The case does add a decent amount of width
and height to the phone with this plastic

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.159
bumper, but that's what makes it shock proof.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.969
Thankfully it's still a very thin case on
par with a lot of standard non-waterproof

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:28.790
cases.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.090
Taking a closer look at the buttons and ports
you'll find they all provide great tactile

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.430
response and still click very well.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.760
Touch ID works just as well as without a case.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.920
There is a plastic membrane covering the home
button that looks pretty flimsy, but it certainly

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.769
gets the job done.

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.870
Lifeproof chose to not make the opening of
the home button completely round because of

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.260
how close it is to the edge of the screen.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.290
Otherwise the small please of plastic between
the home button and screen would be very fragile.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.999
It doesn't get in the way at all but takes
some getting used to.

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:59.860
The mute switch is actually a toggle built
into the case and is backwards from the actual

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.860
mute switch.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.489
So down is on and up is vibrate.

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.900
The front facing camera and proximity sensor
are covered by plastic and the ear piece is

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.760
covered with a wire mesh that allows air and
sound through but not dust and water.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.900
The speaker port and microphone port are covered
by wire mesh as well.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.920
There's a flap with a gasket for the Lightning
connector and an opening only large enough

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.709
for standard connectors.

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.359
Any larger third party cables certainly won't
work.

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.830
On previous cases this gasket was very easy
to lose.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.739
Lifeproof has addressed that by tucking this
gasket in on all four sides.

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.980
The cover for the headphone jack is threaded
which I really appreciate.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.700
It's definitely not going to accidentally
fall out.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.469
Lifeproof includes a threaded headphone adapter
that you can use with waterproof headphones,

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:45.870
or more likely, to allow larger third party
headphone jacks to connect.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.689
The camera lense is covered with a higher
quality glass and is recessed to prevent scratches.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.989
This does allow for snow to collect around
the lens, so be aware of that if you're playing

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.299
in the snow.

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.959
The case is slightly raise around the entire
screen.

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.950
It doesn't seem to get in the way of the Notification
Center drop down but I do occasionally have

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.500
trouble pulling up Control Center.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.489
You have to really make sure you press you
finger deep into the edge of the case.

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.849
Lifeproof claims their cases are waterproof,
dirt proof, snow proof, and shock proof.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.079
After being tossed in the snow a few times
the phone and case came out unharmed.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.050
For the purposes of this review I'm going
to skip the dirt test.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.090
If the case is waterproof it'll certainly
keep dirt out and to be honest I really don't

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.040
want to get my brand new case dirty.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.840
After all, the white front is prone to staining.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.020
For water testing I decided to run my phone
through the washer.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.750
This actually tests it's waterproofing ability
as well as some shockproof ability.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.110
The case passed this test with flying colors.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.420
Most people aren't going to put their phones
through this kind of torture.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.540
More than likely it'll be a spilled drink
or a drop in the toilet.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.190
But if the case can withstand this it can
certainly hold up to more likely scenarios.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.420
And the beauty of the Lifeproof case is that
when you're done you can rinse the soap off

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.190
in the sink.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.110
This case is rated for drops up to 6.6 feet.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.940
A much more realistic drop for me is right
when I take my phone out of my pocket.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.230
And although I've never once dropped my phone
while texting, the Lifeproof Nuud can certainly

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.170
handle that as well should it happen to you.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.440
I did pick up a minor scuff on the corner
of the case and the two pieces also separated.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.710
It's easily snapped back together though.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.270
In terms of call quality it's about what you'd
expect, which isn't great.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.390
In my call tests the person I was talking
to could hear me fine and didn't notice any

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.390
difference.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.300
I did notice the sound through the earpiece
was degraded though.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.670
It was still clear and not muffled at all
but sounded a little bit like someone talking

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.690
in a cave and when there was additional background
noise I had a hard time hearing them.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.590
For music the speaker worked surprisingly
well.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.080
Lifeproof uses the airspace on the back of
the case to amplify the sound and it really

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.080
works.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.140
The back of the case vibrates while playing
music and the sound is great.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.940
In the end this is a really amazing case considering
its size and having direct access to the screen.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.190
The few caveats I've mentioned will definitely
cause it not to be the daily case for many

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.190
people.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.050
But if you're heading out to the snow or water,
or if you're just generally rough on your

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.200
phone, this is the case for you.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.690
If you have any questions that I didn't cover
feel free to leave them in the comments.
