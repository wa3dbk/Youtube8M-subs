00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.940
Hello everyone and welcome! In this video, we're going to be talking about soft versus hard springs and which one is better.

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.609
So you may think that because sports cars and race cars use really stiff springs that that's what's best

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.789
But in reality if you want the most maximum grip you want a softer spring, so why is there this differentiation?

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.819
Let's talk about that, and so what we've got here is

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.079
a depression in the road so we've got two cars driving. They're about to collide which is unfortunate, but that's irrelevant.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.180
So we have these two wheels and they're traveling this one's traveling this direction this one's traveling this direction

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.599
and we have this twenty millimeter depression in the road now the only difference between these two vehicles is the spring rate and

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.849
so what we have on the left side is a

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.160
Spring, and we placed a thousand kilograms on it or about 10,000 Newtons of Force

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.729
Down on this spring and that compressed it a hundred millimeters so that gives us a spring rate of a hundred Newtons per millimeter

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.399
Ten thousand divided by a hundred- 
 hundred Newtons per millimeter

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.070
This one on the right,

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:06.658
Spring B, basically what we have is we've placed that same load, ten thousand newtons on this spring, but it's only compressed ten millimeters

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.659
So a thousand Newtons per millimeter

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.409
So what's going to happen is these are going to travel over this depression

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.809
And we want to maintain contact with the ground

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:21.299
The whole point of a suspension is to keep tires on the ground so hopefully that much is understood

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.209
Seems pretty obvious cars can only do the things that they do if the tires are actually touching the ground

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.250
So, what we've got here is this car is about to leave over this ledge here

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.409
And then it's got a twenty millimeter gap to fill and it's got 100 millimetres of spring compression to do it

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.280
So if you look at this little graph right here

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.149
We've got our amount of spring compression., which is 100 millimeters, and then the force which is on that spring, so

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.640
10,000 Newtons at this point in time. So as it goes over this gap

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.259
you're going to have 10,000 Newtons pressing down on this wheel which we'll just say the wheel is a hundred kilograms and

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.729
So it'll press down on that

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.898
wheel and try and get it to contact this ground and it's got a 100 millimeters of compression to push that wheel down

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.149
Because it's been compressed that much from the weight of the car. So, as it travels over it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.349
You've got 20 millimeters

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.019
So it's going to from a 100 down to eighty and so when it's at eighty

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.140
Now because we've got eighty millimeters of compression in the spring we've got an 8,000 kN force

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.599
So if we take the average of those 10,000 Newtons at the start,  8,000 Newtons pressing down at the end

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.360
Right when it hits contact, we've got an average of about 9kN, 9,000 Newtons

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.849
So we know that Force equals mass times acceleration;

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.929
Acceleration equals Force divided by mass; 9000 divided by a hundred kilograms. That's the mass of the wheel

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.560
We'll have about nine Gs

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.819
Pushing down on that wheel, so if you add gravity to that once this tire goes over this gap

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.598
It's got ten gs of acceleration acting on it, pressing it down towards the ground so it's going to hit that ground very quickly

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.629
Now this spring on the right what we've got is ten millimeters of compression and so you can see here

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.309
It's got ten millimeters of compression, and it's got a 10,000 kN

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.060
Force at that and so we want to fill this 20 millimeter gap well it only has ten millimeters of compression

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.190
so after that initial ten millimeters of

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.999
Pushing that wheel down it can't push it down any more and it just falls at the rate of gravity, so for those last 10

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.900
Millimeters, you've only got one g

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.450
Acting on that tire to bring it down and hopefully it does maintain contact at some point

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.519
Or you just skip over this bump entirely

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.459
But the point is you won't have contact so the wheel and tire can't be doing what they're supposed to be doing which is

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.039
maintaining contact, allowing the car to accelerate, turn,

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.560
whatever it's doing. And so because this softer spring presses it down faster

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.939
you're going to have more contact and you're going to have better contact, so

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.929
Therefore you're going to have, you know, the car reacting the way that you want it to

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.159
Same scenario if we move over here to a bump

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.340
so if we have

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.160
Tire A and that's about to hit a 10 millimeter bump, well, to compress the spring 10

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.489
Millimeters, 10 times 100 Newtons per millimeter it requires 1000 Newton Force to travel through that spring

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.339
So this will be a minor bump and the wheel will maintain

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.780
contact, tire maintains contact with the ground. Now for B, to compress that spring 10 millimeters, it requires a

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.200
10,000 Newton Force because of the higher spring rate, so the larger force could lift the car

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
physically into the air or it could just

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.669
unsettle it; you could have some load transfer occur and so it might slide out, and so obviously that's not ideal.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:44.249
So that kind of explains why a softer spring makes more sense because it keeps the tire in contact with the ground. So why do

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.390
racecars have such stiff suspensions? Well, there's actually a lot of really good reasons,

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.330
they don't exactly apply to road cars though.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.440
So you want to reduce body roll, body lean, that maintains a certain suspension geometry.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.290
That's obvious and you can do that by stiffening the suspension. You also want to maintain

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.469
low ground clearance. Low ground clearance because you want a low center of gravity and so by doing that

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.160
you have low suspension travel because if you only have,

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.689
If you have a large amount of suspension travel and you have a little bit of ground clearance

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:22.200
And you're just going to be bottoming out and obviously you want your tires to be contacting the ground, not your vehicle. The aerodynamic efficiency

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.039
is at a specific ride height, so cars are set up for a very specific ride height, you want to maintain that ride height and

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.259
So you're going to have you know forces acting on this car that are going to be changing that so with the stiff spring you

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
can maintain somewhat of an ideal

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.500
ride height. Same goes for down force, you're going to have down force pressing down on that car

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.450
you don't want it to actually press down too much, you want to stay at a relatively similar ride height and

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.629
so by using stiffer Springs it won't press down as much.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.920
And then also driving on tracks, tracks are often smooth, not all of them granted

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.400
but tracks are often smooth and so this allows for compliance with very stiff suspensions, whereas if the track was really rough,

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.320
you'd see very different changes in the suspension setup by the engineering teams

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.460
