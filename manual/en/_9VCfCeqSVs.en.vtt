00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:01.939
Hey guys!

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.490
Today I'm going to be doing the secret life
of a youtuber tag and I was tag by Max from

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.490
WellDoneBooks.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.370
I'm not sure exactly who the creator of this
tag is, because it just kind of blew up and

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.710
like everybody's doing it and I don't know
who the original creator is, but I will definitely

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.630
leave a link to their channel if I find out
who created this awesome tag.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.730
So without further ado, let me reveal to you
some of my youtube secrets.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.310
Question number one, how long have you been
on youtube?

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.970
I've been watching youtube since 2006, I've
been making my own youtube videos since 2009,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.219
but I've been making booktube videos since
2012.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.420
Question number two, at what point will you
stop?

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.420
NEVER.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.109
I really don't ever see myself stopping doing
this.

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:43.760
Youtube it's kind of the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.670
Which I know sounds so cheesy, but it's so
true.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.280
I've connected with so many amazing people
and it's just influenced my life in such a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.449
positive way and I've read so many amazing
books thanks to Youtube, but I seriously don't

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.539
ever see myself living a life without Youtube,
because it's just such a massive part of my

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:59.539
life.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.699
I'll probably be an old grandpa still talking
about books here on booktube.

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.410
Question number three, what's the best thing
about being a youtuber?

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.160
I kind of answered this in the last question.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.310
For me it's the people I've connected with
throughout my experience here on Youtube.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.930
I spent a majority of my life with people
who I called friends, but they weren't truly

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.930
friends to me.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.470
They were people who took advantage of me
and didn't truly care about me.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.140
But now I have a group of friends, because
of youtube that are that support system that

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.140
I need.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.700
That are truly friends to me, that care about
me, and want to be my friend.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.920
And I'm so thankful for that aspect of YouTube
where you do make connections, because the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.320
friends that I've made here are friends that
I know will be friends for a lifetime.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.320
Number four.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.140
What's the worst thing about being a youtuber?

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.540
This one is kind of an obvious answer and
that is the hate that you receive.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.490
I don't receive a lot of hate, but I do receive
hate every now and then and it just gets under

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.800
my skin and it makes me really sad.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.750
But I've learned that you can't just let those
people get to you, because it's not worth

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.750
it at all.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.070
There's a block button for a reason, so you
gotta click that block button and just move

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.180
on with your life, because those people are
just out to get you, out to get a reaction

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.420
out of you, and you just gotta let it go,
gotta realize what they're trying to do and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.940
just move forward, cause it's just not worth
it.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.289
Question number five how many thumbnail options
do you take?

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.620
I used to be really terrible at taking thumbnails,
like I would completely forget about taking

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.560
them and so I'd have to search through my
video and find a spot where I was kind of

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.370
smiling, but I never really got very good
thumbnails, so now I have gotten into the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.480
habit of taking thumbnail options at the beginning
of my video so I'll just hit record and I'll

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.760
just be like posin' like a derpy mad man until
I find something that I like.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.060
so I'll just show you what I do, because I
need a thumbnail for this video, I didn't

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.280
do it before hand so I could answer this question
with some of the things that I do.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.910
So for this one, we're gonna go with the cliche
.. cause we've got a secret, there's a secret

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.760
in the title of this video and I'm going to
move over a little bit so that I can put a

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.550
title right here ooh ahh oooh ahh so one of
those will end up being this thumbnail.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.790
That's how I do it, I just sit in front of
my camera for a minute or so and just make

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.490
a bunch of different faces and eventually
I will find one that I'm happy with.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.260
Number 6 who is your youtuber crush?

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.130
MirandaSings is my bae, okay?

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.750
That's all I gotta say HEY HEY.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.610
Number 7 who's on your Youtube collab wishlist?

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.319
Honestly I would love to make videos with
all my friends, like I just love making videos

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.069
with my friends, so that's like the ideal
situation here and as for outside of the booktube

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.069
community though.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.070
I would LOVE to collaborate with MirandaSings
that is just like a dream seriously, I would

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.650
probably just like die.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.490
I love MirandaSings so much she is hilarious
also MamrieHart, she just seems like one of

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.270
those people that you would just have the
best time collaborating with so I definitely

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.440
want to collab with MamrieHart, but that will
probably never happen, I'll probably never

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.220
get the chance to collaborate with those two
people, but it's a dream, okay?

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.349
Question number 8 what are you wearing on
your bottom half?

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.630
I am wearing athletic shorts.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.459
I always wear athletic shorts when I'm filming,
unless I'm filming with another person, I'm

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.840
probably wearing jeans, but currently I'm
wearing shorts and I'm doing a little dance,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.580
but you can't see because it's down there,
but you can see me dancing up here.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.580
okay!

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.209
Question number 9 How long till you hit record?

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.959
It takes me about 15 minutes to like mentally
prepare myself and to get ready and get dressed

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.800
and all that jazz, but my equipment is already
set up in my room so usually I'm just able

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.550
to hop in front of the camera.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.280
Turn on the lights, hit record, and off we
go into the filming land, where we film the

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.960
videos, yes.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.930
Question number 10 how do you feel about the
youtube community and the youtube culture?

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.491
I don't really have too much to say about
the overall youtube community, because that's

00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:33.070
not my main focus while I'm here on youtube.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.910
Yes, I am apart of this community, but I feel
like I'm more apart of the booktube community,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.681
like I feel like its its own little hub within
the youtube community and so I don't have

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:45.470
much to say about the youtube community, there
has been a lot of crap that's been going down

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.600
and it's just really unfortunate, but as for
the booktube community, even though we hit

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.440
little hiccups every now and then and there's
often some conflicts that are taking place,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.430
it's usually issues that we're able to work
through and a lot of the things that have

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.520
happened have helped us grow as a community
which I think is important.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.190
Even though booktube has grown into this massive
thing, it still feels really small to me.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.500
People are still really accepting and very
welcoming and that's something that I just

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.090
love about this community.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.300
Question number 11 what's your secret to a
successful youtube channel?

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.430
This is a hard one to answer, because I feel
like I've just been doing this for so long

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.760
and it just has kind of evolved into something
bigger than I ever thought it would become

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.240
and I just don't know how it even got to this
point really.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.110
I just have been posting videos and have been
having fun and have been making friends and

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.699
those are the things that I find to be successful.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.800
Those are the things that I think make a successful
youtube channel, when you're having fun making

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.010
content and you're interacting with other
people and you're talking and having discussion,

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.580
like those are the things that I think are
important.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.229
It's not about the views or how many subscribers
you have.

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:51.710
It's being happy and having fun and making
friendships, I think that that's a successful

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.870
youtube channel.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.430
I don't know though, that's my thought process
behind it.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.150
And the last question, question number twelve
is who do you tag?

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.990
I'm going to tag Jess over at PriceisWong
and Regan from PeruseProject you guys should

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.650
definitely do this tag!

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.650
Thanks for watching guys!

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.980
I'm gonna ask you a question now so we can
get a discussion going in the comments.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.150
What is your favorite thing about booktube?

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.449
I want to know, let me know, down below!

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:16.570
I will see you guys soon with a new video!

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.570
Later!

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.570
Whaaaa fell over!

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.919
But I will let blah blah
