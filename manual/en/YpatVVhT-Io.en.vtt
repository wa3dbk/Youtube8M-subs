You make me get a headache

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:46.406
You know how to have fun

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:48.118

As I get to know you more

you're like a swamp

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.673
It disappears like a dream when I have it in my hands

00:02:45.673 --> 00:02:49.057
It's clear you're dangerous

00:02:49.057 --> 00:02:51.655
Can't stop

The only thing I see is you

00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:30.155
The more I fall into you, the more dangerous you are

00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:31.601
