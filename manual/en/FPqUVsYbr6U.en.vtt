00:00:00.717 --> 00:00:02.262
- [Player] Hey yo, it's A to the O,

00:00:02.262 --> 00:00:03.685
and were going to play
another gaming video.

00:00:03.685 --> 00:00:06.114
Were going to play Agar.io.

00:00:06.114 --> 00:00:07.468
(laughter)

00:00:07.468 --> 00:00:08.368
That rhymed.

00:00:08.368 --> 00:00:09.201
Oh my gosh.

00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:10.177
So the, oh no.

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:11.341
Pluto you ate me.

00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:13.533
I know it's your week and
everything, but please.

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.407
Could you have refrained
from eating me please?

00:00:16.407 --> 00:00:20.087
Okay so in this game you
are a planet out in space.

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:21.806
And your whole job is to try

00:00:21.806 --> 00:00:23.061
and eat everything around you.

00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:24.250
Oh no, no, no Earth.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.355
Earth I love you, your my friend.

00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:26.525
Don't touch me.

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:28.094
See you try and eat up all the smaller

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:30.438
planets and stars and stuff.

00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:32.920
And you try, if your smaller than people

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.874
you don't wanna get eaten.

00:00:33.874 --> 00:00:35.025
You don't want to get touched.

00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:36.475
Like Earth, he's way bigger than me.

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:38.470
So if I touched him he'll involve me.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.844
Oh no, get out of here.

00:00:39.844 --> 00:00:40.863
Oh no, no.

00:00:40.863 --> 00:00:42.205
How do you escape these guys?

00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:44.407
You just plan it.

00:00:44.407 --> 00:00:46.645
Get it, you plan it, oh
my God get away from me.

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:48.815
Hey Lmao, what ever your name is?

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:49.746
I've got some stars to eat.

00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:50.714
I think these are stars.

00:00:50.714 --> 00:00:52.268
They're delicious.

00:00:52.268 --> 00:00:55.271
You know this game, it leaves
me feeling starry eyed.

00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:57.587
Oh come here I'll eat you.

00:00:57.587 --> 00:00:58.557
Oh yes, ate you too.

00:00:58.557 --> 00:00:59.581
You are delicious.

00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:00.462
Moon space man.

00:01:00.462 --> 00:01:01.295
Come here eight ball.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:02.128
Come on magic eight ball.

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:03.133
Come here, come here.

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:03.966
I want to eat you.

00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:07.000
Oh Mexico, I'm going to eat
the entire country of Mexico.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.079
Yes.

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:09.673
You taste like burritos.

00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:10.506
Was that insensitive?

00:01:10.506 --> 00:01:11.910
I'm sorry.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.493
America tastes like hamburgers.

00:01:16.394 --> 00:01:17.597
Or maybe its blam burgers.

00:01:17.597 --> 00:01:18.805
Blam burger.

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:19.638
Do not go fast.

00:01:19.638 --> 00:01:20.471
Oh, I'm going to fast.

00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:21.304
I'm going to eat you.

00:01:21.304 --> 00:01:22.137
Oh no, now your bigger than me.

00:01:22.137 --> 00:01:22.970
Get away from me.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:23.803
Were not friends.

00:01:23.803 --> 00:01:25.240
Were not friends.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.502
So what are you fruit
fanatics up to today?

00:01:27.502 --> 00:01:28.688
Have you played this game?

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:29.933
How big have you gotten?

00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:31.715
Oh no, what happened?

00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:32.991
I'm squishy.

00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:34.772
I must have got left out
in the sun for too long.

00:01:34.772 --> 00:01:35.605
Yes I can suck you up.

00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:39.770
Eat you and I didn't
even have to do anything.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.854
I'm going to eat every thing.

00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:43.467
I'm going to eat this thing, too.

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:44.300
What?

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.359
What happened?

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:46.576
Why did I explody?

00:01:46.576 --> 00:01:47.819
Why am I in ten thousand pieces?

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:48.856
What's happening?

00:01:48.856 --> 00:01:50.756
I am so confused right now.

00:01:50.756 --> 00:01:54.090
I really fall to pieces
when I'm having a ball.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.422
Two puns for the price of one.

00:01:55.422 --> 00:01:56.607
Stop trying to eat me.

00:01:56.607 --> 00:01:57.888
Get away from me.

00:01:57.888 --> 00:01:59.772
I am not delicious.

00:01:59.772 --> 00:02:03.951
Okay so how do I get back
into a fully formed Orange.

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:06.191
Even though I'm not the color Orange.

00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:08.434
Unfortunately space does
not come with a manual.

00:02:08.434 --> 00:02:09.900
Get away.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.733
Stop trying to...

00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:13.657
Whoa, what the, what the hey hey.

00:02:13.657 --> 00:02:15.963
You barfing body parts at me now.

00:02:15.963 --> 00:02:19.496
That's really inconsiderate and rude

00:02:19.496 --> 00:02:21.684
and kind of a disgusting thing to do.

00:02:21.684 --> 00:02:24.115
You don't see me burping
lungs at you and stuff.

00:02:24.115 --> 00:02:24.948
That's weird.

00:02:24.948 --> 00:02:26.229
Your weird.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:27.240
Your fired from this game.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.869
You can no longer play anymore.

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:30.389
What's this guy, ah, I missed him.

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:32.725
Okay, that's fine, it's fine, it's okay.

00:02:32.725 --> 00:02:33.921
Man I want to grow bigger,

00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:36.590
but I just don't have the space.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.980
Get it cause we're in space.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.146
I think.

00:02:39.146 --> 00:02:40.540
I think that's where were supposed to be.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.845
Are we in space?

00:02:41.845 --> 00:02:43.569
Oh no, what is that?

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:44.402
Get away.

00:02:44.402 --> 00:02:46.147
Oh, but I think I'm bigger than you.

00:02:46.147 --> 00:02:47.253
So maybe I should touch you.

00:02:47.253 --> 00:02:48.283
Oh, your going to get eaten.

00:02:48.283 --> 00:02:50.508
Your totally, oh...

00:02:50.508 --> 00:02:52.675
I don't like this.

00:02:52.675 --> 00:02:54.442
Everybody is trying to eat the Orange.

00:02:54.442 --> 00:02:56.919
Everyone's always trying
to eat the Orange.

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.240
It's my every day struggle.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.223
However, I've found that if you

00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:02.975
want to keep people from eating you,

00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:05.751
you just lather yourself
with some broccoli cologne.

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:07.621
It keeps them away every single time.

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:09.372
Oh no, no, don't touch me.

00:03:09.372 --> 00:03:10.568
Don't touch me.

00:03:10.568 --> 00:03:12.074
Oh yeah, eat you.

00:03:12.074 --> 00:03:13.324
You taste good.

00:03:14.357 --> 00:03:17.024
You taste like a blam hamburger.

00:03:17.902 --> 00:03:21.100
Let's get some more of these stars here.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.123
I'm just going for the little snacks.

00:03:23.123 --> 00:03:24.995
I'm just trying to grow gradually.

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:27.238
I don't want to go crazy here.

00:03:27.238 --> 00:03:28.435
But maybe I do.

00:03:28.435 --> 00:03:29.447
Oh look at this screamy guy.

00:03:29.447 --> 00:03:30.800
Come here Maturu.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.330
Yeah, I'll eat you.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.332
Oh no get away from that thing.

00:03:34.332 --> 00:03:35.567
What is it?

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:37.842
Your so big I can't
even read what you say.

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:38.923
I'm going right past you.

00:03:38.923 --> 00:03:40.819
See you later hot potater.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:41.900
Oh no.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.875
I know what that means.

00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:46.602
I know what that symbol means on that dot.

00:03:46.602 --> 00:03:47.435
On that planet.

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:48.477
It means that a monkey just

00:03:48.477 --> 00:03:51.304
stole all tires from your car.

00:03:51.304 --> 00:03:52.519
I hate it when that happens.

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:53.463
Stupid monkeys.

00:03:53.463 --> 00:03:54.296
Don't eat me.

00:03:54.296 --> 00:03:55.129
I'm going to eat you.

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.962
Actually I'll leave you alone.

00:03:55.962 --> 00:03:57.112
I'm just going to go for the small guys.

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:58.946
Like I said I'm a slow roller.

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:00.838
Come on, I want to eat that.

00:04:00.838 --> 00:04:01.956
Oh you keep dodging me.

00:04:01.956 --> 00:04:03.712
I'm just going to eat the small guys.

00:04:03.712 --> 00:04:05.516
I'll just get bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:07.674
Oh I almost got you 25.

00:04:07.674 --> 00:04:09.141
Oh come on.

00:04:09.141 --> 00:04:11.308
This game is astronomical.

00:04:13.513 --> 00:04:14.430
Oh come on.

00:04:15.396 --> 00:04:18.813
Hey Pokerface, you look a little flushed.

00:04:20.055 --> 00:04:21.051
Royal flush.

00:04:21.051 --> 00:04:21.884
Toilet.

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:24.367
Oh look at you.

00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:26.161
Oh no, oh no, Pokerface.

00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:27.266
Get away from me.

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:30.266
It's already a full house over here.

00:04:31.122 --> 00:04:33.887
Come on, yes, deliciousness.

00:04:33.887 --> 00:04:34.836
You know what they should do.

00:04:34.836 --> 00:04:36.369
They should make t-shirts for this game

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:39.310
and say I'm really big on Agar.io.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.034
Get it, I'm really big, cause
I get bigger and bigger.

00:04:41.034 --> 00:04:42.057
It's a joke.

00:04:42.057 --> 00:04:44.017
Oh, I want to eat more people.

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:46.902
Why doesn't anybody want
to get eaten by Orange?

00:04:46.902 --> 00:04:48.721
I think this might be a problem.

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:49.856
This might be a personal problem

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:51.118
that everybody's having.

00:04:51.118 --> 00:04:53.382
They don't want to get eaten by Orange.

00:04:53.382 --> 00:04:54.676
I think you all need therapy,

00:04:54.676 --> 00:04:56.059
because you need to deal with the fact

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:58.234
that you don't want to get
eaten by a giant Orange.

00:04:58.234 --> 00:04:59.397
Get away from me Koera.

00:04:59.397 --> 00:05:00.230
I think your supposed to be.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.807
Or I don't even know what you are.

00:05:01.807 --> 00:05:02.640
Get out of here.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.288
Nobody wants you.

00:05:04.288 --> 00:05:06.871
Nah, nah, nah, nah, planet man.

00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:11.035
Nah, nah, nah, nah, planet man.

00:05:11.035 --> 00:05:15.932
Slowly devouring the entire
space time continuum.

00:05:15.932 --> 00:05:19.508
No one can stop me I am giant Orange.

00:05:19.508 --> 00:05:21.008
I will devour all.

00:05:22.018 --> 00:05:24.388
I cannot be stopped.

00:05:24.388 --> 00:05:25.712
Unless you have a speed bump that's

00:05:25.712 --> 00:05:27.295
the size of Uranus.

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.146
I ate you, you tasted delicious.

00:05:34.914 --> 00:05:36.320
I am drunk with planet power.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.987
I will eat everyone.

00:05:39.391 --> 00:05:40.308
Oh no, get away from me.

00:05:40.308 --> 00:05:41.813
No, no, no.

00:05:41.813 --> 00:05:43.392
Aw, man.

00:05:43.392 --> 00:05:45.770
What a bunch of boo whoey.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.773
Well that was a pretty fun game.

00:05:46.773 --> 00:05:47.769
I really like it you guys.

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:48.872

Because it's so good.

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.306

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:07.770
- [Player 2] This games hard.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.734
- No it's not hard, it's a barrel of fun.
