00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:07.069
Hi, this is Ann Myrick, and today I'm going
to show you how to remove stains in your bathtub.

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:14.650
Really depending on the stain, you need- depending
on the stain, depends on the type of soap

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:22.140
or the type of chemical that you use, just
a normal dirty bathtub you can use the normal

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:31.380
commercial cleaner or a vinegar and water-base.
If you have a lot of rust, you want to use

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:40.100
something, a powder that really takes the
rust out. I'm going to demonstrate both. If

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.600
you have a really bad soiled bathtub, what
I would do is, I would spray it, and instead

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.460
of using my sponge to wipe it off, I would
take kind of the rough area of my sponge and

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.739
just go around, and just spread it but not
take it off, and I would leave it there, and

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.479
I might leave it there a whole 24 hour period,
just so it will get in and really eat away

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:14.880
at that stain, and then I would come back
and rinse the stain, and it usually just takes

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.909
it off perfectly. If it is rust, what I would
use is a powder that really takes away the

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:31.649
rust, and do the same thing. I would just
sprinkle the powder right on the rust area,

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:41.679
kind of rub it in, let it sit, and then come
back and flush it with water. If you have

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:48.590
bad water stains, you can use a vinegar-base,
vinegar and water, spray it on, let it sit

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.711
a little bit, come back, rinse it off. What
you really want to be sure in your bathtub,

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:59.759
to do, is you want to- any soap product is
going to be slippery if left on, so you want

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:07.539
to be sure that you come back with water and
really flush those areas where you put a soapy

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:15.980
base on the area, so you don't slip and fall
and so you'll be safe. This is Ann Myrick,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.560
and that's how to clean a bathtub.
