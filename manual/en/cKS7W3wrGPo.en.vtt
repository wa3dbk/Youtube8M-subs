00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.200
Hey guys! Welcome to LSU! This is Broussard Hall behind me.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.010
My name is Ashley and I will be giving you guys a tour, so you can follow me in.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.770
Hey Guys welcome to the Broussard front lobby and behind me there is a 24-hour front desk

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.630
that is always there for you, to help you
out.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.010
And right outside the front lobby there are
some really good lounge areas for you guys to

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.750
study or hang out in. And there is also behind me
there is a large conference room that

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.060
has really long tables

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.390
and that's really good for group work
and things like that.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.850
I know when I lived in this community,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.850
I really did do a lot of studying in these lounge areas and in the conference room.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.949
*Music Plays*

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.490
And also we have some really cool common spaces that I'm going to show you guys.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.650
*Music Plays*

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.650
*Music Plays*

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.990
And after a short walk down from the front desk and through these doors behind me is

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.640
where you find your vending machines and your free ice machines.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.820
Back here is also where you'll find your computer lab with a free printer.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.760
We just ask that you bring your own paper. And back here is also where you'll find your laundry

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.510
facilities.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.610
It's $1.25 to wash and $1.25 to
dry. But a cool thing is that you're

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.500
hooked up to this website called laundryalert.com

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.800
and it can text you or email you when your
laundry is finished. It can also show you if

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.380
there are any open washer and dryers for you to use.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.400

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.400

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.270
So welcome to a typical room in Broussard Hall.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.240
All of our students will get their own desk with a chair and their own bunkable beds.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.509
And you can decide to bunk them or leave them unbunked like they are in here right now.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.090
And

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.090
Each student will also get their own closets with a lot of dresser space inside.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.850
*Music Plays*

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.939
If you live in Broussard, you will have a hall bath.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.780
but that just means you will be sharing it with the other residents that live on

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.459
your floor.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.030
Another thing about Broussard is that you guys do have a vanity inside the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.099
room for you to use.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.120
We encourage our students to make these rooms feel like home. So definitely decorate

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.489
the walls, we just ask that you don't peel off the paint or puncture any of our walls.

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.230
A lot of students bring their own refrigerators and microwaves and coffee pots and things like

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.360
that. For more information you can check
out our Living on Campus handbook on our

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.060
website.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.780
Well I hope you guys enjoyed the tour. This is Broussard Hall and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.200
I hope you guys have a happy Move-In Day. Geaux Tigers!
