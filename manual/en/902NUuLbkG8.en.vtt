00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.140
Here I have my acrylic paints,
and I'm going to show you how

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.070
you can create different effects
on paper with acrylic.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.840
You can also use acrylic on
canvas, but here I'm going to

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.700
show you how you can paint
on watercolor paper.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.450
So, what happens when you paint
with acrylic and water,

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.470
it dilutes acrylic and makes
it look like water colors.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.700
So, if you are looking for a
water color effect, basically

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.110
you just have to take the
acrylic paint and dilute it

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.670
with water.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.210
And you don't want to use
a large amount of paint.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.460
So this is one example of just
creating different washes.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.000
Impasto is a technique where
you use a lot of expressive

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.270
marks, and you layer the
paint on, rather

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.130
than mix it with water.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.480
You can still dip your brush
every once into water, but

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.170
mainly it's about expressive
marks.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.850
Also, you could try and apply
your paint with a knife.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.615
So, this is more of
an Impasto look.

00:01:09.615 --> 00:01:13.250
And what's fun is that you can
really move around and scratch

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.720
the surface with your
painting knife.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.370
Now I would like to show you two
watercolor techniques, one

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.010
is called wet-on-wet, and
the other one is called

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.690
wet-on-dry.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.610
For wet-on-wet, you're basically
adding colors to one

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.170
another while they're wet.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.570
For the wet-on-dry, you're
applying a layer, allowing it

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.260
to dry, and then going over it
and adding another layer.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.610
So when you create the
wet-on-wet effect, it makes

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.580
your work look very
spontaneous.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.930
And it allows for a lot of
accidents and bleeding.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.480
And the wet-on-dry allows you
to layer, and make it look

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.130
more realistic and refined.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.770
So, I'm just going to show
you both techniques.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.240
Any time when you're working
with watercolor paper and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.780
watercolor, you can map out a
large area with a wet brush.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.950
And that allows the paint
to flow freely.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.790
And it also allows you to create
a nice, even surface.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.660
So, this will be
my wet-on-dry.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.450
So, I'm going to let this
section dry, and I'm going to

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.860
work with this section.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.410
I can start going in with other
colors, and these colors

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.640
will be bleeding in together.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.930
And you can see they create
these hairy edges that can be

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:42.850
really beautiful.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.460
And you go in with more
intense colors.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.300
And also depending on how this
is drying, if it's still

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.430
really wet, it might not bleed
as much as areas that are

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.900
already drying, but
are still damp.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.050
So this allows you for a
lot more spontaneity.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.760
While my area is drying in here,
I'm going to show you

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.490
also how you can create
washes with color ink.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.400
And you will see how similar ink
is to watercolor, but it's

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.320
a lot more intense.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.110
And it can give you a better
bleeding effect.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.870
There are two types of
ink that you can buy.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.610
There's water-based ink and
there's acrylic-based ink.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.840
They look pretty similar, but
acrylic based ink, which is

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.670
what I have right here, is a lot
thicker, and more intense.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.780
So, you're able they get
much brighter colors.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:51.160
You can get really, really
light, and transparent, just

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.140
as with watercolor.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.120
Or, you can go with much more
intense, darker colors.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.590
You can also create
very flat shapes.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.170
When I say flat, I mean
there won't be

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.520
variation in their hues.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.530
They will be one color.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.779
It won't vary from
dark to light.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:20.800
Here I have my quill, and I just
want to show you how you

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:27.430
can incorporate line drawing
into your color ink washes.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.370
You will see areas that
are still wet.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.600
When I go over them, it creates
a nice bleeding,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.610
puddling effect.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.370
So, you can really take
advantage of that.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.570
I can purposefully go into this
area in order to have

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.170
this more creative line,
and also add some

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.680
dark shapes into it.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.440
A big part of working with ink
is reacting to the medium, and

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.830
being spontaneous with it.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.850
Don't be afraid to
create accidents.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:04.380
Accidents--

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.220
whoops--

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.120
like this one.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.110
Accidents are not always a bad
thing, so you can use them to

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.330
your advantage and incorporate
them into your drawing.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.710
So, if this was an accident and
I didn't want this there,

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.680
I could somehow integrate it
into the piece, and make it an

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.050
intentional part
of the artwork.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.720
Now I think you can see
that my dry layer of

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.260
watercolor has dried.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.060
So, I'm going to go in
with another layer.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.860
The trick is to put
it over the areas

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.600
that are already dry.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.930
So what happens is that you
create this edge, and that

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:52.950
edge is something that
you can blend in, or

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.680
leave as a hard line.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.630
And then, the next step would
be to allow this to dry.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.650
And then go with another color,
and allow it dry, and

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.750
go over with another color.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.940
And basically, artists can have
hundreds of layers in

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.760
their watercolor drawings, and
that's what makes their

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.690
drawing really vibrant, and
have a lot of depth.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.710
And these areas don't
necessarily have to be big.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.750
They can be on much smaller
scale, such as individual

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.080
shapes or stones that you're
layering over and over again.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.890
The idea is to build up your
colors, and not to get too

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:33.750
dark right away.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.840
So if you start out with a
lighter undertone such as the

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.720
yellow, you can keep adding
other colors such as red, or

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.220
blue, or brown, and gradually
build them up to the image

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.470
that you like.
