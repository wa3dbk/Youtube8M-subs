00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.238
*  Coughing *

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:05.586
Einaty, does this thing work?

00:00:05.747 --> 00:00:07.002
I think so.

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.519
The light's on.

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:13.539
Hi everyone! Up here on the screen.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.904
We're very sorry that we're bothering you while you eat.

00:00:18.904 --> 00:00:22.098
Eat, eat, don't let us interupt you.

00:00:22.438 --> 00:00:26.001
Just don't forget to save us a little artichoke.

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.496
While we're here in the Yichud room.

00:00:30.732 --> 00:00:31.739
Doing...

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.912
Well, let's not talk about what we're doing.

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:35.707
We just wanted to tell you

00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:37.208
a little bit about whats going to happen this evening.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.858
You guys are probably confused,

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:41.896
and not sure what to expect.

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:45.806
After all we, come from totally different worlds:

00:00:45.995 --> 00:00:46.750
Canadians...

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:48.328
Kibutznikim...

00:00:48.388 --> 00:00:49.380
Datiim...

00:00:49.614 --> 00:00:50.773
Secular...

00:00:51.163 --> 00:00:52.423
Children...

00:00:52.957 --> 00:00:53.683
Elderly...

00:00:54.507 --> 00:00:56.842
But we promise you that it is a winning combination.

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.894
So now that we're done with the chuppah...

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.339
It was nice, eh?

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:02.594
It was amazing!

00:01:03.235 --> 00:01:05.768
...a little longer than I'm used to.

00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:07.725
But absolutely amazing.

00:01:07.903 --> 00:01:10.418
So what else are we going to do this evening?

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:13.088
Soon we will come out of the Yichud room,

00:01:13.226 --> 00:01:15.444
and we will begin dancing....

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.895
Chasidic dancing - obviously.

00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:18.602
Obviously.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.032
Separately: Men together, and women together.

00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:29.482
We'll dance until the next course.

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:31.901
We hope you came with energy.

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:34.506
So for the less religious among you

00:01:34.598 --> 00:01:37.026
Who don't know these dances from childhood:

00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:39.578
These dances are...circular...

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.918
Like folk dancing

00:01:41.113 --> 00:01:44.800
So even if you don't really know what you're doing

00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:48.658
Just go with it. Neither do we!

00:01:49.644 --> 00:01:51.024
The rhythm will change.

00:01:51.122 --> 00:01:52.371
Sometimes it's faster...

00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:53.998
...and sometimes it's slower.

00:01:54.115 --> 00:01:55.907
Ah, that's just because...

00:01:56.054 --> 00:01:58.868
...we're trying to catch our breath.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.953
In short: just go with it and have fun.

00:02:03.324 --> 00:02:04.828
After the next course

00:02:04.927 --> 00:02:06.631
there will be a few speeches and presentations

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:07.990
and after that

00:02:08.084 --> 00:02:09.464
we'll take away the mechitzot

00:02:09.558 --> 00:02:11.040
and take off our suits

00:02:11.168 --> 00:02:12.206
and we'll dance again

00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:13.372
and this time

00:02:13.475 --> 00:02:14.538
not in circles

00:02:14.972 --> 00:02:21.704
YALA BALAGAN

00:02:21.982 --> 00:02:23.708
Do you want to continue?

00:02:23.814 --> 00:02:25.898
yala balagan

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.566
Later, there will be delicious desserts

00:02:30.447 --> 00:02:32.214
and we will say sheva brachot again.

00:02:32.456 --> 00:02:34.098
Similar to under the chupah.

00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:36.958
There's just one more thing

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:38.115
that we wanted to talk to you about:

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.656
We know that...

00:02:40.872 --> 00:02:43.519
weddings are a great place to make a shidduch...

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.868
and we're hopeful...

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.513
...well, there are a few more people here left to set up.

00:02:54.953 --> 00:02:56.806
But, because of the complex crowd here

00:02:56.991 --> 00:02:59.476
we thought it pertinent to give you a few guidelines:

00:03:00.621 --> 00:03:03.653
Guideline 1: Women wearing hats...

00:03:03.752 --> 00:03:05.669
are not making a fashion statement.

00:03:05.773 --> 00:03:07.765
It just means they're married.

00:03:07.948 --> 00:03:10.422
So...you should probably watch out for their husbands.

00:03:12.453 --> 00:03:14.678
If a religious guy talks to you

00:03:14.781 --> 00:03:17.003
and he doesn't give you his hand:

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.888
It's not that your hair is messed up.

00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:21.778
...or that your makeup ran.

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:23.984
He might just be shomer negiah.

00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.926
So how can you tell the difference...

00:03:28.017 --> 00:03:30.044
between a religious woman and a secular woman?

00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:30.999
It's very simple:

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:33.502
Just remember "MAHAK".

00:03:33.517 --> 00:03:36.064
"MAHAK"?

00:03:36.197 --> 00:03:37.389
visible cleavage

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.607
length of the skirt

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.740
and visible tatoos.

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:43.700
How can you tell the difference

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.451
between a religious guy and a secular guy?

00:03:45.554 --> 00:03:47.224
That's even easier!

00:03:47.337 --> 00:03:49.484
Just look for his kippa.

00:03:51.007 --> 00:03:52.266
Ok Aaron,

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:54.866
Let's save some of their energy for the dancing.

00:03:54.952 --> 00:03:56.625
Bon Appetit!
