Boxing_-How-To-Slip-Punches-with-Kerry-Pharr

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:02.830
Kerry Pharr: OK, folks.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.140
The next thing weíre going to show you is
some defensive drills, how to slip a punch,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.650
how to parry a punch, how to block a bunch,
different techniques.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.929
So weíve got Brian in the stance.

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.910
Now the first punch that a boxer is generally
going to throw at you is going to be his jab.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.850
So heís going to stick the jab and if I just
tilt my head this way, this is called a slip.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.370
It slides right over my shoulder.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.199
Now how do I know thatís coming?

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.510
What I normally do is Iím watching a guyís
chest and Iím watching his shoulders.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.590
If he turns his shoulder this way, I know
that a hook is coming.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.420
Now he might feign something.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.440
Now I know I can watch by his shoulders and
tell what heís going to throw but anyway,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.730
heís going to throw a jab and Iím going
to slip.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.980
Iím just going to turn, basically turn this
shoulder, this way and bend.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.140
Thatís all Iím doing, just slipping that
punch.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.080
So thatís how you slip the left jab.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.080
Slip.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.800
Now I have my hands up, slip, and I will move
this hand as I slip to cover my face just

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.530
in case I donít get it.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.760
OK, then a puncher, if heís a right hand
fighter, heís going to throw a combination.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.890
Left jab, right hand, left hook, right hand.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.940
So it only stands to reason after he throws
the jab, heís going to throw the jab and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.940
I will slip that.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.251
The right hand is coming right behind us.

00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:24.390
So heís going to throw a jab, right hand.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.200
So I want to go slip here, slip outside.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.250
Slip here, slip outside.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.140
Another thing that I used to do when I was
a young man was boxing.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.810
Because I was so short, when he threw the
jab, I would slip.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.810
You see Iím slipping here.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.810
Iím over here.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.820
Then I would roll.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.770
I would roll and I would come back with my
hook.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.159
So Iím going to slip.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.850
Iím going to slip this shot here.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.130
Iím going to roll it inside and Iím going
to throw my hook.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.320
Slip and Iím going to roll inside and Iím
inside for the shot but slipping, slip, and

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.670
then the right hand comes.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.670
Iím slipping out here.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.670
All right.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.670
So thatís how you slip a punch.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.950
He might throw a right hand and I slip out
here but you basically got to have the head

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.030
ready to go and move the torso left to right.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.110
Now, I call this a pick.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.900
Itís really called the parry.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.490
This is how you parry a punch.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.980
Heís going to stick his left jab.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.520
Now when he sticks that left jab, if I do
not slip that jab, Iím going to get him full

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.970
in the face with that jab.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.640
If I donít slip it, heís going to hit me
right in the face.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.410
So Iíve either got to slip that jab or I
can parry that jab.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.510
Now stick the jab and the parry ñ move a
little closer to me, Brian.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.209
The parry just means that I push his ñ when
he sticks his left hand out there, I just

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.870
reach ever so slightly and push his left hand
off so that it doesnít hit me in the face.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.500
Now let me show you how not to parry.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.530
If he starts to jab and I reach here ñ come
on over and hook behind that Brian.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.530
Hook.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.530
No, no.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.130
Iím going to stick out there.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.739
Now hook off of that.

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.820
If I stick my hand out here, all he has to
do is hook.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.069
You do not want to reach out here with the
parry.

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.360
When you parry a punch, when he throws a jab,
you push the jab right here.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.460
OK, put a little weave on it.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.090
You push it just an inch or two over here
because what happens, anytime you reach out

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.130
here, the fighter can pull the hand short,
come around and hit you with the hook.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.770
We can just go over this.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.599
So you want to parry this hand here, bring
the right hand back here.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.080
So the same thing.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.230
If he throws the right hand, I can pick it
here.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.910
I can catch it here.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.440
I can also catch it here, here.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.180
Another way is I can even catch it with my
right hand.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.430
So thereís a lot of ways you can do it.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.129
Now, when he throws the right hand and if
I move this hand here, Iíve got to be careful

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.459
because heís going to come with the hook.

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.410
When he comes with the hook, what I want to
do is I can catch it here or I can ñ go ahead

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.459
ñ turn into the shot and then come out and
throw a right hand.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.430
I can catch the hook, turn my weight into
him, boom!

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.520
Catch it here.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.499
Do the same thing if he throws me a right
hand and go back here and turn and go with

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:29.499
it.

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:30.499
All right.

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:36.319
Now as heís moving, letís say that Brian
is moving to his left and all of a sudden

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:37.499
his opponent throws a right hand.

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:39.029
Come to the left.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:43.169
All he has to do is drop his hips and duck
underneath that punch.

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.789
Just duck underneath it and notice how he
did a very good professional move there.

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.560
Notice that when he ducks underneath my right
hand, heís going to pivot out so that heís

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.080
in a position to throw a right hand or left
hook.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.080
So here we go.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.080
Heís going to move to the left.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.569
I throw a right hand.

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:02.499
He goes underneath it and comes back with
the right hand.

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:03.499
Same thing.

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:07.660
If heís moving this way, all he has to do
is dip underneath and he can get his right

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.660
hand.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.660
Go again.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.660
See?

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.660
Just duck underneath.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.660
Duck underneath.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.860
Now come back in the way.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.060
Duck underneath.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.259
Duck underneath.

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.139
Now that is called bobbing and weaving.

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.089
So what you can do as you slip, you slip this
way.

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:27.160
You slip this way.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.699
If I slip to the right, Iím going outside
the jab.

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.319
If I slip to the left, Iím going outside
the right hand.

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:38.340
But I can also, once I slip ñ this is bobbing
and then I come around and Iím weaving.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.759
So slip and come on through, Brian.

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:46.150
Go ahead and slip yourself, like slip outside
my jab and then come on.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.449
Weíre going to talk about slip, roll, slip
and roll.

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.839
Slip and roll through.

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:55.270
Slip and roll through.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.599
Thatís kind of bobbing and weaving.

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:03.439
Bobbing is here, moving your head side to
side and then rolling.

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:08.639
Moving here, moving here, up and down.

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.119
[0:06:10] [Indiscernible]

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:13.689
Male Speaker: Brought it back [Phonetic].

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:14.940
Kerry Pharr: OK.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:22.809
One of the things that Muhammad Ali was so
great at was he was tall and Iím going to

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:32.119
have Brian throw a jab and he would ñ Muhammad
Ali would just kind of rock back.

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:37.729
As he would move his punch, he would rock
away from the punch and have the ability to

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:39.699
come right back and throw something.

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.849
If he throws a right hand, I can rock back.

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:44.759
But if I rock back, now watch.

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:48.509
Heís going to throw a right hand and Iím
going to rock back and not roll my shoulder

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.330
and he will hit me with that right hand.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.539
See?

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:58.020
Now what I want to do when I rock back, I
want to roll that shoulder so that Iím protecting

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.409
myself from that there.

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:08.089
So I can rock back from the jab, the right
hand, either one, and it puts you in the position.

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:13.619
You rock back and when you rock back ñ Diamond
Jim MacDonald, a fighter that I used to work

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:17.279
with who fought Michael Spinks for the light
heavyweight championship of the world was

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:19.169
fantastic at this.

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:20.679
He would stick his jab.

00:07:20.679 --> 00:07:21.839
He would rock back, boom!

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:23.870
Come on the top of the right hand.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:29.240
He knocked out a bunch of fighters with that
and had Michael Spinks hurt in the world championship

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.199
fight just by rocking back and throwing that
right hand.

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:32.289
