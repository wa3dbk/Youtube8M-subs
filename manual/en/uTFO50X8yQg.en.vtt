Welcome to Tuesday's Tips with SewVeryEasy,
my name is Laura.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.820
And today I want to talk about folding your fabric

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.680
to keep it stored until you have time to get to it.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.220
I just finished buying this fabric. It's from Northcott.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.700
It's called Enchanted. It's very pretty. I can't wait to start

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.220
it. However, I know I'm not going to be able to start this

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.280
project right away so I will need to store it.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.240
There's a couple of ways you can store it, but this is the

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.340
way I enjoy doing my fabric. I actually fold them so that

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.960
they're the same width all the way along and they will

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.980
actually sit on my shelf that way.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.720
I keep them all in the same package. This is  the fabric

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.460
I'm going to need for this one project. As a matter of

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.320
fact, in here I actually have the pattern so it's

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.100
all together.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.480
How do I get the bundle to look like this? It's really easy.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.540
You can do this with any size fabric

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.400
and it all takes one ruler. So you need to decide first of

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.160
all what size ruler are you going to use?

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.860
I like the long rulers. I like a 6" ruler because it actually

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.280
equals up properly in my shelf. You could use a 6½".

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.640
This is a 6"×24". I have my folded edge here and my cut

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.320
edge here. I'm just going to take the ruler and place it on

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.900
top of my fabric and I am going to just roll this fabric

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.460
with the ruler. Take the ruler out and fold it in half.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.400
So then I will do that to the next piece, and I will

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.440
continue to do that with all the pieces of fabric I have,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.160
even the long ones.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.580
I'm going to put it here, and if you just hold it here

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.620
as you start to turn right away, you only need to hold it

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.340
once, and then after that it's very easy. You're just going

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.540
to flip the ruler

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.200
and I come to the end.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.760
And I like to fold it where the edge is here so it just

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.700
keeps the edges tucked in. And I do this.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.520
Now I'm going to do that with all of this fabric

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.740
and then I will probably tie it together. I could tie it

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.340
together with a piece of ribbon, a shoelace, whatever

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.980
you can, and then I'll put the pattern in with this.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.880
So having it all bundled like this, it has a tendency for

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.460
me not to steal the fabric from this project to go with

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.960
another project, so when I do get to it I know that all the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.100
fabric is there.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.720
I even do the same thing with my backing fabrics

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.980
and even fabrics that don't go with other projects, just

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.520
because sometimes I find a fabric and I have to have it

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.860
and it doesn't go with anything but it'll go with my stash.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.000
Now these are three stacks of fabric here that I'm going

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.360
to have for backs. And it's a lot of fabric but as you can

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.340
see, I still use the same method and they will all fit on

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.860
my shelf. And by doing this you can actually see the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.000
colors at a glance. So even if you didn't want to do this

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.860
with all of your patterns that you're going to keep

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.840
together, I do this in my colors so I'll have a whole stack

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.080
of purples and I'll have the whole stack of reds and that

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.900
way I'm able to see at a glance what fabric I do have.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.100
It's just a different idea of storing your fabric.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.120
I like them because they fit perfectly all on my shelf.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.440
Just a thought.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.400
If you want to give it a try, let me know what you think.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.340
Thanks for joining me and I'll talk to you soon. Bye now.
