00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:04.714
(hip hop music)

00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:05.666
- [Voiceover] Hey guys.

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.965
Today we're making the
drunken Mother's Day bouquet.

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:10.705
- Exactamente. Let me tell you

00:00:10.705 --> 00:00:12.980
how we got to this point people.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.280
So we cut up all our fruit.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.525
Started with our pineapples.
Cha cha cha cha cha.

00:00:17.525 --> 00:00:20.085
Then took our cookie cutter,
cut out a flower shape,

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:21.455
soak that in booze.

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:22.593
- [Blonde girl] Was that Chinese?

00:00:22.593 --> 00:00:24.149
- That was English. What's
wrong with you girl?

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.240
- Cha cha cha cha cha.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.469
- Then we took our cantaloupe here,

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:29.071
scooped out little balls.

00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:30.371
Soak those in booze.

00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:31.207
- [Blonde girl] With this thingy.

00:00:31.207 --> 00:00:34.254
- Exactly, grab that
watermelon, cut out nice

00:00:34.254 --> 00:00:37.383
tulip shaped watermelons,
soak those in booze.

00:00:37.383 --> 00:00:39.845
Soaked our grapes in booze,
soak strawberries in booze,

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:43.188
cantaloupe and honey dew also in booze.

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:46.416
Then we constructed this
beautiful thing right here.

00:00:46.416 --> 00:00:48.134
All right, and you're
saying, how do we do that?

00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:50.990
We used skewers, sticking a piece on here,

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.242
sticking it in, sticking a piece on there,

00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:56.051
sticking it in, just filling
it out, keeping it nice.

00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:58.327
You just don't want a
bunch of holes and stuff.

00:00:58.327 --> 00:01:01.438
So make sure you fill in everything okay?

00:01:01.438 --> 00:01:04.550
And there you have it. Did I scare you?

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.664
- Yes, you actually did.

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:07.127
I even knew you were going to say that.

00:01:07.127 --> 00:01:07.638
(laughing)

00:01:07.638 --> 00:01:08.590
- And there you have it.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.449
- Son of a bitch (laughing).

00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:12.351
- The drunken Mother's Day bouquet.

00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:16.136
- (gasps) I just said very
bad like controversial phrase

00:01:16.136 --> 00:01:17.436
for the Mother's Day.

00:01:17.436 --> 00:01:18.063
- Son of a bitch?

00:01:18.063 --> 00:01:18.644
- Yes.

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:19.805
- Don't worry. My mama
don't watch my show.

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:21.755
She won't know.

00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:25.191
- Glued onto...(laughing).

00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:28.163
I'm sorry (laughing).

00:01:28.163 --> 00:01:28.813
- Here.

00:01:28.813 --> 00:01:30.625
- Okay guys. If you have attempt that

00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:34.363
don't attempt it at home.

00:01:34.363 --> 00:01:35.129
- Can you taste any booze?

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:36.731
- Yeah I actually do.

00:01:36.731 --> 00:01:38.380
It tastes even better.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.237
- It tastes better with booze right?

00:01:39.237 --> 00:01:40.955
- I said you were ruining the fruit

00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:45.955
but actually you filled it
up with so much goodness.

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:49.384
- The whole point of this is
to use a lot of flavored rums

00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:51.102
and flavored vodkas. You know?

00:01:51.102 --> 00:01:54.004
Anything with a fruit
flavor, you could add in.

00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:56.883
Which again amplifies
all the flavors in here.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:57.464
Good to go.

00:01:57.464 --> 00:01:58.300
- Mmmm.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.366
- You ready for brusher?
What else you want?

00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:01.156
Come on.

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:02.154
(fighting noises)

00:02:02.154 --> 00:02:03.385
- I got you. I got you.

00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:05.242
I could rip of your balls right there.

00:02:05.242 --> 00:02:06.496
- No you couldn't rip
off my balls right there.

00:02:06.496 --> 00:02:08.748
- Girls, always go for the crotch. Okay?

00:02:08.748 --> 00:02:10.397
(laughing)

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:13.462
I got you. I could totally grab them.

00:02:13.462 --> 00:02:17.106
No. I'm serious (yelling).

00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:18.413
What are you doing?

00:02:18.413 --> 00:02:19.830
- I was going for the body slam okay.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.664
Okay hold on. Message for your mother.

00:02:21.664 --> 00:02:22.895
Tell your mom something real quick.

00:02:22.895 --> 00:02:24.265
- Oh thank you.

00:02:24.265 --> 00:02:25.774
Thank you for this opportunity.

00:02:25.774 --> 00:02:26.835
Can I say it in Russian?

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:28.328
- Yeah, be quick though.

00:02:28.328 --> 00:02:29.837
You've got fifteen seconds. Go.

00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:32.205
- Okay. So my mom's name is Lily, okay?

00:02:32.205 --> 00:02:34.040
And she's like a flower.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.040
Mom (Russian Mother's Day message).

00:02:39.264 --> 00:02:40.959
(kissing noises)

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:41.904
- What'd that mean?

00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:43.676
Thank you for the can
that you sent (laughing).

00:02:43.676 --> 00:02:45.721
What did you say? I don't know.

00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:48.090
- Thank you for all the warm
thoughts you sent me here.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.783
No, I just said that my mom is the best

00:02:50.783 --> 00:02:52.919
and I appreciate her the way she is

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.452
and she brought me to this world

00:02:54.452 --> 00:02:55.799
and I will never pay her back.

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.122
- Happy Mother's Day, Mom.

00:02:57.122 --> 00:02:59.723
- From us, to you.

00:02:59.723 --> 00:03:01.116
- That was just overacting okay?

00:03:01.116 --> 00:03:01.905
- Okay. Let's do it again.

00:03:01.905 --> 00:03:02.602
- You suck as an actress.

00:03:02.602 --> 00:03:03.952
No we're not doing it again.

00:03:03.952 --> 00:03:04.707
- Please.

00:03:04.707 --> 00:03:06.085
- Because that performance sucked.

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.478
- Okay let's do it again.

00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:09.498
I can prove I'm not that bad.

00:03:09.498 --> 00:03:10.110
- Okay.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.667
- Okay.

00:03:10.667 --> 00:03:11.889
- Happy Mother's Day, Mom.

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:12.831
- From us to you.

00:03:12.831 --> 00:03:15.176
- It still sucked. It sucked again Mom.

00:03:15.176 --> 00:03:16.592
We'll be making, what's this drink?

00:03:16.592 --> 00:03:17.683
- [Blonde girl] Mango Mai Thai.

00:03:17.683 --> 00:03:18.821
- [Guy] Exactly.

00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:22.142
(squeeling and laughing)

00:03:22.142 --> 00:03:23.395
- Oh snap.

00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:24.788
(screaming)

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:26.878
- Would you stop screaming
you noisy bastard?

00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:29.084
- You're the bastard. You have no father.

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:31.092
- Ooh that was sexy. All right.
