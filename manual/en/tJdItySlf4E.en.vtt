00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:11.770
Aaron Task: While the politicians here in
Washington and the pundits across the country

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.450
are debating the state of the economy and
whether or not we need a second stimulus,

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.400
Texas Congressman Ron Paul is taking a contrarian
view, as he often does, about what the government

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.470
should and shouldn’t be doing for Americans.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.619
If you had won the presidency, and obviously
you ran for the presidency, what would you

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:27.900
be doing differently than what President Obama
has done,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.470
specifically with regard to how he’s handled
the economic crisis?

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.511
Ron Paul: I would have done a lot less.

00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:34.511
Aaron Task: A lot less?

00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:39.789
Ron Paul: I would have allowed the bankruptcies
to occur.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.269
We allow Lehman to go bankrupt so it helps
Goldman Sachs.

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.440
And then we bail out AIG that bails out Goldman
Sachs.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.780
The people that were overextended shouldn’t
be bailed out, debt should be liquidated.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.130
The sooner the debt is liquidated the better,
the faster the prices come down.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.280
To really understand the issue you need to
understand 1921.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.809
The recession, depression that came after
World War I one year along because we didn’t

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.790
believe in all this intervention.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.880
Hoover messed things up and Roosevelt compounded
it because they believed the government had

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.189
to prop up prices, especially price of labor.
It didn’t work.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.380
Aaron Task: If you had been President again,
what role would you give the Federal government

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.890
to help the estimated 16 million uninsured
Americans and the millions of American families

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.360
who are at risk of losing their homes right
now?

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.520
Ron Paul: Well, first you have to stop the
inflation and you have to deregulate,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.680
then you give tax credits to the people who
take care of themselves or to the doctors

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.710
who provide the care.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.560
And in a transition, and I talked about this
in the campaign, in a transition because we

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.899
have so many people so dependent on government,
say the elderly.

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.940
You know, my ideal society isn’t going to
arrive in a week or two. We’re in a four

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.420
year presidency.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.530
So my argument is that you can do that; you
can take care of people but never with a deficit,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.399
never by expanding the spending.

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.969
It would be by cutting spending and I would
cut money oversees. I’d cut hundreds and

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.189
hundreds of billions of dollars of this maintaining
our empire around the world.

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.200
Bring that money home, take care of the people
who are dependent and then work for the day

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.900
where we can trust freedom once again and
understand how free markets actually operate.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.099
Aaron Task: In the past you’ve lobbied that
the U.S. should be out of the U.N. entirely

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.170
and we should disengage.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.790
People look at that and say you want us to
disengage from the world. Isn’t the U.S.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.111
a force of good in the world?

00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:30.800
Ron Paul: No, I think it’s the opposite.
I want to really been engaged.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.300
These people who talk about free trade and
engagement around the world have given us

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.599
sanctions against Cuba for 40 years.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.040
So, I’m the one that wants to trade and
travel and deal with Cuba. And same way with

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.060
Iran. I want to be engaged.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.863
I would say move the navy away from there
and talk to them and say, “Look, let’s

00:02:49.863 --> 00:02:52.459
start off with a soccer game or something.”

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.879
Aaron Task: Right.

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.040
Ron Paul: Let’s break the ice, let’s talk
to people. Let’s not threaten.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.160
What we have in foreign policy is we have
two polices.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.659
One: we threaten and if they do our bidding
we give them a lot of money.

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.370
If they don’t we bomb them.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.769
And I say just talk to them and don’t threaten
them and this whole idea that North Korea

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.239
is a threat to the United States or the Iranians
are going to drop a bomb

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.610
is sort of like the argument that we had to
go into Iraq because Saddam Hussein was going

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.430
to bomb Washington DC.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.400
I mean it’s nothing more than war propaganda
to build up the military industrial complex.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.220
Aaron Task: Alright, turning back to the economy,
what is your sense of the state of the U.S.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.220
economy right now?

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.460
How optimistic or pessimistic are you?

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.090
Ron Paul: Very pessimistic. I think we might
be through a third of it and nobody knows

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.069
how long it will last.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:50.879
Correction is good. We want to correct problems.
But they won’t allow that correction.

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:51.879
The more we do to interfere with the correction
the longer it will last.

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.769
The Depression actually ended after World
War 2. The war did not end the Depression.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:04.720
I remember the war and we lived in very depressed
conditions … wage and price controls and

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.040
people didn’t have automobiles.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.959
It was very depressing. It took that long
to liquidate all the debt and bad investment.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.049
Finally then the people came back and they
got jobs and they weren’t in debt and we

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.390
went back to work again.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.140
The one good thing that is happening right
now is that people are starting to save money.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.591
The government is frantic, they say, “You
don’t want to save money, we want you to

00:04:24.591 --> 00:04:25.591
borrow more money and buy stuff.”

00:04:25.591 --> 00:04:26.591
Aaron Task: Right, government says we want
you to spend.

00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:27.591
Republican: The government wants you to borrow
more money and buy stuff.

00:04:27.591 --> 00:04:31.811
Well no, they don’t need to buy stuff, they
need to save money and pay down debt and then

00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:32.811
we’ll go back to work.

00:04:32.811 --> 00:04:33.811
And the faster that happens the better it
is for us.

00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:37.060
Aaron Task: Right, so obviously hindsight
is 20-20.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.780
But who do you blame, if anybody, for the
housing bubble, the boom and bust we just

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.780
went through?

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.550
Is it more the Fed, is it Wall Street, is
it the American home owners who bought more

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.971
houses than they could afford,

00:04:46.971 --> 00:04:50.500
or your Democratic colleague Barney Frank
who a lot of people say it was people like

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.840
him who pushed low-income housing and people
couldn’t afford it.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.200
Ron Paul: One person.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.200
Aaron Task: One person?

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.090
Ron Paul: Keynes. Keynes did it because he
came into vogue into the 1920s and the 1930s

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.390
and believe believed it

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.760
and they’ve been living by this and Nixon
put the rubber stamp on for all Republicans,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.300
“We’re all Keynesians now, we all have
been, we believe in deficit financing, printing

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.700
press money,” and that created the bubble.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.710
So it’s an intellectual fight. Keynes has
lost this and people are starting to recognize

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.410
that the system doesn’t work.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.960
So now the underground thought process right
now… the thinking goes now on the Internet

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.530
and elsewhere is Austrian economics. They
have the answers to our problems.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.620
Aaron Task: Right, but it seems that Keynes
is making a comeback, at least here in Washington

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.980
DC more recently.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.110
Ron Paul: That’s the last hurrah, it’s
not working, that’s like saying,

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.890
“Well we’ve had these two stimulus packages,
that’s all Keynes. We need one more.”

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.500
People are laughing at that.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.700
Aaron Task: What is your sense of the political
appetite right now for another stimulus package?

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.780
Do you think we’re going to see the Democrats
try?

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.240
Ron Paul: Yea, they will and it might get
passed and it might be passed and they’ll

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.410
probably wait till next month when the economy
has a few more bad statistics and unemployment’s

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.410
11%,

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.970
and they will frantically pass more money
and continue to do the things that created

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.050
the problem in the first place.
