00:00:10.307 --> 00:00:15.692
This event actually makes me more determined
to get into an industry,

00:00:15.692 --> 00:00:21.614
energy industry because I feel that it is really
a promising industry in the future.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.460
I'm Kaixi and my full name is Zhang Kaixi.
You can just call me Cathy.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.000
I'm from NTU.
Chemical engineering year four student.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Actually my hometown is back in China,
Hebei Province.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We're here to discuss and to hear from you.
You are the future.

00:00:43.845 --> 00:00:50.000
In my table we discuss more about the natural gas,
whether its a viable future energy or not.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.615
Our conclusion will be,
Yes it is a viable energy source

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:58.845
in the future especially in immediate future like
within 30 years or 50 years.

00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:01.923
When you go the plant in Qatar
and it's absolutely gigantic

00:01:01.923 --> 00:01:05.692
I think in one stage we have
65 thousand people building it.

00:01:05.692 --> 00:01:07.769
It was the biggest industrial site in the world.

00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:10.769
Neil Gilmour was really a brilliant guy.

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:18.307
Although he is a vice president, he is talking to us
as if we are really grown ups.

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:21.846
He told us how Shell supports
innovation within this company

00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:25.460
and within this energy industry
in the international scale.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.537
He is quite an inspirational guy actually.

00:01:29.692 --> 00:01:36.060
Diversity is really important both in the company
or in a more general way in your own life.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.576
Dr. Selda really makes an impact on me
in a sense that as a female

00:01:40.576 --> 00:01:44.384
and a female leader in this company.

00:01:44.384 --> 00:01:50.075
She appears here which shows that female
can also play a significant technical role.

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:56.061
It really inspired us as young female
potential engineers to go into this industry

00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:57.615
and to develop ourselves.

00:01:57.615 --> 00:02:03.375
And to make a better progress in the future.
It is really inspiring.
