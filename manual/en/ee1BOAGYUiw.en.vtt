00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.160
Scott: Hurricane track

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.260
forecasts have improved quite a bit over the years. I think that's largely due to

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.280
the fact that track is governed by the large scale winds. And larger scales

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.320
tend to be easier to predict. Storm intensity though is much

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.360
more complicated because it depends on a range of scales, all the way from

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.390
those same very large scales down to much smaller scales,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.450
say, the scale of individual rain bands, and some would even argue down to the

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.510
scale of individual raindrops.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.550
HS3 uses two of NASA's unmanned Global Hawk aircraft.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.590
These aircraft are capable at flying at high altitudes above the storm.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.630
A typical science flight would be about 26 hours,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.640
that means we can take off from the East Coast of the United States, fly all the way

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.650
out to the Cape Verde Islands off of Africa, fly around for about 4 to 6 hours,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.690
and then return.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.720
We're looking at the relative roles of the the environment through which

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.770
the storms move and then also what's happening in the interior of the storms, and

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.790
how those two interact to lead to storm intensification.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.840
And so we designed the payloads on the Global Hawks

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.860
to really tackle one or the other. So on one

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.890
Global Hawk that we call our Environmental Global Hawk, we have a set of three

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.900
instruments that take measurements of environmental temperature,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.940
relative humidity, pressure, and wind speed and wind direction.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.940
On the over-storm aircraft, we have a set of instruments

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.990
that are really geared toward precipitation and winds within the storm.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.000
The ideal

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.020
storm for us is a storm that comes off Africa, looks promising,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.060
has a nice interaction potentially with the Saharan Air Layer, moves

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.080
north of the Caribbean Islands and becomes a major hurricane, and then recurves

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.110
and moves northward in the Central Atlantic where

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.150
it's far away from land, but provides us with a good laboratory for getting

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.200
measurements and really understanding the significant storms, which are the major

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.210
hurricanes.
