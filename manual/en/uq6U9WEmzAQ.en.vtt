I am Joe Marshall with Expert Village.com
and today we are going to learn how to win

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.260
at poker. I wanted to cover a couple of strategies
that are easily forgotten but they are some

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.019
of the best ways to ensure a win. In draw
poker, the most common draw poker is Jacks

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:23.909
or better. That’s when you have a pair of
Jacks or better and you can only play or start

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:29.029
opening bet if you have that. For example,
if the first player that has been dealt to

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.600
has Jacks or better, he will actually open
the bet and place his bet. This is kind of

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.170
a bad situation for him as a strategy because
now he has to wait for everybody at the table

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.579
to go out and make their decisions and they
know since he opened the bet that he has at

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.339
least Jacks or better in his hand. So they
can bet heavy and try to force him out making

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.550
him think that they have three of a kind,
flush, full house or they would generally

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.550
may have that and try to force them out well.
So acting first and opening up in Jacks or

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.360
better is sometimes a bad situation to be
in. However, if you are the dealer you act

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.500
last. Everybody around the table has checked,
you know that they don’t have Jacks or better

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.670
to open the game and at that point if you
have Jacks or better, that is when your hand

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.130
becomes a really strong position to play in.
And you can start the bet and everybody else

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.450
is forced to fold or stay in and hope for
the best. And another common thing that people

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.670
do the best way mathematically to improve
their pair of Jacks or better is that they

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.640
discard three cards and let the dealer give
them three new cards. That is good but it

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.220
also tells everybody at the table that you
have a pair. A better way to do it is to only

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.799
discard two of the three cards keeping one
card as a kicker and that will kind of play

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.200
a little bit of psychology on the people at
the table making them think that you probably

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.500
have three of a kind and you are maybe trying
for a full house or something like that. So

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.929
these are all things you want to think about
when you are playing the game strategies and

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.170
little things like that positioning of where
you are sitting, that you can mess with the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.030
other players because it is the game of skill.
It’s also a game of psychology though. If

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.070
you are putting fear in somebody by placing
their bet and their money is on the line,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.000
they don’t want to lose it, the risk is
too high for them, they are going to full

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.640
and you are going to win what’s in the pot.
