00:00:00.617 --> 00:00:01.708
&gt;&gt;Welcome back.

00:00:01.708 --> 00:00:03.206
In this tutorial, I want to talk about how

00:00:03.206 --> 00:00:04.623
to create a two-dimensional drawing

00:00:04.623 --> 00:00:05.899
from your 3D part.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.757
I have a part opened here that we modeled

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:09.000
earlier in the class.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.322
What we want to be able to do

00:00:11.322 --> 00:00:12.760
is communicate on paper

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.222
what this part would look like

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:15.640
and so to do that we want to be able to

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.066
create a front view and a top view

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.598
and a side view drawing.

00:00:19.598 --> 00:00:21.397
We can get glimpses of what that'll

00:00:21.397 --> 00:00:22.524
look like by changing the view

00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:24.219
in the heads up display.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:26.007
So there's a top view

00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:27.667
and we look and there's a right view.

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:29.257
And then sometimes drawings include

00:00:31.707 --> 00:00:32.704
a three view.

00:00:32.704 --> 00:00:34.319
Now industries are really changing

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:35.839
to move away from drawings

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:37.661
and move more to 3D part models,

00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:38.962
so you would actually send this to

00:00:38.962 --> 00:00:40.563
the manufacture as a 3D model

00:00:40.563 --> 00:00:42.317
if you wanted them to build it.

00:00:42.317 --> 00:00:44.035
But at the same time, for record keeping

00:00:44.035 --> 00:00:46.055
purposes it's always
nice to have a drawing.

00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:48.017
So to create a drawing from a part,

00:00:48.017 --> 00:00:50.617
if you go to the new tab
and click on the down arrow.

00:00:51.237 --> 00:00:53.682
Click on make new drawing
from part or assembly.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.900
You're asked to choose what type

00:00:55.903 --> 00:00:57.200
of sheet format you'd like.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.313
We can talk more about this later,

00:00:58.313 --> 00:01:00.021
but for now we'll go ahead and choose

00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:01.576
A, which is just fine.

00:01:01.576 --> 00:01:03.922
And what that does is it puts

00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:05.548
a border on the sheet and a title

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:07.704
and different things like that.

00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:09.342
Next in the right view, you see

00:01:09.342 --> 00:01:10.597
this view palette.

00:01:10.597 --> 00:01:12.453
If you click on on one of the views

00:01:12.453 --> 00:01:13.836
like the front view and drag it

00:01:13.836 --> 00:01:16.190
in to the paper space.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.840
It will create a view for you.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.337
And then it continues
if you drag to the right

00:01:20.337 --> 00:01:22.031
it creates a right view and if you drag

00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:23.960
to the top it's going
to create a top view.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.281
And if you drag over kind of diagonal

00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:28.336
it creates an isometric view.

00:01:28.336 --> 00:01:29.833
You can see next to my mouse

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:31.898
that I have the right-click green arrow

00:01:31.898 --> 00:01:34.395
or green check in the right-click arrow,

00:01:34.395 --> 00:01:37.437
so if I right-click I
automatically exit out of that.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.180
These guys aren't laid out exactly

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.628
like I'd like, so I'm going to drag

00:01:40.628 --> 00:01:41.894
this view over and I do that by

00:01:41.894 --> 00:01:43.414
clicking in the view area,

00:01:43.414 --> 00:01:45.029
you can see the dashed blue line

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:47.571
and dragging, okay?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.811
And it turns out, actually, that this is

00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:51.217
using first angle projection.

00:01:51.217 --> 00:01:52.469
There's a difference between first

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:53.794
and third angle projection.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.034
And I'd like to change it
to third angle projection,

00:01:56.034 --> 00:01:58.252
which is the standard
in the United States.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.851
To do that, I right-click on this sheet

00:02:00.851 --> 00:02:03.615
in the property manager
and I go to properties.

00:02:03.615 --> 00:02:05.774
This shows me the sheet scale and

00:02:05.774 --> 00:02:07.632
a bunch of different
parameters that I can change

00:02:07.632 --> 00:02:09.338
and right up here in the top you can see

00:02:09.338 --> 00:02:10.872
the type of projection.

00:02:10.872 --> 00:02:12.716
If you click on the
third angle radio button,

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:14.666
it switches the views around.

00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:17.348
Now, this is a nice drawing but

00:02:17.348 --> 00:02:18.428
what I really want to do

00:02:18.428 --> 00:02:19.890
is I want to start dimensioning the part

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.432
and I can do that by clicking
on the annotation tab.

00:02:22.432 --> 00:02:25.613
And my smart dimension tool is here

00:02:25.613 --> 00:02:28.713
just like it was when I
was creating the part.

00:02:28.713 --> 00:02:32.183
And I can go ahead and
make a smart dimension.

00:02:32.183 --> 00:02:34.065
You'll notice,though, that that dimension,

00:02:34.065 --> 00:02:35.492
let me get it unselected,

00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:37.213
shows up as a light gray.

00:02:37.213 --> 00:02:38.652
This dimension is what's called a

00:02:38.652 --> 00:02:40.009
reference dimesion and it's not the

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:41.704
actual type of dimension we should

00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:43.820
be making most of the time.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.814
What we really want to use are the

00:02:45.814 --> 00:02:48.009
dimensions we use to creat the part,

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.094
and so we click on model items

00:02:51.094 --> 00:02:53.846
and then we can say source or destination

00:02:53.846 --> 00:02:56.810
and we choose the entire model.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.534
And under dimensions, we can
check marked for drawing.

00:03:00.534 --> 00:03:03.168
And we can check not marked for drawing,

00:03:03.168 --> 00:03:04.805
so this is going to
import all the dimensions

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:06.291
we put on the part.

00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:09.264
And lastly, I think we can choose,

00:03:09.264 --> 00:03:11.470
we'll just go ahead and click on check.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.931
And what this is going to do

00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:14.662
is it automatically dimensions the part

00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:16.228
based on the dimensions we originally

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:18.474
put into the part when it was created.

00:03:18.474 --> 00:03:19.885
You can click on dimensions and move

00:03:19.885 --> 00:03:20.989
them around,

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.540
as you like.

00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:26.363
You'll notice SolidWorks
2010 has a new feature.

00:03:26.363 --> 00:03:27.803
When you click on a dimension,

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.000
it opens up a context manager

00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:31.309
where you can edit the text

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:33.167
right in this spot.

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:36.332
So I can say TYP for typical here

00:03:36.332 --> 00:03:39.048
and that will make it known that this,

00:03:39.048 --> 00:03:40.143
if I zoom in,

00:03:40.143 --> 00:03:41.733
this is dimensioning the fill it

00:03:41.733 --> 00:03:43.544
right here and by adding TYP

00:03:43.544 --> 00:03:45.380
we know that that's typical

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.145
so where there's other
fill its we can do that.

00:03:47.145 --> 00:03:49.385
It's always a good practice to make

00:03:49.385 --> 00:03:51.381
sure that your dimensions
are off of a drawing,

00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:53.065
to move your views far enough apart

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:55.258
from each other that
they aren't overlapping

00:03:55.258 --> 00:03:56.722
the dimensions.

00:03:58.552 --> 00:03:59.774
Let me move this bottom one down

00:03:59.774 --> 00:04:01.121
you can see it kind of moves

00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:03.245
the other two views.

00:04:03.245 --> 00:04:04.359
And if I zoom in on this,

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.202
what's unique about these dimensions is

00:04:08.202 --> 00:04:09.910
you see that they're black.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.905
And what happens is that I can now modify

00:04:11.905 --> 00:04:13.844
my part by just double-clicking on a

00:04:13.844 --> 00:04:15.308
dimension right here.

00:04:15.308 --> 00:04:16.503
So say I want to make this three

00:04:16.503 --> 00:04:18.876
quarters of an inch instead,

00:04:18.876 --> 00:04:20.880
now everything goes great because

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.099
it needs to be rebuilt.

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.308
So if I click on my rebuild button,

00:04:24.308 --> 00:04:25.616
it's going to work on rebuilding

00:04:25.616 --> 00:04:28.684
that geometry with that
dimension at three quarters.

00:04:28.684 --> 00:04:30.925
And now if I go to my window,

00:04:30.925 --> 00:04:33.292
and go back over to example five,

00:04:33.292 --> 00:04:36.123
my geometry is changed here as well.

00:04:36.123 --> 00:04:38.537
So that's why you want to use dimensions

00:04:38.537 --> 00:04:40.720
that are black because by doing that,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.577
you can actually edit the part

00:04:42.577 --> 00:04:44.422
directly from the drawing.

00:04:44.422 --> 00:04:45.757
If you had a reference dimension,

00:04:45.757 --> 00:04:47.286
you wouldn't be able to do that.

00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:48.463
So to make a good drawing,

00:04:48.463 --> 00:04:50.018
make sure that you pull your dimensions

00:04:50.018 --> 00:04:51.319
far enough away.

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:52.956
Make sure they're all readable.

00:04:52.956 --> 00:04:54.255
So SolidWorks isn't super smart,

00:04:54.255 --> 00:04:56.624
you still have to go
in and edit dimensions.

00:04:56.624 --> 00:04:58.238
I like this angle dimension,
we should probably

00:04:58.238 --> 00:05:02.079
move out a little bit
so it's easier to read.

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:02.939
That's the gist of it.

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:03.696
When you're done you can

00:05:03.696 --> 00:05:05.618
go ahead and click on save

00:05:05.618 --> 00:05:10.074
and it will save all the
parts that you've done.

00:05:10.074 --> 00:05:12.575
And we'll save this as
an example five drawing,

00:05:12.575 --> 00:05:13.759
that'll be just fine.

00:05:16.929 --> 00:05:17.960
And you're good to go.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.761
You can also make a PDF by doing a

00:05:19.761 --> 00:05:22.059
save as and changing document type.

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:26.516
Right here, save as type

00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:28.852
if you click on that and go down to PDF

00:05:28.852 --> 00:05:30.754
it'll make a PDF drawing of your part

00:05:30.754 --> 00:05:33.692
that you can email to customers.

00:05:34.432 --> 00:05:36.257
That's it for today.

00:05:36.257 --> 00:05:37.223
Have fun!
