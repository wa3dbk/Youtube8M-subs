Hello. This is Michelle Phelan, nutritionist
at Blossom Bariatrics, where expertise meets

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.060
true compassion. We're always here for you
before, during, and after your weight loss

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.419
surgery procedure--because it's the after
that's the most important part. Today, we're

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.450
going to talk about protein and why it's so
darn important for bariatric surgery patients.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.090
Well, protein--for one--helps you feel full
longer. It stabilizes your blood sugar and

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.309
your insulin levels. It helps with tissue
repair, healing, and your immune system. It

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.460
also supplies your body with the essential
amino acids and minerals needed on a daily

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.149
basis. Folks, its protein, protein, protein!
Bariatric surgery patients have a harder time

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.480
getting in the daily required protein that
they need every day just from the foods alone

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.530
that they're able to eat. You should choose
a high-quality whey protein isolate protein

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.489
powder as a supplement to your daily protein
intake. Look for one that has less fillers

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.650
and preservatives in it. And also make sure
that the one you choose has limited artificial

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.470
sweeteners in it. Look for Stevia or Erythritol
as a sweetener. I get this question a lot.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.650
What the heck is whey protein? Well, whey
protein is made from milk, and there's two

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:29.070
proteins primarily in milk: casein and whey.
Whey protein is extracted from the component

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.640
of milk and then dried and then packaged--so
that it dissolves instantly in your beverage

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.070
of choice. But why Whey protein isolate? Well,
whey protein isolate is better absorbed and

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.770
metabolized by most bariatric patients. It's
a quick, easy way to get in your protein,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.570
because it's pretty hard to get in all your
daily proteins grams a day just from the foods

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.560
you're able to eat alone. So whey protein
can be used as a supplement to make sure that

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.910
you're getting your required 60 to 80 grams
of protein a day. The whey protein powders

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.250
of yesterday are no longer. Whey protein powders
have come a long way. Many are delicious and

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.250
creamy, and dissolve very easily in your beverage
of choice. Try almond milk, rice milk, coconut

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:21.060
milk--these typically are well absorbed by
patients as well and it keeps the protein really

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.340
creamy. Many of my patients also find that
if they utilize an unflavored whey protein

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.719
powder, it's a wonderful addition to their
Greek yogurt, to their soup, or to their cottage

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:40.489
cheese--to boost the protein content. Make

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.420
Until next time, have a happy and healthy
day!
