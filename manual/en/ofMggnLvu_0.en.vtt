00:00:05.036 --> 00:00:05.932
We're going to win today,

00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.231
we're going to win,

00:00:08.232 --> 00:00:09.246
the giant is back!

00:00:09.844 --> 00:00:11.450
Today is the day,
the score is 3-3,

00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:13.091
we're going to grow
when the time comes,

00:00:13.298 --> 00:00:14.944
you're going to see,
we'll grow!

00:00:19.624 --> 00:00:21.595
França, they said
you have a fever!

00:00:21.596 --> 00:00:23.833
I'm going to score today,
I'm going to score!

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.236
Step-over, Robinho!

00:03:02.053 --> 00:03:11.142
"We are the champions,
we are the champions!"

00:03:14.835 --> 00:03:16.273
The Blue Team players
have dengue!

00:03:16.274 --> 00:03:24.334
"Runners-up again!"

00:03:24.498 --> 00:03:29.757
The Blue Team is completely dead!

00:03:30.164 --> 00:03:30.982
I scored three goals!

00:03:30.983 --> 00:03:32.417
I could've scored even more!

00:03:32.418 --> 00:03:33.805
I could even ask for a song!

00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:35.634
Which one?

00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:37.972
"Tá Escrito," by Revelação!

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:39.464
As always...

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.824
we played much better
than they did,

00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:43.468
now...

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:45.541
You missed several passes,
you're hiding behind our victory.

00:03:45.542 --> 00:03:47.931
No, I did miss,
but I avoided several goals!

00:03:48.535 --> 00:03:49.585
Now, go there and film...

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:50.841
David Braz.

00:03:50.842 --> 00:03:51.689
David Braz...

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.922
- Victor Ferraz...
- Thiago Ribeiro, Victor Ferraz...

00:03:53.923 --> 00:03:55.835
- "Caveirinha!"
- Geuvânio!

00:03:55.998 --> 00:03:56.784
Go there!

00:03:56.785 --> 00:03:58.624
Who is going to win
the "Worst Player Trophy?"

00:03:59.208 --> 00:04:00.836
Ask Jubal how he is doing.

00:04:00.987 --> 00:04:03.760
Yes, ask Jubal! Jubal!

00:04:03.945 --> 00:04:05.808
I didn't score today,

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:07.970
I didn't play very well,

00:04:07.971 --> 00:04:09.690
but our victory is all that matters,
we surpassed them,

00:04:10.032 --> 00:04:11.460
the score is 4-3,
that's what really matters!

00:04:11.461 --> 00:04:12.819
Now they'll have to try
to keep up with us!

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.582
Why does the ball
hit the post all the time?

00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:16.341
So, dude,

00:04:16.342 --> 00:04:19.749
I'm always hitting the post,

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.586
but I think that...

00:04:21.683 --> 00:04:23.472
I'm going to score next week,
because...

00:04:23.588 --> 00:04:25.322
- I can't always hit the post!
- Oh, God...

00:04:25.323 --> 00:04:27.556
It's been a while
that I deserve to score!

00:04:27.946 --> 00:04:29.035
Jubal...

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.749
is hiding behind our victory,

00:04:31.063 --> 00:04:31.942
but he won.

00:04:32.691 --> 00:04:34.904
Since I've been playing for them,
we haven't lost,

00:04:34.905 --> 00:04:36.555
now let's focus on the next match...

00:04:36.556 --> 00:04:37.864
and, God willing,
we'll achieve another victory.

00:04:38.743 --> 00:04:41.445
Unfortunately,
Cicinho arrived late,

00:04:41.985 --> 00:04:43.680
he just got here,
take a look.

00:04:47.074 --> 00:04:48.822
The ball never got to me,
what could I have done?

00:04:50.304 --> 00:04:53.089
França and I formed the attack,
and the ball never got to us!

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:55.570
Heart attack!

00:04:56.014 --> 00:04:57.498
Step-over, Robinho!

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:59.146
Since I can't do that
using my feet,

00:04:59.147 --> 00:05:00.568
I had to do that using my hands!

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.986
We won't swap!

00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:04.294
We won't swap,
I don't care about them!

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:06.162
- We won't!
- We won't swap!

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:08.473
Who is going to play
for the Blue Team? I won't!

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:10.433
- Do you want to?
- No, hell no!

00:05:10.795 --> 00:05:11.961
I scored twice,

00:05:12.298 --> 00:05:13.907
I made two assists,

00:05:14.023 --> 00:05:15.271
and they're blaming me!

00:05:15.272 --> 00:05:16.455
- What was the score?
- Darling,

00:05:16.507 --> 00:05:17.973
they're blaming me!

00:05:18.137 --> 00:05:19.333
You are such bad players,

00:05:19.403 --> 00:05:21.573
that you were kicking
each other's backs!

00:05:22.886 --> 00:05:24.827
You were right below the post,
aren't you ashamed, Cicinho?

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:27.828
They were winning
by 7 goals already!

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:30.494
Do you call that being opportunist?

00:05:30.495 --> 00:05:32.319
You were right beside the post,
almost hugging it!

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.232
I fooled "Batata,"

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:35.668
I told him he could leave
and that I'd defend,

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:36.987
I was dying to score!

00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:39.922
We're going through
the same moment...

00:05:40.386 --> 00:05:41.387
you went through in the past.

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:43.706
It started right after Santos TV
started recording the matches!

00:05:43.707 --> 00:05:46.308
We used to tie,
we used to run...

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:47.190
When did you do that?

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.661
You guys used to mock us
all the time,

00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:51.721
Edinho used to cheat all the time...

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.461
- We were fooling around!
- What do you mean?

00:05:55.026 --> 00:05:56.338
We were kicking the ball
at one another!

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.888
To do the right thing
is what really matters.

00:05:58.212 --> 00:05:59.480
But they called it!

00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:01.664
- Wasn't there a fault?
- What?

00:06:01.665 --> 00:06:02.868
- Wasn't there a fault?
- Yes.

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:05.985
Was it the right decision to make?

00:06:06.208 --> 00:06:08.437
Because they called it!

00:06:08.438 --> 00:06:09.764
But I'm experienced, son,

00:06:09.765 --> 00:06:12.937
I know when they're lying
and when they're telling the truth.

00:06:12.938 --> 00:06:15.867
- How come?
- I can't tell my secret!

00:06:16.343 --> 00:06:19.813
We're going through
the same moment...

00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:20.853
you went through in the past,

00:06:21.778 --> 00:06:22.936
you better stop recording!

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.460
We're going through
the same thing...

00:06:26.505 --> 00:06:27.559
they went through.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.849
Do you know
what they are feeling?

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.033
That the ball is square!

00:06:31.635 --> 00:06:32.773
They must call upon Pelé,

00:06:32.774 --> 00:06:35.527
then they'll be able to win,
if the call upon the King.

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:36.729
Currently,

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.941
relying on França and Cicinho,
they'll never score.

00:06:38.942 --> 00:06:40.326
Yes, that's right.
