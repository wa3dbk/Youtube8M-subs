00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.670
the one percent of the manhattan are
allegedly using disabled people to cut

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.360
lines at disney world now this is
reported by the new york post

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.040
some part of me wants it to you with a
grain of salt although there have been

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.830
cases of rich people asking to bara
wheelchairs at the airports so they can

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.330
like bypass the security lines uh... but
in this case in your post is alleging

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.289
that yap wealthy moms will take their
kids to dot disneyworld for spring break

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.570
and they don't want to you with all
these unions and all of these peasants

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.039
they want to go through outlines in

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.770
and go ahead and take part right there
right in line

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.560
so set on uh... seldane

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.590
mean up to one hundred thirty dollars an
hour to the literally you

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.390
his the disabled person to get them past
lines

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.150
uh... i have such trouble and looking
for something else we talked about

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.940
earlier today

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.830
just

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.610
believe if you think that it's a really
participate hank

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.469
there are a number of people there are
quoted in a uh... although they go by

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.340
like when mom said so you know this was
a little shady but in the new york go

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.380
sometimes has a ring at the national
enquirer yes is definitely no lying dead

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.270
beside him one person close to one mom

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.349
for source

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:16.060
normally recalls that hired actually do
pray for their left column

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.960
so like new york post has no credibility
by the but still

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.759
i think one sify possibly it's
disgusting and the post are awesome one

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.890
mother says you can't go to disney
without eight toward concierge this is

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.060
how the one-percent does disney uh...

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.770
back to our concierge

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.530
by the way introduce you a tour comes
here and and also can to me just all get

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.350
out of one of the fact that the disabled
died

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.190
uh... was through a company called dream
two words

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.760
if i was a parent might thing wouldn't
be to have a child in a wheelchair but

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.979
not because i'm very controversial that
way

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.649
how do they call themselves

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:51.890
transplants

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.550
windows in the body of the people who
hire the disabled guides

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.239
they happen to have one dot there

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:03.529
uses a wheelchair she actually has an in
six years disabled so

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:07.869
but that's what they do they like renter
out to these wealthy families so they

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.189
can likes people minds and go straight
to whichever right they want episode

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:17.609
itself i wonder if they get access to a
lot and now i'm thinking about the story

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.889
like other drives

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:24.949
indistinguishable from the get hired by
the rich manhattan families i think it's

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:27.069
happened once

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.900
uh... and then get these huge tits yahoo
wealthy families are willing to pay

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.650
uh...

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.019
more than one thousand dollars for a
howard stern

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.729
