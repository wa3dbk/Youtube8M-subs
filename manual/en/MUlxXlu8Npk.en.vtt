00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.480
Jambo, that means hello and you'll definitely
want to know that if you're traveling to Africa.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.440
My name is Melissa Schenk on behalf of Expert
Village. Today we're going to talk about some

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.199
things you'll want to know before traveling
to Africa and also how to survive in the African

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:20.360
Wilderness. In this clip now let's talk about
food and water. Very important water, especially

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.280
if you're in the African Wilderness. Now,
a lot of the wilderness is not that far from

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.789
many of the towns and it is my suggestion
or recommendation if you can take bottled

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.699
water with you. Now bottled water is not as
easily accessible as you might think so, of

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.649
course it might not always be possible to
take. So you also may want to boil your water,

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:47.510
but a good thing to keep in mind to have with
you and to take with you would be iodine tablets.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.140
Because as I said bottled water isn't always
available in more of the remote places and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.180
you might not always be able to boil it as
well very easily. So if you ever taken these

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.410
before they don't taste very good, but they
definitely will keep your water safe for drinking.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.340
So iodine tablets a definite necessity to
take for safe drinking water. There is various

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.680
lakes and rivers around that you can boil
water but you do want to be safe. With the

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.220
regards of food in Africa there's a various
change in diet especially if you're from North

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.090
America for instance. In Africa you experience
a lot of beef, so if you're good at hunting

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.730
you can capture some of the animals if you
do so desire. But there's a lot of beef, a

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.230
lot of rice, a lot of matoke which is fried
bananas. So when you get into the plantation

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.180
you'll see a lot of predominately bananas
and pineapples. So you can really survive

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.430
off of a lot of fruit, but meat is one of
their staples, as I said beef a very large

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.890
staple and also rice as well. Other things
that they do eat in Africa, I've been to bug

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.000
eating ceremonies where they drum up bugs
from the ground and they literally catch bugs

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.560
and they eat them as well. So if that's something
you might want to experience, well you might

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.710
want to try it. Also don't forget about fishing,
look at these children here they're using

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.610
a simple stick and a string, a good old fashion
way of fishing and some people even try to

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.350
catch fish in the various methods you can
see here using certain types of nets. So you

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.980
can be creative if you can make something
yourself there you can try to do that as well,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.750
it is challenging at time but you can try
your hand at that but just be careful you

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.750
want to make sure it's cooked very, very well
because of course anything especially the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.090
fish does come from the water and you don't
want to get anything like Malaria.
