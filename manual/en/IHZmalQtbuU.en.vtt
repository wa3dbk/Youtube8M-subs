00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.120
When the weather turns cold and the roads
get treacherous having an all-wheel drive

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.350
vehicle, appropriate tires and some winter
driving acumen can make white-knuckle conditions

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.350
much safer.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:28.390
So this is a good week to have the all-new
2014 BMW X5 with their take on 4-wheel traction

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.170
called xDrive.X5It'd be fair to say it was
frigid and snowy this week.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.480
Subzero temps and over a foot of powder from
2 separate storms kept my driving in high-alert,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.230
full winter mode.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.420
For the first time, BMW offers this 3rd gen
X5 in a rear drive model.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.200
Luckily that's not the one I'm testing.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.910
This here is the xDrive35i -- in BMW parlance
that means it's equipped with all-wheel drive

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.879
and a 300-horse 3.0-liter turbocharged inline
6.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:10.729
Far reaching changes were not in BMW's plans
with this X5, so though it is 2" longer, the

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.799
remainder of its measurements remains virtually
unchanged including its wheelbase.

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.659
Ditto on the mechanical side where the same
motor and 8-speed automatic carry over.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.480
But in their pursuit of EfficientDynamics,
BMW was able to squeeze out another 2mpg in

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.020
combined driving, now rated at 18mpg city/27mpg
highway.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.030
Weight is down by about 170 pounds, there's
an ECO PRO driving mode which conserves energy

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.509
and regenerative brakes provide an electrical
boost for the Auto Start/Stop system, which

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.630
curiously never triggered during my test week,
perhaps due to the demand I placed on the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.750
electrical system to keep everyone warm.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.119
The optional Cold Weather package kept my
backside toasty, but the heated steering wheel

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.100
took the week off -- bad timing.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.599
Aerodynamic improvements also aid in the fuel
saving cause.

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:16.080
It's also a little quicker now, able to reach
60mph from a standstill in a speedy 6.2-seconds

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.529
-- and does it all with the utmost refinement
and precision.

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:27.109
Most BMWs are shopped for now by the type
of line you desire and this one is the Luxury

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:28.109
line.

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.819
xLine and M Sport lines are also available.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.159
The Luxury is distinguished by a number of
subtle exterior trim bits as well as these

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.040
19" V-spoke wheels and a sport steering wheel.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.379
Base price of this specific model is $57,725.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:52.989
And of course mine has a multitude of options
from BMW's extensive list, including the extra

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.319
charge Mineral White Metallic paint, the super
bright and gorgeous full LED lighting with

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:06.900
auto high beams, variable ratio active steering,
and safety nets such as a surround view camera,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.269
head up display, blind spot detection, lane
departure warning, pedestrian and collision

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.139
warning and adaptive cruise control with a
Stop and Go feature.

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:23.510
4-zone climate control with adjustable comfort
rear seats round out the major add-ons.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.499
MSRP as tested then is a pause-worthy $70,975.

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:36.919
I had the xDrive working overtime this week
-- a full time all-wheel drive system with

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:43.339
power biased to the rear until the front axle
needs to take on more of the duty, up to 100%.

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:49.079
xDrive has been tweaked this year to be lighter
and more efficient and when equipped with

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:55.849
the Dynamic Handling Package -- not optioned
on my tester- takes 4-wheel control even further

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.310
by adding torque vectoring across the rear
axle.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.059
Hill decent control is here and modulates
the vehicle at low speeds leaving you to simply

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:06.079
steer.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:12.349
Remember, finding traction is only part of
the driving on slippery roads equation.

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.919
Being able to stop the vehicle is equally,
if not more, important.

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.990
And though if I owned it, true snow tires
would be fitted, as is with its all-seasons,

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.590
the X5 feels stable and in control.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:33.140
These Goodyear Eagle LS-2 run flats didn't
do the X5 any favors, so as is, I wouldn't

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.310
grade xDrive any greater than or less than
competing systems.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.500
And the front wipers were not up to real winter
weather conditions.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.129
My X5 complaints stem mainly around the seats
-- too firm without enough thigh support or

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:54.189
side bolstering in the front and placed too
low in the rear forcing kids into a cave-like

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.840
place and leaving adults to stare into the
front headrests.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.099
A 3rd row is a $1,700 option and comes bundled
with air suspension.

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:09.039
I also have a case of sticker shock with this
X5 -- not because it doesn't impress in the

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.219
way it drives because it does, but simply
because there are a number of competitors

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:23.949
that offer truer SUV capabilities wrapped
in similar luxury for far less.
