00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.129
 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.440
when you create a hypothesis what is it
around

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.779
Iowa state lecturer Pete Evans is used
to addressing a class full of students

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.570
they're just not normally in middle
school but Evans and his team are taking

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.650
their show on the road to get kids
around the state excited about

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.839
industrial design

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.710
we want the students that may not have
access to these

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.480
tools to have access so we're 
coming to

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.170
rural communities areas that might not
otherwise have this type of exposure

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.300
and showing them these tools

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.270
 may look more like games to some of
these students they get to experiment with

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.530
3d printers small electronics

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.950
and even virtual reality systems in may
seem like a game

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.070
but you need to start to see how it
operates

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.700
and what it feels like and that means
that these Clarion middle school

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.270
students are getting hands-on experience
with these technologies as well

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.820
 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.050
 we want to provide young
students

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.500
when they're very impressionable the
opportunity to see

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.780
tools that are continuing to develop and
integrate those into their ways of

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.729
thinking about solving problems where
input and output and different motors

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.380
and lights and stuff and how you power those

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.920
it's fun and the students are often very
quick learner

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.810
the students have been really excited
and enthusiastic about

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.200
this type of learning they're already
 fluid with these technologies

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.130
I get really excited when they pick it
up really quickly there there are a few

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.110
kids were you have to sit down there

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.340
and coach them through it
but then there's some that just they

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.440
understand it right away

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.700
 bringing these students

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.360
out of the classroom and getting them
excited about science and technology has

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.550
been a win-win for everyone involved we
love bringing it out to them as a

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.149
field trip they love leaving their
classroom those types of experiences are

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.740
really important for students to get out
of the classroom

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.539
to have the students walk away enthused
about an experience like this

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.619
about stem about design

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.010
is fantastic for Iowa State news
service

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.600
