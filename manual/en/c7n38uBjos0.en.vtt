00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.250
The next brand we are going to talk about
for you ladies is a very well known fashion

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.139
designer that I’m sure you have heard of,
Christian Dior. Christian Dior loves to advertise

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.759
their name on their frames, kind of very in
your face type of approach to designing the

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.540
frame styles. A little bit of a larger frame
but very contemporary so let’s take a look

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.189
at what they have to offer. I’m going to
focus on this one over here, you can kind

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.220
of get an idea of how they are advertising
their frame with the big Dior on the side

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.440
over here. But check it out, you’ve got
some brushed metal on the side here, with

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.091
the bone finish in the back, brushed finish
on the front, very fashion forward, you’re

00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:47.260
not going to see a whole lot of stuff like
this, very, very nice design on that particular

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.750
model. Next thing, this black one, may just
look like a basic black with the shadow metal

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.850
front that I have been talking about but you’ve
got a little accent with a little jewel pieces

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.110
on the side here, just to kind of give it
a little flair without going too over the

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:13.780
top. This one is also a very well designed
frame in my opinion, it’s got a lot of different

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.310
color, kind of adds to me a little class to
the frame, a little accent rather than making

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.190
it very boring. Dark tortoise on the front
which is kind of a fairly standard industry

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.119
color, you know this dark tortoise but again
I like how they have done the design of the

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.950
temple, a little bit of ivory, gold and even
a little bit of copper on there. This brand

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:48.490
is for somebody who is probably going to be
a little bit on the cutting edge of the frame,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.320
frame line, wanting to try something that
is going to be name brand but a little bit

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.920
more bold, a little bit fashion forward, so
if that’s you and you want to kind of push

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.399
the limit with a name brand frame Christian
Dior is probably a good place to start.
