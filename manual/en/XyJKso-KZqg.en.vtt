00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:13.875
Hello everbody! I'm Isa Sari.

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:16.075
In this video, I'm going to review the Emax SimonK

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.400
series 12A ESC for 250 sized quadcopters.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.520
To be honest, it will be a unboxing video

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.260
rather than a review

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.950
I ordered 5 ESCs (1 is for just in case).

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.414
Let's take one of them.

00:00:25.953 --> 00:00:28.773
As you know, these ESCs are designed for

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.400
220, 230 and 250 sized RC quadcopters.

00:00:34.078 --> 00:00:36.078
Let's have a look to the box.

00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:38.549
Obviously, it's not a box, it's just a package.

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:41.122
It's transparent and you can see what's inside.

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:43.550
There is the barcode on the back side of the package.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.400
We'll now measure the sizes of the package.

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.066
Here's our ruler.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.480
First, the height of the package.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.580
It's about...

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.380
16.5 cm.

00:00:55.247 --> 00:00:56.927
A bit longer than 16.5 cm.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.040
The width is exactly 11 cm.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.040
As you can see, these are "small" products

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.920
that means its transporting won't be a problem

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.800
and you won't struggle with customs etc.

00:01:09.288 --> 00:01:11.048
Let's open the package and

00:01:11.048 --> 00:01:12.778
look closer to the content.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.100
First, I would like to have a look at the manual.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.340
It looks like as a detailed manual.

00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:26.496
The package is very tough.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.920
This is the manual.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.180
There is a big table on it.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.640
On this table, you can find the parameters

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.200
related to the other ESC models of Emax

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.600
that can be bought on the web.

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:42.945
There is a variety starting from 6A

00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:44.465
to 80A as you can see.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.640
I'm unboxing the 12A one.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.140
The current draw is 12A.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.740
And this is continuous.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.260
Now the ESC will be examined.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.653
I'm going to show you the Emax 12A ESC at close range

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.990
It's on my hand now.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.640
A black protection case used

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.487
on the ESC's electronic circuitry.

00:02:06.487 --> 00:02:08.041
You can see some specifications on it.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.960
There are 3 black cables on the left.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.820
You can shorten them as you wish.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.140
There are 2 cables and a servo connection on the right.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.280
Like shortening, you can also make extensions to these cables.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.524
But you have to be careful if you would like to do this.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.540
There is the Emax logo

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.720
and the Simon (SimonK) writing

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.600
as well as 12A sign.

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:36.093
These ESCs have SimonK firmware by default.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.019
But BLheli firmware can be installed by using

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:41.201
an appropriate tool if you need.

00:02:41.201 --> 00:02:43.338
Some prefer SimonK, some prefer BLheli.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.600
Let's weigh the ESC.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.520
The weight with the cables is

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.560
exactly 11 grams.

00:02:50.115 --> 00:02:52.355
Some people say its 8, 9 or 10 grams

00:02:52.355 --> 00:02:55.072
as they write on the internet, but it's 11 grams.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.000
As I mentioned before, these ESCs can be

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.445
used on 220, 230 and 250 sized quadcopters

00:03:01.445 --> 00:03:04.130
but they are mostly used on 250 sized ones.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.100
This is all I can say about Emax SimonK

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.780
series 12A ESC. Goodbye!
