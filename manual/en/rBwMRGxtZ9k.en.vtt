00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:07.280
People opposing separate cycling infrastructure
often argue that separate cycle paths are dangerous

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.069
when it comes to crossing other traffic
on junctions.

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:12.500
In the Netherlands this is not true.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.810
It has the safest streets in the world.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.000
Even though it also has
the highest number of vulnerable cyclists.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.419
So what is different about Dutch junctions?

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.299
When we look at junction design
this becomes clear.

00:00:26.299 --> 00:00:31.019
A typical junction without any cycle
provisions will look like this.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.700
The most hazardous action for any traffic
is to make a left turn.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.690
A car will turn left like this

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.280
but the cyclist will have to cross
two lanes of traffic first,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.820
traffic that approaches from behind

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.490
so looking over the shoulder is necessary.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.120
This is a particularly dangerous thing to do.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.110
In left-driving countries this is the case 
for right turns.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.830
And we can see how unclear and dangerous
the situation on this junction in London becomes

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:05.320
When just two cyclists make
such a turn.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.229
Hoping to make junctions safer,
some countries started to paint cycle lanes on them.

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.030
Examples can be found in Denmark,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.030
in Germany,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.330
And recently on London's "cycle superhighways".

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.100
But does this really make a junction safer?

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.530
The cyclist still has to share the road
and has a conflict with right-turning cars.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.490
The left-turning cyclist is then expected to
wait in a corner of the junction

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.170
until it is clear of motorized traffic.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.010
The waiting area is not shielded in any way.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.270
Making this waiting potential dangerous.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.220
Cyclists can only continue the turn

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.640
when the lights have changed to green
for the other direction.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.799
Thus creating an extra conflict

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.909
with cars that turn right from that other direction.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.860
This is not the solution the Dutch prefer.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.720
A typical junction in the
Netherlands looks like this.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.829
Note that the separate cycle paths also
exist on the junction itself.

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.539
This gives the cyclist

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:18.480
a protected waiting area for crossing
the path of motorized traffic

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.729
and also a completely free right turn.

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:27.009
The waiting area for the cyclist is very advanced.

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:34.009
So always in good view of turning cars.

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:46.879
Cyclists have their own traffic light
that has a different green cycle from right turning cars.

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.609
This eliminates that conflict.

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:54.489
Usually the green light is combined with
the green cycle for left turning cars.

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.259
So the cyclist can make the 
full left turn all at once.

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:04.479
If cyclists do have to wait
they are shielded from motorized traffic

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:12.479
by the traffic islands 
in every corner of the junction.

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.599
It is provisions like these, that make
cycling in the Netherlands safer 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.739
than anywhere else in the world.
