Hi! This is going to be a really short video but I wanted to do it anyways. And I want

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.480
to try this japanese candy.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.849
Is a really traditional candy. It's called konpeito. And if you're interested in the culture you may have

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.649
seem it in different, animes, films, etc.

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:22.110
They appear a lot in Studio Ghibli films. It's a sugar-based 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.180
candy, really traditional.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.550
It's been made since the fifteenth century or so in Japan. Or that was the 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.500
time when in was introduced.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.390
And I'm going to show you a close-up of the candy and then I'll try it.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.160
This is the top of the candy and you can open it on 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.930
both sides.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.360
As you can see it's on this capsule.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.570
And here you can see a close-up.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.570
It comes in different colors, all of them really pretty. And it has a this unique shape. With 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.350
a lot of small bumps.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.060
And that must be the way that they make them.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.150
There isn't much else to talk about so let's try it.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.530
As you saw the candy is pretty simple. But really cute. It doesn't have an smell

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.890
so let me try it.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.250
It basically tastes like sugar, really simple. But it has a small fruit hint

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.310
really nice.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.670
And I don't know if that's just me or what but I noticed it.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.799
Is really good and I liked it a lot. So nothing elso to say abut this candy

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.990
I wanted to try it in a video because I want you to see traditional candies too.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.869
And besides this candy always caught my attention because I saw it in different films

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.310
overall in Studio Ghibli films.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.979
And I don't know it got my attention so I wanted to try it. Tell me in the comments

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.810
what do you think about this candy or if you have tried it.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.939
And that's it, I got this from a suscription service called Freedom

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.009
Japanese Market. So as always you have the link in the description. And that's

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.009
everything.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.009
Thank you very much for watching this video and see you on the next one, bye!

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:24.269
Hi! Today I'm here with another CandyTime and as you had read on the title

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.870
I'm going to try this thing here.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.829
I don't know what the japanese name is but basically it's a juice stick.

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.299
In this case it's apple flavor.

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:42.709
And well you can drink it directly from the stick or you can put it on the freezer and make

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.389
like a popsicle.

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:49.579
I don't know how you call it where you live but well.

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.309
 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:55.680
But well. I show you a close-up of the packaging and then I'll try it.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.209
Here you can see the packaging and it's pretty cute.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:07.209
There's this apple here and that's it. In the back there are instructions and here it says 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:10.829
how to open it.

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.400
So let me take it out.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.400
And this is basically our juice. It reminds me of those popsicles

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.010
that you can cut i half.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.669
So I'm going to try it.

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.359
As you saw this is or juice so I'm going to try and open it.

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:39.180
Supposedly you should be able to open it by twisting the top part but as I'm

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.069
really clumsy I'm going to use my scissors.

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.329
Well after droping half of the bottle on my I finally opened it.

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:55.329
So I'm going to try it now, I think I cand directly drink it from here, so.

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.260
 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.049
It's weird.

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.329
I doesn't have a strong apple flavor, it's not bad. Maybe a bit

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:12.389
sweet and I don't usually drink juice like this so I can't compare it with anything 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:13.540
that I've tried.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.530
But I think it will be way better frozen.

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.310
Even so it's not bad and it's a nice option to drink it when walking or something like that. So 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.230
in general I think it's fine I don't know. It's not impressive or anything.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.220
And well, tell me in the comments what do you think about this. I'll have to finish it

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.620
'cause I can't leave it here so.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.440
I got this product from a suscription box service called Freedom Japanese Market

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.010
I'll leave it on the description box as always.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.510
And tell me in the comments if you would like to try it or if you tried something like this before.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.510
And what is your favorite popsicle flavor mine are strawberry.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.250
So yeah tell me

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.400
about your favorite flavor.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.400
That's it. Thank you very much for watching this video and see you on the next one, bye!
