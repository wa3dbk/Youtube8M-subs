00:00:01.061 --> 00:00:03.809
(Anthony) Does Iron Man 
have, like, metal pubes?

00:00:03.974 --> 00:00:05.452
(Ian) SHUT UP!

00:00:06.436 --> 00:00:09.594
Stay tuned for more pointless 
sex scenes in Game of Thrones

00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:11.299
after this commercial break.

00:00:11.317 --> 00:00:14.990
- Dang it!
- Yeah, we only saw her side boob so far.

00:00:16.543 --> 00:00:19.158
Oh my god! 
New Superman?!

00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:24.185
The last Superman reboot sucked ass,
 but it still made a sh-t ton of money!

00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:27.754
And now we've got a Superman 
for the NEW generation.

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:30.900
Starring Macklemore as Superman!

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.350
Walk up to Lois, like 
"What up? I got a big c-ck!"

00:00:33.393 --> 00:00:35.625
Feelin' hella weak 
from that kryponite rock.

00:00:36.064 --> 00:00:36.963
(gasps)

00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:39.150
(groans)

00:00:39.186 --> 00:00:40.789
Oops! We spoiled the ending.

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:42.048
Aaah, f-ck it!

00:00:42.094 --> 00:00:46.259
That's not in the lore!
Superman never rapped in the comics!

00:00:46.363 --> 00:00:48.557
(together) F-CK YOU, STAN LEE!

00:00:48.987 --> 00:00:54.346
From the writer of 12 Years a Slave,
 we bring you a new take on Batman...

00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.547
Oh my god!
You hear that? A new Batman!

00:00:58.061 --> 00:00:59.758
Batman is back...

00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:01.660
and he's black!

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.601
THE REALLY REALLY DARK KNIGHT.

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:07.378
That doesn't make sense!
Batman was never--

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:09.008
And you'd better not complain 
that Batman is black,

00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:10.388
'cause that makes you racist.

00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:12.656
Ooh. Nevermind.

00:01:12.857 --> 00:01:15.924
- Do you like Star Wars?
- Yes!

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.479
- Do you want more Star Wars?
- Yes!

00:01:19.593 --> 00:01:23.154
Coming this summer from
 the creator of Pretty Little Liars,

00:01:23.298 --> 00:01:26.280
Star Wars Episode VII!

00:01:26.558 --> 00:01:28.822
(wind whistles)

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:30.025
Yeah!

00:01:30.164 --> 00:01:32.659
Starring Panic at the Disco's cutest member,

00:01:32.718 --> 00:01:36.226
Brendon Urie, as Luke Skywalker.

00:01:36.498 --> 00:01:40.648
I chimed in, "Haven't
you wookies ever heard of

00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:43.518
using the goddamn force, no!"

00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:44.822
That doesn't make any sense!

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.710
Luke never sang in any 
of the movies or the comics

00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:50.301
or the games or the erotic fan fiction!

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.246
F-CK YOU, STAN LEE!

00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:57.061
Disney really ran out of ideas 
and is already rebooting Frozen.

00:01:57.143 --> 00:01:58.789
Is that the one about the snow man?

00:01:58.972 --> 00:02:03.338
From the writer of the worldwide
 bestseller Fifty Shades of Grey

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:06.827
Let me go!

00:02:07.263 --> 00:02:10.253
Can't live down here anymore!

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:12.950
I'm not sure how I feel about this.

00:02:13.062 --> 00:02:14.920
I hope she gets freaky with the snow man.

00:02:15.393 --> 00:02:16.745
F-ck you, Stan Lee?

00:02:17.396 --> 00:02:20.630
Radioactive spider bites
 Spiderman right on the dick!

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:21.627
F-ck!

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:23.269
Another Transformers movie!

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.259
You!

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:25.815
Twister, the game, the movie!

00:02:25.864 --> 00:02:26.661
Stan?!

00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:28.721
Steve Buscemi as Harry Potter!

00:02:28.763 --> 00:02:29.576
Lee!!

00:02:29.604 --> 00:02:32.110
Wait, I just realized that 
Stan Lee had nothing to do

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.084
with almost all these movies.

00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:37.342
Oh. Well, he still ruined The Hulk!

00:02:37.384 --> 00:02:39.381
Yeah! F-ck you, Stan Lee!

00:02:39.528 --> 00:02:42.615
From executive producer Michael Bay...

00:02:42.768 --> 00:02:47.992
Yep, Michael Bay, the genius 
who ruined Transformers four times...

00:02:48.292 --> 00:02:51.990
comes Teenage Mutant
 Ninja Turtles: The Reboot...

00:02:52.454 --> 00:02:53.530
by Michael Bay!

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.889
- F-ck you, Stan--
- What?

00:02:57.098 --> 00:02:59.240
Michael Bay is actually 
making this movie for real?

00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:01.296
This isn't part of the joke?

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:05.604
Thanks for f-cking up 
our childhood, Michael Bay.

00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:09.982
This video was brought to you
 by The Save Our Childhood

00:03:09.992 --> 00:03:11.594
From Michael Bay Foundation.

00:03:12.082 --> 00:03:14.366
Please, f-cking stop.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.026

00:03:21.973 --> 00:03:25.837
(screaming)

00:03:25.893 --> 00:03:28.122
So when I was doing this
scene, my ball popped out.

00:03:28.122 --> 00:03:30.462
Oh, and don't forget 
to check out Teleporting Fat Guy.

00:03:30.488 --> 00:03:33.456
He's back for a new season

00:03:33.458 --> 00:03:34.883
He's frickin' awesome.

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:38.635
Just gives me another chance 
to make a great first impression.

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:41.024
