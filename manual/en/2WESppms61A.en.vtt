00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.360
Naval Academy

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.680
Greetings, fellow Captains!

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.070
In previous episodes,

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.390
we told you about battleships and cruisers;

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.920
today we’ll talk about aircraft carriers.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.850
The emergence of this type of vessel sparked fundamental changes in naval warfare.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.330
The first aircraft carriers were little more than bases for reconnaissance aircraft.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.170
Because aviation technology was so primitive,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.170
carrier-borne aircraft had not yet been developed into a separate class,

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.780
and these ships had limited attack capabilities.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.090
However, progress was inevitable,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.770
and early multi-wing aircraft soon evolved into easy-to-handle

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.910
and reliable biplanes and then robust monoplanes

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.760
capable of carrying heavy torpedoes and bombs.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.180
At the same time,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.870
carrier-borne fighters were designed to hunt the enemy’s strike aircraft.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.890
The United States and Japan were the first to see the true advantages of naval aviation.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.690
Along with the United Kingdom,

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.080
these nations operated the most numerous

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.600
and advanced carrier fleets in World War II.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.640
U.S and Japanese aircraft carriers differed,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.320
both in terms of their mobility and secondary armament.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.850
However, their key difference in the game is the performance of the aircraft

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.700
and the composition of air groups.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.980
Each aircraft carrier has several squadrons,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.230
capable of achieving various missions.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.080
For most carriers, torpedo bombers constitute the main anti-ship force.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.850
Their torpedoes can destroy thick-skinned and slow targets,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.340
such as enemy battleships and aircraft carriers.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.860
Dive bombers are more effective against light-ships and destroyers,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.180
as the HE bombs that they drop can inflict heavy damage and cause fires.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.370
Meanwhile, carrier-borne fighters contest air superiority;

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.540
their firepower against other aircraft often exceeds that of ships’ anti-aircraft guns.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.370
In addition, all squadrons can be used for reconnaissance.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.990
You can adjust the composition of the aviation on board your ship;

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.800
by emphasizing one or another aircraft type,

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.400
you can change the carrier's style of play and your role in the team.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.230
All in all, the great range of missions and the diversity of capabilities

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.410
make aircraft carrier gameplay unique.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.950
The first US aircraft carrier was USS Langley a converted collier.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.520
She opens up the US carrier branch in World of Warships.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.540
The ship carries only two squadrons,

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.070
making her a relatively easy introduction to the carrier class.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.730
Langley’s two squadrons give the player the chance to practice

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.730
and perfect the skill of aircraft management.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.120
All carriers that follow her in the branch feature increasingly better armor,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.570
speed, secondary armament, and anti-aircraft systems.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.950
But, most importantly, the number of squadrons increases,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.750
the planes are faster and more durable,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.780
and their armament, including torpedoes and bombs, increases in power.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.650
At Tiers V, VI, and VII, a player can get light and escort aircraft carriers Bogue,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.820
Independence, and Ranger.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.330
These ships will help you to master different game tactics:

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.770
each can carry three types of planes, opening up more options to the player.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.790
Tiers VIII and IX are heavy aircraft carriers Lexington and Essex.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.770
Compared to their predecessors, these ships have substantial armor,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.570
relatively strong secondary armament, and, naturally, significantly better aircraft.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.420
At the top of the US tech tree you will find the aircraft carrier Midway.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.390
When built, she was the world’s largest carrier

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.390
and even carried jet fighters on board.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.330
American fighters are worth a separate mention.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.680
Having more planes in their squadrons,

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.160
US aircraft carriers can dominate the air,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.950
often allowing them to defeat their Japanese counterparts.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.690
Nevertheless, Japanese carriers have something to offer in return.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.770
Japanese carriers encourage a user to play more aggressively.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.840
Japanese air groups are smaller, but there are more of them.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.070
The key power of these carriers consists in airborne torpedoes;

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.310
few ships can avoid hits when attacked by several squadrons at once.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.580
The Japanese aircraft carrier branch begins with Hōshō (literally “Phoenix in Flight”).

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.490
Unlike her American counterpart, Hōshō was purpose-built as an aircraft carrier,

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.250
which puts her ahead of Langley in most characteristics.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.850
However, her small hangar capacity does not forgive mistakes

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.210
and you will feel the loss every time one of your planes goes down.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.380
The next aircraft carrier, Zuihō (“Lucky Phoenix”),

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.180
was converted from a submarine tender.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.800
Larger and faster than her predecessor, Zuihō can carry more planes

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.000
and offers more tactical capabilities.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.320
At Tiers VI and VII, Ryūjō (“Prancing Dragon”)

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.080
and Sōryū (“Blue Dragon”) embody the legendary Japanese “dragons”

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.420
featuring powerful attack air groups and better protection.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.880
They enable a player to tackle multiple tactical tasks,

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.980
from conducting reconnaissance to delivering heavy blows on enemy ships.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.480
Shōkaku and Taihō (“Soaring Crane” and “Great Phoenix”)

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.750
are Tiers VIII and IX aircraft carriers.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.350
Not limited by international treaties,

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.480
they demonstrate the might of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.700
With thick armor, high speed, and large air groups,

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.120
these ships are every bit on par with their enemies at these tiers.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.770
Heavy aircraft carrier Hakuryu (“White Dragon”) crowns the Japanese carrier branch.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.400
This warship was drafted, but never actually built.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.630
The very quantity of her air groups will make enemies nervous:

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.730
the carrier can operate eight squadrons at a time,

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.260
so escaping her strikes is quite a challenge.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.570
In our next episode, we will talk about the true masters of avoiding enemy attacks.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.270
Get ready for a review of the most reckless

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.960
and fierce warriors in World of Warships—the destroyers.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.560
