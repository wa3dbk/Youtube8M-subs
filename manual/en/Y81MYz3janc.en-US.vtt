00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.030
Easy Microwave Cheesecakes, for Dukan diet.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.049
Ingredients:

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.939
2 cups / 500 grams fat free quark or fromage frais

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:16.480
2 tablespoons

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.839
of corn starch

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.619
3 large eggs

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.810
Sweetener 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.710
A pinch of salt

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.770
and some flaworing of your choice, like banana flaworing (it's optional)

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.240
Let's combine all the ingredients

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.630
in a large bowl.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.780
2 heaped tablespoons of corn starch

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.920
3 large eggs, 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.920
whipped

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.180
and fat free quark / fromage frais

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.220
(if you can't find fat free quark, 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.200
use 18 oz fat free

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.200
cream cheese instead)

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.620
These cheesecakes are very easy to make.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.750
Just blend everything together until

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.660
you get a smooth batter.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.950
Like this, and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.730
that's all. Now, add a pinch of salt,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.930
and sweetener to taste

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.850
I'm using 4 teaspoons of liquid sweetener, 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.300
but it's up to you. We wan't the batter to be sweet, 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.170
but not sickly sweet, ok?

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.979
When choosing a sweetener for this recipe

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.870
choose one wich is safe for baking, 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.490
Don't use Aspartame, for example

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.389
because is not suitable for baking,

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:19.389
and besides it tastes really bad when cooked at high temperatures.

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:27.659
So, read the label on the bottle or package

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.859
to be sure it says it is suitable 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.029
for cooking and baking at home.

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:39.669
As I told you before, you just have to mix the ingredients

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:40.789
and the batter is ready

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:45.609
to pour into a

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.189
nonstick silicone mold,

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.259
one you can use for bakin in a microwave oven

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:54.969
like this one here.

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:56.369
Using this muffin mold 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:57.719
I'll get 6 cheesecakes,

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.119
 portion size. 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:03.259
Pour the cheesecake batter

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:05.819
carefully 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.819
into the silicone mold

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:15.309
and then we transfer the mold the batter

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:16.849
to the microwave

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.909
and bake on high (1000 wats)

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.719
 for 7 to 12 minutes.

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:32.719
I'm going to show you a batch that is

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:35.519
allready done. 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.850
Look at them, 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.269
here we have

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.199
six cheesecakes baked to perfection, 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:45.919
with a nice golden colour. 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.219
They come out the mold 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:48.799
nice and easy.

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.109
They taste better when chilled.

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.229
And they are moist, kind of juicy,

00:03:56.229 --> 00:04:00.909
with a thin crust

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.559
on the surface. If you don't want them to

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:06.209
get a crust, cover the mold

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.439
 with kitchen plastic cling film 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.199
before baking. Or you can just turn the 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:14.079
cheesecakes upside down when serving.

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.419
And that's all, folks

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:16.359
Enjoy!
