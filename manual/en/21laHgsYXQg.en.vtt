00:00:02.756 --> 00:00:10.181
Ã„lmhultsbladet checks out the world
premiere of a brand new METOD

00:00:12.522 --> 00:00:19.439
Good morning and welcome!
I'm thrilled to see so many of you here.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:28.121
Why are we at IKEA launching
a new kitchen range?

00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:36.997
We do it because life in the kitchen
has changed from just cooking.

00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:43.507
Today we use it for so much more, such as
doing homework, socialising and eating.

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:49.010
The kitchen has become the hub of the home, and
that's why we've developed a new kitchens system.

00:00:49.603 --> 00:00:57.386
We cannot do the things we want to do and stretch
its expression as much as we need today.

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.772
So we made a new system that really gives us a possibility
to create something more modern and traditional.

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:07.470
What's the difference between the kitchen
we have today, FAKTUM and the new METOD?

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:13.880
The biggest difference is flexibility, that
METOD can be built basically any way you want.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.776
This really means that the only thing
setting the limits is your imagination.

00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:21.773
There are greater storage
possibilities with the new system.

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:27.870
Additionally, there are improvements on the inside of
the kitchen and we have also improved the lighting.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.157
How many combinations does
the new kitchen offer?

00:01:37.314 --> 00:01:45.624
They are infinite! We started looking at it, but realized
that we think in a different way than our customers will.

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:48.229
They will do what they want and need.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.126
That's the great thing, that you can find a kitchen
and realize that you may want it slightly different.

00:01:55.577 --> 00:01:58.449
It really is possible to
adapt it to your needs.

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.660
Which is your favourite
combination in the new kitchen?

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.834
There are many, but what I find genius is the
possibility to have boxes inside the drawers,

00:02:09.977 --> 00:02:15.015
so that you don't have to show how
you've organised your kitchen.

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:20.070
You have a calm, nice expression on the outside,
which is extremely functional on the inside.

00:02:20.318 --> 00:02:26.356
If you're a traditional customer or a very
modern one, who wants big spaces or something,

00:02:26.465 --> 00:02:29.523
you can still have a super
organised interior.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.784
We know that 70 percent of our customers want a kitchen
where they can spend time with their family and friends,

00:02:51.548 --> 00:02:57.820
do homework, cook together or sit and just look into
what's happening tonight or what to do tomorrow.

00:02:58.054 --> 00:03:00.165
It becomes a central hub of the home.

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:06.994
After having talked to our customers we know
that they need solutions that work for them.

00:03:07.198 --> 00:03:09.944
Who am I and how do I want to
live and be in my kitchen?

00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:16.352
This is one of the big focus areas when we
have developed our new kitchen system, METOD.

00:03:16.743 --> 00:03:18.833
When will the new kitchen
be launched in Sweden?

00:03:18.988 --> 00:03:22.707
On June 3 in all our stores.

00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:25.688
Which is your favourite
combination in the new kitchen?

00:03:26.524 --> 00:03:30.944
I don't know about combination, but what I
like a lot and that I have some problems with

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.836
in my own FAKTUM kitchen is being able to make maximum
use of the drawers, and we have great solutions here

00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:39.784
that I really look forward
to having in my own home.
