00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.060
In this clip, we're going to be talking about
what to do when you don't have a real Hammond

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.330
on stage with you. A lot of times, you just
don't have the size or the stage or the capability

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.309
to have a real organ there. But, you want
that sound. So, we're going to talk about

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.040
a couple ways you can get that. The first
option is to just play a keyboard with an

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.320
organ patch on it. Typically, you'll have
three or four different organ sounds. And,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.800
now that you've seen some of the ways you
can get different sounds off that. You can

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.030
start to see what kinds of draw bar settings
they're going to be emulating. But, the problem

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.670
with that is you typically you can't change
those draw bar settings. You just, it's taken

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.770
this patch or takes the next one. So, that's
not recommended. If you really want it to

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.109
sound like a Hammond on stage, that's not
the best way to go. The other way is to take

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:51.670
is to play what they call a Hammond simulator
or a tone wheel simulator. Basically, an organ

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.999
simulator. And, it's another type of keyboard.
This type is called a Nord Electro. There

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:04.960
are a ton of different brands out there and
different types of generators. But, this they

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.500
all basically do the same thing. They're all
going to have some sort of basic draw bar

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.370
simulator. Which in this case, its pushing
buttons down instead of moving the draw bars

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:27.070
them. But, you can see
you get the same effect. It's even got the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:38.390
percussion, so you can put that on there.
You can hear that, there's even the vibrato

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.130
simulating those same kinds of things. You
can even split this up, so you know you can

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.360
simulate having two different keyboards and
you have different settings for those. So,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.980
you know you can split that. You, also the
important thing. Arguably, the most important

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.230
thing is the Leslie simulator. So, you've
got to have something that simulates that

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:06.730
speaker spinning.
