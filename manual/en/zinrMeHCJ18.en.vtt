00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.850
Now we've already gone over a few steps to
our choreographed fight. We have a cross punch,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.230
we've also got a nice contact stomach kick,
we got a slap in there. Now what we're going

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.660
to do is, we're going to learn about uppercuts.
So if we find our proper distance. Now for

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.260
the uppercut it's going to be a little bit
different than our cross punch set up. So

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.560
what we want to do is, we want to make sure
that, I've just kicked her. We've got the

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.980
kick in the stomach. Now you'll notice she
backed up after that, it gave her something

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.800
to do. So now we want to set ourselves up.
She's going to come around and she sees wherever

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.630
she is. Now you'll notice I moved my legs
as well to set myself up to be hit. Here she

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:56.550
goes. Up. Alright, now you'll notice with
this that as she comes up. Where is her. Where

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.250
is your illusionary target. Your illusionary
target, she wants to hit me right here, right

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.630
smack dab in the chin. Now where as her actual
target is right about here, which is about

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.570
three to six inches away from my face. So
if you watch as she comes up, it's right,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.900
see how much space I've got. I could do a
little jig in here and not get hit. I'm good.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.900
Now what she's doing when she comes up to
make the sound of impact is called a slip

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.280
Knapp. What she's doing is, she's coming up
with her fist, here she goes, slapping her

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.500
hands and closing her fist again. So she starts
off with her fist so that when she queue's

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.750
the audience can see this nice strong fist
coming in, and then once she's hidden behind

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.990
my body she can open her hand up to create
the sound and then close her fist up again

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.270
as she comes back up through. Now you want
to make sure when you're punching that you

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.020
hold this up here for a while because the
audience doesn't know what to look at so if

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.450
you take it away too fast they're going to
be like "what just happened, what just happened."

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.530
"I don't know." So you want to give them a
second to notice that, Oh her fist just came

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.570
up and slapped her square in the chin. So
she comes up through, and so that looks nice.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:25.810
So if we go around this way, we're actually
going to be, now we're right here. What do

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:34.630
you think? Yeah, we're doing a little good.
And you'll also notice how she torques her

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.900
body. Now she sets herself up to give a nice
big queue. This is very important. You have

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.160
to have this queue so that I know what to
react to. So she gives her nice queue with

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.810
a step back, comes up through, and you'll
notice how this leg has torqued inward, and

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.230
that is how we create the perfect uppercut.
Well, not perfect but a work in progress.
