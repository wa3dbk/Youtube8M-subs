[Daily Acts] [male speaker] Sometimes when I'm walking down the street,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm not necessarily looking out and seeing all these water-wasting lawns

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and people that aren't as connected to their neighbors and their lives as they could be.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm walking down the street looking, going, "Edible oases, rainwater-fed landscape"

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and just looking at the possibility of these sort of landscapes

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
[Trathen Heckman - Founder, Daily Acts] up and down the streets of neighborhoods

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and communities all across this world.

[Goal - save water, grow food, build community]

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Small actions do ripple and they add up and they have a cumulative impact.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And so when you're building upon your small, mindful actions,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
you have the confidence and the ability to take on something a little bit greater.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
[♪♪]

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This in the context of where we're at as a planet 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
with climate change and these really big issues

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and people that are more disconnected and less skilled than ever,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
it becomes even more amazing and powerful how much of a solution this is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to design these ecological gardens and to come together with shared vision and shared voice.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
There's never been a time where your choices have mattered more.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
[♪♪]

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Doing something as simple as us transforming a landscape

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
creates a model that anybody can look at far and wide,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and you're sharing food and connecting and building skills together

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
in your own neighborhood.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It's a richer way to live in normal times,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
but in the new normal of climate change and erratic weather and economic upheaval,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
it becomes essential.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Whether it's me, you, Gandhi, Che, MLK, Willy Wonka,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
whoever past, present, or future, the power of our daily actions is all that we have.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And like Archimedes said, "Give me a place to stand 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
"and a lever long enough and I'll move the world."

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And that's what those simple actions do. They move the world every day.
