00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.410
In this video, we are going to show you how
to easily lay a Decal.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.830
You will need masking tape, tape measure,
an Xacto knife or needle, our Vinyl Magic

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.260
Application Fluid and a squeegee.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.289
Step 1 Start with a freshly cleaned surface.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.300
Hold the decal up to the window to determine
your placement, then place a few pieces of

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.460
tape on the decal, holding it to the window.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.280
Step 2 After measuring to see if itâ€™s in
the middle and perfectly straight, place tape

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.570
all the way across the top of the decal, half
on the decal, and half on the window.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.900
This will act as a hinge, holding your decal
in place as you start to attach it to the

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.250
surface.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.190
Step 3 Peel back a few inches of the backing
paper.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.930
While holding the decal and backing paper
away from the surface, spray the surface generously

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.350
with the Vinyl Magic Application fluid.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.770
Be careful not to get any on the backing paper
because this can make it stick to the decal.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.720
Step 4 While holding the bottom of the decal
straight and tight, take your squeegee and

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.359
start sliding it firmly across.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:12.600
Always start in the top center and work your
way down and out to the sides, pushing out

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.350
any air pockets.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.869
Step 5 Once you have applied that section,
remove more of the backing paper and repeat

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.689
the previous step.

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.200
Holding the decal tight while you squeegee
will help prevent air bubbles from appearing

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.310
underneath.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.499
Step 6 Once the entire decal is applied, spray
it with the Vinyl Magic Application Fluid

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:36.039
to help release the protective mask.

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.310
Start at the corner, andslowly peel it down
and off.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.829
Step 7 You can use the tip of a sharp knife
to pop any small air bubbles.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.590
Simply rub your finger over the bubble to
push the air out.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.409
As always, if you have any questions, please
let us know!

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:52.439
Thanks for watching!
