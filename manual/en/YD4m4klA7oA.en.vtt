00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.410
The story started about two years ago.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.480
When I was feeling

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.650
more than my age.
And I'm 66 years old.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.800
I probably felt about 75.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.820
I got a lot of grand kids and an awesome
husband that's younger than me.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.980
And I was in a size 16 clothes.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.070
I wasn't feeling good about myself.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.100
So I decided I wanted to do something about it.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.250
And we started in MonaVie and 
I started drinking the product.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.320
And it really helped my energy level and
 felt 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.490
a lot better about myself.
Then they came out with the 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.620
RVL product and I had lost about 30 pounds.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.650
Before that just by counting calories, 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.670
watching everything I eat and it was really, really

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.750
it was difficult and time consuming.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.920
I started getting physically fit, 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.060
and I started taking RVL and two meals

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.110
a day and I thought that it was really

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.290
simple and I started exercising.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.390
I am now a certified personal trainer, 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.410
I am a certified yoga teacher, 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.570
I lift weights. It is so neat because I can

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.660
run on the beach with my son, 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.840
with his son and myself. We're
three generations.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.980
And we run together.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.020
I can keep up, and I can outdo my
grandchildren

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.040
sometimes and there are times when I'm at

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.140
the weight I want to be, that I don't always
do RVL.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
But it seems like when we vacation and go
on trips, 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.300
I may have picked up a few pounds. And I'm like, 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.370
I get on those scales and say 
 "This isn't going to work."

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.550
So I drink my RVL a couple meals a day.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.670
Use my bars, and I 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.700
drop my 5 pounds.
Because of MonaVie and RVL

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.880
I am down 70 pounds.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.980
I was a size 16 and now I am a size 4.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.160
I am 66 years old. I feel like I'm 45

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.300
It's kickstarted my life. It's amazing.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.340
What it's done for me.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.604
