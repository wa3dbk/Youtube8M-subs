00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.870
Corn / Pellet Stove or Fireplace Venting Demonstration:
Part 2

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.180
If you’re going to be doing a vertical installation
and going up through the roof and doing that

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.770
on the outside of the house, there’s actually
two different ways that you can do it. The

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.840
first way that we’ll go over it is, you
again take the three inch pipe adapter and

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.439
hook that onto the back of your appliance
and secure that with a clamp. Hook on your

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:40.690
three inch diameter pipe, go out through the
wall using the wall thimble.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.219
And once you get to the outside of the house,
you would install what’s called a three

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.230
inch to four inch clean out tee. And you want
to make sure you have your clean out tee so

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.879
that you’re able to take the cap off and
clean your venting out as you go vertically.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.410
Otherwise you would have to take your whole
venting system apart. But you would attach

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:08.840
this on to the venting and then you would
go up from there through the roof and terminate.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.140
Now if you wanted to start off with four inch
diameter venting right away off the back of

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.720
the unit, you would use a three to four inch
pipe adapter. And so you would go onto the

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.720
back of the stove put your clamp on, then
what you would do is you would hook this directly

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:40.760
onto your four inch pipe. And then using a
four inch wall thimble,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.990
you would go out of the home and then at that
point, you could either terminate if you are

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.230
doing a horizontal installation or you could
put on a four inch clean out tee and go up

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.320
and out through the roof of your home.
One thing that’s very important no matter

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.090
how you put the venting together, whether
it’s a vertical installation, whether it’s

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.450
a horizontal installation, you want to make
sure that you have adequate clean out tee’s

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.440
and ways to clean the venting so that you
don’t have to tear the venting completely

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.730
apart every time you want to clean your appliance.
You want to make sure and check your venting

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.860
at least once a month to make sure that it’s
free from debris. And make sure that you take

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.150
your clean out tees off and clean all debris
out from the chimney system. If your appliance

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.439
has been installed correctly, and if your
home is balanced and you have fresh air hooked

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:36.349
to the unit, you could get by for several
months without cleaning your venting system.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.340
When you’re installing a MagnuM fireplace
insert or Country Flame fireplace insert,

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.090
you want to make sure that the venting configuration
is designed from the beginning for ease of

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.280
maintenance, ease of installation and so that
it won’t come apart when you put the appliance

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.180
into the fireplace.
What we’ll do in this section is explain

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.959
a few things that can be done. When you’re
designing your fireplace insert, and if that

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.739
fireplace happens to be on the outside of
the wall, you may want to terminate the venting

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.010
by cutting a hole - access hole through the
back of the masonry fireplace and go right

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.040
outside so that you can have a vertical termination.
And then seal off your chimney. But if you

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.469
need to go up the chimney as in the case of
the chimney being on the interior of the home,

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:26.409
you’re going to want to prepare things.
And the first thing you want to do is clean

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.209
the chimney system. So call up yourself a
professional chimney cleaner, have him come

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.459
in, and have him check the chimney for cracks
and things. Clean it out very well. Clean

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.409
the entire fireplace opening. And then seal
it so that you won’t get any of the old

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:46.129
creosote and smoke smell that was in your
wood burning fireplace. Once that’s been

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.819
done and your fireplace insert is ready to
insert in, there’s a few things that you

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.049
want to do ahead of time to assure that you’ll
be able to get the fireplace out. And the

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:02.049
first thing is, is design your system so that
the venting will be flexible. And typical

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.310
installation would be, depending on the appliance
is you would, again, hook on the three inch

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.840
adapter onto the back of the unit. Or in some
cases, you would want to hook on the three

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.000
to four inch adapter. Because if your chimney
is thirty feet tall, you’re going to want

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.060
to switch over to four inch. Our manufacturer’s
recommendation is, is that immediately after

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.442
you leave the fireplace chamber, that you
would go with four inch liner all the way

00:04:27.442 --> 00:04:31.750
up and out the chimney system. This is not
a code requirement but it is something that

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.480
we as manufacturers would like you to do to
get the best benefit and to make sure that

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.840
you don’t have operational problems. So
typically what would happen is you would hook

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.580
a clean out tee onto the pipe adapter or you
can use a special clean out tee that has the

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.400
adapter built right into it. And you hook
that on to the back of the unit and secure

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.020
it very tightly. Make sure that your clean
out tee is sitting at a forty five degree

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.780
angle coming off the back of the unit. The
reason you want to do that is when you hook

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.720
the flex tubing that goes onto the unit onto
the clean out tee, you want to be able to

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:21.120
flex this thing in different directions so
that it can go up from the back of the unit

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:28.080
up around and go up the chimney system allowing
enough flexibility in the system so that you’ll

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.770
be able to pull the unit out should you need
servicing in the future. You want to make

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:39.550
sure that you have some type of a flex in
kind of like an S curve that’s built into

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.050
the flex system so that that unit will move
in and out of the unit freely. Once that’s

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.250
done, you could put rigid pipe or you could
hook flex liner onto the end of this system

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.259
and go up and out the chimney system making
sure that you seal both the bottom and the

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.150
top of the chimney and insulate the top two
feet of the chimney system.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.849
You’re also going to have to make sure that
you can route your fresh air safely and adequately.

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:13.230
The best way to route your fresh air is go
down and out the bottom of the fireplace insert

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.949
and out through an ash dump or out through
the back of the existing fireplace. If you

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:23.960
have to go up through the chimney system,
make sure that when you go up and out that

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:31.590
you do not terminate the fresh air close to
the exit for the exhaust or contaminated exhaust

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.150
will come down the fresh air and into the
system and it will contaminate the fire.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:43.419
There are several types of termination caps
that you would put onto the top when you terminate

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:50.030
a fireplace insert. This is a typical one
here. It’s called a vertical termination

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.930
cap. When you put these on, you want to make
sure and check them periodically through the

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.509
winter to make sure they don’t fill up with
debris, birds don’t try to build something

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:03.530
in there and/or it freezes over and causes
the appliance to malfunction.
