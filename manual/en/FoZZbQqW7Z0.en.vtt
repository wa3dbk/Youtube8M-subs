00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:09.900
So we just got a buck so we thought we would
do a video to show you guys one of our favorite

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.990
tools which is the butt out.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.230
That's the butt out.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:26.710
It goes in the butt!

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:42.730
Put it in twist until you feel it grab then
slowly start working it out and continue twisting.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.730
Just like that.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.520
And that will keep all the feces out of your
food.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.780
Then you can just pull it all the way out.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.360
On a big deer that's what it looks like!

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.780
Some of our tools it's one of our favorite
tools, some of us more than others!

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.350
Alright folks, as you can see her we just
had a successful hunt we harvested a doe and

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.060
a we are going to do a butt out review.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.650
It's one of our favorite tools and we are
going to show you why.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.950
So for the butt out, what you do...

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.040
I don't really want to show the insertion was kind of my deal.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.640
Oh how come?!

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.640
It's kind of perverted!

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.890
Haha how's that working for you!

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.369
How you started it was good.

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.320
Okay, well folks you can see here we had a
successful hunt got a doe, and we are just

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.400
getting ready to gut her out and a one of
the things we always used to struggle with

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.560
was trying to make sure not to get any feces
in or around any of the meat had (Laughter)

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.940
One of the things we used to struggle with were
trying to keep the feces out of the meat (Laughter)

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.250
Yeah good luck!

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.780
I am going to try one more time from the beginning.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.000
Hey folks, you can see here we had a successful
hunt today, we shot a doe.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.420
We are just getting ready to gut her here.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.080
One of the things we used to struggle with
all the time was trying to keep the feces

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.900
out of the meet it was always a (held back
laughter) pain to try to cut around the butt

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.520
hole, so what we want to show you was the
butt out and we wanted to give it a review.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.540
So what you do before you get too far along
is you take it and you insert it...into the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.420
butt.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.989
Then you twist and you feel it grab.

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:59.440
Once it grabs then you are just going to pull
firmly.......

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.720
(laughter) and it's not going to work.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.220
Crap, well maybe next deer!

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.040
