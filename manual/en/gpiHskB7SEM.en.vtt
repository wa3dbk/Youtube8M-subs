00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.109
Guy: Let's see what goes where.

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:13.549
Yikes

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.039
Miranda!

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.230
Miranda: Hi!
Guy: Please save me!

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.119
Miranda: What's going on?
Guy: Thanks for coming over. I got my new computer

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.939
I've got my two new monitors. That's the good news.

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.679
Miranda: Yeah! They're amazing!

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.699
Guy: They're pretty cool. So I want to set
them up so I can have like,

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.169
you know, photos on both.

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.140
I've been that in the store so I went out and got them and now, step 2, I just have

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.269
to kind of connect them to the computer
somehow.

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:39.430
Miranda: Okay, well...

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.190
I mean I've done a little dual display
stuff

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.590
but I'm not

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.940
extremely advanced.
Guy: You're a techie! Come on, help me!
Miranda: Okay, I'll try my best.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.320
Um, so this is blue which means it's the VGA
cord

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.000
and it normally would connect right in here,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but it looks like there's a cap there
which means it's covering the port

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.310
and it's disabled because you have a
graphics card right there.
Guy: Okay, so let's

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.330
use the graphics card.
Miranda: Yeah, well this is the DVI connector

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.650
Guy: DVI...
Miranda: Exactly it's digital

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.320
and it could go right there and
then

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.240
there's actually a place in this model for it

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.420
Guy: But I need, like, two of them to connect the two monitors and there's only one connection

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.169
Miranda: Actually, you know, you have an HDMI

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:30.570
port right there

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.850
and that's kind of like the new digital.
You know,

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.290
if we're going out to lunch we can stop
by HP

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.900
and talk to my friend Bernie who is a
brilliant engineer and I think that

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.900
he might be able to help you a little more than I can.
Guy: That would be cool.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.610
Miranda: Okay so we have two monitors and a computer that we want to hook up but

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.509
we're wondering what the best
connectors are to use are.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.400
Bernie: Okay, so what type of monitor do you have?
Guy: Uh, two wide screen monitors.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.690
Miranda: We got the 2408.
Bernie: Oh okay.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.480
Let me walk you through the
different types of connectors.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.730
One type is VGA. That's an
analog signal and you can get really

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.979
pretty good quality with that.

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:29.869
You could also have a graphics card
in your pc that has two DVI connectors

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:33.379
Or another one

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.799
that exists is like a VGA and a DVI connector

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.499
And then the other type of graphics card has HDMI and DVI connectors

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:49.109
Miranda: This is ours. No VGA
on the actual computer but on the

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.149
monitors we don't have HDMI we 
just have VGA and DVI.

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:55.649
Guy: So it's clear isn't it? (laughs)

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:59.110
Bernie: VGA has really good signal
quality for analog

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.169
but one of the really nice things about
HDMI

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.680
and DVI is they're both digital

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.049
video signals that you get out. So you've got
a couple of alternatives.  We've got some

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.109
monitors that are HMDI like I've got
a 2207H that's right

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:17.639
here and that's got an HDMI interface.
You could swipe out the graphics card

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:23.719
just get a graphics card like this one that
has both DVI and VGA.

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:27.569
Probably simplest thing his to get a
converter. Now,

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.299
HDMI has both video and audio
signals in it and when you use a

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.769
converter it'll strip the audio out

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:36.729
of the

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.040
signal

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.549
but that's ok.

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.400
You'll be able to plug in a separate
audio cable like this from the PC

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.580
in to the monitor so you'll still be able to get audio

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.060
but the simplest thing
for the video signal is probably to use a

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.269
converter like this that'll take

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.139
HDMI

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.209
video signal in to

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.370
a DVI signal and there's no
conversion from digital to analog and

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.370
then back to digital as you go into the monitor.
Guy: So just get that in a computer store?
Bernie: Yeah you could get that in a computer store.

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:17.749
Guy: Or take this one?
Bernie: Well if you're really nice.
(laughs)

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.690
Miranda: Okay this looks great.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.699
So Bernie was a huge help.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.159
Guy: Bernie is my hero

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:34.069
Miranda: So we have the DVI cable connected into this port, the monitor

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.939
in that port

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:40.279
and then we have the HDMI adapter
connected to the DVI

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:42.740
cable that goes into this port

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.490
Are you ready to turn it on? 
Guy: Let's do it!

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.099
excited

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.099
okay

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:52.529
That screen is working

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:53.290
and

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.850
Is that one supposed to be on?
Miranda: You know I don't think so, 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.379
but let me check all the connections
just to make sure.

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.979
Yeah the cables in the computer look
good

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.259
and the cables in the mother are all in and the power is on

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.569
which is good because of the cables were
undone then

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.699
we would have to reboot the computer

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.689
Guy: Okay, but we're okay like it is?
Miranda: Yeah

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:20.029
So do you want to set up the displays?
Guy: Yep

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:24.569
Miranda: Okay, so you're going to start by
right-clicking on the desktop

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.309
And you're going to go down to NVIDIA Control Panel

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:30.300
I have ATI so

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.680
you know what it looks like the process is
going to be the same actually in setting

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.739
it up

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:39.029
so we're going to want to change the resolution first

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:43.379
and what does it say on...

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:49.090
Guy: The sheet says 1920 by 1200

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.919
So just drag that across...

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.669
all the way

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.990
and then refresh rate 60 hertz

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.719
and we click apply.

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:03.279
Miranda:We would like to accept these changes.
Guy: We would. We love those changes! (laughs)

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.909
Miranda: Great. Okay now we want to go down to set up multiple displays

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.920
Because we want that one to work.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.949
Okay, so this is it.

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:14.850
and you'll see where it says single, clone,
and dualview.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.999
I think dualview you would work better
for you know and your photography

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:22.610
because you can extend your desktop to the next screen so you have a wider

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.479
space to work on.

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:25.949
Guy: Okay so

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:30.969
dualview is the one I want and then select
the displays you would like to use

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:36.369
and select the display you want Windows to use as a primary

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:39.919
One of two. Apply.

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.739
Maybe that will make that one work.

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:46.259
Oh, we have to press yes.

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:49.639
Wonderful!
Guy: Oh, and we can drag the window across!

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:55.110
Miranda: Now let's make sure that the resolution

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:00.310
let's make sure that the resolution on this screen is

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.609
the same.
Guy: Okay

00:07:01.609 --> 00:07:04.860
so 1920

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.039
by 1200, drag that all the way across

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:10.750
Apply

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.250
Miranda: And then we click yes.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.259
fantastic!
Guy: Oh so now I can drag

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:21.129
back-and-forth it stays in the same resolution.
Miranda: Yeah that's wonderful!

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:25.520
Guy: So if it's a photo something I can see it on both?
Miranda: Yeah show me some of your photos!

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.159
So open up your library over here

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:33.789
and then you can click on a specific picture

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:37.050
Guy: Oh and it comes up big on the other screen!

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.429
Miranda: Yeah I mean you can 

00:07:38.429 --> 00:07:39.550
edit and

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.339
play with all your photos over here

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:47.789
That's what's great about having two screens.

00:07:47.789 --> 00:07:49.900
Guy: Thank you so much!

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.430
So now

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.070
I can show you all all my Paris pictures and bore you!

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.960
Miranda: I would love to see them.
