00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:07.200
A lost ship amidst the sea of sands
hides the secrets of the untold land

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.159
A relic of an age in the sands of time
calls from a distance, o adventurer of kind

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:18.810
Hello and welcome to a new episiode on the
Diablo Universe.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.240
Some sercets are meant to be hidden whilst
others are longing to be found; It has been

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.249
years the game's release and brave nephalem
have explored every inch

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:29.019
of their ancestral land.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.329
Whether thats finding the crown of the lich
king or discovering the fabled whimsyshire,

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.899
we know everything there is to know about
this game,,,right?

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:43.100
Well not exactly, as along comes the biggest
and most well kept secret of them all, The

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.680
pages from the Black Rock Ledger.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.300
A sunken ship found in act 2 stinging winds
that hides secrets and mysteries that will

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.120
make even the wisest nephalem wonder, what
is the point

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.550
of all this.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.050
So join me now as we discover everything there
is to know about this lost tale, what does

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.850
it mean, why does it have only have 6 pages
and why does the writing on it make no sense.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.590
Discover all this and more
in this episode of Secrets of Sanctuary

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.580
If you happen to be playing act 2 of campaign
mode, indulge yourself in mission titled "city

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.750
of blood" and make your way outside the eastern
gate of Khasim Outpost.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.160
This will bring you in eastern section of
Stinging Winds

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.150
marked by a checkpoint appearing on the screen.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.750
Upon venturing futher, you will discover a
decaying ship half buried in the sands.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.890
Quite strangely a man that only goes by his
title, the Gravedigger is seemed to be digging

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.770
for something near the ship.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.000
As you approach, he is ambushed by lunatics
and dies a horrific death leaving a ledger

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.110
behind.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.410
This is a rare event and it has been confirmed
that only six of these pages exist.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.852
So if you wish
farm these pages, you can wander in the stinging

00:01:47.852 --> 00:01:51.500
winds by reloading the checkpoint and by looking
for the lost ship again.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.840
But what do these pages say and why only six
of them esixt.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.180
Lets move on the next part of the mystery.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.610
After spending hours and days farming for
these Pages, one thing becomes absolutely

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.920
clear, there are only six pages that drop
at the black rock with specific numbers cited

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.700
on each of them.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.260
All these pages or stone tablets
if you will, are marked as 4,8,15,16,23 and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.400
42.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.170
The text inscribed on each page is very cryptic
and talks about a mining expidition launched

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.569
from Kingsport a long time ago.

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.379
This journey was a troublesome one as the
crew

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.549
on the ship suffered harships from the beginning
and shipwerecked somewhere after being hit

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.319
by a collosal storm.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.569
The captian of the ship dissapeared in the
nearby desert along with his crew members.

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.290
Eventually, the writer
of this ledger was the sole survivor and nearly

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.989
went mad as he mentioned some deformed creatures
lurking in the dark.

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.569
And this in its essense marks the end of the
six pages.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.040
No other entries exist and the fate of the
final crew

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.790
member remains a mystery.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.049
When the nephalem finds 6 pages of texts that
do nothing, a mystetry arises that can be

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.430
solved by exploring the far fethed corners
of sanctuary.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.730
But the trail of clues leads to a unique turn
of events.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.200
Upon exploring the
deep mystery behind the texts described in

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.110
the ledger, it was found that a nephalem can
find certain weapons in the game that are

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.450
no legendary but hold a strange description
that matches each of the individual ledger.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.180
So the first item here is called "the Splintered
Oar" whose item description is a shanty or

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.129
a sea song whose first words are "from kingsport
to kurast we sail.

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.489
The word kingsport is also desribed in the
page 4 of the ledger.

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.340
A strange an unlikely coincidence, but lets
look further.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.019
Another weapon called Wirt's original leg
talks about the Wirt losing his leg near the

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.330
town of tristram, strangely so, the word "leg"
is also mentioned in page 8 that talks

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.849
about sea legs not being sturdy.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.760
This case too, might sound unlikely as the
writer of Ledger is called McMahon whereas

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.769
the text of weapon describes the fate of Wirt.

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:51.769
But lets move on.

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.510
Rakanishu's blade is the third item here that
in under inspection.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.659
Rakanishu is a cursed lord of the fallen that
is also found in diablo 2 and can be met again

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.310
in diablo 3.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.090
Ledger 15 surpirsingly also mentions of a
curse falling upon the crew members of the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.090
ship.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.139
Next item in
the game called the clipper is also the name

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:13.620
of a fast sailing ship of the 19th century
and explains that the black rock in infact

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.500
a clipper and its troubles are described in
page 16 of the ledger.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.690
Griswold's Worn edge referers to the
blacksmith griswold that succumed to maddness

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.180
and was a mini boss in diablo 2.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.640
Coincidentally, page 23 of the ledger also
describes a maddness falling onto the survivors

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.230
of the ship that lead to their doom.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.400
Finally we look at the
blade spectrum that refers to some silly humor

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.690
but includes the word giggles.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.870
So surprise surprise, the exact word giggling
is also described in page 42 which marks the

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.970
end of the ledger.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.690
Now it is understandable that all these unique
weapons tell an individual story and may very

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.320
well refer to seperate tales, but why then
have they been specifically mentioned in the

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.320
ledgers.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.811
These items are not legendaries, neither are
useful in any way so linking them to the black

00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:00.960
rock holds a strong case.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.900
So does this mean that all these items and
pages collectively tell a disjoined tale full

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.500
of uncertainities and doubts, or is this referring
to something else entirely.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.500
Lets explore further

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.980
An event such as this is referred in the video
games as an easter egg where popular references

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.170
are hidden in plain sight to give a nod to
some other popular event.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.220
What do I mean by this, well allow me to tell
the story once again.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.140
A ship found shipwrecked in a place that is
far away from the ocean, half buried with

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.470
no survivors and a mystery that deepens the
further you look into it.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.330
Somehow certain records of this event exist
where the writer carefully plants

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.520
certain coded messages that lead you nowehere.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.860
Sounds like a famous TV show to me, I will
give you a second to guess.......well this

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.460
is direct reference to the tv show Lost where
the entire sequence is a reminder of characters

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.930
and
events in the show.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.560
how so, well the first answer is in the page
numbers, the numbers in the secquence are

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.290
as follows, 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.050
These numbers clearly appear in the tv show
where the character Jacob used these numbers

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.780
to
mark six candidates.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.210
Another clue is in the fisrt letter of each
ledger, upon putting this together, it spell

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.060
out DHARMA which is scientific venture described
in the TV show.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.970
A final hint might be the appearance of
black sandstorm that sometimes arises in the

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.850
desert terrain of act 2,linking it to the
smoke monster from the tv series.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.830
So this makes it abundantly clear that this
is a nod to the tv show lost with a flavour

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.500
of
Diablo universe sprinkled on top of it.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.960
So when you thought the mystery was sloved
and everything makes sense, well it is my

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.890
duty to indulge you in some further clarification
and fan theories.The black rock ledger is

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:45.630
a real life sailing vessel that embarked from
Portsmouth,England on March 22, 1845.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.540
It was lost and was later found on an island
off the coast of madagascar.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:54.530
Inside the ship, a book was found with the
word LEDGER" printed on the spine of the book.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.670
This makes this easter egg closely related
to a real event

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.600
than a fictional one.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.710
In game, people have theorised about this
event linking to other places on the map including

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.970
some nods to future expansions.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.330
Some believes it links to a chat gem similar
to one found in diablo 2 and others think

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.080
covetus shen has something to do with this.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.020
So many theories to an event that has been
quietly discussed in hush tones since 2012.So

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.350
here I am asking you about your opinion on
this matter, what do you think all of this

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.640
means? can it be
that after 3 years of the game, we are still

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.400
missing something, is it really that cryptic
or are we being paranoid?

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.240
Thank you very much for watching the story
of Black rock ledger.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.140
A special thanks to Kyrael on US forums for
making a

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.660
long post about theories concerning this topic
and ofcourse, a big thanks to our community

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.960
manager Vaneras for suggesting this topic.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.000
This has been the holy hermit for you, take
care and remember to run for the hills when

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.620
the
lamp runs dry, the night is dark and full

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.150
of fallen!
