How to cook Asparagus - How to make Asparagus

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:06.014
Hey my Sweet Vs, It's The Sweetest Vegan here. Today I 
 am going to teach you how to cook Asparagus.

00:00:06.014 --> 00:00:10.310
It is really simple and it makes a nice 
 vegetable for any weekday meal. Here we go.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.859
How to cook Asparagus - How to make Asparagus

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.664
Now the hardest part of this recipe is cutting the stem off the 
 asparagus. Now some people just hold it in between their hands

00:00:21.664 --> 00:00:27.376
bend it, and wherever it breaks is the natural breaking 
 point for where the bad meets the good. 

00:00:27.376 --> 00:00:32.554
And then other people use that breaking point to 
 measure all the rest of the asparagus 

00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:38.731
 and slice off all the stems. And, I think that is 
 pretty wasteful. Because all the asparagus aren't the same length

00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:43.491
and they don't have the same breaking points. So I am just going 
 to look and see where is goes from white to 

00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:48.437
green and see where it starts to thin out 
 a little bit and cut it there. 

00:00:48.437 --> 00:00:55.681
Next I am going to heat up olive oil in a large 
 skillet over medium high heat and add my asparagus to it.

00:00:55.681 --> 00:01:00.209
It is going to get really hot, and going to start to 
 sizzle and that is when I am going to season them.

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:07.222
I am using salt, pepper, dehydrated chopped onions, 
 and then a little bit of oregano.

00:01:07.222 --> 00:01:13.189
And you can do lemon pepper, you can do rosemary, you 
 can season these asparagus however you see fit. 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.600
Your cooking time is also up to you. Some people 
 like their asparagus kind of crisp and stiff 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.708
and other people, like me, I like my vegetables really well done 
 so I wanted to make it kind of wilt-y 

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:33.527
and bent over and not so pleasing to the eye. It just 
 kind of limps over. But that is it for today. 

00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:37.895
This is how my asparagus looked. And yes they were delicious. I 
 just got home from church and I was really hungry,

00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:37.895
This is how my asparagus looked. And yes they were delicious. I 
 just got home from church and I was really hungry,

00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:42.420
so I ate all of them. But they were well seasoned, 
 you don't need to a lot to season them.

00:01:42.423 --> 00:01:48.880
And people say it makes your pee smell funny, 
 I have never experience or observed that.

00:01:48.878 --> 00:01:55.060
So eat asparagus, it is really good and add diversity 
 to your diet. instead of eating string beans. 

00:01:55.055 --> 00:02:02.860
Chop them up just the same. So that is it for today, leave 
 a comment below, I would love to talk to you, and 

00:02:02.857 --> 00:02:06.220
I am going to take a nap, because I am exhausted from church.
