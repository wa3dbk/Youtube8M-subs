00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.080
I used to love her

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:17.905
but I had to kill her!

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.178
I used to love her

00:00:21.213 --> 00:00:24.666
but I had to kill her!

00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:28.650
I had to put her...

00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:32.146
6 feet under...

00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:36.531
and I can still hear her complain!

00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:44.031
Ran:  Shaving on the bullet train...

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.734
It's no wonder everybody thinks you're some kinda hobo!

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:47.710
Kogoro:  It's not my fault

00:00:47.745 --> 00:00:49.495
I was busy with a client all night!

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:52.384
You got drunk, and fell asleep in the doorway!

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.956
Hmph, and why the hell did we bring him along, anyway?

00:00:55.957 --> 00:00:57.888
Ran:  What?  You wanna abandom him?

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:59.747
Kogoro:  Well what about them?

00:00:59.748 --> 00:01:01.447
Ran:  They think they're main characters.

00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:03.703
So... they kinda snuck on board.

00:01:03.738 --> 00:01:05.628
Shinichi:  Weird, they weren't here in the manga...

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.692
I-I'll be right back!

00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:15.226
Shinichi:  IT'S THEM!  The guys who turned me into a kid!

00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:17.114
Well I swear, in this episode...

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.699
I'll do whatever it takes to get my old body back

00:01:19.734 --> 00:01:21.395
AND STOP YOU ONCE AND FOR A-

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.051
Ran:  Conan!  Come sit down like a good little boy!

00:01:24.052 --> 00:01:25.052
Conan:  Yes, Ran.

00:01:31.503 --> 00:01:33.231
You are SO busted!

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.521
Ayumi:  I'll get it!

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.465
Conan!  You shouldn't be making trouble!

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.784
It's punks like you that make grownups hate me!

00:01:42.785 --> 00:01:45.097
You should wrap your gum in paper and throw it away!

00:01:45.132 --> 00:01:46.410
Shinichi:  Brown-nosers!

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.681
That's an even better spot!

00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:53.403
C'mon!

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.643
So Conan, what was that gum for?

00:01:56.678 --> 00:01:58.611
Conan:  I planted a listening device so I can-

00:01:58.646 --> 00:02:00.995
Bored alrady.  I'm gonna go eat!

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.524
Food!

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:03.908
Food!

00:02:08.403 --> 00:02:09.515
Shinichi:  THEY'RE HERE!

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.348
Well I guess now's as good a time as any to kick their...

00:02:12.383 --> 00:02:14.888
Wait... that's not them.

00:02:14.923 --> 00:02:16.320
This is nothing like the manga

00:02:16.355 --> 00:02:17.655
God Dammit!

00:02:21.128 --> 00:02:24.263
Guy over glasses:  I can't wait to get off this lousy train!

00:02:24.264 --> 00:02:25.404
Shinichi:  What the hell?

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.356
Oh, I forgot to turn it off.

00:02:29.913 --> 00:02:33.969
Otokonoko jusu o nonde imasu

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.197
Guy over glasses:  Would you cut that out, it's annoying.

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:40.379
Konichiwa!

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.899
Seriously, enough!

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.042
Gohan oishii desu!

00:02:44.043 --> 00:02:45.043
Grr...

00:02:45.044 --> 00:02:48.005
Over Glasses:  Rosetta Stone ha, nihongo no gengo o masutaa suru

00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:51.597
koto ha nai, ichi shuukan ha, baka mitai

00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:55.832
G-g-gyunu?

00:02:55.833 --> 00:03:00.114
Guy over glasses:  Maybe I should just leave you here so you can experience a japanese bomb!

00:03:00.115 --> 00:03:01.995
Shinichi:  I knew they were up to no good!

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.100
Train Announcer:  Now ariving at, Nagoya!

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:07.146
Let's go stupid!

00:03:06.778 --> 00:03:09.761
Bonzai!

00:03:09.762 --> 00:03:11.534
Shinichi:  I gotta stop them!

00:03:12.436 --> 00:03:13.660
Waaait!

00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:15.644
Ran:  Not so fast, this isn't our stop!

00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:16.609
Let's go!

00:03:16.644 --> 00:03:17.559
Forget it.

00:03:17.594 --> 00:03:19.415
Ran:  Get back here!

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:23.160
Shinichi:  I gotta warn somebody.

00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:25.272
But who... WHO?

00:03:25.273 --> 00:03:27.644
Conan:  There's a time bomb on the train!

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:29.189
Ha, yeah right.

00:03:29.224 --> 00:03:31.157
And I'm the masked Yaiba.

00:03:31.158 --> 00:03:32.158
Shinichi:  Assholes.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.890
Hey Conan, can we help?

00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:36.041
I doubt it.

00:03:36.076 --> 00:03:37.969
I heard there was a bomb in a black briefcase

00:03:38.004 --> 00:03:40.114
on the second floor of car 7!

00:03:40.115 --> 00:03:42.645
Shinichi:  I dont' even wanna know how you found out.

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.295
Hmm, four people with black briefcases.

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:53.694
Hey mister, can I use your computer to check my stocks?

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.959
No, I'm busy raiding, now f[beep] off!

00:03:57.758 --> 00:03:58.926

00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:01.319
I SAID [beep] OFF!!!

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.865
Oh don't mind him, he's just a big nerd.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.809
Wow, nice view!

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.474
Shinichi:  Crap, locked.

00:04:11.464 --> 00:04:13.914
I thought I told you to f[beep] off!

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.060
How are me and my guild supposed to defeat Onyxia

00:04:17.874 --> 00:04:18.285
if you keep distracting me!

00:04:18.286 --> 00:04:21.076
Conan:  Hey mister, do you have a bomb in your briefcase?

00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:23.848
I love disney land!

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.550
Uh... sir-

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.566
I just soiled myself!

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:30.781
Shinichi:  ...next.

00:04:34.074 --> 00:04:38.779
Let's see, gold watch, gold ring, gold glasses expensive suit

00:04:38.814 --> 00:04:41.075
[disgusted] WHAT A PIMP!

00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:42.989
Excuse me sir...

00:04:43.024 --> 00:04:44.749
I accidentally my paper plane.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.265
Can I go get it?

00:04:46.527 --> 00:04:47.129
[grunts]

00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:54.121
DON'T TOUCH THAT!!!

00:04:58.472 --> 00:04:59.727
NNNOOOOO!!!!

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.490
Hah, I should play baseball!

00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:05.904
Genta, please.  Be very careful!

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.801
How many times do I have to tell you to shut the [beep] up!

00:05:16.585 --> 00:05:19.033
Wow, talk about stupid underware...

00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:22.602
My mama/sister gave me those.

00:05:22.637 --> 00:05:25.514
Pimp:  BOTHER SOMEONE ELSE!!!
[kids scream]

00:05:26.507 --> 00:05:29.364
Remind me to BEAT you all when we get home!

00:05:31.612 --> 00:05:32.891
Shinichi:  Time is running out!

00:05:32.926 --> 00:05:34.644
I gotta go stop that bomb!

00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:38.356
Nice try, but where do you think you're going!

00:05:40.204 --> 00:05:40.860
Bathroom!

00:05:41.025 --> 00:05:41.676
You just went!

00:05:41.794 --> 00:05:42.637
Uh, gift shop!

00:05:42.672 --> 00:05:43.660
Not on this train!

00:05:43.695 --> 00:05:44.699
I'm hungry!

00:05:44.734 --> 00:05:45.852
You're not Genta!

00:05:49.345 --> 00:05:52.913
Uh, fine.  I'm going to stop a bomb from going off!

00:05:52.914 --> 00:05:53.914
Yeah right!

00:05:54.658 --> 00:05:57.145
Shinichi:  No good, I'll have to try something else.

00:05:57.146 --> 00:06:01.472
[emotionally]  Hey Ran... there's something I need to tell you.

00:06:01.473 --> 00:06:05.323
You know what, you need to start calling me Ran-neechan from now on!

00:06:05.324 --> 00:06:07.335
Wh-what?

00:06:07.336 --> 00:06:08.613
Ran-neechan!

00:06:08.614 --> 00:06:10.819
Look, Ran, I know this series is based

00:06:10.854 --> 00:06:12.523
on the japanese version of the show

00:06:12.558 --> 00:06:14.404
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING THAT FAR!

00:06:14.405 --> 00:06:17.621
Train Announcer:  Attention all passengers...

00:06:17.656 --> 00:06:20.783
Remember to use the outside deck when talking on your cellphone

00:06:20.818 --> 00:06:24.351
to avoid looking like a total douche in front of the other passengers!

00:06:24.352 --> 00:06:27.857
Shinichi:  That's it, it must be the lady with the cellphone who has the bomb!

00:06:27.858 --> 00:06:30.606
Hey guys!  Ran says she's a 4Kids lover!

00:06:31.427 --> 00:06:32.587
You horrible bitch!

00:06:32.622 --> 00:06:35.555
Ayumi:  Say it ain't so!
Mitsuhiko:  You'll burn in hell!

00:06:41.164 --> 00:06:44.181
Shinichi:  Crap, I've only got a few seconds before it goes off!

00:06:44.182 --> 00:06:48.228
I've gotta use these special shoes that Professer Agasa gave me to get rid of it!

00:06:54.116 --> 00:06:55.269
Ow.

00:07:01.044 --> 00:07:03.292
How- How did you do that?

00:07:03.327 --> 00:07:04.979
I LIKE SOCCER!

00:07:05.014 --> 00:07:06.876
THAT WAS MY LUNCH!

00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:08.300
What was in there?

00:07:08.335 --> 00:07:10.236
Lady:  12-alarm firehouse chilli!

00:07:11.345 --> 00:07:13.553
Shinichi:  Well it turns out those guys were just joking with eachother

00:07:13.588 --> 00:07:14.778
about the bomb.

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:16.607
But they were later arrested for jay-walking.

00:07:16.642 --> 00:07:19.720
maybe I shouldn't stick my nose where it doesn't belong?

00:07:19.755 --> 00:07:21.856
Nah, what fun would that be?
