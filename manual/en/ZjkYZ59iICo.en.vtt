00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:17.392
I've never seen a shark. Yeah I've never seen one up close either.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.852
I think about a shark every time I go surfing.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:23.940
Me too. Me too.

00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:25.942
We're freaking out.

00:00:25.943 --> 00:00:31.989
Ship Captain: A couple safety things about the boat, VHF radios located up on the bridge. Channel 16 is the coast guard.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.911
Ship Captain: That being said, a little about the tour. What's happened is over time ths sharks have become accustomed

00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:51.050
Ship Captain: to hearing these big motors, the crabbers use the same sort of motors.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:54.554
It's really sharky out there. There's sharks everywhere.

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:57.348
Surrounding us. They're big.

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:59.726
And we're kinda scared.

00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:04.730
It was really scary, we were all really nervous at first.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.942
I've never actually seen a shark up close.

00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:13.490
They just through the cage over and were like 'ok get in, have fun'

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:22.708
So we just jumped in and right when you jump there's sharks surrounding us.

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:30.591
From down below, to the sides. You're just like "oh my gosh..."

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:32.973
You just want to curl up in a little ball.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:36.470
Sometimes you legs kinda even get outside the cage, it's a little scary

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:42.810
But it's like such a cool thing to see them that close an see how they really move.

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:43.604
It's so calm under there.

00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:11.797
It was really cool and it was fun to do with the girls because we were cracking jokes and

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:16.512
having fun, so, it was some good times.

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:39.408
Always on Oahu, it's really fun. They call it the 'Seven Mile Miracle'.

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:45.290
... because it's just wave after wave. You can walk out and surf three different waves if you want to.

00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:50.230
It ended up being such a nice day with the sunset. The waves picked up really fast.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.819
As you can tell, yeah, it was a really fun day.
