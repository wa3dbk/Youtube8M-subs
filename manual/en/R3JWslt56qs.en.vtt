00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:10.620
What we call conventional heart bypass surgery
would be done through an incision in the chest,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.930
so that's a sternotomy incision.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.210
And it's ususally about that long, about 8
inches long.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:26.380
We'd also have a small incision in the leg
where a vein from the leg is taken.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.129
The operation consists of first getting the
mammary artery prepared, that's the artery

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:34.219
we use to do bypass.

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.280
At the same time, we're taking the vein from
the leg.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:45.359
When that process is taken care of, the patient
is put on a heart lung bypass machine.

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:50.109
They're given heparin so the blood doesn't
clot during that period they're on the heart-lung

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:51.230
bypass machine.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.859
While the heart is still and quiet, we would
sew the vein to the arteries on the heart.

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.629
The idea is to bypass the blockages on the
heart.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.930
We're not doing anything to the areas that
are narrow themselves, we're placing a route

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.390
for blood to go around those areas.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.670
Some patients may need two, others three,
four or even five bypasses.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.640
It's individual, it's based on the how the
patient's arteries are configured and how

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.340
many blockages they have.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:34.240
That whole procedure of doing the bypasses
takes somewhere between 3 and 4 hours to do.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.880
Almost every patient who has bypass surgery
has atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.962
We certainly don't know exactly what causes
atherosclerosis, it's certainly an active

00:01:44.962 --> 00:01:46.159
area of investigation.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.310
In general, it's associated with a strong
family history of having had heart disease

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.700
or vascular disease.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.440
It's associated with things like diabetes,
high blood pressure, high cholesterol.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.700
So these are all indications that a person
has risk factors for that.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.110
On the other hand, there are certainly patients
who have all those risk factors and don't

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.260
have coronary artery disease and need bypass.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.379
There are certainly some unknowns in the process.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:22.959
A typical stay for patients could range from
4-6 days.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.530
There may be a few patients ready to leave
after 3 days; that's less common.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.019
There may be some patients certainly who start
out sicker and need more than six days.

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.349
Somewhere between 4-6 days after surgery.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.470
Patients will typically be in intensive care
for one day, just the night after surgery.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.069
The next day on average, 80-90% of patients
will be ready to move to a regular step-down

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.069
unit.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.810
I think the thing that would be fair to tell
someone is the day of surgery and the day

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.519
after, the pain and discomfort is there.

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:06.730
We use pain medicine to make sure it's controlled
as well as possible.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.519
I think most people who've had the procedure
will say after a couple days they're very

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.120
comfortable with just oral pain medicine.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.459
And they go home on that.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.170
Patients typically don't need pain medication
after 2-3 weeks.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.340
But I think if you asked people who've had
bypass surgery they'd say they still had some

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.159
soreness and discomfort that may have continued
several weeks after surgery.

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:35.420
They should typically be back to their normal
activity anywhere from 3-4 weeks after surgery.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.599
Some people are ready sooner.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.879
It's usually a couple months, when we do a
typcial sternotomy that people can return

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:51.860
to all activities including lifting weights
and those things.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:59.010
Across the country, there are at least 100,000
heart bypass operations done each year.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.829
That number has actually decreased over the
years, which is a good thing for patients.

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:09.549
with the change in medications, patients are
doing better without having the need for bypass

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:10.549
surgery.

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:17.240
But certainly as people get older and the
population has other diseases like diabetes

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.920
etc they sometimes need heart bypass surgery.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.520
The good news we have for them is that people
are doing well with it.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.010
I'd say bypass surgery has progressed quite
a bit.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:35.640
Certainly back in the 1970s when the first
bypass surgeries were initiated, results were

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.640
relatively unknown.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:43.790
Then in the 1980s, we brought in important
changes like using an internal mammary artery

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.850
which really has made a differnce in the long
term success rate.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:55.390
Really more recently in the 90s and this decade
we've seen that survival rates for bypass

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.590
surgery are extremely good.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:05.600
All across the country, 98, almost 99% will
survive surgery and do very well.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.360
And I think the long term results of bypass
surgery are really quite good.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.780
I think we can say safely and fairly that
patients can get an excellent bypass operation

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.060
all across the country at different types
of medical centers.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.450
There's no question about that.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:28.350
The differnce between a medical center like
ours is that we have physicians here who are

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:35.140
experienced not only with bypass surgery but
with more complicated types of technologies

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.720
and proceedures that some patients who have
bypass surgery may need.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.180
For example, there are some patients who have
very low heart function who need bypass surgery.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.450
Those patients may need some help before or
after surgery with support of their circulation.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:58.340
We have an excellent program in heart device
and heart transplantation.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.520
And I think that addtional expertise really
provides the difference for those types of

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.520
patients.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.860
And I think for patients who don't need that,
we have a center that does a lot of heart

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.830
surgery and has excellent results across breadth
of the spectrum of heart surgery and that's

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.770
a reason patients should feel comfortable
having their operations here.
