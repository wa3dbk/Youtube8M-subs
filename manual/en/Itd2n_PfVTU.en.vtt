00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.320
Hi, I'm Katrina Szish for Howdini.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.960
Today we're going to find out
how to get a healthy mouth

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.120
in just three steps.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.270
To do that, I'm joined by Dr. Brian
Kantor, cosmetic dentist. Nice to see

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.832
you, Brian.

00:00:11.832 --> 00:00:12.264
Nice to see you.

00:00:12.264 --> 00:00:13.128
How are you?

00:00:13.128 --> 00:00:13.560
I'm great.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.080
Now, I want to dive right in, though.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.955
What are some of the keys to maintaining
a healthy mouth?

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:21.660
You know, today, having a healthy mouth
is more important than ever.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.680
Actually having a healthy mouth can
lead to having a healthier body.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.360
It's more important than ever to
take good care of your mouth.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.530
So what I tell all of my patients
is to have three easy steps--

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.760
a good diet, see your dentist twice
a year regularly for cleanings and

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.870
checkups, and to have
good oral hygiene.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.040
OK, now let's focus a little
bit on good oral hygiene--

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.030
brushing, flossing, mouthwash.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.470
Is there an order?

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.940
Well, the most important thing, yes,
is brushing twice a day, flossing

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.260
twice a day, and rinsing
with mouthwash.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.880
I say brushing and flossing, you can
pick whichever one you want to do.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.780
And then you should end with rinsing
with mouthwash because it washes it

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.310
away and actually leaves you
with fresh minty breath.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.640
I love fresh minty breath.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.950
OK, toothbrushes.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.030
Some people swear by their electric
toothbrush, and they say it does a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.494
better job than a manual toothbrush.

00:01:04.494 --> 00:01:05.830
Is that true?

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.790
Well, actually, whatever
works for you.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.240
I say to the patient, whatever
works for you, you can

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.785
use, manual or electric.

00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:16.890
The beauty of the electric toothbrush
is it does some of the work for you.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.720
There's a timer.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.520
It makes sure you brush each quadrant--
there are four quadrants--

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.500
for 30 seconds each.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.350
So it times you, and at two minutes, it
beeps, so it knows you've actually

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.190
done a thorough job.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.660
The manual toothbrush you actually have
to do manually with no timer.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.320
Oh no!

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.090
It requires a little more effort, but
if you feel comfortable with it,

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.780
that's great.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.400
But the most important thing, no matter
if it's manual, electric,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.090
battery powered, is the bristles.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.100
It has to have soft bristles.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.370
There's soft, medium, and hard.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.140
So when you're shopping,
you should look for--

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.930
I guess it says soft bristles?

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.205
Soft, yes, absolutely.

00:01:47.205 --> 00:01:48.140
It's imperative.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.430
Speaking of shopping for tooth-brushing
products, toothpaste.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.760
There are so many out there.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.355
Does it really matter
which one I choose?

00:01:55.355 --> 00:01:55.980
Yes.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.650
The most important ingredient in
toothpaste is it has fluoride.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.764
Fluoride will actually-- it helps
remineralize the enamel, so it makes

00:02:01.764 --> 00:02:02.630
the teeth healthier.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.280
So the most important ingredient
in the toothpaste is fluoride.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.590
Most toothpastes have fluoride,
but make sure it has it.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.292
There are a lot of other ingredients
that some toothpastes have, and you

00:02:10.292 --> 00:02:12.120
have to pick and choose what
works best for you.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.840
There are some that a minty fresh.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.640
For people with bad breath, they
get more of a minty taste.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.250
There are some that has
antisensitivity.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.290
For people with sensitive teeth or gums
that have receded, they want a

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.710
toothpaste that actually helps
decrease the sensitivity.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.320
There's also whitening toothpastes,
which help remove surface stain a

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.740
little better than the
other toothpastes.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.580
So you really have to see
what works best for you.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.050
So shop around a little bit.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.650
Try them out.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.950
Yes.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.110
I would say buy a few.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.750
Try them out.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.200
See what works best for you, what tastes
best, what you like to use, and

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.760
go with that toothpaste.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.640
OK, now when it comes to taste, I think
of mouthwash, and we love the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.670
residual effect, that
fresh minty breath.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.180
But sometimes, mouthwashes burn.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.700
Now, why do they burn, and
do they need to burn?

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.740
Does that mean they're
doing a good job?

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.710
No, the burning does not mean
it's doing a good job.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.740
The burning is the alcohol
in the mouthwash.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.290
It's not an active ingredient.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.410
All it does is it's a binding
agent for the mouthwash.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.230
OK, fantastic.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.020
Now, flossing, of course, is
one of those key things.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.810
And it goes way beyond just removing
those food particles

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.720
from between the teeth.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.090
Yes.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.430
Flossing is imperative.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.140
The teeth have a lot of surface area, a
lot of hard-to-get places, and food

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.030
gets trapped all over.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.550
And you have to really get all the food
out, because the food accumulates

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.660
bacteria, and the bacteria cause
bad breath and decay.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.740
So flossing actually gets in between the
teeth and gets the food particles

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.420
out, and it also gets
underneath the gums.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.290
Now, there's different types of floss,
and you can use what's best for you.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.370
There's a waxed floss.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.340
People with very tight contacts, so in
the back of your mouth, the posterior,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.970
some of those molars are really tight
together, and it's hard to get regular

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:36.850
floss in there.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.680
So that person should use waxed
false because the wax actually

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.520
gets in there easier.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.220
It slips in there, and it's
easier to get through.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.330
So again, you should try different
types of floss and see what

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.470
works best for you.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.460
OK, now flossing, though, of course,
some people think, eh, I can do it

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.610
once a week.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.640
But you say twice a day for flossing.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.990
Yes.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.890
The three most important parts of
your oral hygiene is having--

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.080
brushing twice a day-- minimum--

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.930
flossing twice a day, and rinsing with
mouth rinse twice a day as well.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.490
OK, now, of course, one of the most
important parts is coming to see the

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.110
dentist. How often should
we come see you?

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.310
Twice a year.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.770
If you have the best oral hygiene in the
world, you still have to come see

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.060
a dentist. It's important to have a
professional cleaning and to get

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.310
examined by a dentist. There are a lot
of infections and diseases that

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.580
actually show signs in the oral cavity
before it spreads elsewhere--

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.660
oral cancer, leukemia, HIV. These all
shows signs and symptoms in the mouth.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.220
So the dentist is almost like a
detective and can detect some of these

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.760
symptoms before it becomes a problem.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.040
OK, well, thanks so much for
joining us, Dr. Kantor.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.460
I think I'm ready to go floss.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.135
How about you?

00:04:37.135 --> 00:04:37.970
Thanks.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.440
Thank you.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.030
To recap, you need to get a good
toothbrush, an electric, like this

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.515
one, or there's lower-cost options, like
this battery powered or manual

00:04:47.515 --> 00:04:50.810
one, and change them out
every three months.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:51.225
Toothpaste.

00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:54.790
The must-haves are cavity
fighting with fluoride.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.610
But today you can also get toothpaste to
whiten, to fight gingivitis, or for

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.080
sensitive teeth.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.850
So talk to your dentist about your
needs and spend a little

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.850
time in-store or online.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.860
Try a few out and see what
works best for you.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.990
The floss.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.430
Remember to floss below the gum
line where the bacteria live.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.440
Mouthwash.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.140
It can do more than just
freshen your breath.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.700
It can help kill germs that cause
plaque, gingivitis, and bad breath.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.210
Use it twice a day, morning and night.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.240
