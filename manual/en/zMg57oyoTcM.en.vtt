00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.640
I'm Sara O'Neill and today I'm here at
the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.320
I'm a freelance fashion stylist.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.920
Vintage fashion
is a big inspiration in my work

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.160
and one of my favourite eras
is the Edwardian era.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.560
I've been asked to promote
the museum's Titanic exhibition.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm going to recreate the look
of a first-class passenger

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.680
who may have been on board
the Titanic.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.120
In fashion
we saw a new eastern influence

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.720
with turbans, harem pants

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.320
and feathers being worn
by the fashionable set.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.720
And the most popular couturier
of the day, Paul Poiret,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.640
introduced a new style of dress
that was simple and elegant.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.200
Here the waistline
crept up into an Empire line,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.080
trains shortened,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.360
and the crippling S-bend silhouette
of the previous decade

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.880
gave way to a natural slim shape.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.040
The young women loved it.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.840
But which dress am I going to choose?

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.520
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you too.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.600
Let's do this.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.440
Edwardian ladies
liked to wear their hair high,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.360
especially in the evening.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.200
Balls of padding
helped achieve that high-volume look.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.560
Natural hair extensions were common.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.040
Ladies used horse hair or saved
their own hair from their hairbrush.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.080
The higher the hair
the better the impact,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.920
so first-class ladies finished up
with feathers, tiaras,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.600
anything that gave
the illusion of height.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.400
This popular style
had a soft finish with a lot of volume

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.800
to help take the weight off the face.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.680
A slim figure was essential
and achievable thanks to this,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.720
the modern corset of the day,
made using metal boning.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.160
The corset was worn over combinations
or a shimmy and drawers

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.920
and a petticoat was worn over the top.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.800
Fashion was big business on the Titanic

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.040
and first-class ladies would
change outfits up to six times a day.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.880
That's dedication for you.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.560
Sorry, Sara.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.920
We won't make you
sit down in it though.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.240
Traditionally, make-up was seen

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.040
as something just worn
by actresses and prostitutes,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.080
but by 1912
shops like Selfridges in London

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.480
were beginning to sell it
over the counter.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.160
First-class ladies on Titanic
would have secretly ordered supplies

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.200
and they applied them
with great discretion.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.160
The pale, natural look was popular and
rouge was added for a youthful flush.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.640
So, are you ready
for your evening dress?

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.240
You look amazing!

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.080
Wow! What a difference!
