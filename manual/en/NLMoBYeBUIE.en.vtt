Hi this is Michael Burton with michaelburtonfilms.org
located in Salt Lake City, Utah and we are

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:10.020
here talking about how to use Microsoft Windows.
Now I want to talk to you about how to defragment

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.390
your computer thus making your computer run
faster. Let me start off by saying that Windows

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.470
XP is a registered trademark of Microsoft
and I am in no way affiliated with Microsoft.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.110
O'kay defragmentation of your computer is
so important. As a matter of fact I don't

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.570
think a lot of people understand, at least
not in my family that defragmenting your computer

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.780
is one thing that helps your system be healthy
and it lets your system run better. We all

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.380
get files on our computer that we get on,
we delete, we upload more, we upload programs,

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.410
we delete certain files, we delete music,
we delete videos, we upload more, we download

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.649
stuff off the internet. We are always moving
and shifting around files. So our system gets

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.140
bogged down with all these files and programs
and then when we start deleting things and

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.350
we are also reinstalling new programs the
computer has got to find a place to put it

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.360
and so you know you have a certain amount
of space on your computer and what defragmentation

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.020
does is it takes all the gaps that have been
created by you deleting your programs and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.780
reinstalling programs and then you deleting
those and reinstalling other video clips or

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.090
whatever it is it takes those gaps and moves
those files around to close the gaps and basically

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.409
makes it easier for your archives to find
your programs and your files a lot easier.

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.890
Let me show you how this works. If you go
into your Start Menu and you go to your Control

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.750
Panel. Open your Control Panel and again under
Performance and Maintenance is where you will

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.900
find the defragmentation. It is right here.
What I like to do is I like to do a free up

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.540
space on your hard disk first and what that
does is that gets rid of any unnecessary files

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.439
that you don't need any more, temporary internet
files and programs that you are not using

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.990
any longer. When you are on the internet your
internet downloads certain files to your temporary

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.810
internet files which keeps the websites running
faster when you go to them but they are unnecessary

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.459
and they take up space on your hard drive.
But the moment you delete them it leaves gaps

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.730
and holes in your computer system so eventually
if your computer is running really slow and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.889
stuttery or it takes along time to boot this
could mean that you need to defragment your

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:22.250
computer. If you scroll down here you can
also set up under scheduled tasks you can

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.629
also set up a defragmentation on a weekly
basis. I actually do it on about a weekly

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.719
basis if not twice a week because I am always
uploading and deleting files and so my computers

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.219
seem to get really bogged down and they run
really slow. If you go up here to where it

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.930
says rearrange items on your hard disk to
make programs run faster, that is a defragmentation

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.919
and go ahead and click on that one and let's
open it up and let's drag that down to the

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:52.419
center of the screen. This is your disk defragmenter
menu here. This shows you the different drives

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:56.252
that you can defragment any drive and let's
go ahead with the C drive. We are going to

00:02:56.252 --> 00:03:01.609
highlight the C drive and then when we scroll
down here to the bottom this says we can either

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:07.650
analyze or defragment. If you click defragment
it will automatically analyze your hard drive

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.739
before it defragments but I just click analyze
anyway and let's click analyze and it will

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.340
show you what happens at the top here, right
up above here. As you can see over here in

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.459
the center it says that it is analyzing. Now
you see all these colored bars that is telling

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.860
us you should defragment the following and
let me tell you why. Let's click those. If

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.799
you notice all these colored bars we also
have a key down here that shows us the different

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.120
colors and what they mean. The fragmented
files are the red which is what we are worried

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.140
about. The blue is the contiguous files, the
unmovable files and the free space. You can

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.409
tell by these bars that we don't have much
free space by these colors. There is not much

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.169
white. The blue are some pretty big files
that I don't move a lot and of course the

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.889
green are unmovable that we don't move. The
red is the fragmented space that we want to

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.419
get rid of and as you can see there is quite
a bit of red space. The bigger the chunk means

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:05.939
the bigger the file that originally occupied
that space. Most likely it was a video clip

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:11.079
or something. This is your estimated disk
usage before our defragmentation so it shows

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:16.620
you what your disk space looks like. You have
got a lot of fragmented files and barely any

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.030
disk space so what we are going to do is we
are going to click defragment and under here

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.009
it is going to show our estimated disk usage
after the defragmentation. So after the defragmentation

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:32.220
runs. So once we click on defragment it goes
into the like I said the analyzation mode

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.750
again where it is going to analyze your system.
Now it is saying we don't have enough free

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.909
space in order to run the defragmentation
because technically you have to have at least

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:48.930
15% of space on the computer to run the defragmentation
and we have 12% but it says that you only

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.650
use 7% for the disk defragmenter so technically
we shouldn't be running the disk defragmenter.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.550
I'm going to show you how to do it. I'm going
to click yes to go ahead and run it so you

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.010
can see what happens. What happens is now
we have this bar down at the bottom that says

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.199
estimated disk usage after the defragmentation
so as the computer is being defragmented the

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.879
red spots should begin to disappear. Now because
of the lack of space on the system I don't

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.949
want to run this too long because I don't
know if it is really going to do much or not.

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.139
That just means that I need to clear off a
few more files but basically what you should

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:26.069
see down here is no red marks at all and mostly
all white.
