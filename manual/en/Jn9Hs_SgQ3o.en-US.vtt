What sup guys,

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.470
Today I'm going to review something different.
And that is The Invisible Backpack. And it's

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.320
what I think the perfect backpack for a YouTuber
like me. But is it the only backpack you'll

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.320
ever need?

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.960
Last year, The Invisible backpack was a successful
kickstarter project. The idea was to make

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.630
a backpack that would focus on utility instead
of fashion. It became a slow fashion peace

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.689
to always fit the clothes your wearing but
with a lot of performance and durability.

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.210
So what really makes this backpack awesome
to me is that it has these cool invisible

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.739
compartments. When I took a first look at
the backpack it was discovering one ever the

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:40.149
other.

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.860
So like I said. I've traveling a lot these
days and I used the Invisible backpack to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.460
do that.
When I open the main compartment there is

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.280
really a lot of space. In fact, this backpack
has a volume of 20 litres.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.109
Just to put it in a little bit more perspective.
Your average backpack contains around 24 litres.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:01.170
And the dimensions? Well the invisible backpack
is a lot taller and thinner then you're used

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.320
too. It's widest point is at the top. I guess
this is done because with the shape the backpack

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.290
is designed is has to stay really easy to
get stuff in or out.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.750
But Because I'm a pretty tall guy, these dimensions
suit me just fine. This shape also makes the

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.720
weight balanced more evenly across your back.
But i can imagine the backpack being a little

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.390
too tall for a person below average height.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.810
Now to the utility aspects. This backpack
has 5 compartments to get yourself really

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.290
organised. I really liked the fact that you
don't have to put everything mixed with each

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.159
other anymore.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.659
So we got two compartments at the top. One
main compartment and one for your macbook,

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.200
it will fit a 15 inch macbook pro. On the
front I like to put my cables, chargers and

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.570
a hard drive. The materials used to make these
compartments are rubberised and protective,

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.380
even waterproof.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.590
On the side i'll put something to drink and
maybe my iPad Mini or phone. And sometimes

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.579
when i'm on my way to the gym, i'll bring
some extra shoes and now I can store them

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.219
separately in the bottom pocket.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.960
In the main compartment there is still enough
room door my shirt, some pants, and my camera.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.009
So there you have it. Last week I traveled
with it a couple of times and I was really

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.170
surprised with how easy it is to find and
grab something. To me it really made my day

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.330
a lot easier and I think the design looks
ahead of it's time. And because it's so durable

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.250
and strong I really feel more secure putting
my expensive gear in there instead of my regular

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.890
backpack.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.640
I think this backpack could definitely become
the only backpack you'll ever need. But i'm

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.190
very curious to know what you think! Would
you buy this backpack for 190 euro's?

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.210
