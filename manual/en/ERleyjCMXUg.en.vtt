00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.330
If you're selling your home,
keep millennials in mind.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.890
They're 75 million
strong and house hunting.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.580
Millennials want move-in ready.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.960
They want to cook in
that kitchen from day one

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.590
and entertain in the
backyard that very weekend.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.320
Consumer Reports says
the right renovations can

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.730
boost your home's value by 35%.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.480
So spend your makeover money
where it will count the most.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.170
A Consumer Reports survey of
more than 1,500 millennials

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.660
nationwide found a modern
updated kitchen tops their list

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.710
of the ideal home features.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.160
And you don't need
to spend a lot.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.750
For as little as
$5,000, you could

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.880
add a new suite of stainless
steel appliances, new flooring,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.640
and new countertop.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.870
You'll have a clean,
contemporary look

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.890
that could lead to a 3% to
7% bump in the sale price.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.000
Have a bigger budget?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.110
Think about knocking
down a wall.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.080
Millennials are also looking
for an open floor plan

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.210
with flexible
living space, which

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.620
could increase your selling
price another 4 to 6%.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.640
Another good way to add value is
by expanding the living space,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.770
maybe by finishing
an attic or basement.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.360
And it's always a good idea
to use materials that don't

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.010
require a lot of maintenance.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.120
Like counter tops
made of quartz,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.708
which shrugs off heat,
scratches, and stains.

00:01:21.708 --> 00:01:25.140
Also, consider ditching
dust-catching wall-to-wall

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.490
carpet in favor of
durable hardwood floors.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.130
And don't overlook
the power of paint.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.400
A fresh coat, particularly
in high traffic areas,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.130
can boost your selling
price and another 1% to 2%.
