00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.000
Um, excuse me.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.000
Yes?

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:18.000
An hour ago I came here with my friends and bought this Pocky.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.500
But there is no Pocky in the box.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500
Did you already eat it?

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.500
I didn't eat it, the box is empty!

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.000
I want to talk to your manager! Please bring him here.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.500
One moment please.

[Bag: Secret. Placard: Mister Manager.]

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.500
Excuse me, Mister Manager.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
A customer bought an empty box of Pocky.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Huh? An empty box? How terrible, hm?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But... I know nothing.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This is...

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500
My secret Pocky stash.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
After I take them out of their boxes...

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
...I put them in this bag...

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
...and enjoy them in secrecy.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Delicious!

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.000
HEY!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.500
Give back that Pocky!

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.500
Huh?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Give it back!

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.000
I don't have any Pocky.
