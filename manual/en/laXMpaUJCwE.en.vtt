00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:07.430
We are in step number 5 of the single braids
style in this step I will be showing you how

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:14.210
to seal the ends of your braids first I'll
show you how to sue your ends by simply using

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.960
hot water then I will show you how to sell
your ends with a braid sealer to begin I will

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.940
first show you how to seal the ends of your
braids by dipping them into hot water and

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.539
then I will also show you a second way of
sealing your braids by using a braid sealer

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.059
in please note that by using these products
in these techniques there is a potential risk

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.150
because of the water itself and because of
using the braid sealer as well these products

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.379
can get extremely hot so you have to be responsible
and know that your safety is in your hands

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.580
so first I'll show you how you will be dipping
the ends of your braids in the water but to

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.590
begin I want to note that you must use a cup
with a cool handle as you dip your braids

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.560
in the water the reason why I like to use
a cup is because it only contains a small

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.850
amount of water in it limits the splashing
that can happen when you dip your braids also

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.789
the reason why you want to make sure that
you have a handle on the cup is because at

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:21.360
any moment you possibly may have to reach
and grab your cup and you want to grab a cool

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.130
handle it does not get hot versus driving
grapping the entire cup itself and also you

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.130
will be needing scissors to trim the ends
of your braids as well so to begin you want

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.049
to make sure that you have your hair sectioned
into two sides so that you can dip each side

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:45.270
and one also you have a dry towel in front
of you because when you pull your braids out

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.599
of the water you will have a barrier protection
to wrap your braids around as you rinse off

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:57.599
and ring out any water so what you have to
do is grab one side of your braids and since

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:06.309
they are a lot of braids you just going to
go ahead and roll them all the way to the

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:13.510
now that we have the ends here you just going
to gather them slowly dip it into the water

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.670
you want to be careful in you do not want
to lean on the cup at all so you are just

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.099
going to emerge it for a little bit and just
shake it just a little bit to release any

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:31.250
air bubbles and as you bring your braids out
you want to make sure that you have your towel

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:40.890
in front of you to catch any water and steam
so out I pull my braids and then I am going

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.909
to use my towel to protect me as I dry out
the ends so I to do is just squeeze down to

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:54.569
braids as I go all the way down to ring out
any water inside help get any steam off of

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:06.620
the braids 
just know that you only need to submerge the

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.700
bottom of your braids because that's where
you want to seal them so now that I have dried

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.690
off my braids and they feel comfortable to
the touch and they are pretty warm now what

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.680
you want to do is just grab a small braids
at a time and your scissors and you’re going

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:58.040
to trim off any wispy ends that stick out
of place 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.319
so when sealing your braids with water you
want to do the same thing to the other side

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:08.730
of your braids as well for second option I
will be showing you also how to seal your

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.239
braids with a braid sealer now that I have
shown you how to sell the ends of your braids

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.709
with hot water I will show you how to do so
with a braid sealer if you will like to know

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:27.070
more information on a braid sealer make sure
to go to howtoblackhair.com for more so first

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.110
I will begin by taking a section of my braids
is closest to the front of my face to show

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.490
you exactly how you want to seal off the ends
so on the sealer I have two different sized

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.930
holes one for large braids and one for small
braids that I can use to seal the ends so

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.940
whichever applies you can go ahead and squeeze
the braid into the opening of your sealer

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.500
so I am going to grab my first braid in my
sealer is already hot so I am going to grab

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.690
a braid and I'm just going to go up a couple
of inches from the bottom of the braid and

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:09.599
pinch it with the sealer so I insert it into
this cone-shaped opening pinch the braid and

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:17.550
now it’s already sealed this is much better
than using a lighter or a candle lighter because

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.830
when you do that most times the flames shoot
up the hair and that's the possibility of

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.789
bringing yourself or your hair or your scalp
so you must be careful when you're dealing

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.710
with any tools even the sealer because you
could potentially burn yourself if you're

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.900
not careful but this is great because there
is no fire or flames it simply just melts

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.919
the fibers of your hair so right now I am
going to grab another one and show you how

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:49.639
easy it is to use a braid sealer something
a little more braid than simply going to go

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:56.699
up a couple of inches from the bottom I'm
going to pinch off the braid and now my braid

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:05.981
has been sealed in this step I have shown
you how to seal the ends of your single braid

00:06:05.981 --> 00:06:12.900
extension part I show you by simply dipping
the ends of my braids into hot water then

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:19.660
I show you a second method by simply using
a braid sealer in the next step, step number

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.210
six I'll show you the finished results to
your single braids style
