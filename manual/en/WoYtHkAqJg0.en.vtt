We all love to eat and why not? Good food
like good friends is one of life's great joys.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.580
But when it's handled improperly, food can
make you ill. Millions of Americans get sick

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.550
each year from food poisoning. The experts
call it foodborne illness. And the fact is

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.020
that some people who are over 65 may be more
likely to become seriously ill from harmful

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.359
bacteria that can be in food.
Foodborne illness results from eating food

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:40.070
that contains harmful bacteria. When foods
like meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs are

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.769
handled, cooked, or stored improperly, these
nasty little critters multiply. Through science,

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:53.120
we have discovered new and dangerous bacteria
that can be found in food, bacteria we didn't

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.460
even know about years ago. Science has also
helped us identify illnesses that can be caused

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.290
by bacteria in food, illnesses we didn't recognize
before.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.840
One of the other things that we know today
is that some people, including seniors, can

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.940
be more likely to get sick from bacteria in
food. And once we get sick, it can lead to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.640
more serious health problems. So we need to
pay particular attention to how to handle

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.640
food safely. Sometimes it's hard to see if
food is unsafe because you can't see, smell,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.060
or taste the bacteria it contains. And if
you do eat a food that contains harmful bacteria,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.880
you may not become ill right away. Usually,
foodborne bacteria causes illness within 1

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.630
to 3 days, but you could become sick anytime
from 20 minutes to 6 weeks after eating some

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.270
foods with dangerous bacteria.
Sometimes foodborne illness is confused with

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.820
other types of illness. If you get foodborne
illness, you might be sick to your stomach,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.200
vomit or have diarrhea. Or symptoms could
be flu-like with a fever, headache and body aches.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.200
The best thing to do is check with
your doctor. Foodborne illness is dangerous,

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.700
but it's often easy to prevent. By making
a few lifestyle changes, you can cut your

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.900
risk of getting sick.
