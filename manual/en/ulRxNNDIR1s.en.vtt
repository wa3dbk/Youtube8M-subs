Egypt, 2011

00:00:50.304 --> 00:00:54.397
And there was a new king in Egypt, who couldn't be stopped.

00:00:54.983 --> 00:00:59.060
Said he to himself: Here are the people of Egypt, so many and so powerfull,

00:00:59.414 --> 00:01:01.474
Let's take advantage over them, for they shouldn't get so many

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:08.388
and a revolution will come upon me, and they shall hate me as well, and they shall fight me through...

00:01:08.604 --> 00:01:09.304
Facebook!

00:01:09.585 --> 00:01:15.203
For decades we have been suffering here

00:01:16.044 --> 00:01:21.691
The dictator got stuck to his chair

00:01:22.456 --> 00:01:28.570
Oh, Egyptian, wake up! From now on we won't give up!

00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:35.530
From the darkness we shall see the light!

00:01:36.058 --> 00:01:37.078
Mubarak, go!

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:40.306
You don't rule here anymore!

00:01:41.488 --> 00:01:48.429
Don't mess up with a ragious people!

00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:50.052
Mubarak, go!

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.095
Things will be different from now on!

00:01:55.464 --> 00:02:01.752
Mubarak, go! Go away!

00:02:13.935 --> 00:02:18.291
My good and sweet child

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.109
Don't be so sad

00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:28.600
It's true, we supported the president

00:02:28.802 --> 00:02:32.286
It's time to retreat

00:02:32.516 --> 00:02:37.618
Before we get captured... damn, Mubarak, don't go!

00:02:37.618 --> 00:02:39.427
Mubarak, go!

00:02:39.863 --> 00:02:42.047
Because the blood will spill!

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:50.209
Everyone who still supports you will find himself get killed!

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.594
Mubarak, go!

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.758
Because Egypt will be turned over

00:02:57.105 --> 00:03:03.156
Untill you are deposed!

00:03:03.561 --> 00:03:12.171
Tomorrow we may regret...

00:03:15.806 --> 00:03:21.003
Mubarak, Come back!

00:03:23.794 --> 00:03:49.956
