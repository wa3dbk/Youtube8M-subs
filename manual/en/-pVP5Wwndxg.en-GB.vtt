00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.390
I had a dilemma when buying a new camera recently.
Since I have a 4K monitor, I also wanted a

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.260
4K camera to make the most of it, plus I like
storing videos in the best quality possible.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.170
But at the same time, current cameras under
a thousand pounds can only record 4K at 30

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.470
FPS. I want 60! My next plan was to get the
cheapest camera possible to tide me over until

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.189
they improved, but I didn't see the point
in spending money on something I didn't want

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.449
to use. I researched the Panasonic camcorder
line-up and I'll condense hours of findings

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.970
into 30 seconds for you:
The cheap 100 and 200 series are kind of like

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.140
phone cameras but have marginally better image
quality and fantastic optical zoom. The 500

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.960
series gets improved image stabilisation,
even better zoom and extra features such as

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.820
wifi and something that tells you if the image
is straight or not. Above that is the 700

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.660
series which is the first decent one, is bigger
and comes with a better sensor, connections

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.380
for an external microphone and other features-
but a worse zoom than the cheaper ones. Above

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.260
that and you get Panasonic's top-end hand-helds
that take footage that's about as crisp as

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.800
a photo camera would. The latest top-end generation
also features 4K, but only at 30 FPS. And

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.720
above that they cost thousands of pounds,
look like bad-ass movie cameras and finally

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.870
support 4K at 60 FPS.
Above the budget models, there's this weird

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.090
middle-ground where you can get something
good, but why spend more and stop short of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.200
the top models, which themselves are just
a bit more again? Using this logic, it wasn't

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.730
long until I was back to looking at the Â£600
4K cameras! With much self-restraint I decided

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.940
that only the 100 and 200 series were within
my budget. I then looked at what was available

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.310
second hand. With laptops and cameras I think
it's worth the gamble of getting something

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.410
used but with a superior spec. I ended up
getting myself a Panasonic HC-V520 for Â£200.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.030
It's a few generations older than the current
line-up but has comparable image quality,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.350
which is the big thing for me.
So why did I need to upgrade? Well, my old

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.520
camera was a Panasonic HDC-SD5. It's bigger
than my new one, the flappy movey bits of

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.420
it feel a lot more robust and I suspect was
more high-end when it came out, but has aged

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.730
badly. The battery no longer keeps charge,
the screen no longer works and, perhaps more

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.040
worryingly, it no longer saves half the footage
I record on it and it only stored videos in

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.600
interlaced, not progressive, making moving
footage appear less detailed. And I can't

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.620
see the screen to know what's wrong. In this
comparison you can see that it's also got

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.630
an annoying Matrix-esque green tinge to the
screen and a narrower field of view, making

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.690
it harder to film in enclosed spaces. I'm
sorry for the zoom there. As I said, I can't

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.400
see what I'm filming with that camera, so
this accurately represents what it's like

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.610
to use.
That being said, my new camera's quality is

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.020
noticeably inferior to my parent's top-end
model. The grain is particularly present in

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.370
low-light environments. But I don't care,
because it's got a feature that I've sorely

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.470
missed for a long time: it has a super-powerful
optical zoom! You can have as much quality

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.990
as you like but if you can't zoom in enough
to capture what you want then it's wasted.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.110
And it's surprising how often I need more
zoom than most cameras can offer me.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.870
Ignore 'intelligent' or 'digital' zooms. They
come at the expense of quality and end up

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.890
reducing the footage to a load of wobbly pixels.
With Optical you can really capture what's

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.720
important. This camera also doubles up as
a telescope for me. I've identified strange

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.000
structures that I've wondered about for ages.
I can read far-off signs and perv on bikini-clad

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.660
women from a-far. I don't really do that last
one. OR DO I? No I don't. BUT MAYBE I SHOULD!

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.840
No, I won't.
So yeah, if you're looking for a cheap but

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.420
cheerful camera, at least get one with an
awesome optical zoom. It's funny that cheaper

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.500
cameras tend to have more powerful zooms than
the high-end cameras, which I guess rely more

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.180
on a good sensor to keep things crystal clear.
Although phones and the like are rapidly catching

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.310
up in other areas, dedicated cameras still
have the edge when it comes to zoom capabilities.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.230
So in conclusion, my personal recommendation
for buying a camera is that you need to look

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.300
for image quality, but also a good zoom. Be
sure that it's got a comparatively wide angle

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.989
lens as well or you'll struggle to get things
in the shot when you're filming indoors. 50p

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.340
is pretty much the standard now. Luckily it
seems as though all of these features come

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.389
as standard on more recent Panasonic cameras.
And as for 4K, I don't think that I'll ever

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.879
get a camera that can do it at 60 fps. You
lucky people in America have it easy, since

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:32.759
that's the standard. Here in Europe we can
only get 50 fps which is annoying when computer

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:38.749
displays are 60. It doesn't mix well in Youtube
videos. I have emailed both Sony and Panasonic

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:43.469
and neither do 60 fps in Europe- the only
way would be to import a camera from America

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:48.470
and to pay about Â£100 in import duty. My
cheap camcorder purchase looks more sensible

00:04:48.470 --> 00:05:09.709
by the minute.
