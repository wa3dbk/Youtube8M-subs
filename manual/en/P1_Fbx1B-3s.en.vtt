00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.350
Even taken on its own terms, Assassin's Creed
4: Black Flag is an abject disappointment

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.250
by any rational criteria.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.590
And proof positive that Ubisoft learned less
than nothing from their Revolutionary War-era

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.539
teething difficulties, and further: Given
that - bafflingly - the worst game in the

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.040
series inexplicably wound up setting sales
records from here to Neptune... it's hard

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.400
to find fault with their analysis of basic
economic cause and effect.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.780
If The Beatles recorded a jazz record that
outsold their other albums five-fold, you

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.640
can be damn sure they'd release another fuckin'
jazz album.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.460
It's capitalism, I understand, and there's
absolutely nothing wrong with it.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.670
What I don't understand is Ubisoft's failure
to correct basic problems that even the game's

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.020
proponents acknowledge!

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.280
Even the most in-the-bag, stamp-a-barcode-on-my-forehead-and-assign-me-a-name-with-a-decimal-point-in-it,
bought the fuck OUT 'professional' reviewers

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.409
seemed to echo my criticism that if the third
Assassin's Creed's introductory sequence were

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.480
any longer, Ron Jeremy would be sliding it
down the throat of an underage Traci Lords.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.640
Four hours in and your screen is still weathering
an unyielding bombardment of insightful tutorial

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.000
snippets like 'hold forward to move forward'
and 'move the right stick... to reposition

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.399
the fucking camera'!

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:22.399
Yeah.

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:23.409
And the cow says 'moo'.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.340
Start the fuckin' game, already!

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.340
This ain't even a game, at this point.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.479
You shoot this fuckin' thing in sepia and
it'd be a Ken Burns documentary!

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.390
The ability to rate the quality of each individual
chapter of the game is a welcome privilege,

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.270
even if we all know damn well those suggestion
cards are more likely to be lining Jade Raymond's

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.009
parakeet cage... than taking up any space
on Yves Guillemot's conference table.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.710
In any event, I can only speculate as to the
unique facial expression rorshach of shock,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.990
dismay, and disappointment in the human race
that donned the faceplate of Ubisoft Feedback

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.460
Drone #3301 when RazörFist's feedback slip
wormed its way beneath the proverbial doorframe.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.999
That shit had more zeroes than 4chan's userbase.

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.090
Though I'd hurry to point out that I didn't
hate Black Flag right off-the-bat.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.310
IN fact, when the game initially kicked off
with the series' trademark parkour-cum-stabby-stab

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.810
formulae, I found myself teetering on the
verge of a grudging recommendation.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.990
...and then Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and
Keira Knightley swung in on a chandelier and

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.950
easily the most boring, procedural, incomprehensibly-repetitive
piracy sim in the history of gaming staggered

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.430
through the doorway, fully nude, in a rum-cake-induced
stupor.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.480
I realize playing a game about pirates, then
complaining when pirates show up is like eating

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.140
shit and complaining about the smell... but
I didn't play a game about pirates...

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.830
I played a game about assassin's, so where
the fuck are they?!

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.430
And even if you were making a game about pirates
- which you fucking aren't - making a pirate

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.380
game, and then devoting half the Peter North-ian
length to blithering tedium like repairing

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.120
your ship and recruiting your faceless crew...
is like making a first-person shooter, and

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.090
then spending half the game watching the fuckin'
guns be manufactured!

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.210
This game suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks!

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.420
And could we possibly make combat any easier,
chief?

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.270
I think I may have actually had to burn 1/16th
of a calorie depressing the 'B' button within

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.920
the prohibitively-brief time window of 5 entire
hours to instantly counter and eviscerate

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.920
literally any enemy in the game!

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.790
I defy you to die even once - outside of ship
combat - while playing Assassin's Creed IV!

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.530
It cannot be done!

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.930
The game's central flaw... the proverbial
flaw from which all other flaws flow... (alliteration)...

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.850
is that Ubisoft Montréal... are about 50
times more interested in playing a pirate

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.140
game... than any of their fuckin' audience
is!

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.240
Even going so far as to antagonize Assassin's
Creed fans in interviews... for daring to

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.600
suggest that the series finally set a game
in feudal Japan or a locale that makes infinitely

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.120
more sense than this failed foray into masturbatory
maritime mayhem.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.760
See also: LITERALLY ANYWHERE.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.290
It appears that the crux of their operative
logic stems from a belief that - while skeptical

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.310
at first - fans would eventually be won over
by the fact that capturing, recruiting or

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.830
sinking enemy vessels is innately fun.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.320
And they're almost right!

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.630
Disabling and boarding enemy ships is fun!

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.790
About 10 fucking times!

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.700
Which is roughly 590 times fewer than you
will be forced to engage in this ceaseless

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.270
monotony over the course of Assassin's Creed
4: Black Flag.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.750
And just what is it about Montréal that compels
their game developer residents to reference,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.890
and repeatedly glorify...

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.890
Montréal?

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.669
You don't see Obsidian setting all their games
in fuckin' Irvine, CA.

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.770
Even though, culturally speaking, California
is about 17,000 times more relevant to a given

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.940
socio-political event... thn goddamn Montréal!

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.590
Look, I'm a francophile, myself.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.520
And a shameless one, at that.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.080
But, shit, let's be real, here.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.700
On its best possible day, Montréal... is
Paris for hipsters.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.230
And without your borderline illegal tax 'incentives'
undercutting every other city in the world

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.470
thanks to WTO incompetence... you wouldn't
even be that!

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.810
So let's stop pretending, for example, that
Montréal should have been in any way relevant

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.450
to the global conspiracy in Deus Ex: Human
Revolution, shall we, Eidos?!

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.770
What the shit were the Illuminati after in
Quebec, anyways?

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.620
A renewable source of alcoholism and bad manners?!

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.790
Abstergo being centered in Montréal is like
General Electric being headquartered in Twiddle-Your-Testes,

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.750
NC, so fuckin' cool it with the self-glorification!

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.510
Or better yet, redirect that creative energy
into writing a story where the entire 'Assassins

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:15.040
vs. Templars' subplot doesn't feel 100% crammed-the-fuck-in
to a piracy story that was never once supposed

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.630
to have anything to do with it.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.630
Gentlemen!

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.240
Brandish your shoehorns, because Al Bundy
couldn't make this shit fit in a Assassin's

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.240
Creed game!

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.330
And it's almost as if Ubisoft know it, too,
because they seem far more interested in resigning

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.830
Edward Kenway to menial bitchwork and repetitive
ship-boarding than even peripherally tying

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:38.070
this character in with the main plot.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.220
With Assassin's Creed 4, Ubisoft Montréal
attempted to marry the two disparate genres

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.070
of stealth and piracy... and wound up monumentally
failing at both in the process.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.410
Your stealth game sucks because every stealth
game that uses checkpoints sucks.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.410
Every.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.410
Single.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.410
ONE.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.930
And after Splinter Cell: Blacklist sold 5
copies worldwide with the same save system,

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.160
you should have fucking known better.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.811
And your pirate game sucks because it's hamfisted
and repetitive, and you spent all of a fuckin'

00:06:04.811 --> 00:06:06.260
year to make the goddamn thing!

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.620
Of course it sucks!

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.250
Let's hope to Alien Precursor Christ that
Ubisoft Montréal didn't lose Patrice Desilets'

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.020
number, because this series needs that man,
and it needs him stat.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.340
Assassin's Creed 3 may have set sales records,
but this game sure as shit didn't.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:26.060
And the deeper you wade into these waters,
the angrier the seas fuckin' get.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.560
Time for a course-correction.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.830
I'm RazörFist.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:57.840
God - fucking - SPEED!
