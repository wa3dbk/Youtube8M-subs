00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:22.789
Sometimes, it makes sense for a 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.730
franchise to stay in Japan.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.670
I mean...mosquito simulators?

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.240
Hamster simulators?

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.810
Pet simulators where your pet is a woman?

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.810
Yeah.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.569
Imagine that stuff selling anywhere else.

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:39.139
Go ahead...simulate it.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:45.199
Then again, for every game that stays in Japan
for reasons that are obvious, there’s a

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.909
game that stays in Japan...that maybe shouldn’t.

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:54.109
There’s a game like this...an adorable platformer
with familiar mechanics and a stout little

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:55.109
hero.

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:00.179
It’s like, a sprinkle of Yoshi, a dash of
Mario and a heaping spoonful of Kirby.

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.690
I mean, that’s a recipe a worldwide audience
would appreciate.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.539
And yet...Starfy stayed in Japan.

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:14.299
That is, until The Legendary Starfy for the
Nintendo DS.

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.869
Finally released stateside back in 2009, The
Legendary Starfy was the character’s American

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.242
debut...after seven years in Japan.

00:01:23.242 --> 00:01:28.770
And again, the strange thing about that is...Starfy
isn’t that different from Nintendo’s biggest

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.770
platformers.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.290
In fact, it’s basically just an underwater
Kirby game.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.939
Nothing fishy about that.

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.109
So there is a story here...uh, something about
a rabbit who wears a space suit.

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.429
He somehow falls from the sky and wakes up
Starfy, and he tries to run away...but then,

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:48.990
Starfy chases after him.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.009
If there’s one area of Starfy where Japanese
weirdness does bleed through, its the story

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.009
and presentation.

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.259
And hey, maybe you’re into that sort of
thing.

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.159
In which case, I got a game where you have
to level up a schoolgirl by buying her Beatles

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.069
LPs and feeding her doughnuts.

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.619
You’ll f*cking love it.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.140
Anyway, gameplay is where The Legendary Starfy
delivers.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.459
A big, fat plate of fantastic Nintendo platforming.

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.900
It’s mostly underwater, of course, and that’s
where the character feels most at home.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.390
Starfy can swim the way you wish other characters
swam in their platformers, in which water

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.440
levels are usually a pain in the ass.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.370
This water isn’t so painful.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.840
In fact, it’s delightful.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.370
He’s like a pointy Michael Phelps.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.260
What I like about Nintendo games—uh, and
their platformers, in particular—are their

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.260
controls.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.069
Super-tight, precise...you don’t even have
to think about them.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.349
And Starfy has them.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.940
What’s more, there’s also an insane amount
of content here.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.830
Lots of worlds in the main quest, each with
fun level design, slick graphics and lots

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.130
of secrets to find.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.140
If you need a break from...doing whatever
it is Starfy is doing, there are also multiplayer

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.950
minigames, a 3D model viewer and Starfy’s
freaking wardrobe.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:18.340
You might see this...obscenely yellow talking
starfish...and think Starfy is a game for

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.040
little kids and otaku.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.840
You would be wrong.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.909
Cut from the same cloth as its iconic peers,
The Legendary Starfy is a fantastic Nintendo

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:33.450
platformer, and a testament to the fact that,
sometimes...life truly is better down where

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.969
it’s wetter.
