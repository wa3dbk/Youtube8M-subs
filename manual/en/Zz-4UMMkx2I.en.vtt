00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:14.275
Well there is a lot of unknown about this Roud-The-World

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:16.294
and for example the destination airport

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.000
so assuming that we go on a planned airport we will have a tent or a fixed hangar waiting for us

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.435
but what if we divert? What if for weather conditions we have to land somewhere we did not plan to?

00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:33.482
Well here we have the mobile hangar, and we can mount quickly the mobile hangar to protect the aircraft

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.069
The fabric used for this mobile hangar comes from the sailing world

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:49.580
It's water proof, fire proof, it has ripstops, and it's inflated by fans 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:57.380
and we do not need to use all the fans at full power, it just depends on the wind speed

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.960
So the more wind we have the higher the pressure inside the two fabrics skins is

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.940
So to set up this mobile hangar

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.720
we need roughly 4 to 5 hours

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.800
to be ready for the airplane to be protected

00:01:17.854 --> 00:01:22.894
To completely close the mobile hangar we need 6 to 7 hours

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:30.540
and to make sure that this hangar will stand 100km/h of wind,

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.060
this is the worst case, we would need something like 10 hours
