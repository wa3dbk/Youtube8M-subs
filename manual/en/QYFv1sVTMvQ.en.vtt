Hello, my name is Mellissa. I will be travelling across Europe on my tour bicycle

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:08.359
to tattoo

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:15.359
a lot of people.

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:19.019
Hi, I'm Melissa Holmes and I am about to embark on a journey like nothing  

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.510
anyone's done before

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.090
i'm going to get rid of most of my stuff

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.939
store the rest of it

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.869
put some paniers on a heavy duty touring
bike and cycle across Europe

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.610
on this trip to the most important thing
i'm going to bring

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.610
aside from a bunch of extra tubes and a tent is my tattoo machine

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.190
(Music)

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.610
I have been an artist all my life

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.710
but it was about three years ago that I bought a tattoo

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.870
and I taught myself how to tattoo

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.330
i wanted to raise some funds for this trip

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.800
so I did a series of tattoo marathons and I did as many tattoos as I could

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.720
in 12 hours

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.660
so it was all back-to-back

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.660
one person in the chair after another... on several occasions about
twenty people showed up...and I did tattoos 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.930
on twenty people in one day...it was a little crazy

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.080
the reason i'm doing this on a bike is

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.030
because it allows me to connect better I think

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.340
I have done a few tours around Taiwan

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.570
It was really awesome. I got to meet some
people

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.200
who I would have not met if I were obviously driving on a 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.160
highway or if I were taking the train or flying on a jet

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.000
you really see the land up close and because you are pedaling through it all

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.019
and especially if you are alone

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.149
people are disarmed, curious

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:15.369
and flattered that you are taking the time to get to know their home so intimately

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:20.879
Alright, so...on March 1st it's all gonna happen. I've got my plane ticket booked

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.909
I'm going to Athens and I am going to start right away.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.299
I'm going to have to basically rely on

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.829
my people skills

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.959
I'm going to have to go to restaurants and

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.650
and the pubs and where ever it is that people are
hanging out

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.259
and just get to talk to people and tell them what I am doing

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:39.529
and just spread the word

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:44.879
I'm going to make a spectacle of myself to be honest. The bicycle that I'm riding is going to have stickers on it that say...

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.159
"The Travelling Tattoo Artist" and I think I'm going to get it printed on my jerseys

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.040
so that it looks like the circus is coming to town

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.869
And...

00:02:53.869 --> 00:03:00.869
Everyone's going to be like, "Who is this tall blonde white girl on a bicycle rolling through town? What's the dilly-o here?"

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:20.009
Suddenly they are in a situation where they can get something done for next to nothing maybe that will open some doors you know. 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.049
It takes one and then they spread the word and the next thing you know I am tattooing half of village and...

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:36.049
there you go, you got yourself an amazing story.

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:38.469
Come with me

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:43.079
I'll be blogging the whole time and sharing all
these tattoo stories as I go.

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.609
come see what the rest of the world
thinks of this

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.229
growing subculture

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:50.509
and see what happens when i come
knocking on their front doors

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:54.229
I hope to tattoo as many people as
possible on this journey

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:56.949
find out how they in return will mark

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:57.399
me forever with their stories
