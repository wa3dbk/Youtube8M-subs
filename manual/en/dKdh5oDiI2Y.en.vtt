Hi, my name is Jodi DeJong-Hughes

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.910
I work for the University Minnesota
Extension.  In this series of videos,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.710
we're going to learn about what is
compaction, how to build a healthy soil

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.090
to resist compaction,

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.260
and what equipment and tire choices are
out there to help minimize the effects

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.710
the compaction in your fields.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.990
In September of 2011, the University of
Minnesota Extension partnered with NDSU,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.129
commodity groups, and equipment
manufactures

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.379
to hold a unique field day near Fergus
Falls, Minnesota. Four soil pits were created

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.120
to demonstrate different management
techniques to help

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.679
'Take Control' of soil compaction. This
video is the third in a series of four

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.420
to help identify compaction and manage
it in your fields.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.050
Randy Taylor, an ag engineer with
Oklahoma State University,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.359
spoke to us about tracks and tires and
managing

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.199
field traffic to reduce soil compaction.
Soil compaction

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.340
is generally categorized as shallow or
deep. Shallow compaction is confined to the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.570
top six to eight inches of the soil

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.280
and it's directly related to the
pressure that is applied to the soil.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.159
For tires, your ground pressure is really
close to the inflation pressure.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.100
Proper tire inflation pressure is based
on your axle load,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.130
number tires, and your tire size. Proper
inflation of your tires is discussed

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.759
in more depth

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.609
in video number four of this series. To
calculate the ground pressure for a track,

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.950
you take the length and the width of that
track and the weight that is supported

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.820
by that track.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.899
It becomes a little more complex when
computing ground pressure for a tracked

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.659
vehicle because of the bogie wheels.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.259
While a track may have an average ground
pressure of 5 PSI,

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.119
there are pressure spikes under the bogie
wheels, bringing up the average pressure

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:51.960
overall.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.380
For both tracks and tires, a higher
ground

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.789
pressure will relate to more compaction than a lower ground pressure.

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.020
That's why it's important to know
whether you have tracks or tires,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.609
what kind of pressure is being put on the
soil. Proper tire inflation for road

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:07.170
speed

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.180
maybe two to three times higher than for
proper inflation in the field.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.250
Using the road inflation rate in the
field

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.660
will create more compaction and could
reduce yield. While it can be inconvenient

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.780
to adjust your tire pressure,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.750
it's worth the hassle to minimize the
compaction potential. One of the advantages

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.610
to tracks

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.730
is that there's no tire inflation
adjustment to make. Deep compaction

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.770
occurs below

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.220
8 inches and is related to the force
applied to the soil

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.630
or the axle load. More weight on the
axle means

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.410
deeper compaction. The weight of larger
tractors, combines and grain carts

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.490
can force compaction down to a depth of
three to four feet.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.900
Since depth of the compaction is based on
your axle load,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.230
both tracked and tired vehicles can create

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.800
deep compaction. While they both can
create compaction,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.990
there are advantages to each system.
Tires have greater stability,

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.180
less vibration, lower initial cost, easier
handling on your contours

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.200
and turning at the edges of the field, and
they have a minimal weight transfer effect.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.610
Tracks on the other hand have
better flotation

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.400
and better ride quality in rough fields.
They have less slippage

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.330
and no power hop and they have better
fuel efficiency in soft fields.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.660
Managing your vehicle traffic is one way
to reduce your compaction.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.950
About eighty percent the compaction
happens on the first pass.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.370
I'll repeat that: about eighty percent of
the compaction occurs on the first pass.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.960
Use this to your advantage! In a normal
year

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.450
as much as 90 percent of the field may
be tracked by equipment.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.590
If you use the planter, the sprayer, the
combine the grain carts and do tillage

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.130
passes across the field, these are all
making separate tracks.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.630
The philosophy behind controlled traffic is
to restrict the amount of soil driven on

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.190
by reusing the same wheel tracks or tram
lines.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.680
By controlling traffic, the tract areas
meant to be compressed,

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.970
similar to a road, while the soil between
the tracks

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.370
is not compacted. The benefits to controlled
traffic

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.270
are improved tractor efficiency and
flotation, less horsepower needed,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.600
improved timeliness of your operations,
reduced

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.410
skips and overlaps and improved soil quality.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.070
The philosophy is different than with
minimizing compaction.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.180
Tall narrow tires are important to
minimize the area driven on in the field.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.210
Over time you'll need to line up your
equipment to follow in the combine

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.680
tracks, such as your planter

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.480
and sprayer. Also track maintenance and
RTK will become critical.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.550
If you want to try controlling traffic
without committing to the entire program,

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.690
start with the most compacting piece of
equipment in your field,

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.320
the grain cart. Since most of the compaction
happens on the first pass,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.710
try driving your grain cart in the old
combine tracks

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.320
and head back out to the headlands to
get to the field entrance.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.300
Don't take a diagonal across a field
where you can create eighty-percent

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.780
more compaction across the field.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.240
When harvesting a small field where the
fields are wet

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.610
or when growing a lower yielding crop
like your soybeans,

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.250
try unloading at the ends of the field,
instead of on-the-go.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.560
Your soil is a valuable resource when
growing a healthy and profitable crop.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.370
Understanding the weight and pressure of your equipment and by minimizing your

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.240
footprint,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.000
you are taking control of your soil
compaction.

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:36.870
 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:37.120
