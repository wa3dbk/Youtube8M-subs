00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.530
If there's one BMW in particular I've coveted
more than any other in recent years it's the

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.530
X6.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.020
I just love its coupe-like SUV styling and
high-performance, which is why I find this

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.410
all-new X4 so appealing.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.240
Like a baby X6, it’s got the looks and the
moves without the big price tag.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.289
Just when you thought BMW couldn’t possibly
concoct any more bodystyles, the U.S.-built

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.800
X4 arrives in their increasingly crowded showroom
for 2015.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.640
Though they’re a mouthful to say and absolutely
meaningless to 90% of car shoppers, the trim

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.220
levels are familiar to those in the know;
starting with the xDrive28i fitted with a

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:54.300
turbo-4 and priced from $47,150 and then for
the sporty-minded, there’s this model – the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.070
xDrive35i motivated by BMW’s famous 3.0-liter
twin-turbo inline 6.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.990
Either way, there are 8 gears modulating power
to all 4 wheels.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.020
This top-trim X4 begins at just under $50,000
and like other BMW Sports Activity Vehicles

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.810
is available in the base xLine and the racier
M Sport line.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.249
Of course, my tester is an M Sport plus so
much more, adding the Driver Assistance, Lighting,

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:32.159
Premium and Technology packages for an as-tested
price of $61,350; about $10,000 less than

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.909
a comparable X6.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.499
I fell hard for the X4 this week, captivated
by its sexier, coupe-styled roofline and the

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:47.590
host of M Sport touches, such as these 19”
Double Spoke wheels, shadowline trim, a muscular

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.359
aerodynamic kit, M steering wheel, sport seats
enveloped in Ivory White leather with red

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.700
stitching and of course this Melbourne Red
Metallic paint.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.719
Though they share a wheelbase, which for comparison
sake is nearly identical to an Audi Q5’s,

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.660
the X4 is actually longer than its traditionally-styled
counterpart the X3 and sits lower to enhance

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.660
its gotta’ go appeal.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.440
It can really jump to life, hitting 60mph
in only 5.2 seconds; 1/10th quicker than the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.440
X3.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.030
The compromise BMW asks you to make in exchange
for the X4’s swagger is in rear seat space

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.610
and luggage volume – both of which take
fairly substantial hits.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.560
But other than wishing for more foot room,
I had no problem getting comfortable back

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.470
here – kids sit too low, however - and the
nearly fold-flat seats with moveable tie-down

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.670
cleats and other clever storage options affords
more room than I would have thought.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.510
At just less than 50 cubic feet, the X4’s
stuff it space even less than in a BMW X1.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.940
With a sporty suspension setup and 300 horses
on tap the X4 is a fun-sized SUV that understands

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.210
that it's still a BMW.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.850
The xDrive system has put to good use this
week as well with the all-season Goodyears

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.340
able to find traction even in this heavy,
wet snow we received.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.600
I wouldn't change a thing about the X4's drivability;
it’s effortlessly powerful, silky smooth

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.130
in its operation and has a very comfortable
ride quality.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.060
The X4 is an excellent alternative to the
X3.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.020
The optional Dynamic Damper Control shocks
imbue the X4 with BMW’s hallmark softness

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.080
while still being able to rip up your favorite
road.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.380
The different driving modes truly have distinguishing
traits, ranging from the gas saving ECO PRO

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.210
with a very smooth start/stop system and coasting
function to improve mileage to the uninhibited

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.200
Sport +, where shifts are exceptionally quick
and the traction control backs off.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.490
The engine is torquey and helps make great
sounds and just like the engine, transmission

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:05.420
and suspension, the steering is also affected
by the mode you choose, getting heavier as

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.541
you climb the ladder.

00:04:06.541 --> 00:04:10.620
It’s a wonderful driving experience and
will certainly please those who want in on

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.269
the small crossover craze but don’t want
to forgo a lively motoring lifestyle.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.930
Even at 4,260 pounds, the X4 feels eager to
turn and always energetic, leveraging the

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.780
xDrive system’s torque vectoring across
the rear axle for improved cornering.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.930
If you achieve the EPA numbers, gas mileage
is impressive at 19mpg city/27mpg highway,

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.349
on premium of course.

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:41.770
An easy step-in height leads to body hugging
front seats and that more commanding view

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.639
of the road SUV drivers love.

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.020
The aluminum trim looks great but I’ve grown
tired of BMW’s cabins in general and this

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.180
one looks like every other with dated orange
lighting and an infotaiment system that’s

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.529
till 50% more complicated than it has to be.

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:03.090
The features are cool with some stand-out
apps like online search but their affinity

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.909
to tiny little symbols is a fail.

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.960
Heads-up display is always welcome but I missed
gotta’ have it items like side blind zone

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.960
alert.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.029
It’s a well-stocked, comfortable, quiet
cabin but I’d love to see BMW get out of

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.139
the 80s and really mix things up.

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.270
This X4 or the Audi SQ5?

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:30.589
Something to ponder while you’re dreaming
of your next hot SUV.
