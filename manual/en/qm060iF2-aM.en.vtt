00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.799
Welcome back. I took the liberty of rolling
out one, two, three of these pastry sheets.

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.690
And I'm going to cut them with a nice, sharp
knife diagonally. I like to stack them because

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.519
that saves time and we all know I like to
save time. Stack them one more time and now

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:26.449
you've got quarters. So just from three sheets,
that yields a lot of pastry dough. Okay? I'm

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.929
going to take my hot dogs and I'm just going
to cut them in half. Because I think that's

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.800
a good bite sized snack for an appetizer.
Alright. You're going to take your pastry

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.359
dough and you're just going to wrap the little
hot dog just like that. Isn't that so easy?

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:51.780
Just take an end and roll it across. And it
looks really pretty and homemade. Now while

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.999
you're wrapping this, make sure that you've
thought ahead and have a baking sheet for

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:02.019
which they will live on. Right here I have
a parchment covered baking sheet. Yet again

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:08.190
because I don't like to clean up messes. Now
a word about parchment paper. You can get

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.149
that at your grocery store. You can get it
in a roll. You can purchase it at the specialty

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:20.329
stores in a larger size in case your oven
yields a larger baking surface. My oven takes

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:26.520
a sheet pan, a regular cookie sheet pan, perfectly,
so. Sometimes I'll buy a larger one and I'll

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:35.930
cut it to the size of my baking sheets. It's
also a very affordable way to have lots of

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.890
parchment for a little bit of money. I'm always
about saving a little bit of money. Okay?

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.189
So we've got our dogs rolling and we're going
to do our next step. Remember the egg wash

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.880
that we made with a little bit of egg and
water. We're going to use that with a pastry

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:59.119
brush and we're going to make the mess one
time. Load them up, all pretty on our baking

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.060
sheet. Put the cross edges down, because it
will hold the pastry in place a little bit

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:16.090
better and excuse my reach. I'm going to take
our egg wash, give it a little stir. I am

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:28.410
just going to lightly brush over the pastry
to create that beautiful golden brown color

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.610
that we so want to pop in our mouths. Now
with these pigs in a blanket, you can serve

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.620
it with a side of ketchup, you can serve it
with herbed gourmet mustard if you'd like.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.110
Maybe some Grey Poupon or Dijon, or a whole
grain mustard. Or you can just set them out

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.150
and watch them disappear. Which is usually
what happens in my house. I'm going to pop

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.030
these in the oven that's waiting at three-fifty
temperature. I'm going to cook them for about

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.110
fifteen to twenty minutes, but I'm going to
check on them to make sure they get that beautiful

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.700
golden brown color. When you come back, we're
going to eat.
