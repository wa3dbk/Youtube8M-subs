Hi guys my name is J and I'm talking on behalf
of Expert Village. I'm going to talk to you

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.990
guys about seasoning your chicken for your
chicken fajitas. You want to come over here

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.670
and take a look at my chicken breast what
you want to do is put this liquid smoke on

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.970
there and you just want to squirt down all
over the side of your chicken. Turn it around,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:28.340
just a couple of squirts on each chicken breast.
What you want to do is rub that all over your

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.519
chicken, the reason I stick the liquid on
the liquid smoke on first is so it kind of

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:38.399
wets you chicken that way the season actually
sticks. Now of course when you are working

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.770
with chicken every time you touch it you have
to go over here and wash your hands everything

00:00:43.770 --> 00:01:01.629
else. Okay I washed my hands I can touch everything
I can touch my seasoning and everything else.

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.520
Take your fajitas seasoning you want to bring
that up high, let me dry my hands actually

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.960
sorry about that. Chicken fajitas seasoning
you want to bring that up high and you want

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.961
to evenly coat your chicken breast all the
way. That way every single bit got a good

00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:30.460
nice chicken fajitas taste.
Guys you don't want to be shy with the seasoning

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.570
you definitely want to coat your chicken and
beef completely. I know some people like to

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.570
put a little sprinkle here and there but hey
man you got to season your meat you got to

00:01:40.570 --> 00:02:01.840
make it taste good. Fresh ground black pepper,
then you are going to get your garlic powder.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:16.150
Garlic powder once again.
You don't want to overdo your garlic powder

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.030
but your seasonings you over do it. You just
got to go in there and get all those seasonings

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.260
worked in there and coat your chicken breast
completely. Some people argue that marinading

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.060
your chicken breast would be better if that
is your preference marinade it go a head and

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.900
do what you want to do. I just use a rub on
everything I don't marinade anything, I let

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.689
the tenderizer and my seasonings work for
me and all my meat comes out nice and tender

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.870
because of that. You can see the ingredients
on the back of the bottle and it should say

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.549
tenderizer on there and you want to look for
that. They also sale meat tenderizer separately

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.920
on a separate bottle if you can find that
that is great and use that separate. Now that

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.540
we have preseasoned our meat you want to let
it sit here for about 20 minutes and then

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.979
it is ready to cook. Thank you.
