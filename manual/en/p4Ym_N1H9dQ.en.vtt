00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.690
We're here in beautiful Mammoth California
and this morning we met with John

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.720
who recently purchased a vacation home.
We talked to him about some of the problems

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.070
he faced not being able to see what's going on
up here when he's down in Southern California.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.020
So we're going to bring him over a DCS-930L
so he can keep an eye on his home 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.400
when he's not around.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.400
Steve: All right we're here with John at Crowley
Lake at his winter home. 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.010
Can you tell us a little about it?

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.499
John: Sure this is a new home to us. We've
had it for just a little over a year.

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:35.739
Purchased it in December of 2009.

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.949
Steve: Why did you get this home? And why
did you choose here to do it?

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.629
John: Well we've been coming up to Mammoth
Lakes for about 25 years running and staying

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.229
with friends.

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:48.799
Steve: So what are you doing when you're not
up here skiing?

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:51.589
John: We're home in Southern California working.

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.039
Steve: All right and do you have any surveillance
here to look after your house.

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.039
John: We don't and we'd very much 
like something like that to view 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:10.399
over the internet and check on the house. 
Make sure that the driveway is plowed. 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.140
To see what the weather looks like outside. 
And maybe take in some of the 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.140
beautiful vistas around the house.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.509
Steve: Great! Well we have a DCS-930L here
for you today. We're going to install it and get

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.140
you setup with it.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.600
John: Fantastic!

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.640
Steve: All right, let's go.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.969
John: All right, let's do that.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.280
John: That's great! Oh here's full screen,
there we go.

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.280
Steve: Thanks John for letting us come over
and setting up a DCS-930L for you.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.819
John: Steve, I really appreciate it. That
is so cool. Its just absolutely fantastic.

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.720
I'll be able to share it with all of my friends
and family. Most importantly I'll be able

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.790
to check on the house and the weather when
we're down south.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.989
Steve: No problem, I'm glad we could help
you out.

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.019
John: I really appreciate it. 
Thanks again, Bye.
