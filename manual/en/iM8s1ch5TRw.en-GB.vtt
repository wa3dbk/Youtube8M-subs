00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.260
Many people find the very thought of insects
disgusting - especially when they're in your

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:04.850
mouth. But

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.969
have you ever considered that insects could
be more nutritious, environmentally friendly,

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:09.690
and abundant

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.360
than most other foods? Should we all be eating
insects?

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.770
Compare 100 g of crickets, to 100 g of chicken,
beef or pork, and you'll find they have comparable

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.690
protein content, but crickets are much higher
in essential vitamins and minerals such as

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.640
calcium, zinc

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.240
and iron. Similarly, insects like mealworms
are low in fat, and contain large amounts

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.890
of fibre.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.910
But, that's not the only reason to incorporate
them into your diet. Currently there are 1.53

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.180
billion

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.130
hectares of cropland and 3.38 billion hectares
of pastures covering our Earth. Essentially,

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.360
38% of the

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.970
land you see on a map is used for agriculture
and farming. But where it takes 200 square

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.660
meters of land

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.100
to grow 1 lb of beef, it only takes 15 square
meters to grow 1lb of crickets.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.989
Furthermore, by 2025 its expected that 1.8
billion people will live in areas with little

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.320
to no fresh water. And yet, 70% 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.790
of our fresh water sources are
used in agriculture alone! To produce 1 kg

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.670
of beef it takes

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.189
22,000 litres of water, whereas 1 kg of pork
takes 3,500 litres, and 1 kg of chicken takes

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.039
2,300 litres. But

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:18.270
to make 1 kg of crickets? It only requires
1 litre of water! This is because insects

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.869
can become fully

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.799
hydrated just from the food that they eat.
They're also more digestible - In fact, 80%

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:24.719
of a cricket is edible

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.189
and digestible compared to 50% of a chicken
and 40% of cattle.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.459
And its not like our mouths have never tasted
insects before. For every 100g of spinach,

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:34.099
50 small

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:38.429
insects like aphids, thrips and mites are
permitted. Peanut butter is allowed to contain

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:39.609
roughly 30 insect

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:44.090
fragments - such as heads, bodies or legs
- per 100g. And even the hops used to make

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.630
your favourite

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.560
beer can contain 250 aphids per 100g. Yup
- your summer beer may be spiked with a little

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.329
more bug juice

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.759
than you anticipated.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.219
So WHY aren't we eating insects? They're actually
consumed in some parts of Asia, Latin America

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.630
and Africa.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.399
In fact, the capital of Congo has
households eating 300 g of caterpillars a

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.859
week, which is 96

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.009
tonnes of caterpillars every year! But much
of the Western world is used to screaming

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.759
in disgust if

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.030
they find a bug in their salad! This may be
because western culinary traditions have spawned

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.250
out of

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.260
colder climates with less insects, increased
farming and larger animals to eat. As Europeans

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.700
began to

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.170
colonize the world, they contextualized bug
eating as savage and primitive because they

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.920
observed many

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.090
indigenous people doing it. Little did they
know, bugs are actually extremely nutritious!

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.030
But while the idea of eating insects may literally
be hard to swallow, as recipes are created,

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.010
processing technology evolves and our mindsets
adapt, maybe insects will become the superfood

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.580
of the future. 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.220
Look out greek yogourt and kale! There
are some new kids in town.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.980
We actually challenged ourselves to chomp
down on some bugs, try out a few recipes,

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.330
and eat things

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.390
like cookies and snack bars using insect flour,
in our latest AsapTHOUGHT video. We also discuss

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.770
the role

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.870
and potential for insects in helping to solve
world hunger. Make sure to click the screen
