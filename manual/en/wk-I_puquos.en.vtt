00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.919
Speaker 1: We're going to start moving into
a little bit of football training here.

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:06.470
Use cones, use bags, use whatever you got.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.180
The most important this is you're doing the
work at 100 percent intensity.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.910
We got here six rows of cones.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.540
It's going to simulate a bag.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.289
In this drill, we're going to place two down
a little bit farther to let ourselves get

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.480
out and sprint after we get through the cones.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.830
This drill here we're going to sprint forward,
we're going to shuffle from side to side;

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.710
I'm going to go to about half speed, show
us what we're doing here.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.710
You're going to give it as shuffle.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.779
You're going to come up to the next cone,
and we're going to try to get somewhere.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.570
It's a little bit of linear, lateral, movement
we're trying to work on.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.540
When he gets to the end, he's going to sprint
it out.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.860
Jog on back here.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.860
Notice he's got the bands on.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.860
The reason why we use KBands is to use the
resistance to build a little bit of hip strength

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.380
and drive our leg up with power.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.920
When we do these we're going to go about six
to eight reps with resistance and then we're

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.400
going to move down from four to six without
to really start working with the lighter feeling

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.500
in our legs and develop that speed.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.090
Let's go ahead and go at a couple, full speed
here.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.150
Notice he's really planting on that outside
foot and he gets out and goes.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.799
Let's take a quick look while he gets back
here.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.590
When you get in this position, you want to
be in a balanced, low position.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.460
You're going to shuffle as you get to the
point where you're going to go the other way,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.850
make sure you get a good base and stay centered.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.740
If you leave this foot out too wide, you're
not going to be able to get out and go.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.119
If you leave it too close, you're not going
to be able to shift your weight, evenly, to

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.399
get to the next cone.

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.240
So make sure you get in a place where you're
balanced, shift and go.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.950
Let's see another one here.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.810
Full speed, he's got quick feet, he's planting
that outside foot, he's low.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.079
He's got power, he plants and gets out and
go.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:54.429
Good, remember six to eight with resistance
four to six, without.

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:00.109
Want to go one more with resistance, and then
we're going to do a couple for you, without.

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:03.270
Get out and go, get out and go.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.439
Be quick, be quick.

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.810
Hit it, and go.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.810
Good.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.170
Each of these exercises, make sure that you
sprint through the cones, pull up, walk back.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.590
You want to work at 100 percent intensity,
so if you lose your breath, slow it down a

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.459
little bit because we're not going to use
this as much as conditioning as we want to

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.650
use fast feet.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.950
You can go ahead and unclip.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.020
Good.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.110
Now here, make sure your first rep, you keep
a good center of balance.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.400
You don't want to get out of control now that
your legs are going to feel a little lighter.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.050
You still got to make sure you keep your center
and work to make your feet move faster.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.050
All right, you ready?

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.050
Here we go.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.970
Come on, move, move, move; be quick, be quick,
be quick.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.310
Get out and go.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.299
Good, great job.

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.819
Walk it back, take a deep breath, slow your
body down.

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.519
Here we go; be quick, be quick.

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.689
Get around, get around, get around.

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:13.549
Be quick, get out and go.

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.370
If you get any rubbing or anything like that,
make sure to wear sliders underneath.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.310
It'll hold your bands still.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.049
Always work with resistance.

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.290
Work as fast as you can.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.290
Stay centered.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.290
Keep your balance and push the pace.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.579
