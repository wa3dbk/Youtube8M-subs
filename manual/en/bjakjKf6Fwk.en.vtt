00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.130
Rekenrek is a name for a small abacus-like
math learning tool.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:14.130
"Reken" (pronounced as raken) means doing
math or arithmetic. The word looks like our

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.499
English word, "to reckon."

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:22.499
The meaning of reckon is to calculate, add
up, total, count or number.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:32.300
Rekenreks help students develop conceptual
understanding about numbers.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.539
This math tool is made up of two rows of stringed
beads

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.199
There is a repeating pattern of five beads
of one color and five beads of another color

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.800
on each row

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.339
Begin with first five colored beads to help
children learn to subitize.

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:58.339
One whole row of beads is used to build fluency
to ten and two rows 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.680
of beads are used to build fluency to twenty.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.189
Subitize means that we help children learn
to see the quantity of a set of objects without

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:37.189
counting. Most of us can subitize up to five
objects. The Rekenrek has five red beads and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.369
five white beads to help students learn to
"see" or visually identify quantities

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.679
up to five.

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:52.570
Fluency means knowing how a number is composed
and decomposed or put together and taken apart.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.829
This familiarity with numbers helps children
develop more flexibility and efficiency to

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:03.249
solve problems

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:10.249
Lets try one together. On a Rekenrek, seven
looks like five and two more. We have five

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.310
red 
beads and two white beads.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.069
13 looks like 10 and 3 more. We have 10 ten
beads on the top row and 3 beads on the bottom

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:38.069
row. We could also 
show 13 as 5 five red beads on the top row
and 5 red beads on the bottom row which makes

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.280
10. We add 3 white beads to make 13.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.280
The next slide gives you examples of different
ways to show the number 4.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.510
Using rekenreks empowers students to examine
problems in their own way. How about incorporating

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.129
rekenreks in your classroom?
