00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:04.419
[Music]

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:05.740
We might be a nation of bargain hunters.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.120
But we don't shirk when it comes to game shooting.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.520
One of the most expensive, extravagant, exciting
shooting experiences is glorious grouse on

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:23.500
the glorious 12th and to mark it the boys
from Browning are stepping out in style.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.310
They are going to show off their guns, they
are going to be gunning the engines of some

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.349
superb modern shooting brakes - and you are
going to walk away from this film with expert

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.760
tips for shooting driven grouse.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.379
In preparation for some shooting later in
the season they're taking three versions of

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.199
their top end B25s out for the day of simulated
grouse.

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.059
First they're stopping off at an appropriate
pile in the country for some refreshments

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.489
and to let the cars 12-cylinder engines cool.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.489
12!

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.819
- I see a theme developing here.

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:01.179
What better way to celebrate the start of
the grouse season, or the game season in the

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:06.390
UK, the glorious 12th by incorporating some
beautiful guns in the B25, fantastic game

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.390
guns.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.570
Some beautiful cars, the Astin Martins and
the Bentleys, all 12 cylinder of course bringing

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.720
that combination of the glorious 12th and
glorious 12 cylinders together and a beautiful

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.310
location here at Brocket Hall today.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.670
And start of the season on the 12th August,
it all comes together very nicely.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.420
The cars are on loan from HR Owen in Cheltenham.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.500
At this point we'd be asking Dom to help us
out with the facts and figures of these British

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.800
beasts, but he's not coming until later, instead
we have Bentley brand manager Paul Carvell

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.800
on hand.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.590
This is the Bentley GT speed, W12 engine 616
break horse power.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.299
Fastest road going saloon that Bentley have
produced to date at 205 miles per hour.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.179
Next we have got the Astin Martin V12 Vantage
roadster.

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:00.819
Underneath that bonnet they have squeezed
the V12 6 litre 510 break horse power engine

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:01.819
into the car.

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.259
Top speed of 190 miles per hour.

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.939
0 - 60 in 4.1 seconds.

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.700
GTC speed again will catapault you from 0
- 60 in 4.5 seconds, but all of the comfort

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.190
and luxury of a Bentley.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.849
The Astin Martin Vanquish Flightship of our
range 565 break horse power V12 engine all

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.239
carbon ... pretty stunning car with ... engine.

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:32.390
Get a mental orgasm!!!!If the cars don't do
it for you the guns will - but more about

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.129
them in a minute...

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.689
Our backdrop of Brocket Hall has an infamous
connection with exotic motors.

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:43.730
It hit the press in the 1990s when Lord Brocket
was jailed for burying supercars in the grounds

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.290
of the house and claiming on the insurance
- but those were Italian cars, so his actions

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.099
are entirely understandable.

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.290
Today it's an exclusive golf club and venue.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.420
It was originally built in 1760.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.489
Obviously owned by the Brocket family which
is quite a well known story I am sure.

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.140
Our company took it over in the early 90's
and built it up to what it is now two championship

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.870
golf courses.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.329
The award winning restaurant over there as
well and the hall over here as an exclusive

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.329
use venue.

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.159
Right that's enough pre-grouse moor posing
- we need to make sure these guns are able

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.200
to strut their stuff when it matters.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.260
So we're off to Atkin Grant and Lang shooting
school just a few miles away.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.370
They've been busy here developing a special
stand for anyone wanting to experience the

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.080
next best thing to a driven day .. they also
offer sartorial advice, Dom.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.230
So this isn't your typical stand at your average
clay ground.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.480
So can you talk us through the set up you
have got here.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.180
Yes, what we have got here we have actually
got stone from Yorkshire.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.580
We have had this shipped down for us.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.430
We have got heather here which you will find
on a grouse moor.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.110
As you can see it is sunk into the ground
so as we look out we can't see any traps or

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.110
anything in front of us.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.660
It is very similar to when you are grouse
shooting you have got low horizon.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.930
We have got six traps out here so they will
just appear.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.930
And we have also got traps you can move around
so you can just shoot them over each shoulder.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.510
So this really is as close as you are going
to get to the real thing.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.510
Absolutely.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.250
Yes absolutely and we do spend a lot of time
setting up the targets so that they are actually

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.400
coming down hill into the butt instead of
a lot of clay targets will go up over you

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400
like a partridge target.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.630
I have done a bit of shotgun shooting Charlie
but clearly I am a peasant and driven grouse

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.520
is not something normally open to an amateur
like myself.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.660
So could you give me a few tips on what I
should be doing.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.660
Yes, absolutely.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.050
So when you are actually shooting grouse they
are coming a lot faster and a lot flatter

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.300
than pheasants and partridges.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.760
So instead of a pheasant being nice and high
you are going to give it a long lead in front.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.360
These grouse are coming very flat and you
have got to get out there at them.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.921
So a target when it is coming in towards you,
a lot of the time you can still see the bird

00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:50.670
over the top of the gun because the gun is
pointing up into the direction where it is

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.670
going.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.320
Ok so there is not a great deal of lead.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.640
But you have to be quite positive with your
lead.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.000
Yes, absolutely so it is really important
to get the line of the bird so if the bird

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.170
is quartering in towards you, if he is coming
in towards you and just fairs off to the side

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.190
just go onto the wing tip in the direction
it is going.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.450
Let's hear a little more about the guns on
show today.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.910
Each of our three Browning guys has a different
model, but all of them have been hand crafted

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.080
by the gunmakers and engravers at the Browning
Custom shop in Liege, in Belgium.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.390
We start at the top and the pair of B25 D5Gs
in 20-gauge on loan from Reeves at the Royal

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.640
Berkshire Shooting School.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.650
I mean this is the top of the market gun.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.170
Obviously it is £66,000 for a pair it is
not something you buy lightly.Thankfully there

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.350
is a lot of money still around and people
do like to buy the best.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.352
We are in the market of supplying probably
the finest game gun in the world, certainly

00:05:44.352 --> 00:05:50.940
for balance and feel and we do have a number
of people requesting guns like this on a weekly

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.310
basis and that is why we have a 24 month lead
time.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.790
Next is the 28 gauge B25 on loan from Ian
Coley Shooting Ground and it suits Andy down

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.170
to the ground.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.830
It is one of the few guns in life which is
both aesthetically pleasing to the eye and

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.030
is also more reliable than most and is hard
working.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.230
If you go to any gun shop in the country you
will find B25's that have been around from

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.860
the 50's and 60's, plenty from the 70's and
they are still working and going strong today.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.070
There are very few guns or models that you
will find that have been going that long and

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.580
that well.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.430
Lastly it's the biggest Browning with the
biggest Browning team member, Allister.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.930
Starts from around £22,000.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.380
This one actually comes with a few extras.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.270
Such as the round pistol grip here and this
one is my personal favourite because it is

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.900
the 12 bore calibre and obviously being the
biggest chap out of the three it brings down

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.900
the biggest birds.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.090
But it is a beautiful weapon.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.490
Great investment, great value for money and
it is around half the price of a D grade side

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.560
plated gun.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.750
So value for money it is superb.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.130
They say money doesn't bring you happiness
- but it certainly gives you choice.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.050
It could mean deciding between a Aston or
a Bentley or if they don't raise the hairs

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.440
on the back of your neck, a pair of B25s just
might espcecially when the birds are coming

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.510
at you like little rockets.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:16.860
If you want anymore information about the
custom shop and these B25s email info@isbrands.com
