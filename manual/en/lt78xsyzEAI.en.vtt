Hey folks it is Barry here welcome to my virgin
kitchen I am here today with Stephan who is

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.990
from actual Berlin in Germany.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.500
Hi guys how is it going alright?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.500
Yeah.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.540
He has come all the way to see me here in
the kitchen and we just made this fantastic

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.620
coconut chicken curry, it is fantastic you
can see it on the screen right now.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.150
It is looking so so good, how would you describe
that taste mate, very creamy authentic indian

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.599
tastes and flavours so good nice little chilli
spank in there too and the coriander running

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.210
through it if you want to have a go at making
this hit pause on the video when Stephan clicks

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.779
his fingers.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.260
Alright hit pause jot those ingredients down
this is how we did it.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.650
First grab a big old pan with some oil in
there get it nice and hot before adding the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.550
onion that is a whole one chopped up, 2 garlic
cloves, they have also been chopped push those

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.230
in, 2 cm of fresh ginger gives it a nice little
twang, 3 tablespoons of curry powder, your

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.930
turmeric goes in after that for some nice
orange and yellow contrast right there and

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.540
some freshly chopped chilli.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.440
Feel free to play around with those quantities
it is looking good.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.581
So all the colours in there were looking gorgeous
it was time to add in our key ingredient for

00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:10.100
this recipe, right Stephan?

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.740
Yes we added in our chicken thighs, which
are a lot more juicy than chicken breasts

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.330
definitely chicken thighs in a curry are so
good.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:27.620
Stephan took the lead again by using some
brown rice, so we cooked that up to package

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.660
instructions right?

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.660
Not really!

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.990
We cooked it 3 minutes longer, yeah package
instructions it was not even al dente like

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.729
pasta thing, it was pretty hard indeed.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.150
So there are more steps with your curry to
do, work on those while your rice is bubbling

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.150
away.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.380
Ok guys now add the tin of tomatoes, the coconut
milk and the peanut butter, also add the freshly

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.890
chopped coriander and let it bubble away.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.150
That is right you want it to bubble away for
a good twenty minutes while the rice is cooking

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.530
through let all those flavours mingle around
the room.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.619
Was it smelling good to you?

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.240
Yeah it was very nice.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.080
Yeah is was so good and feel free to play
around with those flavours you suggested adding

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.480
some chilli flakes in there or some salt,
pepper, even some more curry powder ramp it

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.480
up to your liking.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.370
But once it is ready guys take your cooked
rice, to package instructions right, yes or

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.650
a little longer.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.450
Get the rice into a big old dish, spoon down
your chicken curry topping add more sauce

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.700
if you like, freshly chopped coriander and
chilli on there to finish and it was tasting

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.700
absolutely amazing.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.450
So that is it then guys, thanks so much Stephan

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.450

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.450
