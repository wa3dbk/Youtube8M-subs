Hello, Calvin Jones here, Park Tool Company 
with Tech Tuesday

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.560
in this video today we're going to look at the procedures 
for sizing a new chain to a derailleur bike.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.080
There are two basic procedures:
 the easy way and the hard way.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.240
it's generally accepted that we route a chain

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.119
from the largest rear sprocket
 to the largest front sprocket,

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.399
we want to add one inch of chain,
which is two rivets.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.900
So let's look at the hard way first.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.840
First we move the derailleur all the
way to the largest sprocket in the back

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.760
move the front derailleur to
the largest sprocket in the front.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.480
Now we will take the chain and 
route it through the rear derailleur

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.360
We come over the lower pulley in a 
straight line to the upper pulley

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.600
We come behind the cogs, in our 
case we want the largest cog

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.360
we feed the chain through

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.220
we feed the chain onto the front sprocket

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.550
and now we are ready to pull the chain

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.620
and size the length.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.670
We pull it as tight as possible,

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.180
I engage that chainring but I cannot
join the chain here.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.970
This outer plate cannot be joined to that outer plate

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.480
although we think it's as short as
possible, not really

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.340
we have to back up a rivet worth

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.570
so we get this outer to an inner.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.160
We count over one rivet and two rivets,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.100
I'm gonna mark that just to make it easy to remember.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.680
I will now reach my chain
tool and...

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.820
There has to be a better way... and there is!

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.260
Begin by getting the derailleurs out of our way

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.580
The rear derailleur: put it down to the smallest cog.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.320
Now, let's take our chain.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.160
We're going to route our chain over the largest cog

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.760
We're going to bypass and skip those pulleys altogether.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.100
We're gonna come to the front ring,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.760
make sure I am engaged on the back,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.920
I am engaged on the front

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.560
where would we join this? Similar situation here.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.800
I can't cut it here: I would have an
outer plate connecting to an outer plate.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.290
I have to back up a rivet.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.710
This is where I could join an outer plate to an inner plate.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.340
From this point here recall we count over one, two,

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.989
there's that same black mark that we saw before.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.440
That is the same result as before, but
this way we're not fighting any tension.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.120
The chain is not flipping around, it is much easier.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.920
We can now take this to the workbench, 
make our cut, and we're ready to install.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.130
Thank you.
