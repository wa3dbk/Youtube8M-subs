00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:09.700
I'm just feathering out the mold lines. A
lot of people do this when it's dry. I like

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:22.180
to do it when it's wet. Whatever works for
you. I kind of feather out that little cheekbone.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.859
This is my own wet clean. A lot of people;
when they say wet cleaning; they've fired

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.799
the porcelain, then dipped it in water, and
sanded it. This is my version of wet cleaning.

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:43.739
I don't know how many people do this, but
it's the way that I do it. It works for me.

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:56.530
I'm just wetting those seam lines, and running
my brush along them. There's a little bump

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.750
in the porcelain, so I'm going to take my
wet slip, and fill in those little bumps.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.990
I think that wet cleaning this way is not
as messy. I don't have as much dust. Dust

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:19.300
is hazardous. Because my pieces are small
I can do this. I don't know how it works on

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:28.860
larger pieces, but it seems to work on this.
Her head is a little wonky, so I 'm going

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:39.780
to have to let her rest, or we're going to
lose her head. This is a piece of convoluted

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.830
foam. They use it for mattresses, and I've
taken it, cut a circle out of it, and put

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:51.050
it on a tray, and this way, I can rest my
pieces in this tray while I'm working on something

00:01:51.050 --> 00:02:00.640
else, and they can just sit here. It gives
a cushion, and a little bed.
