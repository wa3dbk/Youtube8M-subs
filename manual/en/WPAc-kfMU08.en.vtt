00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.460
Oh wow, it feels so good to be back from the
hospital.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.059
And I just can't believe the doctor got the
gender wrong at the ultrasound.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.460
The last few months we've been preparing to
have a girl, and it turns out our baby's a

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.460
boy.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.220
You got your way after all.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.800
We now have a Kristoff Jr.
Luckily, my mom mailed us some of my baby

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.939
clothes from when I was a boy.

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.519
Let's get him out of this pink stuff right
away.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.369
Hang onto the pink clothes he's wearing though.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.780
Maybe someday we'll have a girl.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.700
Yeah, and we could name her Krista.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.700
Krista?

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.700
What?

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.220
Is that the girl name for Kristoff?

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.610
I don't know about that.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.480
Wait, wait, wait, before you change him, let
me get some pictures.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.110
Cause after all, this is the first outfit
he's ever worn.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.640
(click)
And when he's in high school, we can embarrass

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.210
him with these pictures.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:59.159
(click, click, click)
Oh Kristoff Jr., you're so cute, you're so

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.159
cute.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.309
(kiss)
(click, click)

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.030
And let me get some pictures of you holding
him, when he's dressed up like a girl.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.460
(click)
Okay, okay, that's enough.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.940
Okay, while you get Kristoff Jr. changed into
boy clothes, I'll change the bedding.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.780
I really liked this girl bedding too.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.760
Right now I'll just use your blue baby blanket.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.740
His crib's ready, so we can put him down in
a little bit.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.340
But first, family hug!

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.430
Ah, a baby Kristoff sandwich!

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.460
Ooh, that gives me an idea.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.460
Family selfie.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.620
Let me get my camera.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.020
Okay, I got my camera.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.020
Say cheese.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.330
(Click)
And get a picture of me sitting down with

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.380
Kristoff Jr.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.090
You can never have too many pictures.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.540
(click)
Smile!

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.880
(click)
Auntie Elsa's here to see her beautiful baby

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.880
girl.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.909
Ugh, why is she dressed like a boy?

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.300
The doctor read the ultrasound wrong.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.819
He thought it was a girl, but really, it's
a boy!

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.819
Wow!

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:10.849
That's wild.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.010
He looks so cute.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.330
Anna, he really looks like you.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.110
Luckily, he escaped Kristoff's nose.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.340
No offense.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.540
Well, I guess these pink pajamas I was going
to give you are useless now, but he would

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.780
probably love the teddy bear.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.970
Here you go buddy.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.510
And of course lets take some pictures of Kristoff
Jr. and his new teddy bear.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.520
Here let Auntie Elsa hold him.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.030
Sure just don't pinch his cheeks okay?

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.370
I wouldn't do that!

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.500
Oh, you guys are so lucky.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.600
And I'd be happy to babysit anytime you need.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.430
Oh believe me, we'll take you up on that.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.060
(click, click)
Well, sister, I'd better head out.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.650
I have a hot date with Prince Charming's cousin.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.410
Congratulations on the cute baby boy.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.630
Oh, thank you, see you later sis.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.630
Bye.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.760
Honey, I'm going to put Kristoff Jr. down,
then we can have a nice quiet dinner, just

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.950
the two of us.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.700
Goodnight, cute little baby guy.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.800
Sleep tight.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.540
Oh, this is so nice.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.430
Just dinner, you and me.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.470
Yes, it's nice to have some quiet, just you
and me time.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.030
(baby crying)
Well, that didn't last long.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.530
I have a feeling we'll have a lot of interrupted
dinners.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.080
(music)
(clicking)

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:56.730
Whoa, whoa, whoa, honey, enough pictures.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.280
Way too many pictures!

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.769
