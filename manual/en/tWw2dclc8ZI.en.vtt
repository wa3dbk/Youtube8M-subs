00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.600
Ok we're looking at Green Day American Idiot
main riff

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:30.020
Starts with a G sharp 5 power cord, low string
fret 4, A string fret 6, and the D string

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.699
fret 6 using my first, third and little finger
for that shape

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:42.160
and going to play that twice.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.800
Then throw the shape directly up a set of
strings

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.460
All those notes and play them up a string
higher

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.000
So just change shape based of the E string,
now it's based of the A

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.559
Take the initial shape that you played of
the low 3 strings and put it down on the second

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.559
fret

00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:25.880
Ok...go back to the C sharp 5 power cord based
of the A string

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.520
play it once

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.609
go to your first cord play it once

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:37.280
and then the one that based on the second
fret which is an F5 cord

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.760
that's the end of your first riff.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:53.960
Then play all of that again but miss out the
last cord and play the top 4 strings only

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:01.180
and did you see that I muted that sound at
the end so you didn't get to hear that jarring

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.180
sound at the end

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.999
it's an effect used on the track

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:08.429
and you don't hear that for long at all.

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.410
