(cheery rock music)

2
00:00:10.407 --> 00:00:12.018
We just started Module 24,

3
00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:14.385
I'm actually finishing up Module 22,

4
00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:16.915
and I feel like the momentum is building.

5
00:00:16.915 --> 00:00:19.459
I think listening is sort of the biggest thing,

6
00:00:19.459 --> 00:00:21.529
and I think it's something that I've started doing

7
00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.165
outside of the clients that I'm seeing.

8
00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:26.048
Trying that with my friends and family

9
00:00:26.048 --> 00:00:27.814
just to sit, and listen,

10
00:00:27.814 --> 00:00:30.617
and breathe like Joshua says in the modules.

11
00:00:30.617 --> 00:00:32.363
Recently a good friend of mine

12
00:00:32.363 --> 00:00:35.945
went into the hospital and I've been visiting her a lot,

13
00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:38.545
and I really was able to utilize those skills

14
00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:40.488
by going and sitting with her,

15
00:00:40.488 --> 00:00:42.586
and listening to her, and not telling her

16
00:00:42.586 --> 00:00:45.158
what she should do, or she shouldn't do.

17
00:00:45.158 --> 00:00:47.390
And I left there after the first visit

18
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.811
really connecting that

19
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:51.322
"Wow, I'm putting this skill to use"

20
00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:52.402
and it was really cool.

21
00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:53.663
So I have two clients.

22
00:00:53.663 --> 00:00:55.299
One of the people I'm working with

23
00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:57.539
kind of came to me initially saying

24
00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.889
she wanted to lose weight.

25
00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:01.976
And as we got to talking, I found out

26
00:01:01.976 --> 00:01:03.740
there was a lot more in her life that

27
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.332
she wanted to improve.

28
00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:07.420
So whatever I can do to support her

29
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.308
in making those changes, if I'm able to do that,

30
00:01:10.308 --> 00:01:12.927
then I feel like I've done my job.

31
00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:15.681
When somebody has this a-ha moment,

32
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:18.650
or this light-bulb go off, I absolutely love it.

33
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.132
If you would've told me when I was a kid

34
00:01:21.132 --> 00:01:23.662
I'd be paid to do this, I just would've been like

35
00:01:23.662 --> 00:01:25.578
"Yes, this is amazing."

36
00:01:25.578 --> 00:01:27.299
I absolutely don't think there's

37
00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.249
any better feeling than helping someone.

38
00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:31.798
In the past month it's been strange,

39
00:01:31.798 --> 00:01:33.335
I've had friends that I've known forever

40
00:01:33.335 --> 00:01:34.612
e-mail me out of the blue,

41
00:01:34.612 --> 00:01:36.897
asking about food and nutrition things.

42
00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:38.274
I don't know if it's just in the air

43
00:01:38.274 --> 00:01:40.478
since they know I'm in the program,

44
00:01:40.478 --> 00:01:42.639
but I think I get a lot of cooking questions

45
00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:43.907
and that's kinda perfect for me,

46
00:01:43.907 --> 00:01:44.936
since I love to cook.

47
00:01:44.936 --> 00:01:45.813
So we have to cook,

48
00:01:45.813 --> 00:01:47.195
what's your favorite style of cooking?

49
00:01:47.195 --> 00:01:48.471
Do you like freestyle, or
Oh yeah.

50
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:49.669
Yeah, me too.

51
00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:51.326
See for my log I have to make recipes

52
00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:52.790
and take notes of everything,
Oh awesome

53
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.740
but I don't cook like that...

54
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.157
