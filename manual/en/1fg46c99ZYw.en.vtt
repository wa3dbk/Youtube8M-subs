00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:25.321
Kayla: Hi, welcome to our blog. I'm Kayla.

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:26.691
Kaytie: And I'm Kaytie.

00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:32.511
Kayla: And we are bringing you a very exciting blog. We're going to be

00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:37.366
doing a lot of beauty, which we both know a lot about.

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.726
I'm a make-up artist.

00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:39.646
Kaytie: I do hair.

00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:44.756
Kayla: Yeah, and a bunch of fashion. We're both moms.

00:00:44.756 --> 00:00:50.936
Kaytie: Yeah. We want to focus onto being a single mom, or being a mom

00:00:50.936 --> 00:00:57.146
and getting stuff together, and keeping yourself healthy and active

00:00:57.146 --> 00:01:00.859
and fashionable, but still being a mom.

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.479
Kayla: Totally. Because you don't have as much time, so we're going to

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.299
bring it straight to you. Quickly, we're going to go over a lot of

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.809
different workouts. As much as we hate it, we love it.

00:01:12.809 --> 00:01:18.289
And Hell, we're really into Hell. She is.

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.371
Kaytie: I'm getting her on that bandwagon.

00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:23.044
Kayla: Right, right, so you guys can start with me on that.

00:01:23.044 --> 00:01:26.304
Kaytie: So, every week, we're going to go and pick out an outfit for

00:01:26.304 --> 00:01:30.266
you, and, each week, we'll have a different category, like this week

00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:36.206
is our under-$100, next week may be a winter outfit, or Valentine's

00:01:36.206 --> 00:01:38.626
Day is coming up, so we're going to try and think of some cute date

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:42.726
night outfits for people that they can go and find. We'll let you know

00:01:42.726 --> 00:01:46.706
how much they are and where you can pick them up, kind of just doing

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:49.596
the leg work for you so that you don't have to go

00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:55.026
and rummage through all those racks in stores.

00:01:55.026 --> 00:01:56.626
Kayla: Got it for you.

00:01:56.626 --> 00:01:58.036
Kaytie: Yeah, it's going to be cool.

00:01:58.036 --> 00:02:00.448
