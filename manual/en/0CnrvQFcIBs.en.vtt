Hello guys, my name is eXtremhightech

00:00:02.224 --> 00:00:03.854
and today I am going to tell you

00:00:03.854 --> 00:00:06.774
how to flash the new CWM recovery.

00:00:06.776 --> 00:00:14.200
You, of course, need to watch my root tutorial video in order to fully use and understand this video.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.810
First, before we are going to install the new recovery, I am going to

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.527
answer the question why you would need a new recovery.

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:24.821
So basically if you open up the recovery you can see here:

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:27.701
The recovery is dancing like on a danceparty.

00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:30.729
But if you see in comparison

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:35.110
The new CWM Recovery you immediately notice

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.342
that this recovery is much more user friendly

00:00:37.342 --> 00:00:41.131
and much better to use if you are debugging things

00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.368
and it also looks better.

00:00:44.368 --> 00:00:48.261
So I am going to tell you now how to install the new Recovery

00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:52.328
because this recovery is much better and it is

00:00:52.328 --> 00:00:54.566
really easy to accomplish.

00:00:54.936 --> 00:01:00.283
In order to do this we first have to boot the phone into the bootloader.

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:01.666
So here we are in the Bootloader:

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:05.328
From the Bootloader we have to select the Fastboot Mode

00:01:05.328 --> 00:01:06.071
using the power button.

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:10.936
And after that we have to connect our phone to the PC.

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:14.041
Now we need to do the next steps on the PC.

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:18.149
Before we can flash the recovery we have to download it.

00:01:18.152 --> 00:01:22.742
Just simple click the link that I provide in the video description

00:01:22.756 --> 00:01:25.020
and there you will find the download link

00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:28.384
to the new CWM philz image.

00:01:28.384 --> 00:01:33.066
In Dropbox you just hit "Download", save the file

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.974
and after that copy it to your fastboot-win folder.

00:01:35.974 --> 00:01:42.386
After you copied it you should have a file called

00:01:42.386 --> 00:01:44.507
"recovery_cwm.img" in this folder.

00:01:44.512 --> 00:01:47.759
Now run the run.bat in the folder.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.696
The usual "recovery.img" over here is your

00:01:50.696 --> 00:01:53.037
"dancing" CWM Recovery.

00:01:53.038 --> 00:01:55.546
What you have to do here is to run everything,

00:01:55.546 --> 00:01:58.592
Let's check if our device is being recognized

00:01:58.592 --> 00:02:00.063
so type "fastboot devices"

00:02:00.063 --> 00:02:03.236
Yeah, it detects one device in fastboot mode,

00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:05.155
that's our device, that's good.

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:08.458
Now we need to flash the Recovery.

00:02:08.458 --> 00:02:10.639
We do this by entering:

00:02:10.653 --> 00:02:21.803
"fastboot flash recovery recovery_cwm.img"

00:02:21.803 --> 00:02:24.740
You can use the auto-complete feature here too.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:35.729
Just press "TAB" to auto-complete.

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:39.713
After you did that just hit "ENTER" and it is sending the file

00:02:39.713 --> 00:02:41.471
and it is writing it.

00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:46.017
Now you are done on the PC and now let's take a look at the result:

00:02:46.017 --> 00:02:50.121
So, we now here get back to the bootloader and after that

00:02:50.124 --> 00:02:57.605
go into the Recovery and wait for it to load.

00:02:57.605 --> 00:03:03.543
Then we can instantly see the improved recovery.

00:03:03.543 --> 00:03:07.332
Let's wait for it...

00:03:07.334 --> 00:03:10.632
Yeah, and you see now, there is no dancing anymore.

00:03:10.664 --> 00:03:19.200
Everything is good.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.230
So I would recommend you to install this recovery

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.087
because it is really cool that it is not dancing

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:33.983
and you can keep better track of what is currently happening.

00:03:33.983 --> 00:03:38.562
So, that was just my quick video on how to install the new recovery.

00:03:38.562 --> 00:03:40.661
I think that this is really really useful

00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:44.604
and I think that this version of the Recovery

00:03:44.604 --> 00:03:48.690
was really necessary to make, so thank you for

00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:52.398
making this recovery and I hope that you guys

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:54.878
enyojed my video (and subtitles :P ) and thanks for watching.
