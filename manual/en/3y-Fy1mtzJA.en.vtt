00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:06.099
Some Christians cannot receive the Holy Spirit.

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:12.919
They pray and they long for the Holy Spirit
but they just never receive him.

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:18.518
Sometimes they think that God doesn't exist
anymore or cannot give them the Holy Spirit.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:24.449
Or they think that God does not want to give
them them the Holy Spirit.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:33.838
I will tell you why many Christian cannot
receive the Holy Spirit; it is because God

00:00:33.838 --> 00:00:45.019
does not give the Holy Spirit to those whose
hearts are dirty and in darkness in sin.

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:56.029
First you must clean up your heart, and repent
of your sins and get baptised in water in

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:59.549
the name of Jesus Christ.

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:07.898
Then you will be pure to receive the Holy
Spirit of God.

00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:13.729
God's spirit does not dwell with sin doers.

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.129
IF you want to have the Holy Spirit and have
the Father answer your prayer and give you

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:29.769
the Holy Spirit, to lead you and to guide
you and so you can pray in other tongues,

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:35.939
then there are certain things that you must
do.

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.589
First you must repent and clean up your heart.

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:51.699
Obviously we ourselves cannot make ourselves
clean, I know that, but what we do is WE must

00:01:51.699 --> 00:02:02.439
leave the darkness and come into the light
and Jesus will cleanse us from all sin.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:10.539
THEN you must get baptised in the name of
Jesus in water.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:22.228
The Holy Spirit will flow into you and baptise
you when you pray to the Father with a CLEAN

00:02:22.228 --> 00:02:29.469
heart that Jesus Christ has cleaned and you
will have the guidance of the Spirit come

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.859
to abide in you.

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:43.329
If you continue in worldly living and in any
darkness you will not be able to receive the

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:50.889
Holy Spirit and God will not give you the
Holy Spirit until you REPENT, until you clean

00:02:50.889 --> 00:03:01.719
up yourself before the Lord and you have Jesus
purify your heart so that you will qualify

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.418
to receive the Holy Spirit.

00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:11.558
God does not give his Spirit to everybody,
only those who have been cleansed by the blood

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.219
of Jesus.

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:20.129
You cannot be cleansed by the blood of Jesus
if you continue in darkness and in sin.

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:25.939
Christians who live IN sin, do not qualify
to receive the Holy Spirit.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:32.530
They are in darkness and if the light they
think they have is actually darkness, then

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.369
how deep is their darkness!

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:41.519
If you really want the Holy Spirit today and
you strive after the Lord to receive the Holy

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:48.859
Spirit, then clean up your heart, turn away
from your TV watching.

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.629
Watch what you let your eyes behold.

00:03:53.629 --> 00:04:01.149
Watch what enters you mind, put out the evil
that is in your mind.

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:08.839
Put out and turn away from the actions of
sin you might be doing like sexual immorality,

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:15.629
like following your lusts, like having anger,
having anger at people.

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:22.149
All these things disqualify you from receiving
the Holy Spirit.

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:26.719
If you want to receive his Spirit, then you
must clean up your life today, come into the

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:34.379
light and have Jesus wash you clean by his
blood and then you will be ready to receive

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.139
the Holy Spirit.

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.959
And then when you have received the Holy Spirit,
don't GRIEVE the Holy Spirit and go back into

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:43.959
sin.

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:51.349
I know I have grieved the Holy Spirit before
and the Lord has chastised me, and all those

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:56.969
years I was away from the Lord I grieved the
Holy Spirit.

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.779
And it is wrong to do that.

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:02.169
I am very sorry.

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.019
That is why I walk closely with the Lord now
and I do not want to grieve the Holy Spirit

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:08.909
anymore.

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.309
And that is how you should be.

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:16.869
You should walk in the light once you have
the light, lest you be DISQUALIFIED and judged

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:22.749
even worse than the unbelievers who at least
did not have the light.

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:29.619
Friends we have to be SERIOUS if we want to
receive the Holy Spirit and REPENT.

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:35.559
If you have the Holy Spirit, do not turn to
any darkness.

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:41.989
Be serious in all you do and repent if you
do fall that you may not grieve the Spirit

00:05:41.989 --> 00:05:46.559
of God and bring upon yourself the greater
judgement...
