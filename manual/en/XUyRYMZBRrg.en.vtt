CHEF JOHN HIGGINS:
Welcome to The Chefs' House

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.481
where learning
is our main ingredient.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:22.556
[music]

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:23.891
MALE STUDENT: Service
here gets pretty busy.

00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:25.192
You know, we're
all students here;

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:28.562
we're learning, we're
taking in new experiences so...

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:31.098
Service can get
pretty crazy and intense.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.335
FEMALE STUDENT: My position
today is chef of the day and

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.238
pretty much, I make sure
that the dishes are set

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:41.508
correctly and garnished
and sent out on time.

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:43.710
[music]

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.778
CHEF HEMANT KANCHAN: All
the buns will go in the oven

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:46.313
when we say pick up.

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:47.481
Then you bring it out
and it's already ready,

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:48.782
so easy for us to plate.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:52.886

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.355
CHEF OLIVER LI: For the
salads coming up.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:01:06.233

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:07.234
HEATHER DYER: Our goal
here at The Chefs' House

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.102
is for all the students in
front and back of the

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:11.338
house to learn about
first impressions.

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:19.546
[music]

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:20.914
FEMALE STUDENT: I think this
program is really helpful in

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:23.050
preparing your for
industry and I'm looking

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.518
forward to graduating.

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:40.834
[music]

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:41.702
CHEF HEMANT KANCHAN: I would
go a little bit more ginger;

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:43.303
you don't have much
ginger in there, right?

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:43.637
MALE STUDENT: Sure.

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:44.538
CHEF HEMANT KANCHAN:
So, do a little bit more ginger;

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:46.073
go a little bit
more on the black pepper.

00:01:46.073 --> 00:01:46.640
And do me a favour.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.442
Before you start, just
give me a wipe here and

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:50.143
then we add the
black pepper to it.

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:52.846
[music]

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:53.814
CHEF JOHN HIGGINS: And The
Chefs' House is all about

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:54.982
the applied learning.

00:01:54.982 --> 00:01:57.584
Working in the kitchen, working
in the front of the house.

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.686
It's about the students
communicating with each other

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:01.088
and making it happen.

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:04.124
And trust me, this is
the best way to make it happen.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.126
So The Chefs' House,
it's all about learning being

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:07.094
our main ingredient.

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:18.138
