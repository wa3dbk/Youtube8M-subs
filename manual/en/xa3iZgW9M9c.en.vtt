(dissonance)

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:08.608
(light piano music)

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:12.512
(static)

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:19.152 align:start size:88% position:13%
- What's an eight-letter
word for hairless?

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.820
Oh, it is hairless.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.288
- Was the clue hairless?

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:23.857
- Nevermind, forget it.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.626
Is that our toolbox?

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:28.228
Where are our tools?

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.431
- I just thought it was a
waste of a good box, so.

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:32.932
- Well what are you making?

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:34.534 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well you know how we're
going to Dave's thing later?

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.069
- Oh, yeah, is that tonight?

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.171 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, so I just
thought I'd make a dip

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:39.372
that we could bring.

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.640
- A dip?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.608
Is Dave's thing
the sort of thing

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:42.909
that you bring something to?

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.110
- Um, I don't know,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.146 align:start size:88% position:13%
I don't remember exactly
what the deal was.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.314
Do we have any cumin?

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:51.551 align:start size:88% position:13%
- No, we're out, but the
place down the street

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.986
probably has some.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:53.953
- Okay.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.188
Cumin?

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:56.489
Am I saying that right?

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.324
- Cu-min.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:00:59.559
What'd you say the first time?

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.494
- I said cu-min.

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:02.896
- Cu-min.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.130
- Cumin.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.365
- Cu-min.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:07.300
(alarms sounding)

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.835 align:start size:84% position:16%
Yeah, I can't remember
what Dave said.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:10.270 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Yeah, I just don't want
to be the only people

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.538 align:start size:97% position:3%
that don't bring something,
you know what I mean?

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:13.306
I just feel like
that's the worst.

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:14.741
- Well, if we bring a dip,

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.176 align:start size:94% position:6%
do we have to bring
something to dip into it?

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.311 align:start position:0%
- No no, someone else will
bring something that we can dip.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:19.679
- I don't think you
can just assume that.

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:20.814
- Yeah you can, because
there's so many things

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:21.981
that can be dipped, I mean,

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.050 align:start size:84% position:16%
carrots, I don't
know, so many things.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.252
- We should bring something
you can dip, just to be safe.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.921
- Yeah, but like,
what, you know?

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.155 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I don't know, you're
the one who said

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:30.457 align:start size:84% position:16%
that there are so many
things you can dip.

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:31.257
- Yeah.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.192
- I just think that...

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.062
- Did we walk the wrong way?

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.398
- No, I guess it's just gone.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.569 align:start size:84% position:16%
Well, depending on
what you're going for,

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.170
you could try dill.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.271
- Do we have dill?

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.806
- Oh yeah, so much.

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:48.675 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Okay, well dill might even
be kinda better in a way,

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:49.776
you know what I mean?

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:59.219
(dissonant music)

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:04.424
- Hey.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:05.024
- Hi guys.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:05.959
- Hi.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.527
This is my new boyfriend, Myron.

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:08.728
- Hey, I'm Charlie.

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:09.762
- I love your lantern.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:10.830
- Oh, thanks.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.198
- Hi, I'm Matt.

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.767 align:start size:97% position:3%
Did you guys bring
anything that we could dip?

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.302
- What?

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.239
- Alright, so I recoupled the
electric engine's drive shaft

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.974
to the old yoke's chassis.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.108
Wasn't the prettiest workaround,

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:23.676
but it'll get the job done.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:24.377
Hey guys.

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:25.044
- Hey.

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:25.712
- Hi Dave.

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:26.546
- Hi Matt.

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:29.015
Thanks for coming guys.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:31.851
I know it's a huge risk
we're all taking here.

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:33.553
I don't know what's out there.

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:35.021
All right?

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:37.023 align:start size:97% position:3%
All I know is, there's nothing
left here for us anymore.

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:38.324
It's just us now.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.727
It's us against the world.

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:43.496
- Oh, nice, you brought tools.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.999
- Oh, uh, actually it's a dip.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:46.833
- What?

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:50.537
- Gross.

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:51.905
Why would you bring a dip?

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:53.439
- It's not gross.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.308
- We kinda just assumed that
someone would bring something

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:56.809
to dip into it.

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.811 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Why would someone bring
snacks to this, guys?

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:00.680 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Why don't you just
tell the truth and admit

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.483
that you forgot what
we were doing here.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:07.187
- I brought carrots, if
anybody's interested.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:08.821
- Oh.

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.023
- Thank you.

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.491
- I'm sorry, who's this?

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:14.260
- This is Myron,
my new boyfriend.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.528
- What happened to Tyler?

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:16.663
(sighs)

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.198
- Jesus Christ, man.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.499
- Even I knew about that.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.067
- Alright listen guys,
if we're gonna move,

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:22.569
let's move now, because--

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.270
- I don't wanna be rude, but
there aren't enough seatbelts

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.271
for Myron.

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.139
- What are you talking about?

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.006
Just squeeze in.

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:27.874
- With an extra person--

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.242
- Oh, uh, shotgun.

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:30.710 align:start size:94% position:6%
- No, you're not
shotgun, no, I'm shotgun.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.878
- You have to call it.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:32.679
- I don't call it.

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:33.479
I don't call anything.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.981
I am shotgun.

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.482
- Yeah, she doesn't
have to call it.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.351 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I get car sickness
pretty easily.

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:41.454 align:start position:0%
If I could sit in the front
seat, I'd really appreciate it.

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:43.823
- Myron, no one invited you.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:46.092 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And he didn't
even bring anything.

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:47.126
- I brought the carrots.

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:48.361
- Oh yeah.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:49.929
- Yeah, he brought
carrots, number one.

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:51.531
Number two, he's with me.

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:53.299
And three, he's as
entitled to be here

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.801
as any one of you guys,

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:56.703 align:start size:97% position:3%
way more entitled to be
here than you two schnooks.

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:57.604
- Come on, Hannah.

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:58.504
- Schnooks?

00:03:58.504 --> 00:03:59.339
- What?

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:00.473
What skill do you have?

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:01.541 align:start size:84% position:16%
What are you bringing
to the table?

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:03.376
- Uh...

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:04.611
- Umm...

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.312 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What skill are you
bringing, Hannah?

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:10.316 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I made a sling out of a
skirt that wasn't even mine.

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:12.719
- Okay, well I can
run really fast.

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.320
- Between the two of
us he's the fastest.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.489
I wouldn't say that you're
fast compared to everyone.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.457
- We have to compare--

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:19.125
- I stood in the four corners.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:20.893
- I'm very inspiring.

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:23.062
Nobody wants to give up
when they're around me.

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:25.231
- I can name all
of the presidents

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:27.066
in reverse chronological order.

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:28.501
- I'm a neurologist.

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:30.003
- I have thin wrists.

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:31.537
You'd be surprised
how useful that is.

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:33.973 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well I can balance
on a rolling log.

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:36.142
- I can taste cilantro.

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:37.543
- That doesn't count
as a skill, though.

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:39.379
(everyone talking
over each other)

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:42.148
- I'm a very, very,
very positive person.

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:44.484 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I made gunpowder
from a branch.

00:04:44.484 --> 00:04:46.352
- That's not gonna come
in handy at some point.

00:04:46.352 --> 00:05:03.736
(car engine starts)

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:10.677
(crickets)

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.983 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Can you please put the
tools back in the box

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.451
when we get home?

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:20.320
- Yeah.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:42.475
Yes.

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:49.349
The dill works, right?

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:54.454
- Yeah, it's good.

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:00.259
- Wait, what are we doing?

00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:02.628
- Oh yeah.

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:06.432 align:start size:88% position:13%
- When was the last
time you even saw a bus?

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:07.500
- I don't know.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.070
(dissonant music)
