00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.450
The  Messenger spacecraft will hit

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.039
the surface of Mars and crash at the end
of April.

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:11.499
Basically, we're out of fuel now, we're at the end of a really successful mission

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:15.389
and what happens we can't do anything
anymore to stop it from doing what it

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.390
naturally wants to do.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.880
Because of the fact that Mercury does
not have an atmosphere

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.990
the spacecraft will actually not burn up
so it will truly explode

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.310
when it gets a surface. The University of Michigan built

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.289
one of approximately 10 instruments that
are part of the Messenger spacecraft.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.270
So this instrument,  the Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer was invented here

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.730
was built here and was

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.800
tested here before it was mounted
on to the spacecraft

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.010
and got launched in 2004. (V.O.)  Main engine
start

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.620
two... one and zero and liftoff

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.060
of Messenger on NASA's mission to Mercury.
Technology that our engineers

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.920
touched and worked with will be on the
surface of Mercury for an eternity

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.460
for all we know. FIPS made some really important
contributions

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.820
first and foremost is that FIPS was the
first instrument to measure ions in

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.879
Mercury's space environment.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.189
So, my responsibility for FIPS as the instrument scientist  is to watch what it's doing on a

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.149
daily basis. Not only do I  look at the
data every day but every week I

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.240
participate in the meetings where I talk
on the phone with other messenger

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.090
folks and make the plan for the next thing.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.890
Just yesterday we made the last plan.
I don't want to over blow it but

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.570
honestly it makes me a little sad, you know? Like something I really like is coming

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.090
to an end.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.710
Great things have an end and I like

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.569
that it doesn't fizzle out. We make
discoveries until the last

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.159
day at the height of the discoveries of
this mission.

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.799
Messenger basically made us aware of the
fact that Mercury is in fact

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.979
a planet that's geologically active.
With Message data we actually showed

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.460
that Mercury has in its permanently shaded
crators so literally

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.069
its North Pole it has crators the bottoms of
which never see the sun there's actually

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.770
water ice in those craters.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.069
You know there are signs we discovered of

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.649
recent massive volcanic activity that
has shaped

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.450
large factions of the surface of the
planet think of it like

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.920
early in the solar system the Earth
stripped from all the outer surfaces

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.680
so it's kind of

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.820
take the inside of the Earth gonna throw away
everything else

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.160
and let it sit there and bake. This

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.360
is our history. We've thought about this,
we've

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.780
stay up at night because of it, we've
written

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.900
publications about it of course we will do
so in the future and we've made discoveries

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.330
far beyond what we expected. Related Video:  the catch is
that if they don't perform as well as or

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.370
better than the fuels we already have

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.530
you can have a net increase in the
carbon emissions associated with the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.050
fuels

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.440
so we have to be careful and understand
what the properties are...
