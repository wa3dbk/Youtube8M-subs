00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.920
[Zoe Bruce] My name is Zoe Bruce, and I'm eleven years old.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.050
I am a very, very competitive gymnast.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.630
[Tiffany Bruce] My name is Tiffany Bruce and I'm Zoe's mom.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.740
She was almost nine and a half that she was here at the gym.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.270
I was at work, Daddy was driving carpool, and she fell off the high bar.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.960
And I got that call at work and had to
meet them at Children's in the emergency room.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.060
It was very scary. She had broken and dislocated both elbows.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.640
She had two full arm casts from hand to armpit, and she needed help to do everything.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.910
Obviously she couldn't bend her arms
being the cast.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.310
She needed help to eat and go the bathroom and get dressed
and go to school,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.059
so I got to be a fourth grader for two weeks.

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.159
A couple of her coaches went with her on some days.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.760
She enjoyed eating popcorn because I could just put the bowl in front of her, and she could just take her tongue

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.000
and eat up the popcorn.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.640
[Zoe Bruce] Actually I think that it kind of made me stronger.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.200
After I injured my arms it made me realize that I just, I wanted to be a gymnast. I didn't want to quit.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.640
[Tiffany Bruce] Just two weeks after her surgery she was itching to get back in the gym to be with her team.

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:27.949
As soon as she got clearance from Dr. Mehlman to do anything, even if it was just like leg lifts or sit ups

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:30.069
or mountain climbers, anything.

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:34.800
Every appointment she is asking him what she can the next, what can she do next.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.260
[Zoe Bruce] I mean, who would have thought that a nine year old little girl who felt like she was two feet tall

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.800
could come back from such a big injury and then win fourth at state the next year.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.460
[Tiffany Bruce] She just had a drive within her.

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:55.149
I think this experience certainly has molded her character for who she is going to become as an adult.
