00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:07.336
here very long and fruitful maker
typical monthly or in a lot of you a

00:00:07.336 --> 00:00:11.435
clear using one of these inexpensive as
the monitors so that you can have

00:00:11.435 --> 00:00:16.175
external monitor for your camera essary
conditions so result it's less expensive

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:19.315
than a high definition monitor for these
are very handy

00:00:19.315 --> 00:00:22.485
if you're doing something like operating
a gibber crane

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:26.106
because you can be on top of your camera
to see what the kerosene lots of

00:00:26.106 --> 00:00:28.475
extra-large so these are about option

00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:30.206
there about fifty bucks however

00:00:30.206 --> 00:00:33.626
the problem is when you're not near
power supply the internal batteries on

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:35.806
his own last very long lease mine didn't

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:40.016
so anyway a power the thing because i
feel there's something where you're

00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:45.566
going sunday historical newsblog riddhi
story using one of these this is a

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:49.356
about twenty dollar chargeable with the
m_i_a_ on battery that could set up to

00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:50.736
twelve volts

00:00:50.736 --> 00:00:54.856
which guess what is about the same out
of power you need for one of these

00:00:54.856 --> 00:00:59.826
that we want to try this out for quite a
while and i was finally able to

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:03.556
okay so this is what comes in your box
from china and that your actual battery

00:01:03.556 --> 00:01:06.596
here it's a nice uh... plastic case

00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:08.616
power switch on top

00:01:08.616 --> 00:01:13.406
so it's on and off and then your little
uh... d_c_ carport here you put him on

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.846
your cable series

00:01:14.846 --> 00:01:18.316
and you have power cable that goes into
the better itself into anything that you

00:01:18.316 --> 00:01:21.086
are trying to power since where he is a
monitor

00:01:21.086 --> 00:01:25.346
uh... with that little small power
connector refuses adapter custom three

00:01:25.346 --> 00:01:28.266
hours and fifty cents sunnyvale city

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:32.196
thus allows you to flows into the spark
a warning for the other in your battery

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:35.546
to build up a reminder that we have to
have this all those

00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:39.456
expensive s_c_ monitors user connectors
so that's very important

00:01:39.456 --> 00:01:41.616
very mature power supply here

00:01:41.616 --> 00:01:44.366
group logo also you can charge the thing

00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:45.966
putting your battery

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:49.866
switches green l_e_d_ comes on which is
interesting because it's on the power

00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:52.096
supply itself and not the battery

00:01:52.096 --> 00:01:57.756
however so don't lose this could be on
the at the charge

00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:00.926
elementary legos ought to know that it's
fully charged

00:02:00.926 --> 00:02:04.066
so once that's done uncharged

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:06.726
length of your cable in so

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:09.626
featured

00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:12.295
walt proved this works

00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:16.115
puttin

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:17.985
presto it's clear air cond

00:02:17.985 --> 00:02:23.825
no you have formal power for your
instance investing monitor

00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:27.505
so after doing some testing i found that
these willpower my seven inch monitor

00:02:27.505 --> 00:02:30.665
for a for a half hours that's not too
bad however if you're gonna be on the

00:02:30.665 --> 00:02:33.016
field all day you might want to get a
second one

00:02:33.016 --> 00:02:37.046
especially because these things take
fourteen hours to charge yes that's

00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:39.075
working hours and not kidding

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:43.095
uh... so to might be a real good idea
good news is is the only have to buy a

00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:45.705
water and power cable adapter

00:02:45.705 --> 00:02:49.925
well i think the jail radius or filming
for turning onto these batteries you can

00:02:49.925 --> 00:02:54.235
find a links these original post an
inscription below as well as the

00:02:54.235 --> 00:02:58.865
emailing so we can buy the battery and
the power cable adapter

00:02:58.865 --> 00:03:00.485
dissident through filemaker too for the
month
