00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.210
Welcome back to another cooking video, I'm
Chef Devaux and I am here to talk to you guys

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.210
about Sushi-Grade Fish.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.240
What it is, where to get, how to make it.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.210
Now what is Sushi-Grade Fish?

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.370
Well it's actually just a marketing term designed
by advertisers to sell you a fish at a higher

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.439
price, because there is no quality standard
that dictates sushi-grade fish has to be a

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.230
higher quality than other fish in order to
be called sushi-grade fish.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.640
The only thing that there is, is a guideline
made by the FDA which states that fish has

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.750
to be frozen for a certain amount of time
to kill any possible parasites inside the

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.300
fish in case it's eaten raw.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.540
It means that all fish across the United States
and Europe that is labeled sushi-grade fish

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.010
or sold inside a sushi restaurant should theoretically
have been frozen before hand before it got

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.180
to your plate.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.590
Now this is makes it a bit difficult for restaurants
because you ask them is the fish fresh and

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.460
they say yes, because no sushi restaurant
is going to say no its been frozen because

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.940
that's not what you want to hear, but also
some may not actually know.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.812
So the ones that don't know it could be that
they receive their fish thawed from a sushi

00:01:05.812 --> 00:01:10.469
fish provider which it was frozen beforehand
and gives it to them thawed, or they just

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.759
don't know and they go to the fish market
every day and buy fish and chop it up and

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.560
serve it up.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.200
This poses quite a risk when eating out because
you can't trust what the waiters are telling

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.719
you and you don't know what's going on in
the backend.

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.710
The FDA recognizes this and has made a table
that lists every single type of fish there

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.939
is and basically tells you whether the risk
of parasite infection is high, low or negligible.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:41.509
An example would be tuna is negligible, flounder
is high, salmon is low but there is an exception

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.729
for Scottish farm salmon which is negligible,
so it lists all sorts of information.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.890
There is loads of information in this leaflet.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.060
So check this out on my website, I have created
a link to this, so click on the link on the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.399
top left corner of the page and then you'll
find another link on that page which will

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.299
reference this.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.810
It's a great resource, at least if you go
to a sushi restaurant then you know which

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.420
fish types are fine to order, and you pose
less risk of getting infected by parasites

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.090
which is always a great thing.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.220
Now even though some of the fish on here are
negligible risk, I would still recommend freezing

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.810
them because you don't want to find out that
suddenly some parasite has of course lived

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.220
inside that fish and you're the first case
to disprove this table of contents.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.233
To make sushi-grade fish you need to buy great
fresh fish and to do this you need to know

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:40.330
how to recognize a good fresh fish when you
see one.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.220
So the first thing you want to look for is
you want to look for the eyes, you want to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.940
see a nice deep black pupil and you want to
have the eyes popping out slightly from the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.940
head of the fish.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.820
If it indents in it's probably a bit old,
so just don't be shy, just feel the eye and

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.870
if it feels nice and plump like an eye should
feel then its good.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.710
Now other tell-tale signs to look for is you
don't want a dried out tail.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.260
Now you want to look at the skin, you want
to have a nice shiny glistering, vibrant,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.260
skin.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.570
You want to have it just alive, it's going
to look alive.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.980
Next, when you feel the skin it needs to feel
moist, not slimy that would be bad.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.670
It has to be moist like slightly wet.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.050
Alright so next you want to press it, if the
skin bounces up and retains its shape then

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.390
that's a great sign, if it doesn't and leaves
a finger imprint then that means it's probably

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.120
been on the shelf for a while.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.870
Now you want to look at the gills you just
lift it up and it needs to be a nice pink

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.740
red, if it's brown, dark, dull, then it's
not a good sign, you really want to have vibrant

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.740
colors.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.820
If you're still not convinced give it a smell,
a good fish will always smell of the sea breeze,

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.890
it won't smell of fishiness.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.920
This is great how to recognize a whole fish
as being fresh or not, most fish are actually

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.861
sold in fillets, so how do you tell if a fillet
is good?

00:04:04.861 --> 00:04:08.540
Well the first thing you want to look for
like the whole fish is you want to look for

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.500
the brightness of the scales, if you can see
them and they are still on the fish.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.459
If not, then you want to go to the next thing
which would be check if it's slimy or moist.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.000
You want it to be nice and moist and just
a light layer of water on the fish.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.130
You don't want it to be slimy or sticky.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.720
Then you want to just press the fish fillet,
if it bounces back up and it's nice and perky

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.720
then it's great.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.030
If it leaves a finger imprint just walk away,
you can buy another fish.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.620
Alright now the most important thing about
buying fish is you should never go to the

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.490
market with a preset idea of what you want,
you should never go thinking oh I need salmon

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.480
for tonight or I want salmon sushi later on.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.680
What you want to do is you want to go and
you want to see what's there and then decide

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.500
what you want to make, not the other way around,
because otherwise you'll come there thinking

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.190
I need salmon, I need salmon, I need salmon.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.260
You see salmon, it doesn't look that fresh
but hey, I'm here I need it so I'll buy it.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.410
That's not the way to do it.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.040
You want to always get the best quality and
just be flexible.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.350
If it's a different type of fish that you're
used to just try that, make it work, don't

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.120
be scared and don't come with a prefixed idea.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.639
Okay, so now after buying the right fish,
you have to chop it up into bits and you want

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:28.570
to have fish blocks which are four fingers
wide by two fingers deep, and then the longer

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.950
the better obviously, but at least four fingers
long also.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.000
Then you want to vacuum seal these, and vacuum
sealing is really the best way to do this

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.169
because if you don't then you get freezer
burn when you freeze your fish or you have

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.430
migration of water out of the fish and into
the outside.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.270
The water actually moves when it's frozen,
it's not a stationary object and it likes

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.490
to go out of the food, so when you have less
space around the outside of the food it sort

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.900
of stops the water from leaving it.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.580
Lastly where to get your sushi-grade fish?

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.290
Now, you can get it in some supermarkets,
thaw it out, but not around Spain so I order

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:13.160
it online and the company I order it from
is www.Kazari.co.uk and they supply me with

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.910
sushi-grade fish for free as long as I mention
them in the video.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.570
So that's awesome for me, and you can get
the same fish like it, so that's great.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.490
This is how they send it, they send it of
course in styrene box, it comes with chill

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:31.790
packs, this is just an ice block to keep it
cold during transport and they send it vacuum

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.190
sealed like this.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.470
This for example is salmon and it comes with
the skin but detached so you can still see

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.210
how fresh the fish was before it was cut and
frozen -- that's great.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.140
And the tuna also comes like that, this is
blue-fin but don't worry if it looks to be

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.250
a bit rotten, that's not the case.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.669
When you vacuum seal tuna what happens is
the evaporation oxygen actually turns the

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:57.050
tuna a bit dullish brown but when you take
it out of the package and let it aerate it

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.050
turns red again.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.600
Alright so the best way to thaw out sushi-grade
fish is you just leave it inside the vacuum

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.449
sealed pouch, put it inside a bucket of water
for 30 minutes at room temperature, then pull

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:12.300
it out, cut it open, put it in the fridge
for three to six hours, just to completely

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.480
defrost nice and slowly.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.580
Then use it and make some sushi.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.791
Now if you guys want to get the same sushi-grade
fish as me and you live in Europe, you're

00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:25.670
in luck you can get it from Kazari.co.uk by
clicking on the left right now.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.590
Now if you're in America or somewhere else
in the world I don't know what the quality

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.400
is, I have never ordered so I can't vouch
for these other companies.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.919
I do know some American companies so if you
guys want to check them out then click on

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:40.510
the top left corner of the screen and you'll
get taken to my web page where I have listed

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.949
them on there.

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:46.290
Now if you guys have ordered from these companies
or Kazari.co.uk and you've experienced either

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.770
bad or good experiences, please let me know
in the comment section below so I can know

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.350
and be more informed about it.
