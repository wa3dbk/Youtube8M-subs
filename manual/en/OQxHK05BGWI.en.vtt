Hey everybody, Don Campbell here and today
I want to show you how how to verify a Wordpress

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.000
site using 'Google Webmaster Tools'.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.599
So, the 'Google Webmaster Tools' are just
an awesome resource for now making sure that

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.481
your site looks good to Google. And it's one
of the things that you're going to want to

00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:22.410
do is verify your site in the Google Webmaster
Tools you can do things like submit a site

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.560
map, check for duplicate content, see what
kind of keywords people are typing in to find

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.259
your site. So, it's definitely the important
thing to do.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.879
So I am just going to click on 'Google Webmaster
Central' here. You can just search for "Google

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.879
Webmaster Tools" in Google.

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:44.049
And when you sign in you are going to be taken
to a screen where you can add a website and

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:48.280
basically you just put in the URL of the website.
And once you do that, it's going to ask you

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.440
to verify this site. So here I've got a site
in here already, and I'm going to click "verify".

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.760
Now , there are two ways you can verify the
site. One is through a meta tag. And what

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.510
it's going to do is give you this little meta
tag code that has to go in the header section,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.991
the head section of your page on your site.

00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:11.030
And I'll show you what that looks like. They've
got a little example here. I'll show you where

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.132
it goes. You'll see this head section in this
site.

00:01:14.132 --> 00:01:21.030
And then the other way is through a file.
Now, if you know FTP, and you know how to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.369
do that... This is the way I do it. I will
usually just upload this file to the root

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.409
directory in my site. Then I will go back
to Webmaster Central and verify everything

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:31.409
is good.

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.049
But if you don't have FTP, or you don't know
what that is, then you can always do this

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.090
meta tag version. So, I'm going to do that.
I'm going to copy copy this code and we are

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.530
going to go back to our Wordpress site. Log
into the Wordpress admin, and input that in

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.030
the head section. OK, so, here I am at the
dashboard in Wordpress.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.270
I'm going to go to the appearance section
on the left. And from here, depending on the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.270
theme you have selected here, I got the Expand2Wweb
SmallBiz theme but any of the themes that

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.170
you have, if you go to the editor, you can
actually edit the theme and code directly.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.119
What you are going to want to do is find the
header. Now all the themes are going to have

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.901
this header, no matter what Wordpress theme
you're using, and have this header section.

00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:17.680
Okay, so, what I'm gonna do is go ahead and
paste this code right after the head.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.310
So, here is where we're opening up the head
section of the document, and then this is

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.159
where I'm pasting the code, right after the
beginning. [xx] update file and then When

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.970
I go back to Google Webmaster Central, and
I click "verify".

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.150
Then, it's going to go out there and verify
the site. And, here it is.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.650
So, now it's telling me all this information
about where links are coming into my site,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.379
what keywords people are using to find it,
if there is then you crawl errors, so I will

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.790
give you another video on tour on Webmaster
Tools, and you'll find that this is just a

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.819
super powerful tool to use to diagnose your
site to make sure that it's looking great

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:56.819
to Google.

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.829
Alright, thanks. If you you are watching this
video on YouTube, I'd really appreciate it

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.520
if you'd rate it. And leave me some comments
below, I'd love to hear from you, and look

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.800
forward to seeing you next time.
