Hey guys, Jess here, and this is the Pokemon
Update!

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.740
First up - last week, we mentioned the Pokemon
X &amp; Y Roundtable at E3 with Tsunekazu Ishihara

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.610
and Junichi Masuda, also known as the President
and CEO of The Pokemon Copmany and the Director

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.369
of GAME FREAK. We asked you guys to come up
with questions you'd like to see us ask them!

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.180
E3 is in one week, so keep those questions
rolling on in! We're gonna definitely provide

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.970
as much Pokemon coverage as possible, so keep
commenting and let me know what questions

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.770
you want me to ask and what coverage you want
us to try to get!

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.110
And SINCE E3 is next week, there wasn't a
TON of Pokemon news - after all, if they announced

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.070
it now, what would they have left to say at
E3? So instead we're gonna showcase some awesome

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.800
community stuff that happened!

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.560
First, YouTube user ThePikaWu (who also happens
to be a Union For Gamers partner!) asked his

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.430
date to prom in an AMAZING way!! He dressed
up as Ash and recited a Pokemon-themed poem

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.689
ending with "I choose you." It doesn't get
much better than that - click the link in

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.659
the description to watch the video yourself!
It's so cute! Have you guys ever asked someone

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.560
to prom using Pokemon? Leave me a comment
if so, I'd love to hear about it!

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.591
Next, we all love Pokemon Snap. And we love
the Pokemon movies...well, some of them. So

00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:25.780
what if we combined teh two? Let's face it,
if there was ONE Pokemon movie that deserves

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.510
to be made, it's Pokemon Snap. So GrittyReboots
made a live-action trailer for it. Holy balls,

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.200
I want this to be a real thing. I keep throwing
my money at the screen but nothing happens.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.310
Moving on, Jimmy, aka NintendoFanFTW, started
a series back in October called Pokemon: Weird

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:55.159
Facts and Trivia where he presents...well...weird
facts and trivia about Pokemon, as well as

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.420
Easter Eggs and theories. For instance, the
pokemon Munna, which first appeared in Pokemon

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.150
Black and White, was actually referenced in
the original Red and Blue by a girl outside

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.320
of Rock Tunnel who says she wishes there were
more pink pokemon with floral patterns - which

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.209
perfectly describes Munna! Anyway, go ahead
and click the link in the video description

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.609
to check out Jimmy's channel and the rest
of his Weird Facts and Trivia!

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.829
Finally, like we mentioned last week - Marriland
shirts are on their way!! They'll be hitting

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.930
the Curse store very soon, and if you wanna
get one for yourself, keep checking Marriland

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.819
for an HUGE awesome giveaway! You might even
have a chance to win a 3DS a preorder of X

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.209
and Y - the giveaway hasn't been announced
just yet, but keep your eyes peeled!

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.749
And that does it for this week! Sorry for
the short episode, but like we said, we're

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:40.099
headed to E3 next week, so hopefully that'll
make up for the lack of content here. Be sure

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.419
to subscribe to CurseEntertainment and Marriland
if you haven't already, and go ahead and give

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:49.120
us a Like for Pokemon news! Once again I'm
Jess, you can find me on Twitter @JessBrohard,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.189
and as alway3s, thanks for watching, enjoy
the game!
