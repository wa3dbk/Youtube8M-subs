00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.680
You've probably heard the saying "everything's
relative".

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.710
When you consider our place in the Universe,
everything really is relative.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.590
I'm recording this halfway up Vancouver Island,
in the Pacific Ocean, off the West Coast of

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.590
Canada,.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:27.070
And where I'm standing is about 6,370 kilometers
away from the center of the Earth, that way.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.940
From my perspective, the Sun is over there.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.270
It's as large as a dime held at arm's length.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.020
For me it's really, really far away.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.190
In fact, at this exact time it's further away
than any object I you can see with the naked

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.190
eye.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.260
I'm about 150 million kilometers away from
the Sun, and so are you.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.140
We're carving out an elliptical orbit which
takes one full year to complete one whole

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.460
trip around.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.020
You, me and the Earth are all located inside
our Solar System.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.509
Which contains the Sun, 8 planets and a vast
collection of ice, rocks and dust.

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.090
We're embedded deep within our galaxy, the
Milky Way.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.789
It's a big flat disk of stars measuring up
to 120,000 light years across.

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:24.289
Our Solar System is located in the middle
of this galactic disk.

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:32.899
And by the middle, I mean the center of the
galaxy is about 27,000 light years that way,

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.140
and the edge of the galaxy is about the same
distance that way.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.719
Our Milky Way is but one galaxy in a larger
collection of galaxies known as the Local

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:44.719
Group.

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.549
There are 36 known objects in the local group.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.450
Which are mostly dwarf galaxies.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.490
However, there's also the Triangulum Galaxy,
the Milky Way,

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.980
and the Andromeda galaxy... which is by far
the largest, most massive object in the Local

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.200
Group,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.530
It's twice the size and 4 times the mass of
the Milky Way.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.690
But where is it?

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.251
From me, and you, Andromeda is located just
an astronomically distant 2.5 million light

00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:19.540
years that way.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.800
Or would that be just short 2.5 million light-years
that away?

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.570
I'm sure you see where this is going.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:35.590
The Local Group is embedded within a much
larger group known as the Virgo Supercluster,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.120
containing at least 100 galaxy groups and
clusters.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.490
The rough center of the supercluster is in
the constellation Virgo.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:53.600
Which as of right now, is that way, about
65 million light years away.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.350
Which certainly makes the 2.5 million light
years to Andromeda seem like an afternoon

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.660
jaunt in the family car.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.010
Unsurprisingly, The Virgo Supercluster is
a part of a larger structure as well.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.410
The Pisces-Cetus Supercluster Complex.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:19.120
This is a vast filament of galactic superclusters
measuring about 150 million light years across

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.990
AND a billion light years long.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.970
The middle is just over that way.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.040
Right over there.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.210
One billion light years in length?

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.910
Well that makes Andromeda seem right around
the corner.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.370
So where are we?

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.400
Where are you, and I and the Earth located
in the entire Universe?

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.850
The edge of the observable Universe is about
13.8 billion light years that way.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.920
But it's also 13.8 billion light years that
way.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.630
And that way, and that way.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.590
And cosmologists think that if you travel
in any direction long enough, you'll return

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.060
to your starting point, just like how you
can travel in any one direction on the surface

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.620
of the Earth and return right back at your
starting point.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.209
In other words, the Earth is located at the
very, very center of the Universe.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.040
Which sounds truly amazing.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.529
What a strange coincidence for you and I to
be located right here.

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:27.789
Dead centre.

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:32.699
Smack dab right in the middle of the Universe.

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.370
Certainly makes us sound important doesn't
it?

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.810
But considering that every other spot in the
Universe is also located at the center of

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:42.860
the universe.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.669
You heard me right.

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:51.189
Every single spot that you can imagine inside
the Universe is also the center of the Universe.

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:56.380
That definitely complicates things in our
plans for Universal relevance.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.770
...And all this sure does make Andromeda seem
close by... and it's still just right over

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.909
there, at the center of the Universe.

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.430
Oh, and about every spot in the universe being
the centre of the Universe?

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:37.349
Well, we'll save that one for another episode.
