J: What's with the voice?

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.720
D: I was trying to suck the poison out of the balloons.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.960
J: Poison?  D: Well, it was helium.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.100
Y'know, I was trying to find cure. Go back to basics

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.500
J: I can't take you seriously when you've got a high-pitched voice it's-

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.480
