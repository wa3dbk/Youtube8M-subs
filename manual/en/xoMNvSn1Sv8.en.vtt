00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.166
Welcome to the Introductory Tutorial for PhotoModeler Scanner's 
SmartMatch and Dense Surface Modeling.

00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:10.166
This tutorial shows how to create a dense surface model using 
SmartMatch automation and multi-view stereo.

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:14.266
This tutorial shows how to create a dense surface model using 
SmartMatch automation and multi-view stereo.

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.266
Here is the finished project created from these 9 photos.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.266
Here is the finished project created from these 9 photos.

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:22.266
PhotoModeler Scanner has four stages to create the final textured 
model. 

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.199
These 3D views show the project after each of these stages.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.933
This 3D view shows the results of the first stage.  

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:35.399
The SmartMatch process matches key features across the 
photos and uses these to solve the camera positions as well as 
creating this sparse point set.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.500
The solution from the first stage is used by the multi-view stereo 
system - M V S for short ...

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.233
...to create this dense point cloud.  Zooming in you can see the 
points created by this step.

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:52.999
Each point in the cloud has it's color extracted from the photos.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.333
These points are then triangulated during the modify mesh step 
to create this shaded mesh.

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:16.666
Finally, the triangulated mesh has textures applied from the 
original photos.

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:25.233
We will now show this project being created from the beginning.

00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:29.233
Open the 'Getting Started' dialog.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.000
Select a new 'Automated Project' 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.266
There are two types of automated projects, coded targets and 
SmartMatch.
This tutorial covers the SmartMatch technique. 

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:43.733
Select the nine images used in the project.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.600
Hit 'Next' and a camera calibration prompt apears.

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:50.699
Hit 'Next' and a camera calibration prompt apears.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:59.733
Load the calibration from the tutorial .pmr file.  If the calibration 
was already in the library it would be matched automatically and 
this pane of the wizard would not apear.

00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:06.266
Also, in some cases you can use an aproximate camera or 
SmartMatch auto-calibration.

00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:13.666
Hitting 'Run' now would complete the first of the four steps.The 
results could be reviewed, and changes made before running the 
remaining steps.

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:25.999
All four steps can be run independently, or they can be run 
together by pressing the Options button, and then selecting 'Run 
DSM'.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Hit 'Run' and the SmartMatch process starts.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.566
Features are detected on each image and then matched across 
images.  

00:02:34.566 --> 00:02:38.266
 Once the matches are complete the project is then processed.

00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:42.899
While that processes we can review some basic requirements of 
SmartMatch projects.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.533
A SmartMatch project requires a set of low angle photos with 
good overlap.

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:52.766
Aim for at least 60% overlap, for example photo 1 should overlap  
photo 2, and some of photo 3.

00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:59.999
The subject matter and/or background should contain random 
features. For example, a feature-less, plain white wall will not 
work. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.300
As well, the majority of the scene should not move between 
photos.  

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.033
Avoid using blurry or out of focus photos.

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:11.733
After the SmartMatch process has solved the camera positions, 
the MVS steps will run.

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:17.899
By default, MVS requires each part of the object to be visible in a 
minimum of three photos.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:26.033
The following subject matter is not suited to the SmartMatch and 
MVS process: Non-textured solid colors,  moving objects, 
reflective objects, ...

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:29.866
.. and thin objects that cause occlusions.

00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:34.666
After the dense point cloud has been created by MVS, the point 
cloud will be triangulated and cleaned.

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:38.666
Skipping ahead to when the project is complete.

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:47.499
This shows the stages in the final meshing step which created 
270,000 triangles. The overall process from start to finish took 7 
minutes and 22 seconds.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.833
Changes to various parameters can increase or decrease the 
amount of data created and the time it takes.

00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:54.233
Changes to various parameters can increase or decrease the 
amount of data created and the time it takes to run.

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:58.833
Save this project as "Sun Done.pmr".

00:04:00.733 --> 00:04:09.766
Open the two photos to see the 2D SmartMatch marks created 
and matched between photos.

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:20.766
Open a 3D view to see the same results shown at the start of this 
tutorial

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.100
Turn off point mesh visibility to see the SmartMatch points.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.800
Turn on the point clouds to show the MVS result.

00:04:47.966 --> 00:04:52.632
Adjust the display style to show the point cloud colored from the 
photos.

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:07.232
Turn off the point cloud and turn on the triangulated mesh to 
show the shaded result.

00:05:20.933 --> 00:05:24.933
If photo-textures are turned on they will be created and applied to 
the model.

00:05:24.933 --> 00:05:30.966
This last step is purely visual; it won't change the shape of the 
mesh, or affect measurements.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:41.532
There are a few areas around the edge of the model that are not 
visible in any of the photos.  These areas would not be photo-
textured unless additional angled photos were included.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.933
This project can be exported for use in other 3D packages, or a 
scale added and measurements taken.

00:05:47.933 --> 00:05:50.766
In summary the tutorial showed:

00:05:50.766 --> 00:05:53.799

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.433

and triangulation steps).

00:05:59.433 --> 00:06:01.999
What type of photos and subject matter are required.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.466
And lastly, how to view a mesh in 3D.
