00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.160
Losing streaks.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.110
Yeaaaah, we've all been there and recently
I've been on a losing streak mainly due to

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.500
learning new nauts.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.300
Though, there are other factors that contributed
to me losing, such as not finding the mistakes

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:48.460
I was making in my matches.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.260
One of the things that helped me with losing
games is to reflect on the previous game I

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.420
lost.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:21.500
Most of the time I can see where I went wrong
and learn how to improve from that.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.490
I suggest watching your replays, often times
you can find the mistakes that you made during

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.810
a match.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.280
Learning from this can help you increase your
chances of winning your future matches.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.860
But, you have to be realistic.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.560
You won't be able to magically be better after
watching one replay and then playing.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.049
Chances are you will make the same mistake
again, it takes time to change from the way

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.869
you've been playing Awesomenauts.

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.330
Whether you have issues with over-extending,
being too aggressive or even too defensive

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.119
it takes a while to adapt to another playstyle.

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.439
However, don't think of losing as failing,
look at it as a way to improve.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.390
You improve a lot more from failure, than
success and the accomplishment of improving

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.780
enhances your confidence and overall makes
you a better player.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.490
In the end you could also take a break from
playing Awesomenauts to play another game,

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.760
exercise, read or anything that will take
your mind off losing.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.980
Take the time to think about what’s been
causing you to play worse and chances are

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.710
a break is all you needed to clear your mind.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.829
If your goal is to be in a higher league,
wanting to master a certain character or just

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.660
trying new strategies, keep trying and don't
give up!

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.449
Go ahead and refine your gameplay for whatever
you’re trying to get good at.

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:44.570
It will take time, but you will get there
and be an Awesome player in the end.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.580
And before we go, I wanna know..

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.380
