00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.230
Well today we're at Plumstead we're at the
depot in southeast London and this is the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.160
nerve centre for the railway operations at
the start of the Crossrail installation of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.610
the track, signalling and other equipment.
We celebrated the arrival of the last two

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:33.019
TBMs Victoria and Elizabeth at Farringdon
and that marked what was a really important

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:38.300
moment for us at Crossrail the final breakthrough
of the long tunnel drives this tunnelling

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.530
marathon that we've been undertaking for over
three years. Now we are moving on to railway

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.039
systems so we have to lay track we have to
get the power systems into the tunnels, the

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:56.890
electrical connections and then we are on
into signalling and station fit out including

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.539
lifts and escalators and all the things that
make the stations work and safe and reliable

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:08.710
to operate. Behind me is Crossrail's concreting
train. It came over from France on the Channel

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.470
Tunnel being heavily refurbished, modernised
and expanded to use on Crossrail. We have

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.170
26 miles of tunnels in total and we've got
to provide the supporting slab that the track

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.819
is laid onto and this work has to be done
quickly, efficiently and that's why we need

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:34.530
this big train. The train is loaded up in
the daytime it then moves into the tunnels

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.880
from the eastern portal here at Plumstead
working its way under the Thames tunnels and

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:50.410
on into central London and the city. We started
laying the track supporting slab in the Connaught

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:57.270
tunnel in January this year and that has temporary
rails on it that allows equipment to run on

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.349
those rails to provide other services within
that part of the tunnel. The first permanent

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:09.700
track and rail will be started here at Plumstead
and that starts this autumn. This train will

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.310
lay 300 metres a day which is the rate we
need in order to get this job finished on

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.470
time and be ready to run services through
London at the end of 2018.
