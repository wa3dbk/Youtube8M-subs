Hi I'm Dan with DJ2 Motorsports and in this
video we're going talk about Spring Rate vs.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.780
Spring Load.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.980
Hi, and welcome back to the videos.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.310
In this video, we are going to talk about
coil springs.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.099
We've got our Afco Racing coil springs that
we got from Summit Racing, and there are a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.250
number of things that we need to look at on
coil springs to make sure they fit our application.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.440
One is the diameter, of course, and this is
a 5" diameter spring here on the yellow one,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.970
and the black one is 5-1/2" diameter.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.330
And of course the height which will help set
our ride height, and this is a 9-1/2" tall

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.140
spring, and the black one is an 11" tall spring.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.300
The biggest thing that we need to take into
consideration is the Spring Rate, and what

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.230
the spring rate is, is the amount of weight
that it will take to compress this 1".

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:11.120
All almost all springs are rated that way,
especially coil springs, so this one for example

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.650
is a 700 lb. spring, so it will take 700 pounds
to compress this 1", so if we take 1,400 pounds

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.800
on this it will compress it 2".

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.480
The black spring here is a 900 lb. spring,
so it will take 900 pounds of weight to compress

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.850
this spring 1".

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.201
The other thing that we need to take into
consideration is Spring Load, and the Spring

00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:42.270
Load of a spring is the amount of weight that
this can support before it is totally compressed.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.330
So, if the maximum amount the spring can be
compressed is 6", with our rating of 700 lbs/inch,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.880
that would give a spring load of, this is
just theoretical on this spring.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.120
So, if we compress this spring 6" before it
will stop compressing, and the spring rate

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.560
is 700 lbs/inch that will give us a load of
4,200 lbs. basically all we are doing is taking

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.620
the 700 lbs/inch times the 6" that it compressed.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:17.840
Now on the black spring, since it's a 900
lb spring, and we'll just say theoretically

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.980
that our maximum compression on this is 8
inches, and then this spring load will be

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.980
7,200 pounds.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.950
So it is really easy to figure out.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.120
Most of these springs, like for example on
this one from Afco, they always etch the rating

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.290
for the springs on the bottom here, and that's
a really easy way to find out, but if you

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.560
can find out the maximum compression and multiply
that by your spring rate, then that is the

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.220
easiest way to figure out what the total load
of that spring will be.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.319
Okay, just to recap real quick, we talked
about the Spring Rate, which the amount of

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.390
weight it takes to compress the spring 1",
and we also talked about the Spring Load and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.750
how to calculate that.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.770
You basically take the maximum compression
of that spring, multiply it by the Spring

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.390
Rate and you'll get your maximum load approximately
for that spring.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.650
Again thanks to Summit Racing for hooking
us up with these springs from Afco Racing,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.870
and make sure that you look below this video
and like it, and hook up with us on Twitter

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:34.459
and Facebook, and we'll see you inside the
next video.
