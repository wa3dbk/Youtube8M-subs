Hi my name is Nate McCullough on behalf of
Expert Village. In the following clips we're

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.760
going to talk about the correct procedure
for replacing your upper and lower ball joints

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.789
on a two wheel drive full size vehicle. In
this clip we're going to talk about removal

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.080
of the cotter pin and retaining nut on your
upper ball joint. As you can see I have my

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.289
replacement upper ball joint here. I'm going
to take the nut off and show you the hole

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.640
that our cotter pin goes through. There's
a hole right there, that is a safety feature

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.590
to keep that nut from working it's way loose
over time. The cotter pin inserts through

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:52.170
the castle nut into that hole and is bent
down. I'm going to go ahead and remove the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.199
one that is factory installed right now. The
tool I like to use is a pair of wire cutters.

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.989
They can apply an amazing amount of grip to
something like a cotter pin and they work

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:35.120
great for removing them. Alright and that
is the proper way to remove your cotter pin.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:43.960
You take and break loose the retaining nut
right now. Ok I'm going to slip my socket

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:55.720
onto the upper ball joint retaining nut and
break it loose. Your going to continue ratcheting

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.469
your socket wrench until the nut comes off.
Your new ball joint should come with a new

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:18.270
fastening nut and cotter pin so you don't
have to worry about saving those components.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:26.450
You continue ratcheting until it comes off
and we're just about there.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.819
And that is the proper method for removal
of your cotter pin and the retaining nut also

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.600
referred to as a castle nut. As you can see
it looks like the ramparts of a castle.
