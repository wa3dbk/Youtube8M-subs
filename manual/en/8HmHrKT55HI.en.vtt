00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.609
Hey I'm Justin with AmericanMuscle.com, and
I'm taking a closer look at this custom fit

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.230
bra from Covercraft, fitting all 2010-2012
Mustang GTs.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.089
Covercraft has been making quality products
for many years to help protect your Mustang

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.020
from all kinds of dangers.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.519
This bra in particular is going to be your
cure for rock chips and other paint damaging

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.350
road debris, whether you use it day to day,
on long road trips, or getting to and from

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.410
your next show.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.289
Ok, so bras may not be the most popular aesthetic
mod you can do to the front of your Mustang,

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.120
but when it comes down to protecting your
cars paint, there really is no better way.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.420
The first thing I noticed when taking a closer
look at this bra, is the quality of materials

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.420
used.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.110
Covercraft went with a very thick, leathery
textured black material, that will no doubt

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.850
protect your car's paint from rock chips and
other small dents.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.640
Flipping this thing over you'll find a very
soft felt like material, that's not going

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.309
to harm your car's paint while the bra is
in place.

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.380
The best part is all these materials are completely
breathable, so it's going to allow any clear

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.250
coat damaging heat and moisture to escape.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.830
Besides these quality materials, you can see
this is not some generic one size fits all

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.130
product here.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.000
This bra from Covercraft has been customized
specifically to the lines of these 2010 through

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.380
2012 cars, and fits perfectly in all the right
areas.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.540
This bra also features cutouts and intake
screens, to protect your car's radiator whilst

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.630
still allowing air to enter.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.530
Finally you'll notice the 2 mini spoilers
on the hood section, which Covercraft does

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.610
implement into a lot of their bras, and are
designed to keep the bra from flapping around

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.280
at highway speeds.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.840
Installing the bra for the first time should
only take you 30 minutes to an hour but once

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.100
you get the hang of it, taking the bra on
and off becomes a much quicker and easier

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.100
process.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.470
So if you're looking for unmatched protection
for the front end of your 2010 through 2012

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.100
Mustang GT, then you have to check out this
custom fit bra from Covercraft, available
