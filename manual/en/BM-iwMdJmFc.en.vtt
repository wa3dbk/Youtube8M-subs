JEREMY: Hey Guys!
TONI EVANS: Hi Jeremy how are you?

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.240
JEREMY: Ready. 
TONI EVANS: Alright, ready for work?

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.640
JEREMY: Yep.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.620
TONI EVANS: Hi Jeremy how are you?

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.640
TONI EVANS: Alright, ready for work?

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.560
TONI EVANS: We started with an assessment
at three different locations and we tried

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.280
one at a retirement home to see if that will
be a good match. And Jeremy seemed to be a

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.560
really good match so I approached Pablo to
see if there was a possibility of paid employment

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.620
and we were able to make that match work.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.960
JEREMY: Yeah man I'm so excited.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.220
My dad just called me the other day and told
that we are going to Montana too.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.980
It's so sweet.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.300
BECKY NELSON: I love him and he wants to do
well and he takes instruction and that's really

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.800
good.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.810
He is a positive person and of course the
work situation is very supportive of him and

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.840
really supportive of us if we have a concern
or need they come right in to helping us.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:02.440
I will say they really care about who he is
and he really cares about them so that works

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.120
out well.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.900
TONI EVANS: Jeremy's coffee task list.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.680
It explains about the tables and what they
get.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.660
So that just kinda helps him remember which tables
get what.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.500
JEREMY: You got to wash your hands twice if
you want to stay healthy you know.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.120
Now, if the bag rips I go grab a new one.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.320
TONI EVANS: I think with Jeremy it takes his
family being involved, it takes the work and

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.240
his co-workers being involved, it takes Jeremy
being involved and it takes PROVAIL being

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.520
involved. And it and it takes a whole village
to make Jeremy successful at work.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.960
JEREMY: There we go.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.340
Trash bin all set.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.040
PABLO BINONDA: Jeremy actually brings a lot
to, first of all, our residents. They enjoy

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.880
him a lot. As far as the kitchen staff is
concerned he does a good job keeping up with

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.960
everybody and as long as we stay focused on
his responsibilities, which is pretty much

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.879
routine, he's really good.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:40.280
MARGE: He' s been my friend for a long time.
And he's interested in whatever you are doing

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.960
and you go ask him for anything and he knows when to help.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.460
BECKY NELSON: We have fine-tuned this situation
because it hasn't always been just prefect,

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.080
it doesn't happen like that. You got to have
good people that know what they are doing

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.819
and helping us and that's what we had here.
You know if you ever have a concern just go

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.040
to our good person here and she helps us.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.140
Yay.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.700
She's just a jewel.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.320
At first I was like "I don't know if this
is going to work out" but then she is very

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.880
positive, helping us to be even more positive
and of course the residents adore him.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.040
MAN: Why you like it?

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.740
JEREMY: People and friends I have here.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.980
Here you go.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.500
DORCAS: Very nice fellow, willing to do anything
you ask.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.840
BERNICE: Always on the up-beat, ready to talk
to us about his activities and help us.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.480
JEREMY: So then what I do is put all of these
in here.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.540
See?

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:03.040
GINA: I like him, he's really a nice guy.
He tries his best, you know... he tries and tries... a hundred percent.
