Hey guys and gals, Amanda here.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.160
And lately it seems many of the games I've
been trying out have either been absolutely

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.680
beautiful or totally junky as far as art style
and direction.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.460
Well recently I came across an point and click
puzzle indie game on the steam network I've

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.680
been meaning to try since my friend told me
about it called Lume.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.900
Lume involves a green themed environment and
story line as you join Lumi on her quest to

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.370
restore power to her grandparents already
green home.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.460
The art style in this is what I'd like to
touch on first because it's really like nothing

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.420
I have ever seen before.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.890
The only thing that comes to mind when looking
at this is Little Big Planet but there aren't

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.750
really any stick in your face 3D elements
in here, and those that are they basically

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.510
look like they are filmed and just an overlay
in the game.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:24.570
It's beautiful really, it is.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.220
Well as far as play you're pointing and clicking
your way around.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.320
Once you get the okay to click which is illustrated
by your familiar white glove hand icon you

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.780
may click away and see what puzzle lies ahead.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.930
I found many of the puzzles a little difficult
at first to be honest which actually made

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.950
me feel this game was worth the money I invested
in it.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.799
Being only 6.99 you hope that a game this
short can still do what it's supposed to,

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.160
entertain and amaze you.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.979
Well again, I was nothing shy of entertained
and amazed.

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.329
Lumi right from the start keeps getting more
puzzles for you to solve and one of my favorites

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.990
being where you have to fix her grandpa's
solar panel by aligning everything up so no

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.049
spare ends are left out in the wires.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.950
The hardest puzzle to me was actually one
where I had a graph and had to keep moving

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.060
to different locations on it to find the one
that was ideal for the answer.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.310
I took me a little bit of time to get the
path right but once you figure it out your

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.390
golden.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.110
But if you don't want to necessarily solve
things right away you can click on things

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.470
in the house once you actually get inside
such as photos of Lumi and her relatives.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.470
But there isn't much freedom as far as that
because you're quickly either collecting items

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.610
or using them for the next part of your mission
to restore power.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.970
Now I am not 100% sure if they expect to release
more chapters yet.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.879
After finishing the game's main story you're
told that more chapters lie ahead or maybe

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:56.070
will lie ahead?

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.310
I can only hope there are more because it
was by far one of my favorite indie games

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.520
for my pc I own to date, I think mostly because
of the art style being so unique.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.319
And on top of everything this game uses the
whole going green theme to try and invoke

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.050
a message of conserving energy.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.980
Beautiful game, great message, and challenging
puzzles, what more could you want in an indie

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:28.519
game this cheap, I love it.
