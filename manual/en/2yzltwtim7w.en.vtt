00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I’m feeling better and better all the time, and it won’t be long before I’m back to 100 percent

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I’m glad to hear that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I’m pleased to visit Japan again. I hope I can come back again and again. Thank you.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I came once with the under-16 national team, and then once with Santos, so this is my third time.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I don’t play to be the best in the world — I just try my best to be a good player and to do my bit for the Brazil team.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:24.000
My dream was always to win titles, score goals and play in Europe, and I want to strive to keep doing that.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It’s very comfortable.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It’s good for relaxing, and it is helping me recover (after the injury).

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Thank you. I’ll be sure to use it.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It was a long trip here, so I look forward to having a good rest with this mattress and pillow.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I’m looking to have a good season with Barcelona, and I’ll be working hard to get fit and get results.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 I’m feeling better, so I’m looking forward to playing alongside my teammates.
