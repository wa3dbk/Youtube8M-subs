00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:27.130
I don’t have any numbers to back this up,
but I don’t think there’s ever been a

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.939
game heard of by so many...and yet played
by so few.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.179
A lot of gamers know about Phalanx, but in
most cases, that knowledge only goes as far

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:38.370
as its infamous box art.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.789
Of course, to be fair, that box art goes a
long way.

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.579
So you see that guy, and you think...this
game is going to be awesome, right?

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.070
Either that or it’s going to be the worst
f*cking thing ever.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.039
But either way...it’s at least going to
have a cool premise.

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.640
But alas...old Abner’s involvement ends
at the box art.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.190
And that’s what makes it so bizarre.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.950
It has nothing to do with the game at all.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.879
It’s just there to be different and to get
your attention, which it’s done for the

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:04.879
last 20 years.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.170
I mean, it was smart marketing, but if you
want your shooter to stand out...make the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.250
game memorable, not the box.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.119
As it is, Phalanx is...just another space
shooter.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:30.080
Of course, that’s not to say it’s not
a perfectly good one.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.100
Released in 1992, Phalanx is basically a side-scrolling
space shooter in the classic tradition.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.960
Like Gradius or R-Type, that kind of thing.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.619
It’s the year 2279, and something has gone
wrong with a planetary research project.

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.820
So it’s up to ace pilot Wink Baulfield to
save the day.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.930
Doesn’t even have a beard, I bet.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.630
So there are eight stages, each one with its
own other-worldly aesthetic.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.920
There are these massive cities beneath thick
alien atmospheres, watery mechanical passages,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.880
strange caves crawling with worms...the game
has a really cool look, but it’s a look

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.980
we’ve seen a lot in a lot of similar games.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.820
Especially during the 90s.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:31.030
And that feeling of “been there, done that”
kind of extends into the gameplay, too.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.660
It’s pretty much par for the course.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.810
Now, the cool thing is that...there are plenty
of weapons you can collect, and you can store

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.940
up to three of them.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.390
So if a certain situation calls for a different
weapon, you can actually switch as you go.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.030
You can also adjust your speed in-game, switching
between three speeds as levels change.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.560
But even with these little tweaks...the game
never feels as different as you’re hoping

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.560
it will.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.090
Don’t get me wrong—it’s an awesome shooter,
it’s brutal, it’s still fun to play.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.450
But with box art like that, you expect something
crazy.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.150
Phalanx isn’t crazy.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.570
In fact, it’s...downright normal.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.660
Huge thanks to our friend Ben from New York
for sending us Phalanx and letting us finally

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.110
play the legend.
