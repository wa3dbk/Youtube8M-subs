Hi, everyone! This is Ruri Ikeda.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:16.440
Today, I'm going to show the top 3 of my best beauty products 2014.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
For the 3rd prize,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:28.300
I chose this liquid foundation "Teint Fluide Ã©clat" by CleDePeau Beaute.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.720
This foundation is a cream texture.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.560
Can you see?

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.000
When you apply it on and spread it,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.720
it makes your skin natural and flawless.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.660
This makes my skin so radiant,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.780
that I don't need to use concealers.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.700
It really covers everything and I can't let go of it.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.880
It's a little bit expensive, but its worth it.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.560
So this was one of my essential item.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.100
For the 2nd prize,

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.900
I picked "BB Mineral Powder" by Ettusais.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:38.800
I actually repeatedly used this like 5 times.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.220
This is a face powder with some skin color.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.960
I use this when fixing makeup, and

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.160
it makes my skin look so fresh.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:04.620
Also, Ettusais is really good because you can use it on sensitive skins.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.020
Making your skin natural, and ability to apply on sensitive skins,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.240
are 2 strong points of this product, I think.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.700
When I don't need perfect makeup like going out to neighbors,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.700
I only put this on for my base makeup.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.660
It is very useful for me.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.160
Then..

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.120
My best beauty product 2014 is

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.680
"Beauty Keep Base" by Maquillage.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.800
This was the very best face primer I've ever used.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.360
Whenever I do my makeup,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.060
I first spread this primer thinly all over my face,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.400
and put on foundations as I mentioned before.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.740
That makes my skin perfect all day.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:16.100
I used to have had some trouble with my oily and dry combination skin,

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:25.040
but after using this primer, I didn't have to worry about it anymore.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.960
It makes oily skin matte and dry skin moisturized at the same time.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.520
This primer can be used with whatever foundations you like.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.660
I am sure that this will keep your foundation fresh and matte all day.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.680
Why don't you try it?

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.000
That's all for my best beauty products 2014.
