00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.839
The standoff in Ukraine may have its first
predictable boiling point as Russia issues

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.039
an ultimatum to local soldiers: leave Crimea
in the southeast part of the country or face

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:13.809
a "military storm."

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.340
"Russia's official news agency says the Russians
have given Ukrainian forces until tomorrow

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.480
morning to surrender or they will storm military
bases on the Crimean Peninsula."

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.480
(Via CNN)

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.369
The latest move comes as U.S. officials have
acknowledged the Russian military has complete

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.420
operational control of Crimea, surrounding
Ukrainian bases with troops.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.420
(Via ITV)

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.980
Russia's foreign minister told the UN Monday
it only sent troops to Crimea to protect ethnic

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.980
Russians.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.760
In fact, several local pro-Russian militias
from Crimea joined them in surrounding the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.760
bases.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.071
The Crimean peninsula in southeast Ukraine
borders Russia and was part of the Russian

00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:51.899
Soviet state until the 1950s.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.700
A majority of the population there is ethnically
Russian.

(Via Al Jazeera)

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.160
Ukraine is now increasingly divided between
the largely pro-Russian east and the west,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.270
where a majority wants to join the European
Union and ousted then-president Viktor Yanukovych

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.479
two weeks ago.

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.700
Up to now, reporters pointed out the presumably-Russian
troops in Crimea weren't acting aggressively,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.200
many soldiers unarmed and allowing cameras
to get close.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.220
But Ukrainian troops have insisted they won't
leave.

REPORTER: "Kiev or Crimea?"

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.650
UKRAINIAN SOLDIER: "Ukraine.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.650
Ukraine."

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.970
REPORTER: "Ukraine together."

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.600
SOLDIER: "Yes, of course."

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.030
REPORTER: "And you'll stay."

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.030
SOLDIER: "Yes."​ (Via BBC)

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.270
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry tweeted
Sunday he'd travel to the Ukrainian capital

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.200
Kiev Tuesday to meet with the interim government.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.840
The prime minister there has acknowledged
it currently has "no military options on the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.840
table."

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.909
MICHAEL SINGH, WASHINGTON INSTITUTE: "I mean,
one big concern is what Amy was just mentioning

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.079
— the possibility Russia will try to seize
not just Crimea, but now further territory

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.079
in Ukraine."

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.079
(Via Fox News)

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.399
The Telegraph reports the Russian Defense
Ministry's spokesperson dismissed the claims

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.369
of an ultimatum, calling them "complete nonsense."

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.810
​However, an editor for the English language
newspaper Kyiv Post posted this to Twitter:

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.609
"Despite what Russian Defense Ministry says,
those of us who were there heard this ship

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.359
deliver ultimatum to Slavutych."

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:15.359
(Via Twitter / ChristopherJM)

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:19.150
​Slavutych is one of the Ukrainian Navy's
command ships reportedly blocked into its

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.470
harbor by Russian ships and ordered to surrender.
