00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.060
Welcome back to "Keep Calm and Bake".

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.630
Im Caroline and I have my own You Tube cooking
channel.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.230
But today Im going to teach you how to make
an Apple Crumble.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:23.390
To start with I've got a big bowl of some
Bramley apples, already peeled, cored and

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.390
chopped.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.190
These are going to go straight into my sauce
pan.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.990
Pour your water in.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.170
Then your sugar.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.469
A sprinkle of cinnamon, just to give it that
extra bit of flavor; because apples and cinnamon

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:42.920
make an amazing combination.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.690
Leave this to bubble a just for few minutes
until the apples start going a little bit

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.690
soft.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.690
Mix the corn flour with a little bit of water,
just to make it into a paste.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.739
Pour this into your apples, give it a good
stir around, and just leave this for another

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.050
couple of minutes; just to thicken up that
sauce.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.070
The corn flour makes this sauce in the apples;
makes all those juices lovely and thick, and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.550
syrupy.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.030
Okay.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.760
Now you don't even have to cook the apples
that long, so these are ready; it's just been

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.760
on there a few minutes.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.440
I'm going to pour this into my dish.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.740
Lovely, so get it all in there.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.740
Gosh.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:41.080
This is probably one of my favorite, most
comfy, warming deserts; Apple Crumble with

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.080
custard.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.080
Yeah.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.160
Now leave this to one side, and you can make
your crumble topping now.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.000
Just add your flour.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.550
Next your cold butter cut into cubes.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.550
Sugar.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.540
Custard powder; that my secret tip.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.370
Now pulse this until it becomes fine bread
crumbs.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.810

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.200
Great that's done.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.200
Now you just stop mixing it, once it forms,
kind of like, biggish lumps.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.180
I kind of make sure I have some big chunks
and fine chunks.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.260
And the custard powder; in case you are wondering
why I put custard powder in my crumble; is

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.700
that I like my topping to be lovely and crispy
and a little bit crunchy, so it basically

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.760
helps get that crunch going on.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.889
Now you can pour the topping,over all the
apples.

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.069
There you go.

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.810
Make sure everything is covered.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.810
Okay.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.170
Okay then!

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.739
That's it!

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:01.739
Its pretty easy.

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.159
Now this goes into the oven at 180 degrees
C, for about thirty to forty minutes, or until

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.930
you see the top is all golden and a little
bit of the apple juice is oozing up through

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:12.930
the sides.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.430
Right, lets serve some up!

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.670
Could you hear that crunch?

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.090
The topping is lovely and crispy and crunchy.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.519
Right a big portion coming out.

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:27.519
Yum.

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.409
The apples are lovely and soft and there's
still a little bit of sauce in there which

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.689
is great.

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.590
So for me this is perfect, its not too runny
and you've still got a little bit of sauce

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.780
which is great.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.790
If only you could smell it!

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.879
I can waft some smell out to you.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:52.319
Now I can't have crumble without come custard
so; on goes my custard.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.499
Right, very, very good.

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:59.200
