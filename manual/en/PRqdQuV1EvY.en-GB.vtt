00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.339
In this video, we'll be showing you how to
make your own timber-look clock. The tools

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.889
and materials you'll need are a circular saw,
cordless drill and drill bit, gloss enamel

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.310
spray paint, Stanley knife, tape measure,
PVA wood glue, paint roller, hack saw, timber-looking

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.170
contact sheet, square quad, and a clock for
the mechanism and hands. Finally, you'll need

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.980
safety protection: Goggles, dust mask, and
earplugs.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:42.430
Firstly, measure out and mark up a square
on your plywood sheet. Then cut it out with

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.210
a circular saw, making sure you wear your
eye, ear, and face protection. Then roll out

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:59.120
and cover your square with the contact. Find
your length and cut to suit along one edge.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.100
Then peel off the backing of the contact sheet
and stick it down to the plywood, leaving

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.549
some over hang around the edge. Use the paint
roller to smooth out any bubbles in your contact

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.369
as you stick it down. Turn the plywood over
and cut the contact at the corners to fold

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:29.159
back over the edge of the plywood, using the
roller to remove any bubbles as you go.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.289
Measure and mark out 12 lengths of quad for
your clock face, allowing for 4 large lengths

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:46.920
and 8 small lengths. Sand back the cut quad
to remove splinters. Then spray paint 1 of

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.831
the 4 larger lengths of quad. This will be
your 12:00 piece. On your plywood, measure

00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:58.969
and mark out the halfway points along each
side. This will be where your 12:00, 3:00,

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:07.560
6:00, and 9:00 points will be located on your
clock face.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.120
Add the PVA glue to your quad, starting with
the 12:00 piece, and stick it to your plywood

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.140
at the 12:00 position. Then add the 3 other
larger pieces of quad to the 3:00, 6:00, and

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:29.900
9:00 spots. Then add the 8 small pieces of
quad in between the larger ones, like this.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.600
Once the quad is dry, drill a hole in the
center of the face for the hands. Remove the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.750
clock mechanism and hands from your existing
clock. Turn your clock face over and stick

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:49.100
the clock mechanism into the hole. Turn it
back while holding the clock mechanism in

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.850
place, and then place the clock hands on to
the mechanism's shaft in the hole. Once in

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.180
place, arrange the hands to the right time,
and you're done.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.570
Build your timber-look clock to suit your
dÃ©cor and add that extra character to your

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.900
room. For more details on making this timber-look
