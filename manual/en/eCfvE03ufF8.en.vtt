00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:10.354
Ray. Ray!

00:00:10.437 --> 00:00:12.439
&lt;i&gt;Ray, come here.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:20.156
What is it?

00:00:22.992 --> 00:00:25.453
It's my neighbour.

00:00:26.662 --> 00:00:32.085
Hey, one of the Huns
came out of the cave.

00:01:06.205 --> 00:01:08.999
Why don't you go say hi?

00:01:10.418 --> 00:01:12.670
Well, yeah, I guess I could.

00:01:12.753 --> 00:01:15.674
This would be the perfect time.

00:01:15.757 --> 00:01:19.094
If you go talk to him,
we could see what he's like. Go.

00:01:19.177 --> 00:01:21.513
You could say hi to him too.

00:01:21.596 --> 00:01:23.974
- But he's your neighbour.
- No, he's your neighbour as well.

00:01:24.057 --> 00:01:26.351
But you share a property line with him.

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:29.021
We're all on the same block,
so you could go too.

00:01:29.104 --> 00:01:32.191
We're all in the same town,
but you're next to him.

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:34.527
&lt;i&gt;If he was gonna borrow anything,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;he'd come over to your place.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.238
&lt;i&gt;Well, he's busy now.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:39.824
He's not busy. Now he's goin' in.
Go now because if...

00:01:39.907 --> 00:01:44.580
&lt;i&gt;He's going back in. If you were&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;gonna say hi, you should probably...&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:44.663 --> 00:01:47.124
He's going into the house.
You're gonna lose him.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:49.543
&lt;i&gt;He's gonna go in...&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:49.626 --> 00:01:51.879
- Now you've blown it, haven't you?
- No, I didn't blow it.

00:01:51.962 --> 00:01:54.048
- Chicken. Chicken.
- He went into his house.

00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:56.383
I'm not chicken because
he went into his house.

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:59.971
You look like a chicken in front of
your son and everything. Your son.

00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:01.973
Come on.
