00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.710
Of the trillions slain by the murderous robotic
peacekeepers known as the Manhunters, Atrocitus

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.360
was among the five survivors.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.230
These survivors formed a terrorist group called
the Five Inversions, who waged war against

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.680
the peackeeper’s creators, the Guardians,
but were defeated and imprisoned.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.509
The rage of Atrocitus could not be confined,
and he broke free, butchering his fellow Inversions

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.269
to fashion the first Red Power Ring.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.550
So armed, his war on the Guardians began anew.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.330
Atrocitus is a disruptive Enforcer who unleashes
furious might on unsuspecting foes.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.540
His passive is Red Lantern’s Rage, which
damages nearby enemies with Power Damage when

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.870
attacked.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.970
Atrocitus is fueled by his rage, replacing
the Will Meter with a Rage Meter.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:02.110
His basic attacks fill his Rage meter, as
does damage from enemy drones and champions.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.650
After several seconds without gaining Rage,
the meter will begin to drain.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.990
Atrocitus’ skills normally have no cost,
but at half Rage or more his skills become

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.539
Enraged, consuming half of his maximum Rage
and adding a bonus effect.

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.880
Use Crimson Slash to empower his next basic
attack, granting additional Power Damage and

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.609
slowing the target’s move speed.

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:32.620
If enraged, the Power Damage and slow are
dealt to all enemies near the target.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.670
You can taunt nearby drones to attack Atrocitus
for a few seconds by using Come at Me.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.369
While active, Atrocitus receives a flat damage
reduction that increases with his missing

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.409
health.

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.210
When enraged, Come at Me greatly increases
the frequency of Red Lantern’s Rage.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.210
Overwhelming Rage fills an enemy champion
with Rage, forcing them and Atrocitus to charge

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.640
each other.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.299
When the two collide, Atrocitus deals Power
Damage and briefly roots his enemy.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:07.000
If enraged, he taunts the champion and trades
basic attacks for a few seconds.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.360
Atrocitus and his enemy hit with increased
Attack Speed and reduced Attack Damage.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.099
His ultimate is Plasma Wave.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:21.069
Atrocitus spews a cone of deadly plasma, increasing
the enemy’s incoming damage and dealing

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.230
Power Damage over time.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.650
Playing as Atrocitus is all about managing
Red Lantern’s Rage.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.180
Atrocitus plays best when he can open a fight
with Rage, so, before moving to attack, try

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.349
to wipe out a drone wave or jungle camp.

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.930
When jungling, take Crimson Slash first and
use it to quickly clear two easy drone camps.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.050
Next, at level 2, take Overwhelming Rage and
look for gank opportunities in nearby lanes.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.519
A great early-gank combo is to open with an
empowered Overwhelming Rage and then follow-up

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.819
with Crimson Slash.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.620
If no nearby enemies are vulnerable to ganks,
continue jungling to hit level 3 and take

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.930
Come at Me.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.920
In general, it’s best to save Plasma Wave
for team fights, when your damage-focused

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.750
allies can follow-up on it.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.380
This is because enemies hit by Plasma Wave
take increased damage from all sources,-

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.670
-but also because it fills your Rage bar and
allows you to disrupt enemy damage-dealers

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.459
with Overwhelming Rage or Crimson Slash.

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.819
Atrocitus benefits greatly from Armor, Power
Damage, and Cooldown Reduction.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.030
Atlantean Royal Seal and Cosmic belt are excellent
Artifacts for almost any situation.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:42.450
If you’re after durability, consider Fragment
of Mogo, Eclipso’s Diamond, and Ra’s al

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.689
Ghul’s Robe.

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:49.140
For more damage, try Blue Scarab, Cosmic Belt,
and the Starheart.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.810
Finally, Olympus Gambit or Amulet of Isis
can both provide solid utility for aiding

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.240
your allies.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.140
Atrocitus’ Meteor Drop slows enemies it
hits in addition to dealing damage.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.939
It’s great for the extra slow, making ganks
using Overwhelming Rage and Crimson Slash

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:06.280
even stronger.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:13.040
Rip your enemies apart with plasma and fury
as Atrocitus, leader of the Red Lanterns.
