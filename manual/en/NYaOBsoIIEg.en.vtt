00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.830
This video explains how to fix your printer when you have a paper jam error message on

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.769
your computer. Clear the paper jam from the back of the printer

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.769
first. Remove the paper from the input tray.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.859
Then, press the power button to turn the printer off.

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.859
Next, go to the back of the printer… …and unplug the power cord.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:49.100
Remove the rear access door… …and check the printer for the jammed paper.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.100
Remove the paper by pulling evenly with both hands to avoid tearing.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.050
If the paper tears while removing it from the rollers, check the rollers and wheels

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.679
for torn pieces of paper that might remain inside the printer. If any torn pieces of

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:10.889
paper remain inside the printer, more paper jams are likely to occur.

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:18.889
Re-insert the rear access door into the printer. Then go to the front of the printer.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.429
Check to see if paper is jammed in the front. Be careful when removing paper from the front.

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:27.719
It can damage the printer. Open the top cover of the printer.

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.829
Gently remove any paper you see. Make sure you get all the small pieces that may tear

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.759
off. If the paper tears while removing it from the rollers, check the rollers and wheels

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.869
for any pieces of paper that may remain. If all the pieces of paper are not removed from

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.079
the printer, more paper jams are likely to occur.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.139
Use a flashlight to make sure you have removed all the small pieces of paper from inside

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:53.779
the printer. When you've removed the paper, close the

00:01:53.779 --> 00:02:01.779
top cover… …and go to the back of the printer.

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:08.619
Plug the power cord back in. Then go to the front of the printer.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.849
Press the power button to turn the printer back on.

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.510
Once the printer has stopped making noises, lift the top cover of the printer.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.060
The carriage might try to move into the center of the printer. If so, allow it to move into

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.110
that position. Go to the back of the printer.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.150
While the printer is still on, disconnect the power cord from the back of the printer.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.090
Go to the front of the printer. Check for obstructions under and around the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.290
carriage that could prevent it from moving. Make sure the carriage can move freely by

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.909
gently pushing it to the left and then to the right. This helps find any obstructions

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.569
that might block the movement of the carriage. If any obstructions are found while moving

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.799
the carriage, remove them from the printer. Close the top cover of the printer.

00:02:52.799 --> 00:03:01.659
Go to the back of the printer. And reconnect the power cord to the back of

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.680
the printer. Go to the front of the printer.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.510
If the printer does not automatically turn on, press the power button on the control

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.280
panel to turn printer on. Try printing a self-test page.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.989
On the printer control panel, press and hold the Cancel button.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.090
While holding the Cancel button, press the START COPY Black button.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.939
Release both buttons. If the test page prints successfully, the

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:33.340
issue is resolved. If the test page does not print, go on to the next step.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.430
Printer rollers get dirty from paper dust, ink, and oil from your fingers. In this step,

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.040
we'll clean them. Before you begin, gather the following cleaning

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.749
materials: • Clean, lint-free cloth

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:51.109
• Clean cotton swabs • Clean water to dampen the cloth. Distilled

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:57.840
or bottled is preferable but not required. Do not use alcohol or other chemical cleaners.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.840
Go to the back of the printer. Unplug the power cord from the back of the

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:14.159
printer. Remove the printer's rear access door.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.319
Clean the rollers visible in the printer with a clean, lint-free cloth lightly moistened

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:25.400
with water. The cloth should be damp, but not soaking wet. Use your finger to turn the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.169
rollers toward the printer. Make sure you remove any buildup or debris from the entire

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.740
surface of the roller. Look for the paper pick rollers farther inside

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.199
the rear of the printer. Clean the rollers with a moistened cotton swab, removing any

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:45.520
buildup or debris. These rollers are difficult to reach, but are very important to clean.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.490
While the rear access door is off, check the rollers on the door. Note if any rollers are

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.460
missing, don't roll freely, or are not springy when you push on them. These conditions could

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.330
mean the rollers aren't feeding paper, and that the rear access door needs to be replaced.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:09.330
Reinsert the printer's rear access door. Plug the power cord back in.

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:19.050
And go to the front of the printer. Press the power button to turn the printer

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.720
on. Lift the top cover of the printer.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.229
The carriage will move into the access area. Go to the back of the printer.

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:35.229
While the printer is still on, disconnect the power cord from the back of the printer.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.710
Go to the front of the printer. Check for obstructions under and around the

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.900
carriage that could prevent it from moving. Make sure the carriage can move freely by

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.419
gently pushing it to the left and then to the right. This helps find any obstructions

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.190
that might block the movement of the carriage. If any obstructions are found while moving

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.259
the carriage, remove them from the printer. Close the top cover of the printer.

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:07.259
Go to the back of the printer. And reconnect the power cord to the back of

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.300
the printer. Go to the front of the printer.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.129
If the printer does not automatically turn on, press the power button on the control

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:17.440
panel to turn the printer on.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.560
Try to print a self-test page again. On the product control panel, press and hold

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.659
the Cancel button. While holding the Cancel button, press the

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:30.400
START COPY Black button. Release both buttons.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.889
If the test page prints successfully, the issue is resolved.

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:39.180
If the test page does not print, go on to the next step.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.720
Sometimes the issue can be resolved by resetting the printer.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.840
Perform a power reset by first removing all the paper in the input tray.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:53.840
Make sure that the printer is on, if it is off, press the power button to turn it on.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:02.270
Go to the back of the printer. Without turning the power off, disconnect

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.830
the power cord from the back of the printer. Pull the power cord from the wall outlet.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:15.830
Wait 15 seconds. Then reinsert the power cord into the wall

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.220
outlet. Next, plug the power cord into the printer.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:26.039
If the printer does not turn on by itself, press the power button to turn it on.

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:31.270
Try printing a self-test page again. On the printer control panel, press and hold

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.289
the Cancel button. While holding the Cancel button, press the

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:37.419
START COPY Black button. Release both buttons.

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:45.489
If the test page prints successfully, the issue is resolved. If the test page does not

00:07:45.489 --> 00:07:49.069
print, go on to the next step. If you've tried everything described in

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:54.080
this video and you still have a problem, your printer likely needs some type of service.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.090
Contact HP to find out what the support options are for your printer. Your options for service

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.589
may vary depending on how long you've owned the printer and what country you live in.
