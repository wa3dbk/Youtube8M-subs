00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.200 position:67%
MILES O'BRIEN: Theres no stopping time from
slipping into the future.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.330 position:80%
But that doesn't stop scientists from wondering how
living things know when its time to open up,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.730 position:59%
shut down, grab a meal or go to sleep.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.700 position:81%
JONATHAN ARNOLD: Its a fundamental adaptation
that helps organisms anticipate the daily light-dark

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.400
cycle on the planet.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.100 position:77%
MILES O'BRIEN: How fundamental?
Well, just hop on a long plane ride and learn how

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.800 position:59%
unfun it can be when you try to ignore
your internal clock.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.730 position:84%
With help from the National Science Foundation,
geneticist Jonathan Arnold is studying the intricacies

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.570 position:58%
of this at the University of Georgia,
using bread whose time is up.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.000 position:77%
He uses the mold, the organism neurospora crassa.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.970 position:83%
Arnold studies it because its easier to get a handle
on something this complex by focusing on a relatively

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.400
simple example.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.330 position:81%
JONATHAN ARNOLD: Because we can look at
thousands of cell divisions over a seven-day period,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.700 position:63%
wherein a mouse or some more complicated
organism, it would be much harder.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.070 position:78%
MILES O'BRIEN: It turns out these simple organisms
still has 11,000 genes, and many of them are

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.730
programmed to tell time.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:29.300 position:78%
JONATHAN ARNOLD: A quarter of the genome, about
2,400 genes, are actually have a circadian rhythm.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.030 position:56%
That came to us as quite a surprise.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.230 position:83%
MILES O'BRIEN: Understanding this can do much
more than help us find new ways to fight off jet lag.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.870 position:78%
It turns out diseases listen to the clock as well.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.170 position:77%
JONATHAN ARNOLD: Strokes, sudden death from heart
attacks, heart attacks themselves have a

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.770
circadian rhythm.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.530 position:78%
MILES O'BRIEN: And some drugs, especially those
that fight cancer, are more effective depending on

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.500
when a patient takes them.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.770 position:78%
With so any genes in play, sometimes its difficult
to know which clock actions to study.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.130 position:69%
Thats for Arnolds colleague, physicist Bernd
Schuttler, comes in.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.630 position:66%
He uses statistical models to help unravel
the clocks complex genetic network.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.970 position:72%
BERND SCHUTTLER: We need to use the computer
to analyze and transform the experimental data

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.870 position:81%
that is seen in the lab into something that tells us
something about, you know, what is the system

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.030 position:59%
actually doing at the molecular level.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.370 position:67%
MILES O'BRIEN: First, penicillin, now this.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.370 position:69%
Without moldy bread, we might not understand
what makes us tick.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.800 position:56%
For Science Nation, Im Miles OBrien.
