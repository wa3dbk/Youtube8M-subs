00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.718
Namaskar! Welcome to Nishamadhulika.com.

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:14.303
Today we are going to see how Gram (Chana) and pulses (daal) are germinated.

00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:20.046
Gram and pulses are used in our everyday food.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.257
From these we get proteins, vitamins and carbohydrates.

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:40.531
If gram and pulses are germinated, then more vitamin
C is produced which is extremely necessary for us.

00:00:41.234 --> 00:00:47.656
Germinated seeds are full of fibre and are more digestive.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.187
For germination, we can take desi chana, kabuli
chana, moong, moth or pea (lobia) seeds.

00:00:57.812 --> 00:01:02.117
We have taken desi chana and green pulse (green moong).

00:01:02.742 --> 00:01:05.734
Desi Chana - ½ cup

00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:09.007
Moong dal - ½ cup

00:01:09.594 --> 00:01:18.968
For germination, we firstly need to clean the gram and
pulse.Wash them properly and soak them in water for 8-10 hours.

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:27.382
Make sure that the water in which the seeds are to be soaked
is 4 times more, as then only they will soak properly.

00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:36.640
We have soaked ½ cup gram in 2 cups of water.

00:01:48.359 --> 00:02:00.101
After 8-10 hours we will observe that the gram
and pulse is now double of its actual size.

00:02:00.844 --> 00:02:10.757
For germination, we need to remove the water from
the gram and pulse.We will wash them once again.

00:02:15.094 --> 00:02:32.203
To remove the water, we can either put them in a filter and cover with a wet cloth or
the other way is to put the seeds in a wet cotton cloth, tie it and put over a utensil.

00:02:32.711 --> 00:02:34.218
We can germinate the seeds in both ways.

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:41.976
The gram and pulses will germinate and become ready in about 24 to 36 hours.

00:02:48.773 --> 00:03:48.373
You can remove the water from the seeds in this way. Keep the
seeds for more time then only they will germinate properly.

00:03:50.044 --> 00:04:11.920
Make sure that the towel that we use for covering should not get dry,
otherwise the seeds will also get dry and will not germinate nicely.

00:04:35.895 --> 00:04:56.731
After germination the seeds will become 3 times of its
actual size and in weight also they become 3 times heavier.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.176
The seeds are now soft.

00:05:00.622 --> 00:05:13.301
We need normal atmosphere to germinate the seeds. The seeds
will not germinate if it is either too hot or too cold.

00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:07.449
Our gram and pulse has now germinated and is ready to be eaten.

00:06:07.864 --> 00:06:11.537
They can be eaten raw as they are very soft and fresh.

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:19.676
You can also enjoy it by adding salt and lemon to it.

00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:31.090
The seeds can also be boiled and eaten.

00:06:31.622 --> 00:06:43.504
For boiling, just add the gram and pulse
to the pressure cooker and add some water.

00:06:43.762 --> 00:06:48.809
Also add salt as per your taste. Boil it till 1 whistle comes.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:57.707
Once the pressure of the cooker is over, you can take them
out in a plate or bowl and enjoy them as they are too soft.

00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:06.403
But these germinated seeds should not be boiled too
much otherwise their nutritious value is decreased.

00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:18.332
If any extra water is left inside the germinated seeds, then do
not through it as this water is very healthy and nutritious.

00:07:18.737 --> 00:07:21.356
We can drink this as a soup.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.481
We can use these germinated seeds to make various different kinds of dishes.

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:46.489
We can make pakoras, parathas, cutlets,
chila, etc using these germinated seeds.

00:07:47.911 --> 00:07:52.605
Store the germinated seeds in the refrigerator and use it for 7 days.

00:07:53.387 --> 00:08:02.192
Germinate the gram and pulses, eat it and share
your experiences with us on Nishamadhulika.com.

00:08:02.567 --> 00:08:08.942
