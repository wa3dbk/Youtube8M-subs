00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:08.610
To save a chapter from an ebrary publication
as a PDF

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:22.489
You go to InfoTools and select the Print option
(I'll move this inside the screen)

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:28.610
And you pick the Current Chapter
noting that the book's page number

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.890
is different from the ebrary page number.
So if you are going to count pages

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.300
you want to use their page count,
not the book's page count.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.170
But you can pick a whole chapter and say Print.
It will retrieve those pages from the ebrary

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:56.350
site,
create image PDFs of them for printing,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:05.140
And you can save them as a PDF once you have
done that.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.310
Here we go... Almost done... page 210 is the
last.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.960
So it starts the print dialog once all the
pages are scanned

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.330
We can at this point choose to save it as
a PDF

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.640
rather than to print the document.
So you can save it to PDF.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.640
I could Mail the PDF if I knew which chapter
you wanted.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:43.369
I will save it as a PDF to my Desktop.
I'll give it a name and save it to my Desktop.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:59.360
If I go out of this window
you will see that

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.630
the page is there
and you can page through it,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.650
all 27 pages, but it is not a text document.
It is an image document

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:20.269
and so you cannot manipulate this text.
To save text that you can manipulate

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.769
you need to use the Copy function and go page
by page.
