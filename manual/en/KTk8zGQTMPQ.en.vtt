Teaching a Dog to Follow a Finger Point

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:09.001
Dogs are not born knowing how to follow a finger point. They must learn.

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:14.002
Finding dropped or thrown treats, toys and other objects can be faster and less frustrating

00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:19.003
for both of you if you take the time to teach your dog this skill.

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:25.004
Start with what the dog can already do. Lucy can find a treat when I point with my finger.

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:28.145
Add a Target Stick

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:33.146
Extend the tip just a little beyond your finger.

00:00:37.527 --> 00:00:41.057
Thisi teaches the dog to focus on the tip, not your finger.

00:00:43.058 --> 00:00:49.058
Build length, taking time to repeat each step 5 to 10 times as needed for the dog to achieve 80% success.

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.059
Change Your Orientation

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.060
In small increments, extend the length.

00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:08.061
Hopefully, the dog is getting the idea that the tip is an extension of your finger.

00:01:10.062 --> 00:01:18.062
To keep the game fun and to give rapid practice, place several treats on the floor (increasing by one at a time) and point to each one in succession.

00:01:23.063 --> 00:01:26.063
Change the pattern to keep it unpredictable.

00:01:41.064 --> 00:01:44.064
Here the pointer is at full length.

00:02:04.065 --> 00:02:08.065
Add Distance When the Pointer is at Full Length

00:02:10.716 --> 00:02:18.066
Again, use small increments by placing the treat at the same distance as the last training session, then add a little more each time.

00:02:19.067 --> 00:02:21.067
This is after several sessions.

00:02:22.128 --> 00:02:25.508
Decrease the Length of the Pointer Until You can Fade its Use

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:36.329
Place the treat to get her back to starting position.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.740
You will note that I try to point with the hand that is on the same side of my body as the dog.

00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:55.251
When pointing objects at a greater distance, I use my whole hand held flat and vertical to the ground.

00:02:57.252 --> 00:03:00.092
Both these make it easier for the dog to see the hand signal.

00:03:05.493 --> 00:03:08.093
The pointer is faded by this training session.

00:03:11.094 --> 00:03:13.094
Place the Treats While the Dog is Out of Sight.

00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:20.095
When adding new criteria, start with a longer pointer and less distance.

00:03:22.096 --> 00:03:27.096
To increase the challenge, I have hidden the treats behind objects so they are not so easy to see.

00:03:28.097 --> 00:03:39.097
To Explain the Behavior a Different Way, Throw the Treats starting with short distances and increase as the dog is successful.

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.099
Tips:       *Place treats along wall edges, behind furniture legs, and on carpets.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.100
*What is easy for us humans to see may not be for our dogs.

00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:55.101
The textured carpets I use for traction make it hard for my dogs to find find treats without direction or using their noses.

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:58.542
This skill has many applications:

00:03:59.543 --> 00:04:02.543
*dog learns to read and follow your body movements

00:04:02.544 --> 00:04:04.544
*indicates a direction for your dog to go

00:04:04.545 --> 00:04:08.545
* acts as a physical cue for people with limited verbal ability

00:04:08.546 --> 00:04:10.546
* select between two (or more) indicated objects

00:04:10.547 --> 00:04:12.547
*forms the beginnings of the 'find it' game

00:04:12.548 --> 00:04:20.208
*dog learns to 'mark' the location of an object (such as for dropped objects or bumper for field trialing)               *etc

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.209
