00:00:00.412 --> 00:00:01.895
- You've probably heard
of the placebo effect

00:00:01.895 --> 00:00:03.439
where a non medical drug can provide

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:05.186
real physiological change.

00:00:05.186 --> 00:00:07.888
When you take a placebo, if
you really, truly believe

00:00:07.888 --> 00:00:09.615
that it's going to work,
your brain can be tricked

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:11.322
into releasing the chemicals
that are associated

00:00:11.322 --> 00:00:12.561
with that effect.

00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:14.735
We decided to test the
placebo effect on our office

00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:17.697
to see if we can trick people
into having more energy.

00:00:17.864 --> 00:00:22.613
(upbeat dance music)

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.692
- For a science experiment
on homoeopathic medicine,

00:00:51.692 --> 00:00:55.387
would you be willing to take energy pills

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:57.105
for seven days?

00:00:58.152 --> 00:00:58.843
- No.

00:00:58.843 --> 00:00:59.798
- No?

00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:01.220
Oh, well.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.236
- What's it going to do to me?

00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:03.211
Like, what...

00:01:05.457 --> 00:01:08.194
- The effect should be increased energy

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:09.474
throughout the day though you could

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:11.269
become slightly irritable.

00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:13.711
Maybe lose sex drive a little bit.

00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:16.066
Those are the only two
recorded side effects.

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:19.021
- Alright, for science.

00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:21.023
- [Girl] For science!

00:01:22.545 --> 00:01:23.578
- Awesome.

00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:34.511
- [Voiceover] And just like
that in less than two hours,

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:36.343
one of our test subjects
was already reporting

00:01:36.343 --> 00:01:38.263
feeling the effects of the pill.

00:01:38.674 --> 00:01:41.043
- I am super, super wired right now.

00:01:41.043 --> 00:01:44.375
Like I feel like I'm in the matrix,

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:45.959
like I can see things different.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.844
I don't really know how to describe it

00:01:48.844 --> 00:01:51.079
other than maybe like an alcohol buzz?

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.528
It almost feels like I'm buzzed.

00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:55.887
I'm a little freaked
out, I'm not gonna lie.

00:02:00.856 --> 00:02:02.629
- A little bit, I think
it did help a little bit.

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:03.327
Yeah, why not?

00:02:03.327 --> 00:02:04.560
- Usually at the end of the day,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.021
I just wanna sleep, I just wanna rest,

00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:11.166
but after that I did feel like I'm okay.

00:02:12.427 --> 00:02:13.875
A couple days ago I went rock climbing

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:16.758
and I was able to do like five hours.

00:02:16.758 --> 00:02:21.313
I don't know if it was
the pill or if it was me

00:02:22.513 --> 00:02:24.049
but I was able to do it.

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.776
- I took it right before I drove home

00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:27.483
which is when I always feel the sleepiest

00:02:27.483 --> 00:02:28.925
when I'm driving home because traffic kind

00:02:28.925 --> 00:02:30.917
of just lulls me to sleep
so I decided the pill

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:34.313
and when I was in the car,
I was just losing my mind.

00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:35.555
My hands were jittery.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:38.339
When I got home, my eyes were super open.

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:41.697
I just felt like I had twice the amount

00:02:41.697 --> 00:02:42.903
of energy that I should.

00:02:43.703 --> 00:02:45.186
- So I've been taking the energy pills,

00:02:45.186 --> 00:02:48.355
this is the third day
and I still feel nothing.

00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:50.868
The first day, maybe, when I
took it, there was a little

00:02:50.868 --> 00:02:55.177
like a little surge but I
think that was more mental

00:02:55.177 --> 00:02:56.821
than anything.

00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:58.294
And the rest of the time I took it,

00:02:58.294 --> 00:03:00.611
it was just nothing.

00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:05.423
I'm pretty certain you guys
gave me just empty capsules.

00:03:06.762 --> 00:03:08.731
- [Voiceover] Cool, so
we did give you placebos.

00:03:08.731 --> 00:03:09.503
- You did?

00:03:09.503 --> 00:03:11.290
- [Voiceover] So, don't worry.

00:03:12.244 --> 00:03:14.120
- Ah, I knew it (laughing).

00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:15.971
- I actually, from day
one, knew that you guys

00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:16.837
gave them to me.

00:03:16.837 --> 00:03:20.211
I was like, hmm, they
never mentioned the name

00:03:20.211 --> 00:03:22.202
of this, I wonder if they're placebos.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.025
I wonder if mentally I was
like, these aren't real

00:03:24.025 --> 00:03:27.215
and that interfered with
how they could affect me?

00:03:27.215 --> 00:03:32.184
- It's weird, you're just
tricking your mind but it works.

00:03:32.553 --> 00:03:34.956
- I feel like my brain is pretty magical.

00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:38.897
And that if I just trick into
doing more of what I want

00:03:38.897 --> 00:03:41.554
I can have a very happy life.
