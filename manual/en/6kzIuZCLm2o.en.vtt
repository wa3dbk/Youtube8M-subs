00:00:01.511 --> 00:00:35.026
(UPBEAT INTRO MUSIC)

00:00:35.026 --> 00:00:36.650
Hey guys I'm Sara.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.421
And I'm Logan.

00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:40.529
And we are here at the Holiday Tree Lighting an annual tradition here 

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:42.079
at Longwood.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.391
(SLOW MUSIC)

00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:47.147
Sean, what is your favorite part of the holiday tree lighting 

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:48.819
here at Longwood?

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:51.849
Well it just starts off the holiday season right here at Longwood, its

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:55.558
always been a festive tradition and it just gets the holidays going on

00:00:55.558 --> 00:01:09.882
the right track.

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:12.630
I'm here with Dr. Cormier the president of Longwood University, 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.385
Dr. Cormier what is so important about the holiday tree lighting 

00:01:15.385 --> 00:01:17.109
every year for Longwood?

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:20.348
I think it is the symbol of our family coming together and launching 

00:01:20.348 --> 00:01:25.077
the holiday season, again, whatever religion you observe and this is 

00:01:25.077 --> 00:01:30.545
our way of expressing to people that this is the light of the world.

00:01:30.545 --> 00:01:33.488
What is your favorite part of the holiday tree lighting every year?

00:01:33.488 --> 00:01:36.884
I'll tell you what my very favorite part is, seeing all these little 

00:01:36.884 --> 00:01:40.211
children coming with their families and just seeing their eyes get so 

00:01:40.211 --> 00:01:43.553
big when they see those lights come on I mean its just spectacular, I 

00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:48.953
love it. 

00:01:48.953 --> 00:01:51.878
(SLOW MUSIC FADES OUT)

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:55.562
Every year Longwood University hosts its annual Thanksgiving Dinner 

00:01:55.562 --> 00:01:59.088
and this year we decided that, as a cast, the Longwood Show would go 

00:01:59.088 --> 00:02:00.760
together.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.887
It turned out to be pretty interesting, not everyone has the 

00:02:04.887 --> 00:02:12.280
impeccable manners that I was raised with.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.295
I honestly think that some people's diets were, un-American.

00:02:17.295 --> 00:02:21.736
I think that on Thanksgiving you should, you know, eat your fill.

00:02:21.736 --> 00:02:23.382
Some people didn't agree.

00:02:23.382 --> 00:02:27.091
Do you know how hard it is to stay on a diet during Thanksgiving?

00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:33.962
Especially when you have Logan here eating like TWO plates of food.

00:02:33.962 --> 00:02:35.918
Smaller bites equal smaller calories.

00:02:35.918 --> 00:02:40.073
Do I think it was a good idea for all of us to have dinner together at

00:02:40.073 --> 00:02:40.715
Thanksgiving?

00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:43.627
Well initially when I heard that we were all going to have 

00:02:43.627 --> 00:02:46.396
Thanksgiving dinner together I thought it sounded really fun with all 

00:02:46.396 --> 00:02:48.172
the Longwood Show.

00:02:48.172 --> 00:02:53.971
Did you know that your body is made up of .1% parasites?

00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:56.113
In retrospect.

00:02:56.113 --> 00:02:58.491
No.

00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:00.476
Would you just eat some turkey?

00:03:00.476 --> 00:03:02.888
Oh No, please, please, I don't want it.

00:03:02.888 --> 00:03:05.544
If you don't eat turkey you aren't controlling the turkey population.

00:03:05.544 --> 00:03:06.576
I'm a vegetarian!

00:03:06.576 --> 00:03:07.764
I do not eat meat!

00:03:07.764 --> 00:03:10.559
The one good thing about Thanksgiving is that it helps control the 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.309
turkey population in America.

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:14.086
Eating meat is eating fear.

00:03:14.086 --> 00:03:18.866
I do not eat fear.

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:22.262
When you eat meat you are eating fear okay?

00:03:22.262 --> 00:03:24.953
I do not want to eat fear, I'm better than that.

00:03:24.953 --> 00:03:25.654
Inappropriate?

00:03:25.654 --> 00:03:26.660
I don't think so.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.228
When you are eating meat you are eating the fear it felt when it was 

00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:30.809
being killed.

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:34.448
Did you know that the biggest tape worm found in the human body was 35

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:35.925
meters?

00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:40.130
Well I had a great time at the dinner, it was the cherry on top of my 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.837
day.

00:03:41.837 --> 00:03:44.815
Do you know how to kill a turkey?

00:03:44.815 --> 00:03:47.653
Do you want to know how to kill a turkey?

00:03:47.653 --> 00:03:51.615
What you do is you take a knife and you stab it in the back of the 

00:03:51.615 --> 00:03:54.027
neck.

00:03:54.027 --> 00:03:55.829
Thats how they kill them.

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:04.606
Some people have the idea of "fear" that animals can "fear" when they 

00:04:04.606 --> 00:04:11.254
are being killed I dont really understand it...

00:04:11.254 --> 00:04:13.619
Giving thanks is putting yourself constantly putting yourself in the 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:17.015
position to rely on the help of others its a sign of weakness.

00:04:17.015 --> 00:04:20.071
Do you think Jack Bower thanks the millions of lives he saves?

00:04:20.071 --> 00:04:23.415
no they thank him.

00:04:23.415 --> 00:04:24.015
Paul!

00:04:24.015 --> 00:04:26.157
I told you I needed this room.

00:04:26.157 --> 00:04:27.960
I want to talk to the camera.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.468
Am I mad I wasnt invited to the Thanksgiving dinner?

00:04:30.468 --> 00:04:34.569
No, I am the Crew Manager of the Longwood Show there is always going 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.174
to be this natural separation between the manager and the rest of the 

00:04:38.174 --> 00:04:40.064
crew its jealousy really.

00:04:40.064 --> 00:04:43.006
Besides I have lot of friends to go to Thanksgiving dinner with.

00:04:43.006 --> 00:04:50.033
They were all just busy.

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:54.213
And my mom is right it's THIER loss because I am a beautiful person 

00:04:54.213 --> 00:04:58.027
inside and out.

00:04:58.027 --> 00:05:02.154
As the assistant to the crew manager I am Corinne's number 2. I am 

00:05:02.154 --> 00:05:07.823
also in charge of the party planning committee, but I failed to invite Corinne.

00:05:07.823 --> 00:05:11.428
It is here that I announce my resignation as the assistant to the crew

00:05:11.428 --> 00:05:15.424
manager. I will meet my challenges head on with my head held high and I

00:05:15.424 --> 00:05:18.925
will laugh at those who doubt me.

00:05:18.925 --> 00:05:20.675
Goodbye Corinne.

00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:23.287
Goodbye Longwood Show.

00:05:23.287 --> 00:05:25.560
Now get out.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:36.743
(CLOSING MUSIC) 

00:05:36.743 --> 00:05:42.620
Happy Holidays from the Longwood Show!!!
