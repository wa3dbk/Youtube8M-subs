00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.680
Hey, I'm Kristin Shaffer, national-level bikini
competitor, Mom, and businesswoman.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.570
If you're ready to find out how bikini models
get their amazing bodies, you get it all right

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.090
here, right now.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.269
Hey, everybody.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.070
Welcome back to my kitchen.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.910
Today we are making chocolate protein pancakes.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.810
All you need for this... this is a super simple,
easy recipe.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.810
I love it.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.620
I wouldn't recommend it for anybody that is
really close to competition.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.870
This is a recipe that I use in the, what they
call, "off season," or if you're just trying

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.760
to lose fat to get into really good shape,
you can use this recipe.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.600
If you're getting close to competition, one
of the ingredients in here is this sugar-free,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.160
fat-free Jell-O that I use.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.379
It has corn starch, modified corn starch,
in it, so I would not use this if you're super

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.750
close to your competition, 6 to 12 weeks out.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.550
But for anybody that's just trying to get
into great shape, this is a wonderful recipe,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.600
and quite delicious, I might add.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.610
What you need are eggs, my sugar-free, fat-free
Jell-O.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.610
It's chocolate fudge instant pudding.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.830
A scale, of course, a little bowl that you
need for mixing it all up, rolled oats, oatmeal,

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.430
and then Pam olive oil spray, and then a cup
just to put your egg yolks in.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.110
So I have a skillet here ready.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.880
I'm going to go ahead and preheat that.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.100
Spray it with my spray for the first pancake.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.100
Okay.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.400
So let's go ahead and separate our eggs because
all we want are egg whites, no yolks.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:43.540
I'm just going to put the egg whites in the
bowl here.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.479
For me, I use about... oops.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.960
I just dropped a yolk in there.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.509
Seven egg whites.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.670
Okay.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.900
So separated out my yolks.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.810
These go to the bears later.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.099
And then let me wash my hands real quick.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.099
Okay.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:19.310
Then I'm going to measure out my oatmeal.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:32.120
So, for me, for one meal I use about 40, 41
grams of oatmeal.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.140
That's good right there.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.340
Pour it in the bowl.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.680
Mix that together.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.980
And then I'm going to add just a little bit
of that chocolate pudding.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.459
So I'm just mixing it up together just to
mix it pretty evenly.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.100
I got an open package already because I just
use just a little bit.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.100
This does have some calories in it.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.340
It's about 35 calories per serving, which
is about a quarter of a package.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.340
So that's a lot.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.200
So I only use about probably a fifth of the
package.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.200
A sixth.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.459
As you can... hopefully you can see that.

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.820
I'll just sprinkle some in there.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.849
Then just mix it all together.

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.230
Now, you're going to see when you mix it up
it kind of gets these, you know, chunks of

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:30.260
chocolate in there as the powder doesn't mix
very well in the egg whites, but that's okay

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.159
because you're going to find later that those
chunks of chocolate actually taste pretty

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.970
darn good in your pancakes.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:37.970
Okay.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.909
That looks pretty good.

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:42.150
So now we're all preheated.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.379
I'm just going to put my first one in there.

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.230
That one did not come out very good when I
poured it, but that's okay.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.970
And then I just a few minutes here or so.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.659
I'm going to flip it over as soon as it kind
of coagulates and it gets a little bit more

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:05.239
solid.

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.709
Just like you would with a normal pancake.

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.810
All right.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.379
That's my first one.

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:25.470
Spray it again.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:44.770
All right.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.750
I think we've got this last one all done.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.190
It kind of looks like it's done.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.740
Turn my burner off.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.500
I add a little bit of SweetLeaf Sweet Drops
English Toffee.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.210
It kind of tastes a little bit like maple
syrup.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.220
That's why I love it so much.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:12.280
Just put a few drops on there, and then spread
it around with my fork.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:19.040
And I have my chocolate protein pancakes.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.020
Mmm.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.210
Absolutely delicious.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.590
Love them.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.639
That wraps up today's episode.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:27.639
