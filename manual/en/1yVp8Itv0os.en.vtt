00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.080
i know... i know it's raining... but still...
if it's enough to make you crazy and weakened

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.670
it's enough to make you lazy and sleep in
sometimes, i don't want to fight no more

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.039
and it feels like a wars outside my door
you know poor, is what they say i am

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.519
but i try not to focus on what's not in my
hand

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.160
i offer all that i am
in word, flesh and bone

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.750
to bless every home
i've touched that's touched me

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.480
money never saved me
it's the people that raised me

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.680
and gave me a chance
out of love, out of faith, out of anything

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.559
they had
just to live in this land

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.949
and succeed, be the best in whatever you believe
i'm an immigrant's dream in the flesh

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.100
momma what they didn't tell you about the
west is

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.909
people here live more empty and desperate
once you assimilate, it's not what you expected

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:58.159
childhood is hectic, there is no protection
i don't know a single youth that is not affected

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.299
bullet-ridden streets that's ill crack infested
mind power remains our best weapon, blessed

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:08.840
i know, it's hard to get up some days
cloud covers grey, streets the same way

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.750
damp, you could feel the northwest in my lungs
but i will not be defined by where i'm from

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.950
i will not be defined by where i'm from
i will not be defined by where i'm from

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.750
i will not be defined by where i'm from
and i will not be confined to where i'm from

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.550
i never been a morning bird, nah
more of a night-owl, stomach with a slight

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.350
growl
won't eat for hella and then go on a binge

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.210
i usually forget and coffee is my friend
or a dependency

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.460
hope it's not the end of me
too focused on how the rent'll be made, and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.010
then paid
we stack and give it away

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.570
faster then you can say "next month is coming"
emcee's today gotta have 10 jobs

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.350
to keep the lights on, hope we can get to
a song

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.500
before our energies gone, and it sounds like
this...

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.720
then i think of the kids and keep writing
like my momma kept fighting when she thought

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.330
of me
to be free

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.560
anything you say
everything you pray

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.549
the answer is all within
don't be afraid

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.170
we gotta be the change
i'm staring at the rain

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.230
it's cold out now but life don't hesitate
to slow down now would be one hell of a waste

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.819
i chase my dreams through the day
with mic in palm like i'm holding my fate

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.200
and i know, it's hard to get up some days
cloud covers grey, streets the same way

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.260
damp, you could feel the northwest in my lungs
but i will not be defined by where i'm from

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.300
i will not be defined by where i'm from
i will not be defined by where i'm from

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.300
i will not be defined by where i'm from
and i will not be confined to where i'm from
