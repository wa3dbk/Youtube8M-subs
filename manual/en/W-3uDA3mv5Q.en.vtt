00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.909
I suppose there are some photography
courses in Britain

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:06.990
and abroad that are

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.550
fairly prescriptive. You're given

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.830
specific kinds of training for specific

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.570
kinds of jobs. We're not like that

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.540
we are

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.990
open-ended to

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.210
expansive and so on and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.420
this results, ideally,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.620
in graduates who could

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.510
work in a whole range of jobs.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.059
When I was applying for Photography  there was a few places in
particular that were said to be

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.770
the best for Photography and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.690
this was promoted as the one for a
student who

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.340
has come from a Fine Art background, hasn't
studied Photography

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.790
previously.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.910
It said to come here and you'll learn
everything from scratch

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.100
and you'll leave at a very high standard.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.810
I suppose one thing that we're really
looking for

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.510
is, A: creative individuals but B:

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.490
I'm individuals who can be autonomous

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.690
learners. That's a really important dimension of the course

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.780
and perhaps the course isn't suitable for

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.460
a student who wants to be told what to
do all the time.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.750
I think, because the university is so
small,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.820
all of the courses do interlink.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.690
Everybody goes to the same events and
gets to know everyone, so there's quite a

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.210
good community

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.619
between say Fashion and Photography.

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.100
They often ask for Photographers to collaborate with them.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.390
The best part of the degree

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.920
for me,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.110
the support I get, not only from the tutors

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.110
but from the students,

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.990
how creatively reflect on things with them

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.149
and bounce off things and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.630
get ideas from them. They give a certain
amount of time

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.030
per year, per student, where you're allowed to go
away and do work

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.450
placements and work experience and
you're encouraged to do as much as

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.160
possible.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.220
There was a student called Michaels who opened her own

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.489
gallery after she studied here on the BA

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.120
and from that I managed to get onto
a workshop with

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.500
Anders Petersen and work with several
publications like

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.390
Another

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.819
Vice Magazine and

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.480
London Fashion Week, just because of that connection through

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.580
the university.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.900
It would be a perfect course for somebody who's looking at
photography but looking at

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.640
other mediums

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.510
as well. If you're interested in fine art as well as photography

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.080
other fine office as as well as
photography

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.930
it takes a lot of different types and brings it into one course. It doesn't just

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:51.650
limit you

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.640
to photographs.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.840
It's for anyone who wants to have

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.500
a broad knowledge of photography.
