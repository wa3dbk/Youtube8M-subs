00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.420
you're in the center of Forsythe Township,
Marquette County, the better part of Michigan,

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.780
the Upper Peninsula

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.960
to me its about going out with the family,
there will be three generations hunting here

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.580
this year, theres been times I've

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.250
gone out and put the gun in the back of the
blind and read and book and just watched the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.930
dear come back to camp

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.670
only to find out I never did hold a gun, deer
hunting is not about killing deer, not at

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.449
my age anyway, maybe Tyler,

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.530
thats what you're looking forward to more
than anything else, but you get to be a little

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.920
bit older and its not about that

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:44.829
anymore, its about family and tradition and
getting away from things, its more of the

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.341
environment, coming back in the

00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:53.460
evening and playing cards, the laughter, thats
what I want, thats what I want him to enjoy

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.789
and to grow up with, that was

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:04.230
the best part about camp, the very first hunting
camp I ever went to, my brothers and I went

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.820
out with our uncles

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.830
they were in the kitchen playing cards and
we were in the bunk room and we got into a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.000
pillow fight, my uncles came in and

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.440
the first they uncle Ray did was holler at
us, and Ted Stenson said, no, camp is for

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.440
kids, let them have fun

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.560
and we've pretty much followed that tradition
out here right along with camp is for kids

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.671
and Junior, we come out and he's bull hunting
and theres a spike coordinate that came in

00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:36.680
and I shot the spike coordinate

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:45.180
and I started trailing it, and where does
it go? right underneath his stands

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.180
where is Junior?

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.170
back at camp eating apple crisp

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:04.820
he still brings it up on occasion, and where
are ya, eating apple crisp

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.209
I've got a picture of Donna bringing out her
deer blind for the first time, and shes wearing

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.390
her fathers coat

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.170
thats her way of keeping him involved, and
she said, you know, this would be what he

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.209
would like, and this is my uncles

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:29.510
its what I wear at camp, its really a little
bit small for me but it'll fit you, but if

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.189
I ever see it on the floor

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:41.790
youre done, cause theres a lot of history
that goes with it, and thats what camps about,

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.840
go have fun, you can do it and

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.879
go have fun doing it, like Johnny and his
apple crisp, he said its all he could think

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.379
of sitting in those trees,

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:59.780
I know theres one more piece of that apple
crisp thats sitting in that corner, if I wait

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.950
somebodys gonna get back to camp

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.659
before me and get that apple crisp
