00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.630
In this video we are going to take a look
at a really cool way of practicing chords

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.630
on the guitar we're going to be discussing
a tonal principle called the cycle five chord

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.800
progression and what is really  is a
way of arranging the scale chords of any key

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.930
and putting them into a really neat sounding
chord progression.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.190
So we'll be working in the key of C ; so the
first thing we're going to do is have a look

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.039
at our circle of fifths that we're all familiar
with and I'm going to go through and eliminiate

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:48.039
all the notes that are not in the key of C.
So, I'm taking out Bb, Eb, Ab, Db and F#.

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:59.239
And now here's what our cycle five looks like
now that we've taken out all the notes that

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:06.469
are not in the key of C.
We've just left the positioning of the notes

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.450
in the same order, the same sequence as they
would appear around the original circle of

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.899
fifths, but we've just taken out the notes
that are not in the key of C.

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:24.899
So what this diagram represents is the root
movement around the circle of fifths ... in

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.070
the key of C. Now the next thing I'm going
to do is put in the chord qualities, I'm going

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.950
to add the chord qualities in ... and in this
case this would be C major seventh, this would

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.950
be F major seven, B minor seven flat five,
E minor seven, A minor seven, D minor seven

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:02.219
and G seven.
So let's recap ... the first thing we did

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.750
was eliminate the notes that were not in the
key of C, and this left us with the root notes:

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.750
C, F, B, E, A, D, G and then we filled in
the scale chord quality that relates to each

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.030
root note in the key of C, so now we have
C Major seventh, F Major seventh, Bminor seventh

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.970
flat five or B half Diminished as I have it
written here on the screen, Em seven, A minor

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.970
seven, D minor seven and G seventh and we're
going to be playing the chords in an anti-clockwise

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.540
manner that's the chord sequence we're going
to be playing on guitar; but just before we

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.150
go to the guitar I'd like to clear up one
thing for you in case you're wondering why

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.590
it's called the cycle five; and that's because
the distance between all the root notes when

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.760
you are moving in a clockwise manner, the
interval distance between all of the root

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.010
notes is a fifth.
The distance between C and G is a fifth, the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.750
distcance between G and D is a fifth and so
on right around the cycle.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.690
Now, of course there's many different ways
we can play this chord progression on the

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.000
guitar, for the purpose of this video I'm
just going to set two criterias when I'm selecting

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
the chords; firstly that each chord will only
have four notes in it; and secondly, that

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.890
each will be close to each other on the guitar
fretboard so that we don't have to move around

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.890
a great deal. And so this is how I'm playing
the C Major seventh chord, the root note is

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:54.430
marked with a clear dot.
And here's the F Major seventh I'm using,

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.890
again, the root note is marked as a clear
dot, and take particular notice of how I'm

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.230
barring the first, second and third strings
with my third finger.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.570
Now, it's a good idea to practice these chords
in pairs in other words the C Major seventh

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.910
shape going to the F Major seventh shape;
before we go any further let's have a listen

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.910
to the cycle five chord progression so we
can hear how the whole chord sequence sounds.
