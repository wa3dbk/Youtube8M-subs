00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.700
this is a story about Community Action
about people coming together in the face

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.900
of extraordinary challenges to make
things better and it's a story about our

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.359
teeth well teeth are at the root of it
anyway 'pun intended' you see this year

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:21.370
alone more than 181 million Americans
won't visit a dentist even though half

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.600
of us over 30 suffer from gum disease
and about one in four of our kids under

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.980
five already have cavities more than 2.1
million people showed up in emergency

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.249
rooms with dental issues in 2010 and
about 80% had preventable conditions

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:41.409
something needed to change a year ago
the American Dental Association started

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:45.280
a nationwide community-based movement so
dentists could help end the dental

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.809
health crisis in America we created
action for dental health which aims to

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.170
reduce the numbers of adults and
children with untreated dental disease

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.510
through oral health education prevention
and treatment of people in need of care

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.929
through action for dental health we're
helping patients with untreated dental

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.950
disease by focusing on emergency room
referrals that get people out of the ER

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.140
and into the dentist's chair in Maine
where Waldo County General Hospital's ER

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.460
was inundated with people experiencing
severe dental pain the hospital opened a

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.939
dental clinic offering low income people
dental screenings and referrals to

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.109
Dennis for further care our Give Kids a
Smile program expansion amplifies

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:26.920
current efforts to screen and treat kids
who don't have access to professional

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.219
dental care on the other end of the age
spectrum we're helping vulnerable

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:34.509
elderly people by providing more access
to care in nursing home environments

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.350
we're working to strengthen and expand
the public-private safety net by

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.189
promoting community-based contracting
between local dentists and federally

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.090
qualified health centers in places like
Chinook Montana these types of

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.020
partnerships enable more people to be
treated we're working with legislators

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.829
to remove barriers to Dentists
participation in the Medicaid program to

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.569
increase the safety net and cover more
people dental disease prevention efforts

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.580
include fluoridation program expansions
education channels like mouthhealthy.org

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.420
and participation in a public
service effort with the Ad Council we've

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.320
introduced community dental health
coordinators trained community outreach

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.440
specialists who help people navigate
complex public

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.240
health systems and connect with local
resources for dental care 34 community

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.870
dental health coordinators work in eight
states helping thousands of patients get

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.670
the care they need dentists are making a
difference but together we can do more

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.870
we can do more by continuing to grow
these grassroots efforts noted by the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.580
action for dental health goals for 2020
in our report to Congress we can do more

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.300
by supporting policy measures including
the action for dental health act which

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.170
will fund programs that are working to
improve dental care educate people about

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.940
their health and provide more access to
underserved people nationwide and we can

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.680
do more by simply recognizing what works
communities from Waldo County Maine to

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.190
Silver City New Mexico and Beyond have
embraced the action for dental health

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.020
movement and continue to innovate and
expand its efforts all 50 states are

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.560
involved in at least one revolutionary
initiative that's part of this movement

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.480
and that's some encouraging action for
dental health
