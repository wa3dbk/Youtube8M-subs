00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Are you losing all your ranked games and find yourself in ELO Hell?

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.100
Are you still trying hard to win your games, but still lose because your team troll them?

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.800
Do YOU wish to get out of Elo Hell to finally play with players at your level?

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.800
Well then, this is the video for you.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.000
I warn you : to win your games, you must troll yourself.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.800
I present you the...

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Hey! What's up GG (guys and girls)? CouilleBleu's back today with his ButtFucking Friend Murdered to play...

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And now, you're going to learn how to gain some ELO points.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
For runes, I take things here and there to give me some Magic Penetration and Ability Power per level because...

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.100
I have no IP since I just bought Soraka hehehehe...

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.000
If you have the IP to spend, take some flat AP instead to burst the enemies early game.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.000
For masteries, I take everything to maximise my Ability Power.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.000
If you're being pushed near your tower, that's the best situation you could hope for.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:25.500
Have Alistar use his Flash-Shoot in air-Headbutt combo, have Sion use his stun and enjoy your threesome.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.200
And then, since Soraka the bitch healer died, you can double ghost to make Vayne piss in her pants 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:40.000
and stun her, chop with your axe, headbutt to the wall, shoot in the air and whoop her ass in mid-air with your shield OH YEAH!

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:50.000
Usually, you should attack the range carry to minimize the damage done to you and to not let her farm, but if your AliSion, you can whoop that support if you want!

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.800
But why would we do that? Because now, you can hide in the brush, Flash and stun that running Vayne, explose your shield, 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.000
have Alistar stay a bit behind to block her path with a stun and headbutt for the kill OH YEAH!

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.500
Don't worry Vayne and Soraka, this party's just getting started.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Here's the reason we prefer to go for the support first : even if the range carry is almost dead, that fuckabish Soraka will heal her.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.500
And then you will have to tower dive to kill her...

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.000
You're getting ganked when you have low health? No problem!

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:33.000
Use your shield to protect yourself, headbutt that fake dragon near your tower, stun her and enjoy watching her run away like a boss.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.000
As Alistar, use your Headbutt-Shoot in Air combo if your Flash is down.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.500
Then, Sion will Flash in to pick up the kill, not letting her use her heal abilities.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
GET OUT OR I'll BURST YOU DOWN!

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.000
Thank you for the tower, barbie!

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.000
What? You want to die that badly? Alrighty then!

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:05.000
Now that the tower's down, do your ninja here, stun that fuckabish like no one to not let her heal and enjoy your threesome again OH YEAH.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.500
And again.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And again.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.500
No no no no no Soraka! Don't even try to run away.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.800
Time for some Vayne bursting!

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.500
Knowing that Vayne has a push-back skill, separate yourself from Alistar.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:31.500
And from the brush, use your Flash-Stun-Explose shield combo to burst her HP down and let Alistar enjoy his ass whooping session.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.500
Sometimes, you will happen to be in a situation where you had a sure-kill, but somehow, you fail to kill your target.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
But it's okay! Come back a bit later to pick up 2 kills!

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:54.000
So yeah, you and your BFF will have a lot of kills, the enemies at bot lane won't be able to farm, they won't have any good items and they will be under leveled.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Of course, there will be some fuckabishes that will tell you nonsense like...

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:23.000
But it's okay! You will carry the game, no problem and the one talking caca about you will beg you two to do this combo again!

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:34.000
As a nice player, you should always help your teammates in danger even if they seem to be some extra mega uber fuckabishes with no mana that will die for sure.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.800
That's it for today, people!

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.000
Don't forget to check out my channel for more boring League of Legends videos.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:47.800
Feel free to leave a comment in any language you want, but I'll only answer those in English and in French because I'm a racist fuckabish.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Ciaossu!
