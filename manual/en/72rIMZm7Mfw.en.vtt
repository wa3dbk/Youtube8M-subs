00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.360
Welcome to Carmoza Auto Transport. As the
nation's leading vehicle transporter, we're

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.590
here to answer your questions and to help
you cut through the clutter of auto transport

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.590
companies.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.550
If you've already requested a quote from an
online auto transport broker - you've likely

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.960
been inundated with responses. But, how do
companies differ? And who can you trust? It

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.940
can be a confusing and intimidating process.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.220
We know what you're going through and would
like to clarify a few things right up front.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.170
Auto transport is a pretty straightforward
process - and only three things really matter:

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.940
First, is your vehicle going to be picked
up and delivered on time?

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.640
Second, safety. While most vehicles are safely
moved, accidents do happen. As a result, insurance

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.750
is not something "nice to have," it is something
you need to have. Quite simply, if something

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.630
were to go wrong, is the company you are using
to transport your vehicle going to be there

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:54.890
to back you up?

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.480
And lastly, accurate pricing. The lowest price
means nothing. As you compare quotes, how

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.309
do you know what the "right" price is? The
right price is the real price it will take

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.920
to get the right vehicle to the right place
at the right time.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.450
Many transport companies talk a good game,
but when it comes to proving what they claim...

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.850
well, that's a whole different story. Most
brokers are not insured... most have no quality

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.090
controls in place to monitor the drivers they
use, and many will tell you one price up-front

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.549
just to get your business - only to tack-on
hidden charges and fees later.

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.520
Carmoza Auto Transport is different. As the
nation's leading vehicle transporter, we've

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.799
put a whole new spin on the auto transport
industry. We serve the entire United States,

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.860
providing professional, door-to-door vehicle
transport services - with competitive rates.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.240
To top it all off - we provide premium full
coverage insurance and the highest level of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.070
quality and service. Quite simply... we take
the worry out of shipping your vehicle.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.490
By utilizing the nation's most reliable network
of automobile carriers, we are able to transport

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.280
your car in a safe and timely manner, door-to-door,
to any destination in the United States - including

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.749
Puerto Rico, Alaska and Hawaii. All of our
drivers are both bonded and insured - and

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:15.709
we treat every car as if it were our own.

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.900
With Carmoza Auto Transport, you can expect
a higher level of quality!

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.799
Carmoza takes the time to pre-screen every
carrier it uses. In addition, every Carmoza

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.999
customer gets a survey at the end of their
move. We do this to get feedback on how satisfied

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:35.699
each customer was with the service they received.
We constantly measure the performance of our

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:40.980
drivers based on direct customer feedback.
If you are talking with other companies, ask

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.489
them to explain how they measure the quality
of their drivers.

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:51.010
We do our very best to ensure every vehicle
is picked up and delivered on time. We have

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.549
back up transporters on every route and a
team of highly trained professionals that

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.169
monitor each load's schedule.

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:04.019
All of our carriers are top-notch professionals
who value their cargo and take every precaution

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.219
necessary to avoid any damage to your vehicle.
To provide you with the maximum protection

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:15.339
and peace of mind, we also carry $500,000
in contingent cargo insurance. If something

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:19.360
were to go wrong, with Carmoza you are covered.
Many brokers will tell you that they have

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.419
insurance when in reality they do not. For
your protection, ask every company to provide

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:29.110
proof of cargo insurance. If a company cannot
provide you with proof of cargo insurance

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.510
 - THEY DON'T HAVE INSURANCE!

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.749
Carmoza's management team is comprised of
extremely talented and nationally renowned

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:43.569
executives. Our CEO is Pat Croce, a successful
entrepreneur who was once part-owner of the

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.069
Philadelphia 76ers basketball team. Our President
is Peter Fong, who was formerly the President

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.760
of the Chrysler brand! Our leaders have high
expectations and are focused on increasing

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.760
the level of service people receive during
auto transport.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.189
We take the worry out of shipping your vehicles.
