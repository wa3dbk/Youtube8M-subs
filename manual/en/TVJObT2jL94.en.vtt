00:00:05.225 --> 00:00:06.390
- Hi there wig lover!

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.709
This is Heather from Cysterwigs.com.

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:09.931
And today I'm bring you a review

00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:13.656
of a very popular Noriko
wig called Jackson.

00:00:13.656 --> 00:00:17.287
And the color on Jackson
is called Chocolate Swirl.

00:00:17.287 --> 00:00:20.444
I guess I get a lot of
questions about colors

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:23.661
and this one I get asked
quite a few questions about.

00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:27.041
'Cuz I don't think people
understand what a swirl color is.

00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:29.996
A swirl color has lotsa highlights.

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:32.658
So if you don't really dig highlights,

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:34.722
stay away from swirled colors.

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.363
Because not only do they have highlights,

00:00:36.363 --> 00:00:39.558
but they often have highlights
in more than one color.

00:00:39.558 --> 00:00:41.355
Such as Chocolate Swirl here.

00:00:41.355 --> 00:00:45.069
And they have the highlights
all throughout the hair.

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:46.821
So lots and lots of highlighting.

00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:48.072
This color is very pretty.

00:00:48.072 --> 00:00:50.438
It has a,

00:00:50.438 --> 00:00:52.292
a dark chocolate base.

00:00:52.292 --> 00:00:55.381
And on top of that you've got
this light chocolate color.

00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:59.112
Which is kind of like a rusty brown

00:00:59.112 --> 00:01:02.065
or like a brownish auburn color.

00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:03.856
And then, in addition to that,

00:01:03.856 --> 00:01:08.025
you've got this, which is a very, very

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:10.392
pretty blonde highlight.

00:01:10.392 --> 00:01:14.559
So it's got a lot going on
in this particular color.

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:16.414
It works well with Jackson.

00:01:16.414 --> 00:01:18.399
Jackson's got a lot of layering.

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.924
And so that highlighting
just kinda really plays up

00:01:21.924 --> 00:01:25.012
the fact that it's got
all these highlights.

00:01:25.012 --> 00:01:27.947
Another thing that Jackson's
got is built-in volume

00:01:27.947 --> 00:01:30.248
via a ton of permatease.

00:01:30.248 --> 00:01:31.806
Noriko wigs in general tend

00:01:31.806 --> 00:01:34.588
to have quite a lot of
permatease going on.

00:01:34.588 --> 00:01:37.125
Which gives them a lot of built-in volume

00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:38.925
and makes them very flattering

00:01:38.925 --> 00:01:40.976
for a wide range of face shapes.

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:43.345
I think that this is a very beautiful

00:01:43.345 --> 00:01:45.167
amount of volume for someone like me.

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:47.682
I think it looks really nice on.

00:01:47.682 --> 00:01:50.605
But it might be overwhelming
for people with smaller frames.

00:01:50.605 --> 00:01:53.016
So just kinda keep that in mind,

00:01:53.016 --> 00:01:56.099
as you're on your hunt for a new wig.

00:01:57.092 --> 00:01:58.964
So Jackson's really, really popular.

00:01:58.964 --> 00:02:01.607
To me, it kind of makes me
think of what would happen

00:02:01.607 --> 00:02:05.633
if you had the May wig as your normal hair

00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:07.722
and just kind of grew it out.

00:02:07.722 --> 00:02:10.167
Because this is
substantially longer than May

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:13.209
but has a lot of similar
layering going on.

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.110
It has the shorter front.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.955
Though the front on
Jackson is substantially,

00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:20.914
the layering in the front of Jackson

00:02:20.914 --> 00:02:24.417
is substantially longer than it is on May.

00:02:24.417 --> 00:02:26.125
The front is 6.8 inches,

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:28.853
which will almost go all
the way down to my jawline.

00:02:28.853 --> 00:02:31.416
So quite a lot of layering
going on here in the front.

00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:34.186
You could always have a
stylist trim that for you

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:37.924
or cut a bang into it if you want it.

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:40.212
I just like to kind of play
with it in front of my face.

00:02:40.212 --> 00:02:43.616
I think that's kind of
fun to let that sort of

00:02:43.616 --> 00:02:46.189
frame my face a little bit better.

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.889
I think that this is a lot of hair.

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.722
They give you quite a
bit of hair in this wig.

00:02:54.818 --> 00:02:57.586
Which again, on me, I
think it looks great.

00:02:57.586 --> 00:02:59.130
But I think on somebody
with a smaller frame,

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.629
this might be a bit much.

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.809
This is still technically
a mid-length style.

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:05.961
It's not particularly long.

00:03:05.961 --> 00:03:08.014
Though it is most
certainly longer than May

00:03:08.014 --> 00:03:10.513
and a number of other Noriko wigs.

00:03:10.513 --> 00:03:12.239
So let me go ahead and turn to the sides

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.671
so I can show you all the
stuff that's going on.

00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:19.004
This is what Jackson looks like when you

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:24.533
push all the hair backwards off the face.

00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:25.866
And then,

00:03:27.953 --> 00:03:31.720
if you push it forward
onto your shoulders.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.878
You could really pick up

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:34.525
on that highlighted shade by the way.

00:03:34.525 --> 00:03:37.975
Lots of the highlights going on.

00:03:37.975 --> 00:03:40.142
And then here is the back.

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:42.787
Back is a little bit longer.

00:03:42.787 --> 00:03:46.954
And I'll tell you the exact
measurement when I turn around.

00:03:48.424 --> 00:03:50.490
Moves very nicely.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.584
It's a little bit heavy
but it's a Noriko wig.

00:03:53.584 --> 00:03:55.117
They do that.

00:03:55.117 --> 00:03:58.509
I think that the fibers on these
Noriko wigs feel very nice.

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:59.928
They feel very silky.

00:03:59.928 --> 00:04:02.333
But at the same token they
tend to be a little heavier

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:05.881
than fibers from other
brands such as Jon Renau.

00:04:05.881 --> 00:04:08.894
And the fibers themselves
are of a coarser,

00:04:08.894 --> 00:04:12.284
like they're a little
bit wider in diameter

00:04:12.284 --> 00:04:13.742
than a Jon Renau fiber.

00:04:13.742 --> 00:04:14.953
So,

00:04:14.953 --> 00:04:17.884
I think that this feels very nice

00:04:17.884 --> 00:04:20.411
but it is not the same

00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:22.465
as a Jon Renau or a Belle Madame fiber.

00:04:22.465 --> 00:04:24.865
Those are much finer in consistency

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:28.532
and they feel much more
satiny to the touch.

00:04:29.907 --> 00:04:32.195
But this is a very nice fiber.

00:04:32.195 --> 00:04:34.864
Slightly shiny, but that's easy to tame

00:04:34.864 --> 00:04:37.368
with a little bit of dry
shampoo as I keep saying.

00:04:37.368 --> 00:04:39.744
Or you can hit it with
a Jon Renau wig wand,

00:04:39.744 --> 00:04:41.302
which is pretty much magic.

00:04:41.302 --> 00:04:43.595
This is a 4.5 ounce wig.

00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:47.251
So it's fairly heavy for
a wig of this length.

00:04:47.251 --> 00:04:49.862
But not uncomfortably so.

00:04:49.862 --> 00:04:51.679
So let me go ahead and take it off

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:54.929
so I can show you the cap construction.

00:04:56.136 --> 00:04:58.795
Before I do that, I want to
put this up in the sunlight.

00:04:58.795 --> 00:05:00.909
So you can see how pretty this looks

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.159
with the direct sunlight shining on it.

00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:10.421
Very pretty, very warm
but without being red.

00:05:11.297 --> 00:05:14.539
So here is the interior

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.856
of the cap of Jackson.

00:05:16.856 --> 00:05:18.794
It's very stretchy in the back.

00:05:18.794 --> 00:05:20.354
Does felt here at the nape.

00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:22.099
But does not have the Velcro tabs.

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.160
Instead it has like a
little bra hooky thing.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.424
Then you've got lace on the ear tabs

00:05:27.424 --> 00:05:28.464
which makes them pliable.

00:05:28.464 --> 00:05:30.600
You could wear glasses with them easily.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.191
And there is a minimal amount
of felt here at the front.

00:05:34.191 --> 00:05:37.981
And the entire top of
this wig is permateased.

00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:42.148
The entire, this whole row lace
area, all 100% permateased.

00:05:43.486 --> 00:05:47.653
So if you flip it back, right
side in, and you part it,

00:05:49.911 --> 00:05:52.782
it's all permateased up here at the top.

00:05:52.782 --> 00:05:55.121
I personally don't mind that.

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.198
But I know some people do.

00:05:57.198 --> 00:05:58.970
And when you part this wig,

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.725
I mean because the entire
thing is permateased,

00:06:01.725 --> 00:06:03.188
you're gonna get that permatease

00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:05.855
all the way through your part.

00:06:05.855 --> 00:06:07.204
Now does it, doesn't really,

00:06:07.204 --> 00:06:08.731
I'm gonna get out of
the way so you can see

00:06:08.731 --> 00:06:09.884
up against the backdrop.

00:06:09.884 --> 00:06:11.322
You know, there are some flyaways

00:06:11.322 --> 00:06:14.208
but it's nothing you can't manage.

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:17.532
So all in all I think
this is a very well-made

00:06:17.532 --> 00:06:19.540
open cap wig.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.123
I'm gonna go ahead and
put Jackson back on.

00:06:30.908 --> 00:06:33.711
And I'm gonna go ahead
and just smooth her out

00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:35.628
with a wide tooth comb.

00:06:37.727 --> 00:06:40.639
I'm gonna change the part.

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.806
Just so you can see that no
matter where it's parted,

00:06:45.776 --> 00:06:48.359
it's gonna look just as pretty.

00:06:49.924 --> 00:06:51.507
But it's gonna pick up

00:06:51.507 --> 00:06:54.323
on different parts of the highlight

00:06:54.323 --> 00:06:55.736
depending on where you part it.

00:06:55.736 --> 00:06:57.648
Because as I said, those swirl highlights

00:06:57.648 --> 00:06:59.491
go all throughout the wig.

00:06:59.491 --> 00:07:01.472
So,

00:07:01.472 --> 00:07:03.284
when different parts of
the hair are exposed,

00:07:03.284 --> 00:07:05.753
different highlights will appear.

00:07:05.753 --> 00:07:08.232
The highlights go all
the way back to the nape.

00:07:08.232 --> 00:07:10.557
So even the nape of
this wig is highlighted.

00:07:10.557 --> 00:07:12.471
And speaking of the nape,

00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:15.997
it's 8.25 inches, which is fairly long.

00:07:15.997 --> 00:07:18.846
But still in the mid length category.

00:07:18.846 --> 00:07:21.387
So this has been a review

00:07:21.387 --> 00:07:23.688
of Jackson by Noriko.

00:07:23.688 --> 00:07:27.064
In the color Chocolate Swirl.

00:07:27.064 --> 00:07:31.351
Which is a very pretty, very
highlighted brown color.

00:07:31.351 --> 00:07:32.595
Thank you for watching.

00:07:32.595 --> 00:07:33.992
And I hope you have a great afternoon.

00:07:33.992 --> 00:07:34.825
Buh-bye.
