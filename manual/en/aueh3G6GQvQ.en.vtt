00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.790
So these are the instructions for the origami
penis and balls.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.501
So the first step for the origami penis is
we're going to make a book fold, so it's going

00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:16.700
to start with the white side up.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.430
We want to take the bottom edge up to the
top edge, make sure that it lines and precisely,

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.270
and then make a good crease fold.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.770
Open that up and then do the book fold, just
like this.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.670
What we're going to do is we're going to make
an 8 x 8 grid all the way across.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.911
So the next step we're going to fold the bottom
edge into the center like that and we're going

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:48.920
to do it on both sides, and try not to make
these put on top of each other at all.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.220
Make it so that they come right up against
each other without overlapping.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.030
We're going to open it up.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.142
Now in order to get this one to go in half,
we're going to take the bottom edge and we're

00:00:58.142 --> 00:01:04.300
going to take it up to the quarter line up
on the top.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.520
We're going open that one up, and then take
the bottom up to this line, this one-quarter

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.520
line.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.670
And you'll see how we divided the bottom half
into fourths, we have equal eighths right

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.670
there.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.929
I'm going to rotate it over and do the same
thing up here.

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:21.939
Make sure that when you do it on the other
side, that you're just going up to the fourth

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.369
line and not that eighth line.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.149
Fold that one in half and then fold this one
up to the bottom like that.

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.670
Open it up and then we're going to rotate
it to the side, and now we're going to divide

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.409
this into fourths as well.

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.509
So go ahead and take the bottom edge there,
fold that up to the middle, and then open

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.700
it up.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.310
One more time there, that'll give you the
fourth line.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.450
Then in order to cut this one in half, try
and take note of where the halfway line is

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.079
right there, and sort of see if you can get
it to connect.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.329
You see right there how those two lines are
on top of each other, and then rotate it over

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.859
until they're right on top.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:07.919
You can see right over here, as well.

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:16.160
We're going to get these two edges to line
up together, just like that.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.670
All right, next we're going to fold this one
up and make that one leave.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.370
We fold the bottom edge up to the center line.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.640
We leave that one there and flip the model
over.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.920
Now we're going to make a diagonal fold that's
three blocks in.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.620
So take the bottom edge right here, fold it
up to the top of the this line right, so there's

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.640
still five units on that side.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.420
Fold that one over and do the same thing on
this side like that.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.250
And then we're going to open those two up,
flip it back over, and then open this up.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.680
This V right here is the line that we're going
to use.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:07.760
I'm going to fold three units over, and then
use that V, fold that up and squash it down

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.370
like that.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.520
So I'll show you again from here.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.030
We're going to use this line right here, this
line right here, and this line coming across.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.420
We're going to take three units, we're going
to come over.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.700
We're going to use that diagonal to fold it
up and that'll squash down like that.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.420
Next we're going to use this line right here
on the one-third line, and we're going to

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.560
inside reverse fold it, back this way.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:45.040
So fold it over like that, so it starts over
here like this, and then it pushes through

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.170
and folds over like that.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.110
Now we're going to repeat the same thing on
this side.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:57.680
So if this was over we'd take the three units
over, fold those three units over like that,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.720
using that fold and that crease folds over.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:09.720
Then the one-third line right here is going
to inside reverse fold back the opposite direction.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:18.100
And if you've done that correctly, what'll
happen is these two edges will line up right

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.380
next to each other.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.320
Next we're going to fold this top unit down,
and the way this works is go ahead and pinch

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.659
this whole square right here, go ahead and
pinch that whole square.

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:38.659
Fold the whole thing down over the edge and
then this side panel will swing over in response.

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.620
Go ahead and do that on both sides.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.370
Fold this one down as well and that will thin
the top like that.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.419
Next we're going to fold the top up, after
this has come down, and we're going to use

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:58.710
both of these little squares, we're going
to fold those triangles down, and fold the

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.710
whole thing back down.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:08.930
We're going to do that on the left side, also
the right hand side, and this will come down

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.360
like that, as well.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.270
After that we're going to take the bottom
edge, fold that up to right about here, you

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:25.610
can see how it lines up with the next line
right there, and then we're going to fold

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:32.979
this triangle flap, fold that down on both
sides right over the top.

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.910
And then once we have the triangle flap folded
over, open it back up and then turn that into

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.379
a squash fold, and that'll give you the full
shape on the front.

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:48.830
Open it up there on the other side there as
well like that.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.509
And then after you have that, you have a little
bit of shaping that's left to do.

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:56.139
So instead of having these sharp corners,
we're going to round these, so that they will

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:03.729
be more spherical on the top, the left, and
the bottom.

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:13.680
All the way around and then at this point,
like it's those set up properly, and then

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.199
we're going to work on the top.

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:21.250
Go ahead and make just a little pleat fold
right there, about one unit down, and then

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.059
as tiny a little pleat fold as you can.

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:32.979
We're going to fold that over and then flip
the model over, and thin this edge over a

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:33.979
bit.

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:38.569
It'll stretch over, and it'll make a little
bit of a stretch fold of a squash, and that'll

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:47.729
thin the center, so that the tip has a little
bit more thickness to it like.

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:53.410
Then shape to taste like that.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:07:03.449
There should be just a little bit of an action
right there, for the origami penis and balls.
