Hi and welcome to a new video! 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.480
Today, we will review the adidas 11Pro.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.420
An extremely underrated football boot if you ask me.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.020
In this video we will show you why.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.940
Enjoy the video! 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.200
The first category is about the comfort and fit.  

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.660
The 11Pro offers a great performance.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.220
The K-leather is very soft and the fit was just perfect.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.520
The 11Pro is suitable for narrow as well as for wide feet.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.500
However, if you have a really narrow feet

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.140
or prefer a tighter fit, you should go half a size down.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.220
The thicker K-leather offers a great a comfort.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.840
On the other hand, the touch is not as "direct" as

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.640
with thinner boots like the Vapor X or F50.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.360
However, the 11Pro is not supposed to provide a barefoot feeling.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.900
So, I'm still satisfied with the touch of the K-leather.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.640
The quality of the 11Pro is great - it feels very solid.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.300
Still, the durability of the 11Pro wasn't really satisfying.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.440
We found first stress marks after only two weeks.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.660
This is quite normal for a leather boot

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.428
but we still have to deduct some points here.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.740
To sum it up...

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.380
The 11Pro could really satisfy us in this review.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.840
The K-leather provides a great comfort and touch.  

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.660
There are a few weak points in terms of durability.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.160
Also, you should keep in mind that it isn't a speed boot.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.440
The 11Pro weighs about 260g in size US10.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.260
If you can deal with the weight and durability issues

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.060
it is a really great boot.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.960
This is why I rate this boot with 9.0 out of 10 points.
