00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.680
Good day, today we are making raisin rolls.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:16.740
To make them, which required specific techniques, we’ll need flour, milk powder, sugar, yeast salt, eggs and water.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:26.340
In a later stage we’ll add butter and raisins.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:51.220
Initially mix the flour, milk powder, sugar and salt.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:02.280
Because this recipe contains a lot of yeast, we’ll first mix the salt and add the yeast later.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.760
Our dry ingredients.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.020
So that the salt is divided and not too concentrated.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:30.260
We’ll add the eggs, the water and finally the yeast.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:46.200
This requires time, to become a nice whole which doesn’t stick to the sides of the bowl.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.860
After that we'll add the fat.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.300
We'll be right back.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.460
After 10 minutes firmly kneading it has become a nice ball.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.580
I have already measured the raisins, but first add the fat.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:16.740
We’ll continue to firmly kneading until the fat is well mixed with the rest.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.580
You will notice when dough will no longer stick to the sides.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.480
The fat has been nicely absorbed by the dough. The bowl seems rather clean.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:49.640
Add the raisins. When the raisins are nicely combined with the dough, we’ll be back.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.900
The raisins are now in the dough and we’ll remove the dough from the mixing bowl.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.900
I’ll place it on the counter top and let it rest from about 20 minutes.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:13.540
After that we’ll make pieces but first let them dough rest under plastic.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.040
We’ll show the result in a moment.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.800
After the first time rising, the dough has become soft.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:51.260
We’ll now make pieces of about 70 grams, which we’ll shape, rise again and place it on a baking plate.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:01.960
The shaping of the dough pieces is something that you’ll need to get the hang off; to turn the dough into a nice round shape.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.300
With the flat palm of your hand, start rolling it.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:19.960
Gently make your hand and fingers into a bowl shape. Use this way to make nice round shapes.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:29.880
It doesn’t have to be perfectly round. We’ll reshape them again.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.080
Repeat this step until all dough of dough have been shaped.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.980
The dough balls have rested for about 10 minutes.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.560
We’ll give them their final shape by shaping them again.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.920
Don’t press too hard, the purpose is make a more round.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:05:01.820
When done place them on the plate. I am placing 5 rows of 3 balls. Keep space between since they will increase in size while rising.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.900
We’ll smear them with beaten egg.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:18.520
Smear them equally. The beaten egg will give the rolls their shiny look.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.260
If this is done less well, effect will be the same.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:38.800
We’ll continue this way and afterwards place them in a warm oven (not more than 35 degrees Celsius) to rise for 40-60 minutes.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.600
The rolls have been in the oven for about 50 minutes.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.840
I have also pre-heated the oven to 220 degrees Celsius.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:52.660
And we’ll now bake them for about 10 minutes.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:10.340
The rolls have been in the oven for about 10 minutes. As you can see they are nicely round with a brown color.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.360
This recipe does not need steam.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:28.420
Make sure that you don’t touch them until they are cooled. If you touch them now they will collapse, which would be a pity. This will not happen when they are cooled.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.740
If you like  and enjoy it? Please let us now.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.960
Do you have question or suggestions? Don’t hesitate.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.960
Until next time!
