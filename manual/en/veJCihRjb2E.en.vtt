Google AdWords Campaign Experiments

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:09.149
AdWords Campaign Experiments makes it easy to test your ads.

00:00:09.334 --> 00:00:17.879
For example, it’s easy to add experimental text ads that have variations 
 on messaging, headlines, display URLs, and calls to action. 

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:26.641
For display ads, you can similarly test experimental ads, which include variations 
 on your images, calls to action, or display URLs. 

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:34.017
And now for the first time you can test the performance of text ads 
 against the performance of your display ads on the Google Display Network. 

00:00:34.017 --> 00:00:38.963
To begin testing your ads, first you’ll navigate to 
 the 'Ads' tab of your campaign. 

00:00:38.963 --> 00:00:42.609
Then you’ll click the status icon to the left of the ad. 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:48.547
You’ll click the empty beaker entitled 'Control only' to make 
 your ad active in the control split only. 

00:00:48.672 --> 00:00:55.380
Click the half-full beaker entitled 'Experiment only' to make 
 your ad active in the experiment split only.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:05.341
If your ads are set to run in the experiment or control split only, you can get a 
 holistic view of your experiment performance by looking at your stats at the campaign level. 

00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:12.563
If you have ads set to run in both the control and experiment 
 splits, you can view statistics broken out by split for each ad.

00:01:12.563 --> 00:01:19.180
To do this, just click on the 'Segment' button and 
 select 'Experiment' from the 'Ads' tab in your campaign.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:28.189
I mentioned before that on the Display Network, ad experiments allow you to test the performance 
 of including only text ads in an ad group versus only display ads. 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.231
Let's look at how to run this type of experiment.

00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:34.575
First you'll need some display ads in your campaign. 

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:39.677
If you don't already have display ads, one easy way to 
 create them is with the Display Ad Builder. 

00:01:39.677 --> 00:01:44.910
Once your display ads are ready, you can follow 
 this example to set up an experiment: 

00:01:44.908 --> 00:01:49.430
First, click the check boxes next to each of your display ads.

00:01:49.427 --> 00:01:57.820
Then, click the 'Change status' drop down and select 'Experiment only' so that 
 your display ads will run only when the experiment split is active.

00:01:57.586 --> 00:02:03.340
You can try just one display ad to start, or 
 you can include many different display ad variations. 

00:02:03.344 --> 00:02:08.170
You’ll follow a similar process to change your text ads to 'control only'.

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:13.680
A variation of this experiment would be to see leave your 
 text ads running in both the control and experiment splits

00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:17.540
with display ads still running only in the experiment split.  

00:02:17.542 --> 00:02:23.310
This allows you to measure the incremental value of having 
 both display and text ads in an ad group.

00:02:23.314 --> 00:02:35.090
One thing to note is that your ad rotation settings, found on the campaign settings tab, will still affect how 
 your ads are served if you have more than one ad in each of the control and experiment splits.

00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:41.730

Happy experimenting!
