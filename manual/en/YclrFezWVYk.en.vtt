00:00:05.473 --> 00:00:06.749
Hi, I'm Francis, 

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:09.450
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:17.336
Let's cut the ingredients for Katsudon.

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.002
Slice the onion (70g) into quarter inch slices.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.988
Chop the mitsuba parsley into three-quarters inch pieces.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.990
Let's prepare the pork loin slice (120g).

00:00:30.207 --> 00:00:35.332
Make several cuts across the tough, stringy part between the fat and lean meat.

00:00:35.783 --> 00:00:38.711
Flip it over and repeat the process.

00:00:38.894 --> 00:00:43.052
This will prevent the pork slice from curling up when deep-fried.

00:00:44.182 --> 00:00:47.263
Tenderize the pork slice with a meat pounder.

00:00:48.936 --> 00:00:53.519
Sprinkle the salt and pepper on one side.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.004
Next, crack the egg into a bowl 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:02.413
and spoon a quarter of it into a shallow dish.

00:01:03.707 --> 00:01:07.762
Add a sprinkle of water and beat well with a whisk.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.911
Now, dust both sides of the pork slice with the all-purpose flour.

00:01:16.036 --> 00:01:18.221
Make sure to remove the excess flour 

00:01:18.221 --> 00:01:20.829
and then dip the pork in the egg.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.868
Finally, coat the pork with the nama-panko, soft bread crumbs 

00:01:27.868 --> 00:01:29.985
and shape with your hands.

00:01:30.946 --> 00:01:33.823
Let's deep-fry the pork in a heavy pot.

00:01:34.262 --> 00:01:37.406
Preheat the oil to 340 degrees Farenheit (170 °C).

00:01:37.816 --> 00:01:40.237
Gently place the pork into the oil 

00:01:40.237 --> 00:01:42.763
and deep-fry for 2 to 3 minutes.

00:01:43.552 --> 00:01:47.552
Slowly rotate the pork slice as shown to brown evenly.

00:01:49.855 --> 00:01:51.919
Flip it over with tongs 

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:56.564
and cook the other side for 2 to 3 more minutes until golden brown.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.646
Place the tonkatsu, deep-fried pork cutlet onto a cooling rack 

00:02:01.646 --> 00:02:03.673
and drain the excess oil.

00:02:05.235 --> 00:02:08.551
Cut the tonkatsu into three-quarters inch pieces.

00:02:10.212 --> 00:02:12.263
Let's make the katsudon sauce.

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:13.928
Combine the water (50ml), 

00:02:13.928 --> 00:02:15.612
dashi stock powder, 

00:02:15.612 --> 00:02:17.223
soy sauce (1 tbsp), 

00:02:17.223 --> 00:02:18.801
mirin (1 tbsp), 

00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:20.087
sugar (1 tsp) 

00:02:20.087 --> 00:02:22.481
and the onion in a small pan.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.925
Stir lightly with chopsticks. 

00:02:25.742 --> 00:02:27.176
Cover 

00:02:27.176 --> 00:02:29.853
and turn on the burner to medium heat.

00:02:30.248 --> 00:02:33.871
When it begins to boil, reduce the heat to low 

00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:36.374
and simmer for about 3 minutes.

00:02:36.812 --> 00:02:39.075
When the onion is completely cooked, 

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:41.359
place the tonkatsu into the pan.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.363
Crack the egg into a bowl.

00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:47.546
Beat the egg lightly 

00:02:47.546 --> 00:02:50.091
and distribute it onto the tonkatsu.

00:02:51.231 --> 00:02:52.201
Cover again 

00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:56.056
and cook on high heat for 20 to 30 seconds.

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.343
When the egg reaches the desired consistency, 

00:02:59.343 --> 00:03:01.463
garnish with the mitsuba parsely 

00:03:01.463 --> 00:03:03.278
and turn off the burner.

00:03:04.757 --> 00:03:07.781
Place the fresh steamed rice (200g) into a rice bowl.

00:03:10.213 --> 00:03:14.010
With a turner, gently place the mixture onto the rice.

00:03:14.754 --> 00:03:19.730
A tip to making a delicious katsudon is to distribute the egg over high heat 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.781
while the tonkatsu is still fresh and warm.

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:29.191
There is a tradition that Japanese students eat Katsudon before taking an entrance exam 

00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:31.722
since Katsu also means “to win.”

00:03:35.404 --> 00:03:37.797
Remember not to over-mix the egg 

00:03:37.797 --> 00:03:41.612
otherwise it will lose its rich and fluffy texture.

00:03:41.612 --> 00:03:43.297
Good luck in the kitchen!
