00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.180
Samsung BEAT DISC (BEATDISC / M6710).

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:16.789
The Samsung BEAT DISC (also called the M6710)
has a bit of a silly name, presumably to make

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.730
it seem "exciting".

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.830
The thing is, the BEAT DISC is a pretty exciting
phone without having to give it such a strange

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.480
sounding name.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.810
Closely related to the BEAT DJ, the BEAT DISC
is a little more conventional in appearance,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.950
but it still shares some of the styling and
the B&amp;O ICEpower amplifier of its bigger sibling.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.120
Samsung say that this has a "half touch" display.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.680
and it does appear that the lower portion
of the screen is touch-sensitive.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.379
It also comes with the DISC UI music interface,
which gives the BEAT DISC its name.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:57.739
The display is a 2.6" 240 x 400 pixel panel
in 16 million colours, making it a fairly

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.870
large display for this class of phone.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.660
The BEAT DISC also comes with stereo Bluetooth,
an FM radio, microSD expandable memory (up

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.369
to 16GB), a 3.5 mm audio socket and stereo
speakers.

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.070
On the back is a fairly basic 3 megapixel
camera with a slightly disappointing video

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.079
capture quality of 320 x 240 pixels at 15
frames per second.

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:31.290
Still, this is primarily a music phone.. and
this is something it seems to do very well.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.880
This is a 3.5G phone with a maximum download
speed of 7.2 Mbps over HSDPA, it also supports

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.180
quad-band GSM.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.789
There's no WiFi on the BEAT DISC, but the
USB 2.0 HS connector should make file transfers

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.280
very easy.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.899
Samsung did not give any guidance on price,
but did say that the BEAT DISC should be available

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.930
from Q2 2009.
