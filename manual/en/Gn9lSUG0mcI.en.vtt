Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo. Today I'm gonna
show you some stretches for neck spasms, which

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.590
are never fun. So let's get started. For the
first exercise, just take you hands and kind

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.230
of clasp them behind your head and your neck
area. Bend your head forward, tucking that

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.900
chin in, and by using your elbows to help give
you some motion, just rotate you head back

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.800
and forth. So you're kind of pulling through
with that bottom elbow just to give you a

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.210
little stretch in there. You can just move
back and forth like I am about 10 times, or

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.670
you can kind of pause there and hold it for
about 3-5 seconds. Stretching one way, and

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.200
then doing that maybe 5 times with a 3-5 second
hold. The next one you can still take your

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.600
hands and kind of now clasp them a little
bit higher up on your head, so not necessarily

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.310
in the curve, but higher up. And then this
time, just use your elbow on the top to kind

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.170
of push over. So now it's more of a side bending
kind of motion. So reaching one way, and then

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.280
coming back. So same thing, you can either
just kind of do a continuous motion side to

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.280
side, or you can hold it there for about 3-5
seconds, and do about 5 of those. The last

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.959
stretch you're gonna need a towel. Something
long enough to actually wrap around you a

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:42.530
little bit. Now don't try strangling yourself,
this is kind of an awkward motion. But with

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.179
the towel on your left side, you want to actually
take your right hand and grab it. And then

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.929
the towel part on your right side, grab with
your left hand. You're going to bring it about

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:58.899
where your ear is and then across your face.
Just really comfortably right there. That's

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.069
why you want to use a towel so it doesn't
hurt. And go up at an angle. Almost like towards

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.470
the crease in of the ceiling, and then pull
to the side, while you're taking your other

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.470
hand and pulling downwards. So this is just
gonna give ya an extra tight rotation stretch

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.470
there. Hold this one for about 15-20 seconds
if you can. And then come back down, switch

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:29.019
sides, holding here, pulling up here, and
going towards the other side. There you have

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.099
it! Wooo, those were the stretches for neck
spasms. If you have any questions, leave them

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.360
