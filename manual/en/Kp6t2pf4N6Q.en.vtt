[music]

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.440
As promised, here's that follow-up mailbag episode.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.680
And wouldn't you know it, our good friend Erin Siegel
is back to help us out with some more

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.500
awesome drawings while Alison catches a breather.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.100
We've still got a lot left to squeeze in, 
so let's get right to it.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.240
Are you ever going to do that episode you mentioned about voice acting, putting roleplay back in RPGs,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.020
or genres, or any of those other ones?

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.480
We will probably get to all the episodes

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.940
we've put in the future topic category at some point.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.800
Because James spends most of his time running a consulting company and holding a full professorship,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.140
Extra Credits episodes tend to be written as they overlap with problems he's thinking about in his work life.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.100
But, like I said, all these things will probably come up sooner or later.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.700
I don't actually need help with the research project itself,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.540
but my topic is similar to what you guys covered in an episode once.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.540
Where do you guys find your research sources?

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.340
Hmm, that's tough. We don't actually keep a list of footnotes for the episodes,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.820
and some of the information can't really be shared anyway because

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.980
James gathered it from industry people he works with.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.060
Other than that, though, all the information we use

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.120
is publicly available on the internet
or through the U.S. library system.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.700
We try very hard to keep things that are speculative
in a speculative voice,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.900
like the possibilities of tangential learning, for example.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.700
We also try to always call out when we're making a logical leap in an episode,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.290
and suggest other valid possibilities.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.260
But we're going to miss this one sometimes, so fact check us and dig deeper wherever you can.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.320
That's actually something I'd love to see come out of the show.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.200
I got SO many cool game ideas.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.240
Is there any way I could pitch them to a studio?

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.360
Well, here's the thing. Everybody's got ideas. In fact,
people in game studios usually have a lot more ideas

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.380
they want to work on
than they'll ever be able to produce.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.920
Unfortunately, this means nobody's really going to be interested in your game ideas.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.000
However, prototypes are a different matter.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.180
If you can put together a prototype that
really shows off what you're trying to deliver,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.370
that's something that publishers will potentially look at.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.540
There are thousands of ways to make connections and get people to notice your prototype,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.300
but conventions are usually a good place to start.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.400
Next question!

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.180
Is there any place I can apply my
Psychology or Economics or whatever degree

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.980
in the game industry?

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.200
Most designers and producers I know
came from disparate backgrounds.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.440
James, for example, took his undergrad in Classics.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.200
But if you're looking for an industry job more directly relevant to your field, that may be a pretty tough sell.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.360
Only giant companies like Microsoft devote resources to dedicated psychologists,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.340
and only companies who build their entire game
around some non-game-related discipline,

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.320
like Economics and Eve Online,
hire those fields specifically.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.040
It could happen, but it's a long shot.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.140
How do you get into game localization?

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.340
There's a small number of companies that handle
a lot of the localization work for the game industry.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.900
Just Google "game localization"
and you'll find most of them.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.180
See if they have any openings,
or even just send them a resume with your skills.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.093
Just be prepared. You'll have to have a strong grasp of the language you're translating from,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.620
and an impeccable command of the grammar and idioms of the language you're translating into.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.940
Are there any game design books you would recommend?

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.400
First and foremost, James recommends Jessie Schell's "Book of Lenses".

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.940
After that he suggests "Rules of Play", "Designing Virtual Worlds", and another book called "On Game Design".

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.300
If you're already a professional designer and have those already, you might also check out "Game Feel".

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.940
It's got an interesting and different take on the art of game design,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.020
but other books like "The Design of Everyday Things", "Understanding Comics", and "Flow"

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.300
are also an essential part of the game designer's library.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.660
Don't strictly limit yourself to books specifically about game design

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.020
to learn how to be a better game designer.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.200
Is there a reason you haven't done a "Video Games and Violence" episode?

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.540
We've toyed with this one a lot. The problem is,

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.440
there's just not enough good data regarding their real effect for us to say anything definitive.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.980
You've heard us complain a few times about the fact that most of the studies done in this regard

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.380
are funded by groups with highly biased political agendas regarding games.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.900
And that goes for both sides of the debate,
from within the industry as well as from without.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.720
We touched on it a little in the non-combat
gaming episode, but we could do an episode

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.340
on why violence is such a common theme in video games from a design perspective.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.040
If that sounds interesting to any of you, just email, tweet, or Facebook us and say so. We'll add it to the stack.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.940
Next.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.560
What do you think about EA's Origin service thus far?

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.460
Well the EULA bugged James enough to not buy Battlefield 3 on the PC,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.480
and I can think of plenty of things we don't like about Origin.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.720
But lots of other people have already made those complaints,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.680
and we seem to do a lot of EA bashing on this show. So instead,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.800
I'm going to list off some of the things we do like about it.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.140
Most importantly, it's a sign that EA realizes that physical product sales won't carry them through the next decade,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.720
which is a positive change.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.400
EA is a big player in this industry, and it would do a lot of damage if they were to collapse.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.060
If you look at all their studio acquisitions over the last decade

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.620
and how quickly they've shut down many of the companies they've acquired, you'll see that they've been

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.260
groping for some answer as to why they're simply no longer profitable the way they used to be.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.600
Origin may be the first step towards a real answer to that question,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.480
and a sincere acknowledgement that the market's changing.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.300
Besides, even though Steam's been a fantastic digital platform,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.080
a little competition can only mean good things for digital distribution.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.080
But all of that said, they need to fix their dumbass EULA.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.440
Do you see a way for a Latin America or Africa or other seemingly absent markets

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.910
to become more relevant in the realm of games?

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.600
Latin America certainly will, and soon. James does a lot of work there.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.320
In fact, if you Google the words "video games Brazil" or "CNN Argentina video games",

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.560
his work will probably be the first thing that comes up. Latin America might even be a future topic down the road.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.060
We'll see.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.240
As far as other regions go, we have less experience there. India is probably going to be viable in the next decade.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.700
Turkey already has a pretty good MMO market going, but these things are really going on a case by case basis.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.880
We'd like to use the Big Mac index. It... look it up. It's a thing.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.880
As an off-the-cuff indicator of whether or not a country will be a reasonable market for video games

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.720
in the next decade.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.700
If it takes the average person in the country more than an hour of work to afford a Big Mac,

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.800
there's probably a lot of other things that need to be done before they're really ready

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.220
to be a thriving video game scene.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.300
Is there a way we could get the show closed captioned or translated?

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.800
We're all pretty slammed beneath our current workload,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.920
but we would love to see the show be accessible to more people.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.240
I'm not a hundred percent sure what would need doing through Blip or PA TV,

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.960
but if anybody out there is willing to volunteer,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.120
we'd be happy to look into a closed caption edition.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.320
As far as translation goes,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.620
it's something we're working on but could use some help with.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.560
We'd like to put the show up on major gaming sites in other countries so more people can find it.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.300
But our progress has been pretty slow.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.680
If any of you happen to work for that kind of major site, or simply want to tell us who's the best source

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.480
for gaming information in your country, please email us. That would be amazing.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.440
And that is all we got time for. I'll plan on scheduling these mailbag episodes a little more often from now on,

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.520
and we're going to try to organize occasional Livestream Q&amp;A so we can answer more of you guys' questions,

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.260
But for now, thanks again for all the questions.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.260
Thank you, Erin for helping us out once again.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.140
We'll see you next week.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.400
