00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.400
Welcome to the biggest and best
Atlassian summit ever.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.640
We are about to cross 40,000 companies and organizations around the world,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.680
 using Atlassian's products.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.750
Other teams are discovering they can use
JIRA

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.220
Confluence and HipChat, to make their teams more productive.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.810
You're going to hear how Vistaprint,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.510
uses Atlassian Service Desk, to support

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.040
their teams in over twenty two countries.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.220
You are going to hear how Twitter, use Atlassian's products to support their HR, Finance and legal team.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.800
And you'll even hear how B Braun, uses
Atlassian's products to create a social internet, 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.470
to support 50,000 of their employees,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.350
And there's only one company,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.430
that wakes up every morning and thinks about teams.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.370
And that company is Atlassian.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.540
I'd like to welcome to the stage, my
good mate and Co-Founder,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.080
Mike Cannon-Brooks.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.470
I am going to share with you my top 5
announcements/highlights from Summit.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.650
So it's been a really big year for our biggest customers.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.790
Indeed we launched our enterprise
services and software offerings,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.700
in July, a few months ago. 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.700
And we also introduced a new class of products,

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.620
so alongside our cloud and server offerings, 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.330
we introduced a data centre class of products,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.830
for the largest scale customers who have the most critical of needs.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.660
And we started with that in July with JIRA Data Center

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.780
And last week alongside JIRA Data Center,

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.320
we launched Confluence Data Center. 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.640
Today I want to announce another Data Center offering,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.300
and that's with Stash.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.080
Stash Data Center is Clusterable, Highly Available and Extensible.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.160
All of the add-ons and power of the marketplace work inside Stash.

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.169
Let's talk about HipChat.

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:54.469
Now HipChat is built to connect business teams,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.910
in real time, no matter where they are, no matter what device they're using.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.830
It brings group chat, file sharing and integrates all of your applications together,

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.860
into a wonderful experience of
collaboration for your teams.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.760
You might think how much do I expect to pay?

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.610
The answer now is, nothing.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.260
And we also added HipChat plus so if you
want to add video chat,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.709
screen sharing, and unlimited storage, it's just two dollars a user a month.

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.309
3 billion messages sent through HipChat.

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:23.309
The last billion came in just four months, 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.590
and as you can see from the chart that's only accelerating.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.400
HipChat Server is now in public beta.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.220
We now have more than 400 companies using it live, 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.400
some with thousands of people behind the firewall.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.460
And it's at feature parity with the cloud.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.900
I am very excited about upcoming IOS 8 mobile client.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.340
IOS 8 gives amazing capabilities for us to integrate

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.060
HipChat, with the rest of the operating system,

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.920
with the rest of the applications on the phone.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.660
And I heard that there's another company

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.880
that's running a conference alongside ours,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.459
that's trying to compete with us.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.840
Uhm...

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.260
They shipped some sort of a watch.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.380
HipChat will also work on the Apple watch.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.300
We're not quite sure, there's no SDK &amp; no watches yet.

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.889
But it will probably look a lot like this.

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.889
Let's talk about Service Desk.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.250
It's easily our most successful product launch ever.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.260
We now have thousands and thousands of teams,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.760
running on Service Desk.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.420
So today with this launch of Service Desk 2.0, we're

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.400
radically changing the pricing.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.400
All of those customers are now free.

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.279
One price: twenty-five dollars an agent, for all of the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.520
features of Service Desk.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.580
No feature based pricing.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.340
Let's talk about Confluence.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.720
So one of our biggest applications Confluence

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.920
is obviously been massively successful over the last

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.620
decade.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.030
We're taking that and making that collaboration

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.890
in context. 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.940
Let's stop for a second and look at why context

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.560
is important.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.580
Context increases the speed and accuracy of

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.360
collaboration. What you notice is different in 5.7,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.460
is that now I can actually select pieces of content

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.840
and I can add in line comments

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.110
directly there in a single click.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.000
When I open that PowerPoint presentation,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.620
you'll notice that I can share it with other colleagues.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.050
So we've made files

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.710
a first-class citizen in Confluence from 5.7.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.460
It's all in html5, it renders over 80 different file types

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.480
all the office documents that you're used to.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.280
And lastly we've added versioning to files,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.100
and made it very very simple to add new versions.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.100
Let's talk about dev teams.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.060
Two years ago we started a big journey, to change the

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.640
flow of your entire product team.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.830
We started that during the year with the development

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.710
panel. So now inside every issue you can get access to

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.540
all of your development experience. Both in

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.550
terms of the work flow for the developer, the steps they

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.310
have to move through.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.630
And in terms of the data. 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.630
We also wanted to make them faster,

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.370
and we're doing it by adding robots. What now happens

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.590
is when you have automated issue transition setup,

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.120
the developer can continue to work in Stash.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.680
The ops people can continue to work in Bamboo,

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.880
people can work in a tool of choice, which is what we

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.800
want them to do.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.960
When the developer branches and commits code,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.580
the handy little robots behind automated issue

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.740
transitions will automatically move that issue along.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.490
All the automated workflow that you can put in JIRA

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.570
now integrated across your entire development stack.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.030
And we've got a completely new version experience

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.580
coming up, in JIRA.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.140
I can see a high-level sort of a progress bar where I'm

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.820
up to. How many issues are done, in progress currently,

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.290
and awaiting to be done.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.450
So the warnings at a version level allow you to see

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.570
problems that you may not be aware of.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.570
That we're the only company that has visibility into all

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.500
of the different tools simultaneously,

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.100
to tell you where you might have problems.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.100
Uuuh do you guys want one more thing

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.420
or you're you all done?

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.240
You want one more? All right.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.780
We have an entirely new product for you today...

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.790
in JIRA Portfolio.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.280
The goal of JIRA portfolio is quite simple

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.280
It's to allow you to plan at scale,

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.600
it's to allow you to connect your strategy with your

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.400
reality, and it allows you to respond to change when

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.540
things are going wrong, when things are off the rails

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.360
you want to know as early as possible and you want to

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.160
be able to make changes.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.900
We're trying to democratize the world of portfolio

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.600
management. It's very good for very big teams, but we

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.560
think that every team can benefit from this sort of thing.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.670
Now as a quick recap because I can see I'm rapidly

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.670
running out of time. We've got Confluence and Stach

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.960
data center for our biggest customers to make sure

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.220
we're growing alongside them.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.230
We've got HipChat as a Server beta, IOS &amp; OSX clients

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.230
and a whole series of new integration capabilities that

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.640
connect Confluence and BitBucket.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.220
Service Desk 2.0 with a single portal, email access and

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.660
just twenty five dollars for agent, free-for-all your

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.260
customers. Confluence with the in context collaboration

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.840
in comment, file collaboration, previews.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.840
Dev teams, the dev panel, those handy little robots

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.840
and a whole new version experience. And an entirely

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.240
new product in JIRA Portfolio to connect your

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.180
organization's strategy with the actual reality.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.140
So for me, that's it. Thank you very much.
