00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.730
We are on an island called
Appledore Island which is a

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.920
small island, about 95 acres.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.180
When I was a student, I thought
this was just the

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.120
greatest place.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.610
I mean, I do still
think this is the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.590
greatest place on earth.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.830
So I actually chose UNH as my
undergraduate school, because

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.050
of the Shoals Marine Lab.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.300
It's a very special place,
because this place is

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.009
primarily geared for
undergraduate education.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.050
So this summer after my freshman
year, I came out here

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.770
and took underwater research.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.360
So now I come back every summer
from Alaska to teach

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.470
the underwater research class.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.210
The second day out on the float
we give them a slate and

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.430
an assignment, and they're going
and collecting data.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.040
Every year we have the students
come up with their

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.640
own proposal.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.150
We don't spoon feed
them anything.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.180
We want them to go out and look
at things and make their

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.140
own observations, and then we'll
guide them in trying to

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.060
develop a question that can be
answered in a variety of ways.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.450
It's very real, you know?

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.150
We learn basic driving safety
and ecology and then we can

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.440
just jump right in and ask
questions ourselves.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.390
A lot of universities will offer
a diving class where

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.610
they can get certified to dive
or an advanced certification,

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.040
but very few places offer a
scientific diver course, where

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.140
they're also learning underwater
research methods,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.200
sampling methods, data
collection methods, for the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.200
experimental design of how you
go about answering questions

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.500
in the subtidal.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.140
And the academic portion that
Jim and I give them of the

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.320
organisms and the ecology that
they can take forward and

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.380
apply to any system, not
just underwater.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.405
This is a really amazing
experience.

00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:01.900
It's really special.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.160
I think it's extremely valuable
that we get such a

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.570
variance in our learning
experiences.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.410
All the components, whether
they're in the classroom or in

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.670
the dive locker, on the float or
underwater, all have really

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.770
useful cross communication and
it's very different being

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.490
underwater and trying
to conduct research.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.520
We told them on the first night,
going over the syllabus

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.620
and what they'd be graded on,
and we have an organism exam.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.810
We're going to take you
underwater, and you're going

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.850
to have to identify 20 things.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.740
And they said, well how
will we remember?

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.670
We come back on the float
and we write down?

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.960
And I said no, you'll have a
slate with you, and you'll

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.480
write down underwater, and
take the exam underwater.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.160
And every year they're like,
I've never taken an exam

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.410
underwater.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.690
I am so glad I decided to come
here, because it's given me an

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.500
opportunity to see if marine
biology is right for me.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.060
Because I'm doing it
and living it.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.490
I've always loved the ocean
and growing up here it's

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.520
really great to be able to take
tide pooling to the next

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.840
step, and be able to look
at the environment

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.900
in a different way.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.300
The unique part about Appledore
Island is, first of

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.640
all, it is an island.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.800
So students who come out here
not only get an intense

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.640
experience in academics, but
they also get an intense

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.240
social experience.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.620
And almost 100% of the time,
students come out here with

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.530
lifelong friends, or
they leave here

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.780
with lifelong friends.
