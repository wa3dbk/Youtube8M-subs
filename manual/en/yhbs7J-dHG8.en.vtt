Hi, my name is Alison Hassel and I am the Public Relations Manager for Zoos SA.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.540
I am in charge of all the PR related activities for the zoo.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.530
So, I manage the media relations,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.530
meaning I host any film crew or media when they're on site,

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.390
I put together media stories for the organisation,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.330
so, write press releases, pitch stories to journalists.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.780
I also manage all of the social networking for the organisation

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.100
which includes facebook, twitter, our blog site

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.860
as well as our YouTube channel and we also put out a

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.030
monthly external e-newsletter as well as

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.220
an internal newsletter, which we manage.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.370
I'm really, really lucky to have the job that I do working with Zoos SA

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.320
and especially Adelaide Zoo because it's a job and a role

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.830
that encompasses both my personal and professional interests.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.690
As a communicator, it is my job to

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.670
relate stories and ideas and messages from the organisation

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.390
and when those key messages encompass what I personally believe in

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.870
it makes my role ten times easier

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.880
and I absolutely love the animals and care for the environment

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.010
and really want to make a difference when it comes to our world.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.360
My favourite part of the job, I'd have to say, is

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.070
the media relations aspect of it

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.220
as well as the social networking

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.200
especially because you can engage one on one with your audience

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.320
they talk to you, you talk to them.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.330
I do get to interact a bit with the animals

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.810
however, now that I am the manager, I don't get as many opportunities like this

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.560
to be with the animals, but when they do come up I jump at it

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.840
because look at this, how special is that?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.130
I'm originally from Los Angeles, California

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.860
and I've been living in Australia for about seven years.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.760
I moved to Adelaide in 2009 to undertake the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.730
Bachelor of Public Relations at the University of South Australia.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.930
Studying at the University of South Australia gave me a practical and theoretical

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.990
knowledge of the PR industry that set me on a course

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.270
to realise my professional dreams.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.370
The learning and support environment created by staff

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.370
at the University of South Australia was also instrumental in my success to date.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.710
I found the students to be very friendly and inviting and the

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.700
lecturers and tutors were definitely there for you throughout the whole course

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.950
whether it was getting in touch with them after hours or

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.430
staying back for a few minutes to have a little bit of extra time with them.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.560
I undertook my internship placement in my third year of study at the university.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.260
We could pretty much undertake our internship in any industry

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.880
in any organisation, because the PR industry itself is quite vast.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.410
You'd be quite surprised where you could work in Public Relations.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.040
When I first started the degree, I had no idea that I could work at a zoo, for instance.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.880
I think it's also vital for students to take those opportunities

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.310
to further their learning outside of the classroom

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.770
whether it be going to university arranged events

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.970
or through some sort of professional industry body

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.220
Those are the chances that you'll get to work on your personal brand

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.580
and develop those relationships that will progress you further in your career

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.380
once you have a great theoretical background and foundation

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.030
that the university will provide.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.640
