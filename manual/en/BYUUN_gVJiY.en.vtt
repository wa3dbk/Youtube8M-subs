00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.879
On this 2002 Toyota Rav 4, were going to install
part number 75125 from Drawtite.

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.309
The first step involved is to take down this
tie down bracket.

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.410
We will show you where the hitch is going
to mount up in the frame.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.309
It is going to use these two existing studed
holes in the frame.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.460
On the passenger side it is going to be identical.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.560
And what is nice about this is that the bolts
in there are relatively easy to clean out.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.320
On the other side though there is not a tie
down bracket take a few moments to clean out

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.320
those threads over there.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.320
We will work on that next.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.800
:28
Alright we are going to spray these down even

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.633
though we just got the bolts out of them just
to make sure we get all of the dust and the

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:39.910
extra grime that came out with it and we will
thread our bolts in just to make sure it works.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.260
Alright this is our other side that doesnt
have anything in there, so it is going to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.260
take some work.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.801
So what we will do is spray it down and when
you do that we can go ahead and run our bolt

00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:49.801
in.

00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:54.120
And be very careful about doing this so you
do not cross any of the threads starting off.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.051
It is going to appear like our threads are
too big, but it is just a bunch of dirt and

00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:59.420
grime in there.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:21.360
Once you get it started then you want to back
it off and do 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:56.590
that two or three times and you can see some
of the junk is 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.710
already coming out.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.190
