00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.890
Hi we’re here at Presqu’ile Provincial
Park, and I’m with Dave, and we’re in

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.820
the marsh. Things are going to get a little
mucky. But very cool…

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.640
So, here we are at the Presqu’ile marsh
and this is one of the coolest spots, and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.910
some would say the coolest spot, at Presqu’ile.
Yeah, it looks great! And not only is it a

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.100
beautiful place to walk through, it is full
of really cool creatures. And I thought since

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.970
we’re dressed for the occasion, we’d go
in with our nets. Yeah, this is yours. How

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.770
come I get… why do I get a little pink one?
Well, you’re a rookie… I didn’t want

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.620
you to hurt yourself or anything.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.230
Now of course you don’t have to wade in
the water to enjoy our marsh. We do have an

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.050
800 meter boardwalk that goes through the
marsh so people can come and experience it

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.360
without getting their feet wet. But sometimes
it is fun, with the kids and the adults, to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.260
see what you can find when you scoop through
the water.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.960
One of the best things about the park of course,
is our bird migration. Easily in the spring

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.920
we’ll see well over 100 species… probably
close to 200 species of birds will be coming

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.580
straight here. So 100 different species? So
this is like a birder’s paradise here? Easy…

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.400
easy you can see 100 different species a day
some days, so yeah it’s a birders paradise.

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.610
And people come in May, some people come all
year around to see birds, because different

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.680
times of year, different birds, but May is
my personal favourite time of the year because

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.120
that’s when the birds are in their breeding
plumage, they’re at their brightest colours.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.120
Beautiful oranges and yellows. Yep, almost
as good as a warbler, almost as good as a

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:45.480
warbler! Be careful what I might attract here.
You never know! (Bird sounds) Was that good?

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.530
Absolutely, I’m surprised we’re not being
mobbed right now actually!

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.800
One of the cool things about Presqu’ile
is we actually have a program here to look

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.909
after the park and re-forest it. This was
all naturally forested, and during European

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.060
settlement it was all cleared. So these fields
are actually non-native habitats. So by having

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.640
our own nursery, we can help to bring some
of these fields back. So a reforestation of

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.980
old farmland? That’s exactly right… reforestation
of old farmland! We use all native species

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.480
that we, as I said, the seeds that are collected
right here in the park. And it’s cool because

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.330
we have a lot of people that do this. It’s
not just staff that do this. We get a lot

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.069
of school groups come in and other volunteers.
And anybody that’s interested can get a-hold

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.609
of us and we’ll get a working group together,
get out and plant trees where they need to

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:33.689
be planted.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.220
Well Doug, we’ve seen a lot of cool things
in the park. Very cool! But this might be

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.550
the coolest! This is the Presqu’ile lighthouse.
Built in 1840, it is the second oldest, continuously

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.270
operating lighthouse on the Great Lakes. Wow!
And it’s the only lighthouse found in a

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.180
provincial park! And there were lots and lots
of shipwrecks in this area… well over 100

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.629
shipwrecks within about a 30/40 year period.
Wow! There was a lot of loss of life, and

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.969
they finally got this lighthouse built. And
it’s an icon for the park, and an icon for

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.569
the town. And there it is, the Presqu’ile
lighthouse!

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.840
Okay Dave, we finally got one in nice and
straight. Fabulous job. Great job, eh? Yes,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.540
let’s go! We’re outta here, let’s go!
