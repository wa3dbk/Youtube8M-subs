00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.560
My name is Henrik Vibskov.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:29.000
I don't really see myself
as a typical, classic Danish designer.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.760
This is were we make
our creative creations.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.600
I operate within
many different creative fields.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.360
I make clothes...

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.240
I trained in menswear
at Central Saint Martins.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.880
I make costumes and exhibitions...

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.640
I'm busy creating the costumes
and the set design

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.800
for a BjÃ¶rk performance
at the Brussels opera house.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.200
I dart around
and talk to everyone involved.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.840
'What's the status?
How far along are we?'

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.320
I'm very impulsive, and so I get
lured into weekend projects a lot.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.320
Copenhagen is the place
where I'm based and where I live.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.240
I think it's a great place.
I also travel quite a lot.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.600
It only takes me ten, fifteen minutes
to get to the airport.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.120
'An easy-to-do-business-with country.'

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200
I have a great life in Copenhagen.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.360
When I do my shows in Paris,
I'll fly down there.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.200
It's a bit like 'back to the base'.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.800
We make our stuff, and we're off.
We make our stuff, and we're off.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.520
We have a shop in Copenhagen.
It's been around for eight, nine years.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.480
It's on Krystalgade,
just next to the RundetÃ¥rn tower.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.360
It's a 'multi-label store',
to use an English term.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.800
We carry other brands, too.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.400
In the shop we represent people
or friends who make clothes or beer...

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.560
All kinds of stuff!
And we're able to sell it here in our shop.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.840
It's both a metropolis
and not a metropolis.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.280
It's still a small city...and a quiet city.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.920
If you've been to a pulsating city and
then fly back to Copenhagen, you go:

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.680
'Where are all the people?
Is there something wrong?'

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.560
'No, it's just a regular Sunday.'
