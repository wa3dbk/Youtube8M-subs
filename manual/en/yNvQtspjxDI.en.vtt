Hi, my name is Sue Conrad, and we're going
to be going over how to jump higher. One item

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.090
that you can use to help increase your height
is using a jump rope and you can use this

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.670
as your warm up, or you can just use it as
your whole workout because there's many different

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:23.410
things you can do with a jump rope. So you
can just do a basic two-footed jump, that's

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:40.579
one option. Another option is to alternate.
I actually start off with sets of twenty to

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.579
twenty-five so maybe do three of them to warm
up, and if you want more of an extensive workout

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.460
you can do some advance jump rope options.
Another exercise you can use to help increase

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.510
your vertical jump is you can do some calf
raises or toe raises. You can use those using

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.640
something to support you, or you can just
do them free standing. So you come up and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:13.369
do your calf raises, of course it would work
better if you were on a higher surface but

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.229
you can just do them standing if you don't
have one available. You're just going to come

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.930
forward onto your toes and then bring it back
down, keeping your back in an upright position,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.630
back nice and straight. You can, of course,
then we have our toe raises. You're just going

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:39.860
to lift your toes forward, keeping your body
upright without rocking back. Another exercise

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.469
that you can do to help increase your vertical
jump or vertical height is a deep knee bend

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.729
or a deep knee squat. You just come down,
as far down as you can go, and then come back

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.850
up. You can go a little bit lower on these
but you still want to maintain your proper

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:06.380
form, make sure your knees don't go forward
of your toes. And lastly, I have a more advanced

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.260
option, which is either a jump squat, or a
deep knee bend with a jump. So you can reach

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.980
down, shoulders back, reach up. You can also
add some resistance to this by grabbing a

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.760
medicine ball. Remember, this is an advanced
option, if you have knee or back issues this

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.010
exercise is not for you. So you're going to
reach back, sit it back into that chair, and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.510
propel upward. And these are some exercises
that are going to help with your vertical

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.530
jump.
