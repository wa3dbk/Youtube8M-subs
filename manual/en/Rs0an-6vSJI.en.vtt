Hi! My name is Kip and I'm here on behalf
of Expert Village. Today we're making a white

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.269
Christmas cake. Once your cakes have cooled,
go ahead and begin to assemble them. I've

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.100
already put down the first cake and I've put
a layer of frosting. Not on the edges, just

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:25.710
on the top. Then you'll take your second cake
and place it on top. Make sure that it is

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:34.190
centered properly. Go ahead and frost this
one. You can use a large rubber spatula for

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.750
this stage because you want to put a generous
amount edge to edge, but down the sides at

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:48.610
this point.
Once we're done doing that, double check to

00:00:48.610 --> 00:01:01.710
make sure you're square, and place the last
cake on top. Now, we're going to go ahead

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:32.770
and put a nice amount of frosting over the
entire cake. Then you can switch to this frosting

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:42.289
knife, and just go and smooth out. Double
check, because like right here that the center

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:53.170
piece has slide over just a little bit. That's
not uncommon. Just smooth out the job lightly

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:15.780
and gently all the way around. Once we're
done doing that, just take a moist paper towel,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:33.530
wipe off the little bit of mess that we've
made. Then we can got ahead and put a few

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:52.780
pecans for decoration on top. There we have
a really fun Christmas dessert, the white

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.130
Christmas cake.
