Hi, I am Eugenie.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.490
Today I am making delicious Taiwanese invention,
bubble tea, of two flavors: milk tea and coconut.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.760
You can find my recipes at Eugeniekitchen.com
First, cook black tapioca according to the

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.380
directions on the package.
And drain and wash with cold water.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.220
And soak 1/3 cup of tapioca in 3 tablespoons
of simple sugar syrup.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.660
And let sit for one hour.
And make ½ cup of strong black tea with a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.660
teabag.
And let cool to room temperature.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.870
Then in a cup add the tapioca and syrup mixture,
2/3 cup of ice cubes,

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.720
cooled black tea,
1 tablespoon of simple syrup

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.720
and finally add in ½ cup of cold milk.
Voila!

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.240
Classic bubble tea, milk tea boba.
I love sweet milk tea with chewy boba, Giant

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.430
tapioca pearls.
In fact this is milkier than the bubble tea

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.710
last summer.
And for children,

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.710
in a cup add the tapioca and syrup mixture.
And in a shaker, add 2/3 cup of ice cubes,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.060
1/4 cup of coconut cream (4 tablespoons),
½ cup of cold milk,

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.060
and 1 tablespoon of simple syrup.
And shake rigorously until combine.

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:12.439
Then pour over the tapioca-syrup mixture.
And voila, no-caffeine drink coconut bubble

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.700
tea.
I just love this delicious tropical flavor.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.650
Milk tea and coconut: seriously those are
some of my favorites.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.620
Bon appetit.
Do you have cravings for this sweet ice-cold

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.200
drink?
Make bubble tea at home.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.380
If you have giant black tapioca pearls, it's
just a snap.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.650
This hot summer,
I wish you enjoy this ultimate Taiwanese summer

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.650
drink, bubble tea, at home.
Thank you for watching. Bye!
