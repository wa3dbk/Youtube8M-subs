Hi on behalf of Expert Village.com, I'm Shelly
here with AA Callister in Salt Lake City,

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.470
Utah and we are talking about to choose a
winter horse blanket. What I'd like to talk

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:16.440
to you about now is adding a liner or layer
your blankets. Now, you don't need one blanket

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.830
that will last all year, that's kind of the
problem is that because you have Spring and

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.500
Fall temperatures and then you have your really
cold winter temperatures. So what a lot of

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.000
people will do is they will either buy two
blankets, two separate blankets, lightweight

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.020
for the Spring and Fall and the a heavyweight
for the winter cold months or they will use

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.060
the same blanket and just add a liner. This
is just a fleece liner so that it's breathable

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:49.530
and then what do is put this on first, so
we will put on her fleece liner first, and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.510
then we will secure it and fasten it, this
is just got the two criss-cross surgical on

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.020
this blanket and the open front so we'll put
the liner on. You'd say why do I need to add

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.950
a liner, and that would be when the temperatures
get colder than your blanket is rated for

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.950
you can put a liner on for extra warmth. So,
it just depends, and most people do have a

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.399
liner at home for the milder temperatures
so we are going to put on our fleece liner

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:31.930
first let me secure this,
just move the straps down so that they fit

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.909
the horse comfortably and then we'll just
put our regular blanket on over the top of

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.499
it. So that way you would just have a blanket
and then a liner instead of purchasing two

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:49.479
different blankets, it's totally up to the
horse owner, what your prefer to do. If you

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:57.329
prefer a liner and a blanket or just buy two
separate blankets. It just gives the horses

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:07.340
the extra warmth for the extremely cold temperatures
in your area. Then we would just put on our

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.879
blanket over the top of that and we have added
extra warmth to the blanket we already have

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:21.090
without having to purchase another full size
winter blanket, then we secure that, so I

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.950
guess it would be like almost wearing two
pair of winter socks or two shirts for a person.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.219
So that's how to add a liner and why you would
need a liner with a winter horse blanket.
