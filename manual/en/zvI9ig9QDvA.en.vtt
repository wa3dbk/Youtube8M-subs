Hi everybody, I’m Melissa. Welcome to Cloudmom.
So excited to be talking about this terrific

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.840
baby carrier today on Cloudmom. This is the
Boba soft-structured baby carrier. I have

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.189
another video where I go into all the features
of the Boba, and this video is about how to

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.390
position and carry your baby in the front
carry position with the Boba. So we’re going

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.430
to be walking through that right now. So step
number one with this is to place the carrier

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.140
along the upper portion of your hips, depending
on your height. And you really, really want

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.000
it to be very, very tight. So you’re going
to make sure that the tag is in with this

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.920
carrier. And because my baby is going to be
carried on my front, I’m going to have the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.039
tag on my front part. And remember I’ve
got this great clasp in the back that has

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.879
dual adjustability. So I’m going to turn
around and show you guys how I’m going to

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.510
adjust that in the back. So I’m going to
place the carrier here, along the upper portion

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.570
of my hips. I’m going to snap it in here.
And I’m going to pull from both sides to

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.660
make sure this is as tight as possible. Tight,
tight, tight, that is the mantra with all

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.790
of these baby carriers for safety purposes
so you really want this to be tight. Okay

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.200
guys? Pull in on both sides. Okay. So here
I am. And interestingly enough, if you’re

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.329
sort of out for the day with your baby and
you find that your baby’s already walking

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.990
or crawling and they want to get in and out
of the carrier a lot, you can just go around

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.320
like this, and pretend it’s like a fun,
funky apron and not worry about taking this

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.869
middle strap off all the time. This is the
first thing you’re going to do. And when

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.659
you do this, you don’t carry your baby,
you don’t have your baby with you. You do

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.710
this first, you get it all worked out. Another
thing I would do before I even picked up my

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.950
baby, is make sure that I’m happy with where
my straps are. I actually like to leave them

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.380
on the looser setting. Again, the way you’re
going to loosen them is by lifting up on this

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.899
little piece here and pulling. And it has
dual adjustability. But for me, it’s easier

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.549
to have them on a looser setting, get my baby
into position, and then tighten. Now I’m

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:15.590
going to get my baby. Here he is. Peace, love,
rock and roll and baby carriers, and very

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.470
cute too. Okay. So the main thing with your
baby in the baby carrier is that you want

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.209
to make sure he’s in the correct squatted
position. And this means that his knees are

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.290
going to be slightly higher than his bum.
Some people even refer to it as a 93-degree

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.569
angle. With a newborn, he will still be in
this squatted position. And as the baby gets

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.700
older, he’ll be able to have his legs sit
outside the carrier, in a 90-degree angle

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.040
like this. So you’re going to make sure
your baby’s in this nice position. Okay?

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.950
I’m fiddling here, so I’m taking my hand
off the baby’s upper back and neck, but

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.680
don’t do that with your newborn. You’re
always going to be supporting the neck and

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.890
the back. Now when you’re putting on your
carrier, what you’re going to be doing,

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.300
rather than thinking about putting your baby
into the carrier, you’re going to be smoothing

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.310
the carrier over your baby. So I’ve got
my hip situation all worked out here. I’m

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.560
supporting my baby. I’m supporting their
neck. And I’m just going to smooth the carrier

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.099
over my baby. So here I am. You see? I smooth
the carrier over my baby. My first armrest

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.700
is here. I’m going to place it over that
arm. Okay? I’m holding my baby, and I’m

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.560
supporting his neck the whole time. Now I’m
turning this way. I’m taking my second armrest

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.110
like this, and I’m smoothing it on. There’s
two more steps here. I can tighten these straps,

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.180
so that you know your baby is nice and tight
and secure before you turn to tightening.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.900
See how I’m tightening it, tightening the
strap just by pulling down? So the baby’s

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.890
nice and tight and secure before you take
this piece here and snap it into place. So

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.030
here I go. And this is that great piece that
moves up and down on the Boba. Duck. Dual

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:01.049
adjustability, I’m going to snap in. Okay.
So here’s my baby. This is so comfortable

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.959
at this point. If he’s a newborn, again,
he’s in like this. If he’s older, his

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.299
legs are going to be able to go out like this.
A couple safety things: you want to make sure

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.950
there’s always a flow of air to your baby.
His head doesn’t have to be turned to the

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.280
side. Sometimes he might be like this, but
you want to make sure you have that nice flow

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:26.090
of air. And you want to make sure the baby
is high and tight. Most times with carriers,

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.419
the problem is that they’re not tight enough.
99% of the time, that’s the issue. So you

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.979
could always tighten. And it really should
be so secure. So that he’s high and tight,

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.159
and you have this rule with carriers called
the "kissing rule". You can easily lean down

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:43.000
and kiss your baby. Okay? So here’s my baby.
He’s very comfortable. I also have this

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.219
removable headpiece, which is terrific if
it’s sunny, or if I’m nursing. And I’m

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:51.000
going to show you guys in another video how
to nurse in the Boba. And I’m going to show

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.130
you guys how to take off your baby from the
Boba. Okay? So again, main thing here is,

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.089
you’re going to safely take your baby off
from the upper portion of the Boba. And then

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:03.690
you’re going to take off your hip part.
You don’t have to do that while you have

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.149
your baby on there. Okay? So, my baby’s
here nice and tight. I’m going to turn around.

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:14.880
I've got this piece here, which I’m going
to unsnap like that. I go back, one hand is

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.149
on my baby at all times, especially if he’s
small, I’m supporting his neck. I take off

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:26.899
this arm strap. I take off this arm strap.
I just sort of let the carrier fall down while

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:33.690
holding my baby. And then I put my baby in
a safe place, and I’ll be right back. Bye

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:40.849
Fredo! Here I am. And now all I have to do
is take off my waist part, and I’m all done.

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:46.219
I have a couple other videos on the Boba,
on back carrying on the Boba, nursing on the

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:50.240
Boba, and the features of this really terrific
carrier. So check those all out. Thanks so

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.720
much for watching Cloudmom.com, and see you
guys next time.
