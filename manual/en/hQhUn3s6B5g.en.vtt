00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:33.320
Hi everyone, welcome to this special DLC video for Storm 3. So, this video is quite simply meant to propose DLCs.  

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.530
As can see, the title isn’t that hard to understand.  

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:49.050
I wanted to propose last week the 3 sannin (war clothes),but I was surprised to find that cc2 had already released them a few days ago.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.560
So, perfect, I can take advantage of this and remove them from this video 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.690
and propose you 6 or 7 DLC packs of my own accord that you’ll most likely enjoy. 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.860
.   And I’m counting on you to vote for your favorite.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:12.650
Next I will send the video to cc2 and maybe with a bit of luck they’ll be carried away by certain DLC

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:22.380
and thanks to you and the number of votes that you submit, maybe they’ll be tempted to create these DLCs. 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.060
So I’m going to try to give you the opportunity to speak your mind and share your opinions.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:41.030
We’ve already seen Naruto dressed like Goku, we’ve already seen Naruto dressed as a student, 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.890
Sasuke as a student, Sakura as a student, recently Kakashi Anbu

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.300
Jiraya , yamato anbu ...We’ve had a bit of everything.  

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.600
I know that not everything won unanimous support, so I decided to propose you 6 or 7 DLC packs 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.860
and I will explain to you at the end how to proceed for the vote.  

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.230
Here we go! I would like to propose you these 7 DLC packs… 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.490
And most importantly, watch the video until the end to properly understand what you need to do 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.760
and remember the names of the packs that I’m proposing so that you can vote at the end.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.450
We’ll start right away so we don’t lose any time, with the pack “Kage summit.”

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.730
“Kage summit” consists of regrouping 5 DLCs that have hats, for those who appreciate the hats of the Akatsuki.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:43.500
Here, Tsuchikage in a hat, as well as Raikage, Mizukage, gaara and danzo...

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.800
So, 5 DLCs with hats.  This pack is called, the first pack “Kage summit.”

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.780
Next we go to the 2nd pack. The second pack is reserved for generation so it’s called the “special generation” pack

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.890
and consists of regrouping 5 characters "from Storm G"

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:22.310
so that would be Sakura dressed with a  Kimono ,Hinata too, kimimaro dressed completely, Naruto(Lee),and finally Sasuke (training)

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.020
So that is the second pack  called “special generation.”

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.880
Now we move on to the third pack, which is the pack “Akatsuki.”  

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.210
Pack Akatsuki which is simply capes of the Akatsuki

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:52.760
.  Kakuzu with his full cape, Hidan, Karin, Jugo, Suigetsu , and finally, the best for last, Orochimaru with the Akatsuki cape. 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.210
So that makes 6 DLC, so for this 3rd pack called "Akatsuki".

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.510
We move on to the 4th pack, which is the "Edo tensei pack".

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:18.780
It would consist of : kakuzu (edo),Hanzo (no edo),Kimimaro (Edo) , Chiyo(Edo), and the two last ones, Shodai &amp; Nidaime in Edo tensei.  

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.870
I remind you that they fought against Sandaime in the first season of Naruto in Edo tensei.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.340
So those 6 DLC... if you liked it this is pack #4 called “Edo tensei.”

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.160
Now we move on to the 5th pack, which is the pack “Kimono.”

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.140
For those who appreciated the one before ( Naruto kimono, Sasuke kimono...etc)

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:47.710
Jiraiya kimono, Orichimaru kimono, Hashirama and Tobirama in kimonos, and Lee as well in a kimono, and finally Deidara kimono.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.700
This fifth pack is called the "Kimono pack".

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.090
The 6th pack is the “Suit &amp; tie pack.”

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:09.030
This includes Shikamaru in suit and tie, Sasuke, Naruto, Sai, and finally Gaara in a suit and tie.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.730
So it’s the 6th pack “Suit &amp; Tie”

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.900
And finally, the last one, the 7th pack is called the “Younger days.”

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:43.370
Younger days, which regroups Konan (1st akatsuki) Kabuto(anbu), Zabuza (kiri clothes) Nagato(1st akatsuki ), and kisame(kiri clothes)

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.990
So I’m going to go over the packs again.. Don’t hesitate to re-watch the video if you’d like. 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.140

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.620
That’s it for these 7 DLC packs. Now, it’s up to you to vote! It’s simple! 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.690
You go to the comments section of this video. You’ll notice that there are only 7 comments – the 7 packs.  

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.170
Don’t hesitate to watch the video again if you don’t remember what you saw.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.090
You simply have to click on the green thumb next to the name of the pack that interests you the most

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.390
of coursing, hoping that you found these packs interesting. 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:38.400
Don’t hesitate to share this video with your friends to get them to participate. 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:45.180
There are a lot of people who complain that they don’t get what they want, but don’t do anything to change this fact. 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:53.110
I’m proposing to change things and maybe have a DLC that you will like, so don’t hesitate to participate 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.680
and click on the green thumb next to the pack(s) that please you.  

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:16.180
In about 3 weeks, I’ll send this video to cc2 and maybe with a bit of luck they’ll see that people are motivated by certain DLC and put them in place.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:35.020
I know cc2 listen fans, we can saw it lot of times...

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:46.070
