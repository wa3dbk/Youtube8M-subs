00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.680
Well, the selection process is very similar to Division 1.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.540
On the internet, the NCAA.com, they have a broadcast where you find out

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.939
who you're playing in the national tournament.

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.539
Basically there's 64 teams

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.479
and they'd break it down by different
regions geographically and they

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:30.109
what they do, they pair people by record, strength, and schedule;

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:37.109
and we battle to find out who's going to
be number one in the country.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.870
Right now at 12:30, we will be sitting here in the gymnasium

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.439
as a team

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:45.030
to look at the selection for the Division 3 national tournament.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.540
And, right now were just sitting here waiting to see who we're going to play and where we're going to

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.030
go.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.760
Whoever we play, i feel we have

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.100
the talent and the skill-set to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.100
be the best and to beat the best.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.060
WPI, Massachusetts Institute of

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.190
technology, and Williams.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.190
So I really want those four teams, hopefully we get to play one of them in the first round.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:41.189
And next up with Curry..

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.370
Were getting another NESCAC opponent in Middlebury who we were fortunate enough to

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.280
play two years ago.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.450
Didn't like the outcome of that game. So this gives us an opportunity to

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.830
paint a different ending. for other teams that i've mentioned, I know were known for our

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:58.880
big 3

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.370
or the big 4 that we have for

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.340
putting the ball in the hole, but we actually play some defense; and were ready to play some defense

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.850
for the National tournament, and bring the National Championship home to Curry College this year.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.239
Let's bring it in fellas.

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.419
Tomorrow, 5 o'clock. Be early.

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:15.159
Hard work on Three...

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:15.910
1..2..3.. HARD WORK!
