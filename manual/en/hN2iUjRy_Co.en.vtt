00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:08.929
So it's your first night in Tokyo. Ok, you're
going to a bar or maybe a stylish cafe, and

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:15.799
you can still use the magic word "please"
here: onegaishimasu. And let's practice. You

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:26.220
order something with a quantity, ok? Of course,
the first one, something-o. You have the coffee,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:35.120
tea, it's either "kohi." "Tea" is "ocha."
And if it's a bar, you can order a beer, which

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:43.250
is "biru." That's how it's pronounced in Japanese.
And then "Wine" is "wian." If it's red wine,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:53.450
red is "aka," so aka wian. If it's white wine,
it's "shiro" - shiro wiam. So we have the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:01.540
product's name here, and you can put the number
here. It's one, two, ten, and I have these

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:09.570
two counters right here. "Hai" is for glass
or a cup. And "hon" - well, it's a cylinder

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.820
object. If you're ordering a bottle, we count
with hon because it's a cylinder. Ok, so let's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:27.530
practice. You want to order two cups of coffee,
ok? You say, "Kohi o ni hai onegaishimasu."

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:44.320
How do you say, you like three bottles of
beer? How do you say? Biru o san hon onegaishimasu.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:52.850
It makes a difference if you're ordering maybe
wine. You want red wine: aka wian o. If you

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:01.320
say "ippai" that means one glass. But if you
say "ippon, that means a bottle of wine. So

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.090
you want to be a little bit careful with "hai"
and "hon."
