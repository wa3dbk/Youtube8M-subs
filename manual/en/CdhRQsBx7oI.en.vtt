00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.270
Zelda gets its own symphony, Mario gets everything,
Metroid gets...um...Mario gets everything!

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:30.460
You know, for a company that has as many icons
as Nintendo, they sure seem to have a tiny

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.460
spotlight.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.120
And so...if only because it’s nice to see
someone else

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.570
get some time at center stage, I’m thrilled
about Kirby’s Dream Collection.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.470
Go ahead, Kirby.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.360
Eat it up.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.580
I meant...I meant the spotlight.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.540
It’s a figure of speech, you hog.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:00.719
Of course, we shouldn’t have expected anything
less from Nintendo’s gluttonous globule

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.710
of gregarious gulletry.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.410
That means he’s a fatty who people like.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.500
Kirby’s been eating his way into people’s
hearts for 20 years now, and to celebrate

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.220
the occasion, Nintendo has compiled six of
his earliest core platformers onto a single

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.220
disc.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.450
Now, the key thing with any collection are
the games themselves.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.390
And fortunately, the selection here is just
stellar.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.560
There are some classic platformers in this
group, and more importantly, they actually

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.100
play great on the Wii.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.530
Playing with the Wii Remote on its side instantly
feels natural, even for the N64 and Super

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:41.570
Nintendo games.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.649
So what about the games individually?

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.660
Well, the highlights are obviously that classic
triad of Kirby’s Adventure, Kirby’s Dream

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.300
Land 2 and Kirby’s Super Star.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.520
Those three games are incredible to this day,
particularly the first two in terms of what

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.020
they were achieving given their hardware.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.920
Having them all together like this is an awesome
reminder of just how good Kirby games have

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.030
been over the years.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.220
And they’ve held up very well.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:18.760
In fact, they’ve held up so well, Nintendo
didn’t even have to make any adjustments.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.280
Which...might be an issue for some people.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.250
These are meticulous emulations, which means
no extras, no new content, no improved anything.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.970
Just the original games as they were and always
have been.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.870
The purist in me likes that, but it would
be nice if I could get to the main menu from

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.530
individual games...rather than having to reset
the system.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.890
Again...meticulous.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.220
Of course, the fun with a collection like
this is the history and extras, and that’s

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.500
where Nintendo did a really nice job.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.760
The package comes with a little history book
on the Kirby series and a 45-song Kirby soundtrack...and

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.970
on the disc itself, you can get information
and video of every Kirby game ever and three

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.090
episodes of the Kirby anime.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.870
Throw in a selection of new challenge levels,
updated from the versions in Return To Dream

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:21.319
Land, and you have a nice little package and
a fun celebration of 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.319
the series.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.760
Kirby doesn’t get as much credit as his
peers, and to be honest, he’s not exactly

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.450
the originator that Mario or Donkey Kong or
Link were.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.380
But to their credit, the Kirby games have
always been more taking a creative approach

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.320
to existing ideas.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.680
Why not eat the enemies?

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.370
Why not use their own weapons against them?

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.950
Why not ride a hamster?

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.010
Without Kirby, the world may never have known.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.340
It’s the fantastic and nostalgic Kirby’s
Dream Collection.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.140
Happy birthday, fatso.
