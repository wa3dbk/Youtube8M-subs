[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.047 --> 00:00:04.130
Welcome to Tekzilla Bites.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.389
Feed your tech hunger fast.

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:06.180
I'm Patrick Norton.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.763
If you've been
wondering what's bigger

00:00:07.763 --> 00:00:10.460
than a Samsung Note 4,
faster than an iPhone 5s,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.726
prettier than an Xperia Z3, and
hey, probably packs more memory

00:00:13.726 --> 00:00:16.059
and a better camera than darn
near every other cellphone

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.770
available, well,
you'll probably be

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.450
thinking about the iPhone
6 and the iPhone 6 Plus.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.630
Want the 30 second review?

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.900
All new design, 4.5 and 5.5
inch retina HD displays,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.290
an A8 processor, 802.11ac
Wi-Fi, improved eyesight camera,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.500
crazy HD video including 240
frames per second slow motion,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.600
a barometer, and iOS 8.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.220
Sound good?

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.200
Got some more time?

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.950
Let's talk.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.940
Any time you begin a
product launch with a line

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.410
like, "This day is an important
day in Apple's history,"

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.330
you know the hype machines
in Cupertino are set to kill.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.020
Though, hey, between the shiny
new Apple Watch, not iWatch,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.396
the Apple Pay, not iPay payment
system that includes some

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:53.978
of the biggest names in credit
cards and banking and, oh yeah,

00:00:53.978 --> 00:00:56.620
two new iPhones with all new
designs, bigger HD displays,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.332
a new A8 processer,
802.11ac Wi-Fi,

00:00:58.332 --> 00:01:00.540
some major updates to the
eyesight cameras, and, hey,

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.170
iOS 8, you've got to
say, it's not all hype.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.500
Let's talk specs about
those new phones.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.130
New shape.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.707
Continuous, samless design.

00:01:07.707 --> 00:01:09.790
These are actually the
thinnest iPhones ever made.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.770
The 6 is 6.9 millimeters.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.166
The 6 Plus is 7.1
millimeters thin.

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.665
And, of course, the
new A8 processor

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:17.370
is the fastest
Apple's ever made,

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.980
and the coolest and
the most awesome.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.700
Though quite frankly,
the gaming demos

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460
looked pretty freaking awesome.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.320
One disappointment.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.870
I really wanted a sapphire
screen on the new iPhone,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.440
but I'll just have to settle
with an ion strengthened

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.110
screen.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.340
4.7 inches on the iPhone 6,
5.5 inches on the 6 Plus.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.990
I am stoked that the
iPhone is finally

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.917
getting to Android
screen size territory,

00:01:35.917 --> 00:01:38.250
and kind of surprised to see
that the 6 Plus is actually

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.230
going to be larger
than Samsung's Note 4.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.100
I mean, basically, a G3 is
pretty similar to the Note 4.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.900
This is an iPhone,
this is a Note.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.900
This is a huge
difference in size.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.060
The 5.5 inch screen,
1080p, while the 6

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.930
gets a screen that's,
quote, "more than 720p."

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.370
It's 1334 by 750
pixels, which is

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.120
an eye pleasing 326
pixels per inch.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.340
There's a new landscape
view for the iPhone 6 Plus

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.970
that includes the home screen.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.180
Finally.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.790
I am seriously
disappointed that it

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.250
seems to be 6 Plus only
and not on all the iOS 8

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.610
compatible phones.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.860
Apple says the 6 gets faster
LTE than an iPhone 5S,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.630
more LTE bands than any other
smartphone for better roaming

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.670
around the world.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.620
200 LTE carriers, including
all three in China.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.769
LTE is nice, but I'm more
stoked about 802.11ac being

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:23.310
in the phone.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.380
Up to three times faster
than the iPhone 5s,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.597
150 megabits per
second, thank goodness.

00:02:27.597 --> 00:02:28.680
And something interesting.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.677
Wi-Fi calling for when
cell coverage sucks.

00:02:30.677 --> 00:02:32.760
It's a good idea, but you
know what I really want?

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.370
A freaking lightning
cable that's

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.500
running at USB 3.0
or lightning speed.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.170
Is that too much to ask for?

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.128
I'm a weather geek and
I play in the mountains,

00:02:40.128 --> 00:02:42.470
so I love that the iPhone 6
and 6 Plus have a barometer.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.920
But the real prize is
the eyesight camera

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.830
in the iPhone 6.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.800
Major updates.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.190
8 megapixel eyesight camera, 1.5
micron pixels, f/2.2 aperture,

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.780
and an all new sensor.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.360
Focus pixels, quote, "previously
found only in professional DSLR

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.870
cameras," determine
focus direction

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.320
and how far to move the lens.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.937
The idea's faster
and better focus.

00:03:00.937 --> 00:03:03.270
There's also next gen vocal
tone mapping, advanced noise

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.270
reduction, and the end
result is that the photos

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.200
they show in the
presentation look gorgeous.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.870
Of course, professional
photographers

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.320
like National Geographic
level are taking many of them,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.360
but I've got to say, the macro
shot of the butterfly, amazing.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.900
Of course, the A8 has a built
in image signal processor.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.890
The ISB helps with both shaky
hands and low light, which

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.930
means if you like
taking, well, birthday

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.170
pictures with the candlelight
or pictures in a barn,

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.330
you're good to go.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.800
Apple also says they've improved
face detection both near

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.350
and far.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.725
There's a cool
burst mode that'll

00:03:29.725 --> 00:03:32.980
detect smiles and blinks to find
you the perfect group photo.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.670
Optical image
stabilization, which

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.140
again is great for low light.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.210
And since Apple likes to be
cocky, they say hey, quote,

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.220
the iPhone replaced the
point and shoot camera.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.771
Next up, the video camera.

00:03:42.771 --> 00:03:44.270
So, there's a new
Apple design video

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.260
encoder inside the iPhone 6.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.390
Slow mo at 120 frames per
second or 240 frames per second.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.130
Cinematic video stabilization.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.440
I'm kind of curious to
see that one in real life.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.900
Quote, continuous autofocus
shot on the iPhone 6.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.687
Thanks to the focus
pixels, focus changes

00:03:58.687 --> 00:04:00.270
are automatic and
almost undetectable.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.710
Again, I'll believe
it when I see it.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.002
Apple also took some time
with the face time HD camera,

00:04:05.002 --> 00:04:07.126
the one that faces you when
you look at the screen.

00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:07.890
An all new sensor.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.840
f/2.2 aperture.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.762
They say it let's in
over 80% more light.

00:04:10.762 --> 00:04:12.470
That's going to make
for some nice video.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.280
Burst selfies, single
shot HDR photos.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.250
Pretty amazing.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.860
So, how much is the new iPhone
6 and 6 Plus going to cost?

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.649
There are 16
gigabyte, 64 gigabyte,

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.420
and 128 gigabyte versions.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.940
Awesome.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.760
The iPhone six starts at $199
for 16 gigabytes with a two

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.520
year contract.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.360
Then jumps to $299 and $399.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.420
The iPhone 6 Plus, the big
one, starts at $299 for 16 gigs

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.490
with a two year contract,
then goes to $399 and $499.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.440
We're looking at
like $650 and $850

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.770
off contract with T-Mobile.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.370
Both are gold,
silver, space gray.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.430
The iPhone 5s is
now starting at $99.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.377
The iPhone 5c is free.

00:04:46.377 --> 00:04:47.210
Getting all excited?

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.626
Got your hand on
your credit card?

00:04:48.626 --> 00:04:51.130
Pre-orders for the iPhone
6s start September 12.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.220
They're supposed to ship
September 19th, 2014 in the US,

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.360
Canada, UK, France,
Germany, Australia, Hong

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.520
Kong, Singapore, Japan.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.686
Of course, the Apple stores
will have them then too.

00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:01.840
And iOS 8 free download
September 17th,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.860
at least for the iPhone 4S,
5, 5C, 5S, iPod Touch 5th Gen,

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.380
iPad 2, iPad with
Retina Display,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.040
iPad Air, iPad Mini, the
Mini with Retina Display,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.300
and mostly when you look at
the new apps inside of iOS8,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.290
the health app is good.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.790
I really like the
idea that families

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.950
will be able to share
applications and content

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:18.490
they own.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.910
You also get a pretty cool
predictive keyboard in iOS 8

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:21.650
called Quicktype.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.691
It's going to like, learn
your conversation style

00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:24.970
and help you answer fast.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.462
The health app
looks really cool.

00:05:26.462 --> 00:05:28.420
Notification extensions
for your favorite apps,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.934
and a whole bunch more
little bits and pieces.

00:05:30.934 --> 00:05:33.350
Hey, ever wanna learn how to
cut up your own applications?

there's thousands of different
subjects you can learn

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.660
at lynda.com/tekzilla.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.300
It's a great place to start.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.530
Videos you can access
online any place,

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.320
any time at your own pace.

Check it out,
lynda.com/tekzilla.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.690
Oh, and before I forget,
one last thing to talk

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.940
about with the
iPhone 6, Apple Pay.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.610
Tim Cook says, we've
placed a lot of energy

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.140
into creating an entirely
new payment solution.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.540
What he means is
that Apple wants

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.490
to replace credit
cards with the iPhone.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.530
That's why the new iPhone has
the NFC technology that Apple's

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.770
been mocking on Android
phones for years.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:10.880
It's pretty simple.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.050
You add a card from your iTunes
account or take a picture of it

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.130
in the Apple Pay.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.230
Apple says when you
add a card to Passbook,

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.730
its number is never
stored or shared

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.330
to your device or
Apple's servers.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.270
You get your phone by
the contactless payment

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.895
thingy in 220,000
merchant locations,

00:06:23.895 --> 00:06:27.280
and you pay with, quote, the
simple touch of your finger

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.192
using Touch ID.

00:06:28.192 --> 00:06:30.400
There's a couple good things
going on with Apple Pay.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.816
I like that each transaction
is authorized with a one time

00:06:32.816 --> 00:06:33.410
unique number.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.327
That makes it harder to
skim numbers and scan.

00:06:35.327 --> 00:06:36.785
The person behind
the counter can't

00:06:36.785 --> 00:06:38.870
see your name, your
credit card, or your code.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.770
And best of all,
Apple's got this working

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.690
with Visa, MasterCard,
American Express,

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.510
quote the bank issuers that
handle 83% of the credit card

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.380
purchase volume.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.590
That's a pretty good list.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.250
I just wish it wasn't
launching a week

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.630
after the privately
stored images in iCloud

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.160
got exposed on the interwebs.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.570
Hey, I went there.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.090
I also went to town on Amazon
finally bringing Instant Video

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.170
to Android devices that
aren't called Fire,

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.590
and of course if you
subscribe at tekzilla.com

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.570
youtube.com/tekzilla, you'll
probably see us having some

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.740
serious doubts about the first
generation of the Apple Watch.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.440
Tweet @tekzilla, comment down
below, and have a great day.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.070
Thanks so much for watching
this episode of Tekzilla Bites.
