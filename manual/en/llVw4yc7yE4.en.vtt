ART SMITH: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.410
I'm Chef Art Smith, and we're
at the Chicago Green City

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.770
Market where everything's local
and fresh and delicious.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:10.490
I'm here with a family.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.230
And we're going to go home,
and we're going to cook a

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.010
wonderful, delicious, easy
meal for all of us.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.433
Hi.

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:16.280
What's going on?

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.830
How are you?

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.630
Good to see--

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.190
these are my neighbors.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.430
And speaking of neighbors,
I brought my good

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.185
friend Lee Anne Wong.

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:23.250
[? Ebu. ?]

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.510
Marianne, always good
to see you.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.950
MARIANNE: Good to see you too.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.780
ART SMITH: Good to see you.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.940
So what are you guys
doing here?

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.900
MARIANNE: We're here to
try to shop to try to

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.220
make a healthy meal.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.390
ART SMITH: Well, you're
at the best place.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.020
MARIANNE: Yes.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.000
They have like fresh food.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.710
ART SMITH: So I'm excited.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.765
So let's go and explore
the market.

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:40.015
MARIANNE: OK, let's go.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.910
ART SMITH: What's wonderful
about fruit when it's very

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.860
fresh and very local is it's
nice and crisp and you see the

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.900
sheen of the skin, but what's
important is the crunch.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.760
MARIANNE: We're going to
shop for tomatoes.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.164
ART SMITH: Isn't that nice?

00:01:01.164 --> 00:01:03.040
It smells so good.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.019
When it fresh, there's nothing
better than this.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.262
It's really amazing.

00:01:06.262 --> 00:01:10.135
MARIANNE: This is onions, too.

00:01:10.135 --> 00:01:12.210
ART SMITH: What's unique
about everything here

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.200
is it's all in season.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.480
And this is fresh garlic.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.720
Smell it.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.550
See how it smells like garlic?

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.580
Abraham, [? can you ?]
smell it?

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.610
I see some cucumbers
over there.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.070
I think they look really
delicious.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.740
Let's go find some herbs.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.590
OK, perfect.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.890
LEE ANNE WONG: I have
vegetables now.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.420
ART SMITH: OK, guys.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.470
I think we've got everything.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.960
Lee Anne, we got our basil.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.180
LEE ANNE WONG: We're
ready to cook.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.450
ART SMITH: Tomatoes.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.130
We've got all our great
stuff and everything.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.980
It's time to go cook.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.137
MARIANNE: Let's go cooking.

00:01:38.137 --> 00:01:38.614
ART SMITH: Exactly.

00:01:38.614 --> 00:01:39.864
Let's go.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.240
[? Ebu, ?] look at this.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.410
Now tell me about this
chicken, Marianne.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.220
MARIANNE: We're going to
marinate it with garlic, Dijon

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.790
mustard, salt, and
lemon juice.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.500
ART SMITH: Lemon juice?

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.690
MARIANNE: Garlic on the inside
so when you grill it all the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.515
flavor going to be
on the chicken.

00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:01.720
ART SMITH: OK, Lee Anne,
you want to put our

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.415
chicken over there.

00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:04.090
Skin side down first,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.962
LEE ANNE WONG: That way it
gets nice and crispy.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.970
ART SMITH: Your mom's grilled
chicken is going

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.222
to make four meals.

00:02:13.222 --> 00:02:14.650
Beautiful.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.890
That's amazing.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.750
I want to show you how to make
a wonderful, wonderful salad

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.600
with this chicken.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.970
So tear the greens for me.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.280
Perfect.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.510
OK, y'all got that going.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.730
What can we get Dad
to do over here?

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.100
LEE ANNE WONG: Just break
these in half.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.360
ART SMITH: Perfect.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.960
OK, I'll slice cucumbers.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.380
You guys are the architects.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.010
I want you to start arranging
it for the way you

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.550
think it'd be nice.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.160
MARIANNE: And we need space
for my chicken.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.510
ART SMITH: There you have it.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.330
A simple, delicious salad.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.250
OK, we're going to make
a perfect pasta.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.360
We start with just
a box of pasta.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.440
And this is a whole-grain
pasta, which

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.290
is better for you.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.320
We're going to put the
chicken in the pasta.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.005
I see tomatoes.

00:02:57.005 --> 00:02:59.210
You want to put those
in a bowl for me?

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.500
Beautiful.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.300
What about our broccoli?

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.590
Want to add that?

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.450
Oh my goodness gracious.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.130
And then we just toss it.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.200
So what we're going to
now is make our soup.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.620
We've added the bones of that
grilled chicken with some

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.790
water and onions and garlic
and some carrots.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.730
When you add the fresh
vegetables, they give that

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.460
broth that wonderful flavor.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.390
So what we're going to do now
is just take the bones out.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.170
It'll really taste delicious.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.090
And what's great about this dish
is that that one chicken

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.990
made four meals.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.360
Food just doesn't taste good
unless you share it, and

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.945
sharing it together and cooking
together makes life so

00:03:38.945 --> 00:03:40.310
very special.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.440
We all want to take good care
of each other and feed each

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.010
other wholesome, healthy food.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.960
But most importantly, it's to
share your love and there's no

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.854
better way to share your
love than through food.

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:50.346
LEE ANNE WONG: Cheers.

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:52.955
ART SMITH: And may all our
lives stay full of fresh,

00:03:52.955 --> 00:03:54.090
delicious--

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.020
LEE ANNE WONG: Healthy,
happy eating.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.270
ART SMITH: Healthy,
happy eating.
