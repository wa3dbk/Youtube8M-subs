00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:07.152
- Boo boop.

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:10.294
Hello! My February
tomatoes are quite firm.

00:00:10.294 --> 00:00:12.527
Oh, yeah.

00:00:12.527 --> 00:00:14.404
Should I be measuring? Nah.

00:00:14.404 --> 00:00:17.848
I like you guys. This is a fun show.

00:00:17.848 --> 00:00:21.294
(mellow music)

00:00:21.294 --> 00:00:24.175
♫ Young man, you're a sensitive guy,

00:00:24.175 --> 00:00:27.669
♫ I said young man, well it's okay to cry,

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.127
♫ I said young man, it is better to have,

00:00:31.127 --> 00:00:35.477
♫ Complex e-mo-tions
than to kill somebody ♫

00:00:35.477 --> 00:00:36.536
Hey guys, this week on My Drunk Kitchen

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:37.694
we're discussing gender roles.

00:00:37.694 --> 00:00:39.783
And that tall order calls for a tall boy.

00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:43.995
Mmmm. We're going to be
making a macho gazpacho.

00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:46.342
Using this blender, this bowl of ice,

00:00:46.342 --> 00:00:49.910
And all of these ingredients
that I have to chop.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.858
Ah, man. Mmm.

00:00:52.858 --> 00:00:54.194
For those of you who don't know,

00:00:54.194 --> 00:00:58.216
a gazpacho is a cold,
vegetabley soup. (burps)

00:00:58.216 --> 00:01:01.973
Step one: Cut, core, and
quarter the tomatoes.

00:01:01.973 --> 00:01:03.937
Two ripe tomatoes. (hums)

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.547
Now for those of you My
Drunk Kitchen enthusiasts

00:01:07.547 --> 00:01:09.253
who are pointing out that
I'm using a sharp knife,

00:01:09.253 --> 00:01:12.243
it is only because my skills
have been proved exponentially.

00:01:12.243 --> 00:01:14.961
However, I do not condone
in any way shape or form

00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:17.397
the use of sharp objects
in drunk settings.

00:01:17.397 --> 00:01:19.575
Period. Fun fact. Don't be an idiot.

00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:22.392
Be yourself, but the smartest version.

00:01:22.392 --> 00:01:24.953
These quartered tomatoes
are much like something.

00:01:24.953 --> 00:01:26.404
It's like taking a young
boy and reshaping him

00:01:26.404 --> 00:01:29.348
into your image of what
a "man" means to be.

00:01:29.348 --> 00:01:31.174
With young men, you see
a higher dropout rate,

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:33.784
more prone to addiction,
more prone to violence,

00:01:33.784 --> 00:01:36.166
and more prone to suicide. That sucks!

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.666
Why could that be? I dunno.

00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.543
Maybe it's because we
tell half of our children

00:01:39.543 --> 00:01:41.125
that it's not okay to cry?

00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:43.028
That's so messed up!

00:01:43.028 --> 00:01:45.221
Ugh, ugh. (sound effects)

00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:48.675
Beautiful. Next add salt.

00:01:49.752 --> 00:01:53.201
It calls for a slightly
heaping tablespoon, so.

00:01:53.968 --> 00:01:56.575
You know, do this for a while.

00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:58.233
One small green bell pepper.

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:01.511
I have a green bell pepper,
and some small peppers.

00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:06.094
But not one small green pepper.

00:02:06.094 --> 00:02:07.288
So...

00:02:07.288 --> 00:02:11.113
(upbeat jazzy music)

00:02:11.113 --> 00:02:11.985
Another thing I want to say is that

00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:13.569
not only is it bad to encourage boys

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.166
to be emotionally repressive,
I also think it's sad

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:19.494
to discourage them from being
physically affectionate.

00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:20.865
I can't imagine what it'd be like not

00:02:20.865 --> 00:02:23.765
to be able to comfortably
hug, or touch, or embrace

00:02:23.765 --> 00:02:25.215
any of my friends because somebody would

00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:28.885
call me an offensive
slur, or say I'm being

00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:30.210
something that I'm not supposed to be.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.870
I mean, we're judging these kids

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.535
for wanting to hug each other?

00:02:33.535 --> 00:02:35.369
The next ingredient is
one medium cucumber.

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:39.245
I only have one large cucumber,
so I'm gonna cut it in half.

00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:41.300
(squeals)

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.253
In America, we have this weird, outdated,

00:02:43.253 --> 00:02:45.126
puritanical view of it, where it's like,

00:02:45.126 --> 00:02:47.572
"Whoa! You can't hug
your bro! That's so gay!"

00:02:47.572 --> 00:02:48.977
What's wrong with being gay again?

00:02:48.977 --> 00:02:51.497
Oh right, nothing. Etcetera.

00:02:51.497 --> 00:02:53.462
Unencucumbered!

00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:57.096
Next add onion, garlic.

00:02:57.096 --> 00:02:58.707
You're supposed to chop
the onion and the garlic,

00:02:58.707 --> 00:03:00.638
but, this is a Ninja.

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:02.753
Show me what you got.

00:03:04.506 --> 00:03:05.952
We'll see about that.

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:07.974
Three cups of tomato juice.

00:03:07.974 --> 00:03:09.511
Fun fact: I don't have tomato juice.

00:03:09.511 --> 00:03:12.659
But I do have leftover pasta sauce.

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:13.824
Same thing.

00:03:13.824 --> 00:03:17.647
(upbeat jazzy music)

00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:19.488
Shove it into it.

00:03:19.488 --> 00:03:21.662
Red wine vinegar.

00:03:21.662 --> 00:03:23.269
I love the taste of vinegar.

00:03:24.675 --> 00:03:27.352
(choking) Don't do that. Olive oil.

00:03:28.465 --> 00:03:31.898
I occurs to me just now that
I'm adding the ingredients

00:03:31.898 --> 00:03:35.965
in order of the way they're
listed on the paper,

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:38.521
and not at all reading the recipe.

00:03:38.521 --> 00:03:40.056
Could this be a problem?

00:03:40.056 --> 00:03:45.035
We'll find out, here on,
almost at the end of the video.

00:03:45.035 --> 00:03:46.883
Mint, parsley, ice cubes.

00:03:46.883 --> 00:03:48.459
Parsley.

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.315
We should give our young
men the same encouragement

00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:54.263
we give (burps) uh, nevermind.

00:03:54.263 --> 00:03:57.199
Sugar. Hot sauce.

00:03:59.767 --> 00:04:02.155
Add your ice to make sure
that it's nice and cool.

00:04:02.155 --> 00:04:06.250
Just like your temper in a hot situation.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.128
Ice, yes.

00:04:08.128 --> 00:04:10.545
(sound effects) Ow. Aw. Hmm.

00:04:10.545 --> 00:04:13.828
Now we blend it all
together, just like how

00:04:13.828 --> 00:04:16.296
we blend all of our opinions together

00:04:16.296 --> 00:04:19.460
when discussing hot topics, such as

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.749
masculinity, femininity, gender roles,

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:25.646
and whether or not toxic
masculinity exists.

00:04:25.646 --> 00:04:27.305
I know this is going to be a raving debate

00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:29.319
in the comments section,
and I encourage it.

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:30.852
I love that you guys
think about this stuff

00:04:30.852 --> 00:04:32.124
and care about this stuff.

00:04:32.124 --> 00:04:35.879
And frankly, that is cool.

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.380
Just like this gazpacho.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.380
(blender whirs)

00:04:42.392 --> 00:04:44.915
Now you pick it up.

00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:47.834
Oh my god. Pick up.

00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:53.253
I want to understand you.

00:04:53.253 --> 00:04:55.276
Part of my feels like
this is some sort of sign

00:04:55.276 --> 00:04:57.383
that I should not even try.

00:04:57.383 --> 00:04:59.120
But I'm going to ignore that part.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.345
(grunts)

00:05:01.345 --> 00:05:02.889
I can tell that you are really locked on

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.240
to something right now.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.470
(upbeat peppy music)

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.500
Nailed it!

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.450
Guys, look at this macho gazpacho we made.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.152
Mmm. Smells like freshly
blended vegetables.

00:05:15.152 --> 00:05:16.723
Tastes like...

00:05:16.723 --> 00:05:21.723
(upbeat peppy music)

00:05:24.547 --> 00:05:26.426
watery salsa?

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:27.192
Thank you so much for watching,

00:05:27.192 --> 00:05:29.540
subscribe to my channel if you want to.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.204

the internet in most places.

Check it out in the links below.

00:05:36.154 --> 00:05:37.889
Have a beautiful day,
I gotta clean this up,

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.565
and also probably drink more of this.

00:05:39.565 --> 00:05:40.459
It's not so bad.

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:42.841
Recipe's in the description
(kissing noises)

00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:43.470
Talk to you guys soon.
