00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.980
Have you ever suffered from boils?

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.360
Yes, then here's an info capsule.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.800
Boils are caused by deep bacterial infection of hair follicles. 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.720
They can occur on any part of the body that has hair follicles.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.820
They are usually harmless and tend to heal within a few weeks.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.740
Boils start as small, red, painful nodules 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.960
and gradually increase in size to haunt you.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.140
Some people are physiologically more susceptible to develop boils

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.620
because they tend to be staph carriers. 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.220
The bacteria cause boils when they enter the skin.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.060
Boils are generally not contagious

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.360
but the bacteria that cause boils certainly are.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.760
Moreover, people with diabetes, low immunity, poor hygiene, poor nutrition,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.220
or long-term illnesses are more prone to this problem.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.140
I will now tell you about some home remedies
 that will help cure boils naturally.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.700
For the first home remedy.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.180
Take some black seeds and boil them in some water.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.580
Grind them along with a little water to get a paste like this.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.440
And apply it on the affected area twice daily.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.100
The next home remedy to treat boils.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.300
Take about a handful of neem leaves.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.280
And grind them to form a paste like this.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.980
And apply it on the effected area.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.220
Alternately, you can also boil 15g neem leaves

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.740
in about 500 ml water until the quantity of water reduces to one-third.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.000
For this another home remedy that can be used to bring a boil to the head

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.600
and reduce inflammation and swelling

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.600
use a bread poultice.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.380
For this, you need to soak a bread

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.720
in hot milk or water

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.600
and apply it as a poultice on the effected area.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.100
Now some tips to help your boils heal faster.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.400
Soak your boil in warm water

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.440
or apply a hot pack to reduce the pain
 and help bring the puss to the surface. 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.760
Continue this even when the boil starts draining. 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.420
And make sure you wash the wound 2-3 times daily.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.100
You can also apply crushed garlic cloves or onion.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.760
Tea tree oil is another useful remedy but it takes time.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.480
And if your boils are accompanied
 by symptoms like fever and fatigue,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.020
do consult your doctor.
