00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.750
Here you go. Welcome to the Gracie and Mommy
Show. It's a lot hotter in the front yard

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.790
than it is in the back yard, and today we're
reviewing the Crayola Washable Neon Sidewalk

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.200
Paint. Yeah. Yay! We're gonna paint the sidewalk
neon. Yes. This is uncomfortable. Okay.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.710
Alright, so it's about, oh, I'd say a good
20 degrees hotter out in the front yard than

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.079
it is in the back yard. So this is gonna be
a fast review, but so this is - we played

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.910
with this at a number of toy shows this year,
and so you get this little paint roller tray,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.860
and you get 3 neon paints. You get a sort
of neon greeny yellow, a neon corally pink,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.140
and then a blue which let's face it, there
is no neon blue. There's never a neon blue.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.510
So I'm going to pour these into the trays,
and then we are going to make Crayola magic.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.969
Oh, it came out like poopy. I don't know if
anyone can see the blue poopy.

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:19.420
Neon yellow, and oh look, they had flip tops.
Oh. They had flip tops, maybe I wasn't supposed

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.270
to unscrew the top and make a big blue poop.
Maybe I was supposed to do this. Oh that's

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:36.979
better, it's more like a loose poopy. A loose
green poopy. And then over here I shall make

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:44.209
a loose coral poopy. Oooh. Oh that looks like
brains. Here you go, this is what this looks

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:52.950
like, very brain like. So now we have our
3 colors, and now we are going to paint - and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.749
we have neon sidewalk chalk too. Yes. So let
me scootch back.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:02.999
We have this beautiful piece of white sidewalk,
because do you all remember when our sewer

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:09.670
pipe collapsed in October? Yeah, and they
dug up our whole yard twice? Good times. Good

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.810
times. I have no idea if you can even hear
us. So yeah, we have a beautiful piece of

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:25.810
whiteness here to draw upon. Would you like
a roller or a brush Gracie? Brush. Okay.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:34.910
Wow, that's magical. It's so bright! It's
definitely magical. Are you just making a

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:43.239
puppet face? Maybe. Maybe. Can I use the roller?
Sure. Okay. I'm gonna hold my camera with

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:51.290
one hand, and with my other hand, I am going
to roll my roller through the brains, I mean

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.969
coral paint. Oooh, cool. Miss Robin is going
to do chalk. The sidewalk is quite warm. My

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:04.429
buttocks is quite warm as I sit here on the
sidewalk.

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:14.060
Okay, so this is what it looks like when you
roller. So I'm not sure - I'll make an M for

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:25.590
Mommy. There we go. I need more brain paint.
Need more brains! Alright. Needs more cowbell.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.710
Needs more brains. That's what the show does
need though, more brains. Need more smart

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:39.540
people. Need more smart people on the show.
I don't know if I can see where I'm drawing.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:47.090
I know, it's so bright out here I can't see
anything. I don't know if pink was the best

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:54.620
choice of color. I do like the roller. It's
very bright, like I don't know if the camera's

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.769
picking it up, but the colors are definitely
very vibrant.

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:05.180
I'm gonna mix colors, I'm gonna go into my
loose movement color here, cause I wanna see

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:13.290
what it looks like as sort of an outline to
my - oh, I made mustard. Yeah. Very attractive.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:20.870
But it is very bright, like it's definitely
very green. It would've been better if it

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.460
didn't have pink all over it already.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:36.290
It's so hot out here. So I think - oh, I just
went back into pink. I think this is cool,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:45.610
only if you have not experienced 10 days of
95+ degree heat, and you are sitting in full

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.890
sunlight on about an 85 degree piece of pavement.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:59.820
Can I use your roller? Yeah. Trying to do
it. I think that the Crayola Neon Paint Washable

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.850
Sidewalk - oh and this is washable by the
way, so when it rains, it will all go away.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:11.400
All our beautiful artwork will go away. But
it's very hot out. Very hot out right now.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.520
I think we need to go back inside and do inside
toys now. Yeah that was enough outdoor fun.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.890
Okay, raise your hand if you wanna do inside
toys. Yay! Gracie, where can they find us

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.620
on social media if we don't die out here?
Facebook, Instagram, Periscope, and Twitter.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.600
Follow us those places, don't be a hater.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:37.440
Ooh that's a lot of pink. That's a lot of
brains. Thank you so much for watching, please

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:48.040
