Hello ladies and gentlemen boys and girls Im going to be doing a tutorial on an nail art

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.739
design that you can use for christmas
new year's any special occasion

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:15.709
i'm using Seche Clear

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.470
it's a clear base coat and you need a clear base coat to protect your nails

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.640
especially if you'r using darker nail polish in
my case I'm using petrol by sally

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.089
hansen complete salon manicure

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.300
then I am using a french white tip nail polish 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.360
# 134 by NYC you can use any white nail polish that you have

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.100
then I'm using kiss nail art paint and
that's just to correct any mistakes

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.350
then i'm going to be using scrap perfect
best glue ever 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.200
and that's only uh... to use with the
glitter if you don't have this then you

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.340
can use any base coat or top coat

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.740
and then i'm going to be using glitter

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.579
uh... and

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.800
you also going to need a brush

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.260
so thanks for watching and let's get started

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.510
okay so know what we going to do is start off  

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.720
by applying a base coat to our nail this will protect our nail uh... from the darker nail

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.440
polish that we're going to be applying

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.799
on our nails

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.020
so now after the nail polish sets in "dries"

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.939
we will be applying the

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.490
darker nail polish which

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.039
in my case it's going to be

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:29.350
the petrol

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.750
by sally hansen salon manicure 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.770
know that the base coat is dry

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.290
i'm going to be applying the darker nail

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.000
uh... polish 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.270
and i'm just going to be applying 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.680
one coat of this cause it has great
coverage anyway's 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.330
so then after this we're going to be
applying the french white tip

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.150
so after cleaning around my cuticles 
i'm going to be doing the white french 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.899
tip

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.710
now it's okay if you mess up you can get
a detailed brush and with the same

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.979
white nail polish you can fix around the edges but what i'm going to be doing is a second coat of

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.170
the white, know i'm going to be fixing around my edges with the kiss nail art paint

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.959
but if you do not have this you can use your regular white nail polish

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.529
and a liner brush to fix around the edges and then i'm going to be painting my tips 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.229
with the white nail polish and then afterwards i'm going to be applying 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:30.479
best glue ever but if you do not have best glue ever you can use a...   

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:35.739
base coat or top coat nail polish, all right so know with the best glue ever i'm  

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.319
going to be putting a little bit uh... on the piece of paper 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.589
with a flat brush i'm going to be applying to the white french tip

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:45.369
just very thinly 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:49.170
and i will know when its dry as soon as it gets tacky 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.500
know I purchased the best glue ever at amazon I don't know if any other craft stores 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.989
carry it

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.709
but you could check

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.019
and then afterwards after you done applying make sure you careful not to apply on the 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.309
darker nail polish because you'll get glitter on it, so know i'm going to be applying the   

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:06.469
glitter 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.439
on the french white tip were I put the
best glue ever, know if you not 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:16.180
used the best glue ever thats fine if you used the base coat or top coat

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.099
even better so now after applying the
glitter on the french tip

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.559
i'm going to use a fan brush and just clean out the excess glitter

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:30.129
now i did forget to mention at the beginning ah...  

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.949
you are going to need a top coat and I did apply the top coat but not 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.209
on the glitter part only 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.369
on the dark nail polish and to seal of the edges

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:45.649
