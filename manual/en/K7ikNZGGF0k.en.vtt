00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.750
Well we've been waiting for another Civic
Type R. Well at last it's here.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.700
Well a concept is anyway.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:18.000
It previews what the road car will look like
when it arrives in about a year.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.499
The front features the bumper of the facelifted
civic -- which is also on show here -- but

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.599
there are some serious differences as it's
lower and longer.

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:36.660
There's also an aerodynamic fin in front of
each wheel and big intakes.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.090
Apparently these will make production.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:48.440
You have hider wheel arches to accommodated
the type R's wider track for improved handling

00:00:48.440 --> 00:01:10.119
and this concept is running on 20inch allows
which are likely to be an option.

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:17.210
The most dramatic angle of the Type-R is the
rear.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:27.640
There are quad exhausts a double diffuser
and an dramatic fin.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.009
Honda clearly aren't going for the subtle
approach with this car -- they want to stand

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.210
out from the crowd.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.500
This concept was designed in Swindon, the
road car is being done in Japan, but apparently

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.920
the two teams have been working closely.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.689
The production car will get a turbo engine
with over 280 horsepower and will be offered

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:57.420
in a normal and a more hardcore version.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:11.909
There is even a chance there will be a Tourer
Type R to mimic Honda's BTCC racecar.
