00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.450
Pretty much the first thing you want to do
when you arrive to the area you’re going

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.420
to ride at, is you want to make sure that
your bike is safe to ride. The most fundamental

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.380
thing is to make sure that your wheels are
properly installed, the brakes are all lined

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.661
up, enough air pressure and all that other
sort of stuff. I think, one thing that I’ve

00:00:19.661 --> 00:00:23.810
seen so many times with all sorts of people
riding bikes is that they don’t know how

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.110
to properly install or remove a wheel. So,
your wheels held on by what’s called a quick

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.780
release lever, so it’s a, there’s a little
cam, right in there, you can just see it’s

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.710
just profiled that keeps the wheel on. So
it’s not a wing knot, you don’t just turn

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.210
it, turn it, turn it, until it, until it gets
tight because that doesn’t actually hold

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.089
it as tightly or securely as your quick release
so you know, got my closed quick release,

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.539
I open it, undo it a little bit to clear these
little tabs that prevent your wheel from falling

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.570
out if you somehow forget to close things,
so my wheel’s off, so it makes it way easier

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.140
to transport, but you need to know how to
take the wheel off to change a flat tire,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.500
stuff like that. So, to install my wheel make
sure that your disc brake rotor lines up with

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.079
your disc brake, if you put it on backwards
it’s not going to be very safe, so drop

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:21.320
it down, make sure it clears in there with
the disc pads, you want to rotate your quick

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.081
release until you start to get some clamping
force and you want to have your quick release

00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:29.460
tight enough so that it takes the palm of
your hand to close. If you can just close

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.210
it with your fingers, it’ll be a little
bit too loose. So that’s the front wheel,

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.240
rear wheel, pretty much the same thing, little
bit more complicated because you’ve got

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.990
to deal with the chain and all that other
sort of stuff. So what you want to do is you

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.219
want to shift your bike into the smallest
or largest cog, just to know where everything

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:57.570
is to start off with, then you undo your quick
release lever, push down, pull the derailer

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.070
out of the way and your wheel’s off. So
same thing, you’ve got your gears here,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.810
you’ve got a quick release lever, and you
have to remember what gear you took the bike

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.360
off in, the chain off in, needs to be the
gear that you put it back on in, or you can

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.220
shift, the heat of the moment, you pull it
off, some other gear, just go over to your

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:27.670
shifter, shift it down, slot it in, remember
to put the chain over the cogs, because it

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.360
won’t work otherwise push things up and
back. Make sure you get the disc brake lined

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.120
up, sometimes it’s easier to do this if
you have the bike flipped over. In this case

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.270
it might not be, so we’re in sort of push
down on the wheel to make sure everything

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:56.170
fully seated, close up the quick release lever
and boom, your wheels are off and on.
