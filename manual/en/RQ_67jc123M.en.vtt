[â™«] 

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:15.163
Hi, this is Tara Reed, and I want to talk to you about 

00:00:15.163 --> 00:00:18.553
my Art Licensing Mindset Audio Postcard Series. 

00:00:18.553 --> 00:00:21.525
You may have never heard of an audio postcard series, 

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:22.823
so I'll explain to you what it is. 

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:26.169
Basically, once a week for the next 24 weeks, 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.862
if you choose to sign up for the series, 

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.578
you will receive an Email in your Inbox; that will then link you to

00:00:32.578 --> 00:00:38.336
a postcard page online where you can listen to a three-to-five minute conversation 

00:00:38.336 --> 00:00:43.010
with ideas, and a few things to do during 
 that week to get you familiar 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.952
and comfortable with the different skills that you need, 

00:00:45.952 --> 00:00:48.715
and mindsets that you need to succeed in licensing your art. 

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:54.033
I start with Week 1 where I talk about a snow globe analogy, 

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:56.423
and I came up with this the last 
 time I was in New York. 

00:00:56.423 --> 00:01:00.581
If you're ever in New York you'll see 
 tons and tons of souvenir shops 

00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:03.274
and these cute little snow globes just caught my eye and I noticed 

00:01:03.274 --> 00:01:05.364
that they made them in all different sizes. 

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:08.708
Often people talk about your comfort zone as a box. 

00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:12.372
Stepping outside of the box means try something new, 

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:17.624
and I think that a snow globe is a great 
 analogy for a comfort zone as well. 

00:01:17.624 --> 00:01:22.593
So, if at Week 1, this is your 
 comfort zone with art and art licensing,

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:24.962
you're inside this nice, protective bubble, 

00:01:24.962 --> 00:01:28.055
and all the skills and information that you're comfortable with 

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:30.627
are floating around like the snowflakes inside, 

00:01:30.627 --> 00:01:32.903
and everything that you don't know how to do, 

00:01:32.903 --> 00:01:35.162
or that makes you uncomfortable or you're unsure of, 

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:39.132
is outside, but you're nice and protected, so 

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:41.910
for the next 22 weeks, I'll talk to you about everything 

00:01:41.912 --> 00:01:45.670
from dealing with deadlines, to negotiating contracts, 

00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:48.670
to talking to manufacturers, learning and new skills, 

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:51.910
and my goal is that at the end of the 24 weeks, 

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:55.700
when you go back and you assess what you're comfortable with 

00:01:55.705 --> 00:01:56.880
and what you're not comfortable with, 

00:01:56.884 --> 00:01:59.650
you won't have your starting snow globe anymore, 

00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:02.300
but instead your comfort zone will have expanded 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.160
and you'll have more skills inside.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.830
