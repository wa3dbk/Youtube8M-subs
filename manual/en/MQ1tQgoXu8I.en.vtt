00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:04.449
Hi.

00:00:04.449 --> 00:00:05.449
Iím Antonio, and today weíre going to be
talking about menís dress shirts.

00:00:05.449 --> 00:00:09.110
In particular, weíre going to be talking
about menís dress shirt fabrics.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.769
All right.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.870
This is brought to you by Real Men Real Style.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.530
below and most of our videos and this is just
more solid contents so that you can learn

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.130
and dress sharp.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.570
All right.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.570
Dress shirt fabrics.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.510
So letís jump into this.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.210
Solid, the most common fabrics on the planet.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.909
And as you can see here, Iíve got white top
left tan corner, dark blue top right, light

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.710
blue bottom right, lavender over here bottom
left.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.100
Solid fabrics are what youíre going to see
on most dress shirts and thereís a reason

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.249
for that.

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:26.189
Solid fabrics are incredibly easy to match
and they are the most formal.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.399
So a white shirt incredibly versatile; you
can wear that with a black tie if itís the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.509
right style or you can wear that with a pair
of jeans.

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.909
So, very wide range of clothing that can be
with it.

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.130
In addition, they can match almost anything
so this light blue over here in the bottom

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.909
right hand corner, this will go with the charcoal
gray suit, this will go with a pair of raw

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:47.909
denim.

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.709
This will go with ñ how you could wear it
with even a pair of shorts assuming that you

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:54.070
got the style right.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.810
Now, once we start getting into darker, solid
colors, the formality of the shirt falls.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:07.079
So, dark maroons, this dark blue, all of a
sudden, the shirt is no longer as versatile.

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.500
It becomes more of a casual wear color.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.760
Lavender, this is something ñ itís really
underutilized and I put it there because it

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.550
is a great choice and one that because of
its light shade, itís still a very versatile

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.550
fabric.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.140
All right.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.709
Semi-solid, the most underutilized fabrics
in a manís wardrobe if you even have them.

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.670
And youíll see weíve got a couple herringbones
here.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.459
Iíve got herringbone I put to the left over
ñ actually two herringbones in the left.

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.019
Now, over here to the right, weíve got a
more complicated pattern, itís a Glen Check.

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.980
And this is something ñ what I love about
this semi-solid is from a distance, theyíre

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.980
going to look solid.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.110
And so they have the same versatility of the
solids but when you get up close, you can

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.989
see the pattern, this white here in the bottom
right hand corner.

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.579
Most of you wonít be able to see that it
does have a check pattern and unless youíre

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.980
viewing this in HQ, you probably donít actually
see that.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.350
So, going from semi-solid to now stripe patterns.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.709
So this is very clear that there is a pattern
to this.

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.489
Now, the vertical stripe as it ñ and you
donít see them going because the reason you

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.709
see a vertical striped often on a shirt is
it gives the illusion of slimming the figure.

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.879
So, this shirt if itís cut right and if it
fits a man well, will usually make a man look

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:27.879
a bit thinner.

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.860
In addition, it helps the color bleed into
the trousers and why thatís important because

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.170
it gives you a monochromatic look.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.230
So, these two bottom blue shirts, you could
easily wear these with a nice pair of blue

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.269
jeans, some raw denim or a pair of dark slacks
and itís going to look good.

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.860
If you wear this one over here on the top
left, it will still look fine but theyíll

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.719
be more contrast between the top and the bottom
because white is the dominant color up here.

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:01.030
But the great thing about white being the
dominant color up here on this top left hand

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.620
corner when itís going to be a bit more versatile.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.310
You could actually wear this shirt in a business
setting.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.379
This bottom two, you could but theyíre going
to be more casual.

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.770
Now, over here to the top right, this gets
a bit more complicated.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.930
So if you look at the shirt, itís got actually
five colors in it.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.540
So weíve got the light blue, a medium blue,
weíve got a very dark blue and then weíve

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.270
got ñ looks like an oranges ñ orange brown.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.420
And look at the difference, weíve got thin
stripes, weíve got wider blue stripes and

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.910
weíve got a complicated pattern actually
in the white in which we see a very ñ looks

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.590
like a honeycomb weave.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.850
So, because of the complexity of this fabric,
I wouldnít be hesitant if youíre in finance

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.200
in New York to wear the shirt.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.701
However, if youíre working over at Google,
youíre working over down, you know, at a

00:04:47.701 --> 00:04:52.130
ñ in a creative field down Los Angeles, youíre
down in Austin, Texas.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.550
This would be a great fabric to pull off in
any but the most formal vacations.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.720
Itís really going to standout and be a unique
pattern.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.200
Check patterns, these are the least formal
of all of the patterns that weíve talked

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.200
about.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.310
Over here to the top right, this, you know,
would be something that you could wear in

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.310
a business environment.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.670
Itís simple, only two colors, white dominates.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.500
Bottom left hand corner, we can see that the
blue dominates.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.060
And these two bottom fabrics would actually
be fine to wear.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.000
If youíre going to be wearing the shirt by
itself without a jacket.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.540
Over here to the top right, unless youíre
wearing a light pair of trousers, youíre

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.020
going to have too much contrast and itís
going to look best with the jacket.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.370
Over here to the left, because we introduce
the color red, all of a sudden this becomes

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:44.060
a bit less formal and ñ because mix with
the complexity of the pattern, Iím going

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.720
to say that this one is ñyou wouldnít really
want to wear this with a suit.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.520
You could if youíre not wearing a tie with
it and if youíre in a very informal environment

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.320
or well, I think overall, this would actually
look great, again, with just a pair of trousers.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.620
And the reason being is because of that red,
itís going to be a fabric that you donít

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.620
see very often.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.610
Itís going to help you standout.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.130
Quickly, letís talk about weaves.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.070
And so imagine these are individual yarns
in a fabric.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.160
If you go north and south, thatís the warp,
up and down.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.210
Across from left to right, we see the left.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.330
And the ñ how these are woven together depends
on not only the strength of the fabric but

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.930
usually some of the patterns weíve seen as
well.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.900
So, these are the four most common shirt fabrics.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.490
Actually, I take that back ñ the pile weave
you rarely ever see in the shirt fabric but

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.970
the twill, the satin and the plane particularly
the twill and the plane theyíre going to

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.330
be a 90% of dress shirts.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.140
The plane is something you see ñ you see
all the time, very simple.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.160
As you can see the warp goes right over the
left, one two, one two.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.810
The twill is a bit more complicated and whatís
interesting about the twill is you actually

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.410
get a denser weave.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.310
Now the twill if you remember, thatís going
to be herringbone fabrics and it does create

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.970
a very unique pattern.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.360
I really like twills because theyíre usually
stronger; theyíre a little bit more heavy

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.360
weight.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.280
Satin ñ now, this is where youíre going
to get a bit of a shine.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.830
As you can see the warp in the left, thereís
not a one two, there is a jumps over four

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.810
different yarns here.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.800
And this is going to give you a bit of shine
in the fabric.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.670
Now, quickly the pile weave, this is going
to give a fabric kind of a three dimensional

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.350
feel, a very textured, heavy feel.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:36.270
So, if you think about a corduroy, thatís
an example of a pile weave.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.210
All right.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.780
Well, that is Menís Dress Shirt Fabrics in
a nutshell.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.090
This has been Antonio Centeno with Real Men
Real Style.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.380
I hope to see you at the work site.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.380
Take care.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:48.381
Bye-bye.
