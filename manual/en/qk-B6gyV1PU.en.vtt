Lalaloopsy Color Me Dolls Demonstration

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Hi, I’m Amber. Welcome to the Lalaloopsy Color Me tutorial.

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:11.000
Today we have a special guest visiting

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.000
she’s going to show you all of the fun activities that you can do with your Lalaloopsy Color Me dolls.

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:18.000
Let’s meet Kalea, our coloring expert and Lalaloopsy fan.

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.000
Hi!

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:25.000
So, Kalea, can you tell me a little bit about these two Lalaloopsy Color Me dolls?

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:30.000
Sure. This is Squiggles N Shapes. And this is Trace E. Doodles.

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:35.000
They’re so cute! What types of creative things do you like to do with them?

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.000
I love to color her and make cool patterns on her dress.

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:41.000
There are lots of other fun things you can do with her, too.

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.000
Can you show me what she comes with?   You get four super fun-colored markers.

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:48.000
Two stamps. And an eraser sponge.

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:52.000
And – you get your very own Lalaloopsy Pet!

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.000
Can you show us how to decorate her?

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:55.000
Sure!

00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:58.000
So, the first time you use the markers,

00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:01.000
you have to shake the marker for 30 seconds

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:05.000
and then press down until the color comes out.

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:08.000
Then you can color her wherever you want!

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.000
You can color her hair!

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.000
Or make fun patterns on her dress!

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:17.000
You can even make cool shapes on her face!

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:21.000
And you can color in her cheek!

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:26.000
I really love her shoes, so I start coloring there.

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:28.000
What can you do with the stamps?

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, I love the stamps!

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:36.000
First you color on the stamp with your marker, like this.

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:40.000
Then you can stamp fun shapes wherever you want.

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.000
Make sure to let the color dry!

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.000
So cute! What happens when you’re done?

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:48.000
Now you can play with her!

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:55.000
What if you wanted to do it again?

00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:59.000
No problem! The color erases easily with water.

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:03.000
You just wet the sponge and then wipe the color off.

00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:06.000
This way you can design again and again!

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:10.000
Hey Kalea, do you want to color her again?

00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:11.000
I sure do!

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:39.000
And those are the Lalaloopsy Color Me dolls. Thanks, Kalea!

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:40.000
You’re welcome.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
