Hi guys, its Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay
Tutor, and today’s Studio Tip, we’re talking

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.289
about keeping your Polymer clay clean.

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:17.039
Now, has this ever happened to you before,
you have a pristine block of White clay and

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.609
you cut off a piece, and you start rolling
it around your hands, trying to make something,

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:29.130
and you’re rolling it on your surface, and
within a few seconds, it’s covered in dirt

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.010
and lint and all kinds of little flecks and
stuff, and it’s really, really frustrating.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.860
So, I have several tips I’m gonna share
with you today that you can help to avoid

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.860
getting it dirty in the first place.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.350
First thing that you’re gonna wanna do is
watch what you’re wearing, now, all fluffy

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.590
scarves, sweaters that kind of stuff, don’t
wear it in the studio, get rid of it.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.970
Cats, dogs, I mean I know a lot of you guys
like to have your pets around you when you’re

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.140
working, don’t work with…don’t have
them in there when you are working with White

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.630
Polymer clay, get them out, get your area
nice and clean and then it should really help.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.420
Now, there’s a bunch of ways to get it clean,
sometimes, you know it looks pretty clean

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.290
here, I haven’t got a lot of stuff sitting
around, but you’d be surprised how much

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.020
dirt and lint and things are here.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.220
So the first thing you’re gonna wanna do
is get some baby wipes and wipe down your

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.730
whole area, make sure it’s nice and clean,
also, a great thing to do is to use something

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:41.180
like one of these sticky things…these sticky
roller…lint picker-uppers, just wipe your

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.890
whole…go around your whole surface, all
the areas where you’re working, and pick

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.260
up all the lint, and even just a few seconds
here and I’ve got lots of lint here.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:00.969
Also, make sure that your hands are super
clean, I’ve got hands with really, really

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:08.840
deep veins…or finger prints and little markings
and stuff on it, my hands will trap all kinds

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.850
of things in them, even when they seem clean,
I’ve washed them, what you can do is use

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.890
one of those nice sugar scrubs or something
and get them really, really clean.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.000
Another thing I like to do is roll a piece
of Translucent clay in my hands to just pick

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.670
up any little bits of dirt…this is after
I’ve scrubbed them and they are nice and

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.109
clean, it’ll just make sure that I’m not…

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.560
I haven’t got anything stuck to my hands.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.150
Also, once your hands are clean, don’t be
touching your jeans and stuff all the time,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.130
if I just quickly set this lint thing on my
jeans, you can see how much little tiny fibers

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.340
are on your clothing, so if you just try to
avoid touching your hands and then back to

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.290
the surface, that will really help.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.100
Of course, keep your pasta machine really
clean, your tools really clean, just try to

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.840
keep the area as clean as possible, in a future
video I’ll show you how to get rid of some

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.989
of that…if you have got it on your clay
pieces, but we’ll save that for another

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:12.989
day.

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.010
So I hope these tips were helpful for you,

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.340
you like this video or not.

And in the comments sections, make sure to
let me know if there’s something that is

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.200
a problem for you, if you’d like me to show
you a video on how to solve that, that would

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.010
be great, leave those in the comment section
below.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.290
