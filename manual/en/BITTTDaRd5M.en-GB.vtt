Hi Foodtubers, I'm Alex from French Guy Cooking

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.000
Today we are making delicious and super easy Mini Croissants

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Don't worry, it's just a cheat on the posh version

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.500
So we will make three different versions of it

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.000
Two savoury and one sweet

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 These mini croissants are perfect for snacking when you are watching the world cup

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The beauty of this recipe is that you can do everything in advance... and focus on the match

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.500
[Crowd Cheers]

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
First up, lets prepare some really simple fillings

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.600
The first one will be Italian inspired and so simple

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.000
Just a bit of pesto and a few slices of mozzarella

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.000
...and if you have fresh herbs, that would be really nice

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.500
Think of basil, parsley or mint for example

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.500
Of course you can use pre-made pesto

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.300
Gennaro might be mad at me for that

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I guess it's always good to butter him  a bit during the World Cup

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.000
Next filling is French inspired

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Mix a handful of grated Gruyère cheese or any melted cheese, with a bit of sour cream

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Grated nutmeg will add some proper attitude

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Set it aside with a few ham slices

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Last filling is all about sweetness

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Mix two or three tablespoons of room temperature chocolate spread, with a handful of grown hazelnuts

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and a sprinkle of cinnamon

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I know it's a bit weird, but bare with me

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.300
A tiny, tiny pinch of salt will make it even better

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.500
The fillings are ready, now let's get down to business with the mini croissant

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.000
Take a roll of pre made puff pastry and divide it into 16 equal parts

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
To do so, cut the roll into quarters and each quarter into four pieces, starting in the centre

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
If you don't have rolls but sheets of puff pastry, cut them into narrow triangles like so.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
At the end, each piece should look like a narrow triangle

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
To me it just looks like a pizza slice

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Place a slice...I mean...place a triangle in front of you with the narrow end pointing at you

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Place the Italian filling like so, spread some pesto and add a few bits of mozzarella on the wider edge

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Sprinkle with herbs and leave the narrow end clean, otherwise you won't be able to seal it properly

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and here's what is looks like with a French filling

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and now with the sweet filling. Remember not to overload it...less is better

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.500
and this is where the magic happens

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
To shape the croissant start at the wider end

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Stretch it a bit and gently roll it with your palms

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.500
... be careful not to crush it

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
now with the French filling...

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and finally with the sweet filling

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.000
Place them on the baking tray with some paper underneath

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.500
The tip of the croissant should be tucked under the role

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.500
Brush them with an egg wash

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Pop them in the pre-heated oven for about 15 minutes 200°C / 390°F or until golden brown.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.000

Look at these beauties!

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.500

I told you guys they are super easy to make

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.500
but the best is still coming up

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.500
because basically you can pimp them using any fillings you like

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
think of savoury like fresh cheese, dry tomatoes, cured ham

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.000
or sweet, like marmalade, coconut or honey

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.500
