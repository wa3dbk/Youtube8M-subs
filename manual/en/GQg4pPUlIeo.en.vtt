00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.009
On February 6th, Robocop will be back in Germany cinemas.

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.520
I am in Los Angeles and will be talking to the cast and crew

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.250
and Mr. Robocop himself.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.690
This, my friends, is the future of American justice.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.720
How many like Thomas Kane will pay for
their crimes,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.769
now that Robocop is here?

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.820
This movie, like the original one, takes
place in Detroit.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.500
Did you think about changing the setting?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.829
No, Robocop belongs to Detroit, no doubt
about it. They even considering building a

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:34.989
statue of Robocop in Detroit.

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.800
There's a big debate in the city whether they should or should not bring

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.600
- created a statue for Robocop. I hope they do!

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.300
Joel, you play two parts in this movie. You are Alex Murphy and Robocop.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.370
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.500
How are they the same and how are they
different?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.100
Well, he is Alex throughout the whole film

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.109
I mean that is the battle that is going on

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.690
with-in him - when he becomes Robocop

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.630
they insert artificial intelligence in his brain

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.240
and has a new body but he still feels
like himself

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.000
so that is sort of the battle that's
going on inside of him

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.600
 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.960
we put a man inside a machine

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.130
Michael, Raymond Sellars is not the typical villain, is he?

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.480
I don't think he's evil i think is
capable of doing

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.870
some bad things but I thinkhe thinks
the bigger than all that, he thinks

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.590
but with the future means and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.710
what mark he's gonna leave on the world
you know he's very manipulative

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.480
but he´s not, I don't think he
thinks he's doing a bad thing and he

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.660
thinks he's doing a good thing

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.230
and to some degree he is doing that, I think he is a complex guy, he is not

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.640
not one of the classic villains you see

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.280
in movies at all.
You wanted a man inside a machine

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.090
and that's what you've got but the human
element will always be present

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.520
You know it's like Frankenstein and the
monster you know,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.820
you're playing with a sort of a -

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.490
you are in God's workshop,

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.550
let's put it that way. You know

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.830
and should we be there should it just be

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.640
up to nature and the creator

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.840
your your tampering with something

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.500
that is devine, I think.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.650
 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.800
I´d put that guns down now if I were you.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.600
How do you think the americans would react if there was a Robocop out there right now.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.340
I don´t know. I think

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.540
I think a lot like people in the film
react. Some are

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.490
afraid and questioning if this is the
right way to go on

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.990
and a lot of people will be excited
think it was very cool and

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.900
maybe make them feel safe.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.800
How would you feel about it?

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:16.000
I dont know.
I think its a very interesting and dangerous idea.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.700
Consider the invasion of Iraq, right?

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.280
American pull out of Iraq, so did
Great Britain

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.630
because there was pressure home cause
american soldiers with dying

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.400
now what if that was being done by
robots only?

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.470
There were no soldiers there. Would it be that
pressure? I mean

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.510
it changes things. We have to
acknowledge that the use of drones

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.000
robots for war and law enforcement is a big change

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.060
 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.690
in the way humanity operates

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.130
and countries who have to have their own
legislations about it and the UN will

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.310
have to say what's

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.670
going to be a scepter or not and I
thought you know it's time to get that

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.670
 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:00.940
issues are really happening.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.150
This movie takes place in 2028.
Yes.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.910
Do you think our world could look like that?
Close.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.180
Not for the big things walking down

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.700
but you know we have robots now, they
work all the time for us.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.169
Drones, robots.
Does it scare you?

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.820
The future?

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.600
 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.780
Yes, it does.
It does. Doesn´t it you?

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.280
I don't love the idea you know giant machines

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.510
telling me what to do or controlling me

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.820
I´m not crazy about that idea.
I totally get that

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.800
thank you so much for the interview.
It was nice to meet you!

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.610
even know you can do it

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.130
but you got to draw a line somewhere

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.370
Is that boring enough for you?

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.340
I think it is interesting!
Funny I thought it was boring

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.590
