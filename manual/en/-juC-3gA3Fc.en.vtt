00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.049
As Muni Operators, you're here to serve the
customer.

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.920
That's the commitment you have to make in
order to sit behind the wheel.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.090
A Muni Operator's responsibility is first
and foremost for the safety and security of

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.090
their passengers.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.570
I tell my friends "you want to be a Muni Operator?

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.800
Be dependable, reliable and friendly."

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.750
Muni Operators have to follow a specific route
and a specific schedule.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.531
A lot of people depend on you being there
when you're supposed to be, and it's your

00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:38.079
job to make that happen.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.980
You'll be dealing with a lot of different
types of people.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.890
A friendly personality goes a long way.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.190
You're in charge of your bus and your passengers.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.629
At the end of the day it's a team effort,
but there's only one person behind the controls

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.719
when you're out there on the road.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.829
You become the face of Muni to that customer.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.090
People skills are important.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.950
As Muni Operators you have the responsibility
to put your best foot forward, not only for

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.250
your customers but for Muni as well.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.810
There are challenges to the job.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.200
There are challenges in any job.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.030
You may not work a 9 to 5 shift.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.280
We're out most hours of the day and night
serving customers.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.600
You'll drive nights and weekends.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.649
You could pull a holiday shift.

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.000
No two days are exactly alike.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.540
We wants you to succeed.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.710
And we'll train you extensively so you will
succeed.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.759
During your orientation, you'll get the hands-on
experience you'll need to handle pretty much

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.890
any situation.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.520
There are certain physical demands of the
job.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.609
You're going to have to help riders who may
need extra assistance,

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:56.030
and you'll have to do a comprehensive vehicle
inspection before you take your bus out.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.030
We're all about passenger service and safety.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.670
Yes, there's more to the job than just driving,
collecting fares and picking up passengers.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.330
The physical demands are there, but I don't
find them to be anything I can't handle.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.040
The city has one of the best compensation
packages anywhere.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.319
Our salaries and benefits are competitive
with any transit agency in the country.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.370
And there are plenty of opportunities for
career advancement at Muni.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.680
There's no limit to what you can do once you
become a Muni driver.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.350
It's like the city streets; there's a lot
of different paths you can travel, lots of

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.390
opportunity for growth.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.450
I wouldn't trade my job for anything.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.150
What it is is public service.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.030
That's what I do; I'm a public servant.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.700
And it makes me feel good at the end of the
day

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.290
to know that I've had an impact on my community.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.540
Taking Muni also helps cut down on traffic
congestion and air pollution, and that's a

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.110
good thing.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.870
Having one of the greenest fleets in the country
is something gives us a great deal of pride.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.810
We're not just getting people around, we're
helping protect the environment.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.439
