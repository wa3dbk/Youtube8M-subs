[ girls in crowd cheer ]

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.300
TheFNDC.com presents Drinks With Diablo:

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.500
The Jolly Rancher.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.000
Alright, welcome back.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is your host, Jöhnny Dîablø,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.888
with my guest, 

00:00:18.888 --> 00:00:20.000
Suzielicious.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
&gt;&gt; Suzielicious: Tee hee.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
&gt;&gt; Crowd: [ laughs ]

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.400
&gt;&gt; Dîablø: And today, we're making the Jolly Rancher.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.400
Now, this is a pretty simple drink.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.800
What you're going to need: 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.500
Sour Apple Pucker,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.200
green apple vodka,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.200
Midori, and a little bit of cranberry juice.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.600
Alright, we're going to make enough for two.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.900
If you want to just make enough for one drink,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.900
just cut it in half.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.800
We've got a shaker full of ice.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.900
One ounce each of 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.900
green apple vodka,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.900
so two ounces.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.900
Two ounces of Sour Apple Pucker.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100
And two ounces of Midori.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.500
&gt;&gt; Inferno: Mmmm.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.200
&gt;&gt; Inferno: I moaned, I'm sorry.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.200
&gt;&gt; Someone: [ laughs ] 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.200
&gt;&gt; Dîablø: Then to that, just add a couple splashes of cranberry juice.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.600
Okay.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.600
Then we're going to shake it up,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.500
and we're going to pour it out.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.500
&gt;&gt; Suzielicious: You could make a samba.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.000
&gt;&gt; Dîablø: We're almost out of ice.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Alright, let's see what we've got.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Oh, that look interesting.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
&gt;&gt; Cortney: [ laughs ]

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
&gt;&gt; Dîablø: I don't know what to tell you.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Alright,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Suzielicious, tell me how this tastes.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
&gt;&gt; Suzielicious: Awesome.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
&gt;&gt; Dîablø: It tastes like a Jolly Rancher?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
&gt;&gt; Suzielicious: It tastes just like a Jolly Rancher.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.200
&gt;&gt; Dîablø: It tastes like a sour apple Jolly Rancher to me!

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.200
