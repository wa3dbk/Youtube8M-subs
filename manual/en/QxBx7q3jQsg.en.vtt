00:00:00.055 --> 00:00:01.846
- Well hello everyone, my name is Tyler,

00:00:01.846 --> 00:00:03.172
and if you know anything about me,

00:00:03.172 --> 00:00:06.469
you know that I have the
absolute worst memory.

00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:09.209
I try to document my life as best as I can

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.312
in a couple different ways.

00:00:10.312 --> 00:00:12.088
First, I make videos here on YouTube.

00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:13.388
I've been doing it for five years,

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:16.093
but this past 2012 I
wanted to do something

00:00:16.093 --> 00:00:17.475
that was more day-to-day.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.516
So what I tried to do every
day for the entire year

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:22.675
of 2012 was to write down something

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:24.475
that I did each day.

00:00:24.475 --> 00:00:27.714
You can see it's kind of
filled out completely.

00:00:27.714 --> 00:00:29.387
It's like a little diary of everything

00:00:29.387 --> 00:00:31.151
that I did every day of the year.

00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:34.297
Let's look at some
highlights of 2012, shall we?

00:00:34.297 --> 00:00:36.235

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:38.128
January 21st I went to Olive Garden.

an adult slumber party and which somebody

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.414
stole my hair product.

00:01:13.414 --> 00:01:14.737
I made a video about it.

00:01:14.737 --> 00:01:16.328

00:01:16.328 --> 00:01:19.276

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.392

00:01:35.392 --> 00:01:38.109
August 21st Zane deleted his Twitter.

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.071
August 23rd Zane came back to Twitter.

00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:41.929

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:43.612

"They Did It Again" E!
Special that I talked about

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:05.310
in last week's video.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.469
November 7th I was on
the X Factor pre-show.

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.988

December 17th I went to my first

00:02:14.478 --> 00:02:16.659

December 19th I flew to New York City

00:02:18.377 --> 00:02:20.177
to see how Pepsi and Beyonce want us

to be a part of the intro for Beyonce's

00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:23.752
Super Bowl half-time special.

00:02:23.752 --> 00:02:25.191
If you don't know about that,

00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:26.249
it's in last week's video.

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:27.804
But, I will remind you again,

00:02:27.804 --> 00:02:29.570
you can click the link and the description

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.926
and see how you can be
a part of the intro.

00:02:31.926 --> 00:02:33.631
It's gonna be on national television.

00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:34.850
It'll be that awesome.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.685
I'm hopefully gonna be involved.

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:38.380
You're hopefully gonna be involved.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.393
It's gonna be amazing,

00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:40.709
so click the link of the description.

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.425
December 26th I saw Les Mis.

00:02:42.425 --> 00:02:44.179
December 28th I saw Les Mis.

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.116
Then December 31st I
celebrated the New Year

00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:49.798
with all of my best
friends in San Francisco.

00:02:49.798 --> 00:02:51.377
That's pretty much my year.

00:02:51.377 --> 00:02:54.360
So for 2013 I am going
to be documenting my life

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.204
just as much, if not
more, here on YouTube.

00:02:57.204 --> 00:02:58.562
I am going to be making videos,

00:02:58.562 --> 00:02:59.863
so be sure to subscribe.

00:02:59.863 --> 00:03:02.057
I am going to try to
make a video every week.

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:03.694
We'll see how that goes.

00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:06.179
You saw how last year
went, but I will try.

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:08.744
I am also going to be
answering a question a day

00:03:08.744 --> 00:03:10.265
with this Q&amp;A journal.

00:03:10.265 --> 00:03:11.798
I can't do a journal without prompts,

00:03:11.798 --> 00:03:13.620
and so every day it gives
you like a little prompt

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.838
and you write a little blurb for that day.

00:03:15.838 --> 00:03:17.858
Then you do it every day for five years

00:03:17.858 --> 00:03:20.598
so you can see how your
answers change for five years.

00:03:20.598 --> 00:03:22.350
What I'm gonna do with this, hopefully,

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.440
is I'm going to be putting up videos

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.961
on my second channel, which is

00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:27.923
Youtub.com/extratyler.

00:03:27.923 --> 00:03:31.081
Click right here to subscribe to that.

00:03:31.081 --> 00:03:33.322
It might not be every
day, but I am at least

00:03:33.322 --> 00:03:35.329
going to answer every question in a video.

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.862
Some days there might be two videos.

00:03:36.862 --> 00:03:38.081
Some day there might be zero videos.

00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:40.459
Hopefully every day there'll
be at least one video.

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:42.846
I am going to be answering
the questions super quick.

00:03:42.846 --> 00:03:44.011
It's not gonna be anything special.

00:03:44.011 --> 00:03:45.788
Not gonna be anything edited, maybe.

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:47.007
I don't know how it's gonna really work.

00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:48.828
You'll see if you subscribe.

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:52.190
Finally, I am going to continue doing

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.674
my calendar journal,
and this year I am going

00:03:54.674 --> 00:03:56.717
to use a calender that
one of you guys sent me.

00:03:56.717 --> 00:03:58.935
It is a chickens inspired
by chickens calendar.

00:03:58.935 --> 00:04:00.595
If you don't know what video this is from,

00:04:00.595 --> 00:04:02.116
I did a video a couple years ago

00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:03.393
that was all about chickens,

00:04:03.393 --> 00:04:05.309
which doesn't sound good, but trust me,

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:06.969
it's one of my favorites
that I've ever done.

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:08.396
So click here if you haven't seen that.

00:04:08.396 --> 00:04:10.555
Whoever sent me this sent
me this lovely letter.

00:04:10.555 --> 00:04:12.634
It was beautiful, but I
can't read your signature

00:04:12.634 --> 00:04:14.573
and your Twitter handle that you listed

00:04:14.573 --> 00:04:17.568
isn't on Twitter, so thank you.

00:04:17.568 --> 00:04:19.727
I just wanna say thank you,
I'm gonna use it all year.

00:04:19.727 --> 00:04:21.771
If you wanna use your
calender as a journal

00:04:21.771 --> 00:04:23.976
just like I did in 2012
and like I'm gonna do

00:04:23.976 --> 00:04:27.250
in 2013, I have just the calendar for you.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.630
Last year I did a little photo shoot,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.814
I think it was in November,

00:04:30.814 --> 00:04:34.390
for the Vlog brothers for
a Men of YouTube calendar.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.765
It was so awesome and I was so honored

00:04:36.765 --> 00:04:38.436
to be a part of it 'cause
it included so many

00:04:38.436 --> 00:04:40.510
amazing YouTubers that I look up to

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.792
like Charlie Sacule and Toby Turner,

00:04:42.792 --> 00:04:44.789
WheezyWaiter and the Vlog brothers,

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.809
and all these amazing guy YouTubers

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:48.213
that inspire me so much.

00:04:48.213 --> 00:04:50.396
If you want that calendar,
I think you should

00:04:50.396 --> 00:04:52.068
probably get it because
all of the proceeds

00:04:52.068 --> 00:04:53.675
go to charity.

00:04:54.183 --> 00:04:56.298
I am July, and I'm not gonna lie,

00:04:56.298 --> 00:04:58.394
it's a pretty amazing picture.

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:01.052
You've seen me model before.

00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:04.859
(camera snapping pictures)

00:05:06.443 --> 00:05:08.644
So obviously, I'm not gonna ruin it,

00:05:08.644 --> 00:05:10.908
I'm not gonna show you,
but I'm just gonna say,

00:05:10.908 --> 00:05:13.938
July has never looked this hot.

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:16.585
I think that is all I have
for you guys this week.

00:05:16.585 --> 00:05:18.739
I wanna know, comment below,

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:19.998
how do you keep track of your life?

00:05:19.998 --> 00:05:20.904
How do you document your life?

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.758
Do you vlog, do you blog,

00:05:22.758 --> 00:05:25.301
do you do the journal thing with calendar?

00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:27.948
Do you put little memories in a jar

00:05:27.948 --> 00:05:29.701
and then at the end of
the year you pick out

00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:31.500
all the memories to see
all you did that year?

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.310
I wanna know, comment below.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.424
Yes, like I said, I
think that's all I have

00:05:35.424 --> 00:05:36.311
for you guys this week.

00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:38.204
I will see you guys next week.

00:05:38.204 --> 00:05:41.083
Until then, have a fabulous life.

00:05:41.083 --> 00:05:43.010
I am actually about to head out the door.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.943
I am going to L.A. for the weekend.

00:05:45.466 --> 00:05:47.566
I will be back in San Francisco on,

00:05:47.566 --> 00:05:48.866
I think Tuesday.

00:05:48.866 --> 00:05:53.312
I have some big news coming so stay tuned.

00:05:53.312 --> 00:05:54.843
Yeah.
