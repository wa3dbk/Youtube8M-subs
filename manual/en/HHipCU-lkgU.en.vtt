00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.100
[Intro music]

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.290
Aioli is a sort of Provencal mayonnaise 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.000
made of olive oil and garlic. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.100
In French ai means garlic and oli is the Provencal word for oil.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.060
To make it the traditional way 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.100
you need to use a mortar and pestle. 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.240
Grinding the garlic will bring out flavors that no mixer 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.010
will be able to achieve. 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.290
The authentic aioli differs from regular garlic mayonnaise 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:40.000
in three aspects: it's consistency is thinner, it is paler 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.030
and the taste is sharper. 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.020
A pure delight to garlic lovers. 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.030
To make the aioli sauce you will need an egg yolk, 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.240
garlic peeled and germ removed, seasoning salt and 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.020
freshly ground peppercorn, olive oil, Dijon mustard 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.020
this is optional and finally you need a mortar and a pestle.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.040
Place the garlic and salt in the mortar. 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.060
And using the pestle crush the garlic. 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:21.020
Crush and grind the garlic and salt together until you obtain 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.070
a paste. [grinding sounds] 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.130
Clean the pestle and continue. 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:40.200
[grinding sounds] Break the egg. 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.020
Separate the yolk from the white. 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.140
Cut the membrane of the egg here. There we go. 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.280
Place the yolk into the mortar. 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.070
I like to add a little bit of Dijon in my sauce, 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.080
this is optional, because it will help to combine all the 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.120
ingredients together and to hold the sauce. 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.040
So add the Dijon. 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.080
Combine the yolk, Dijon and garlic base together. 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:19.200
[mixing sounds] Then add the oil slowly. 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:39.240
[mixing sounds] It's getting thicker thanks to the emulsion. 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:50.000
Add the oil little by little with a thin stream. 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:17.000
[mixing sounds] This is a workout. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.240
I forgot to list an ingredient in the recipe, elbow grease.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.030
Continue the emulsion until all of the oil 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.150
has been incorporated. 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:04:13.000
[mixing sounds] We're almost there, final effort. There we go. 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Then add the pepper. And mix well. [mixing sounds] 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:45.200
After the effort, the reward, taste your sauce. 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:53.040
Mm, very nice, the seasoning, the flavor of the garlic, 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.100
the slight bitterness of the olive oil, 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.000
the flavor of the olive oil, beautiful. 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.260
If you've done a great job, 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.040
this is the consistency you will get. 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.170
It's a little bit thick, you know, quite a bit. 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.020
It's very shiny. Very nice. 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.180
So serve the sauce with steamed vegetables and poached fish 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.000
to make the perfect aioli dish. 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.030
Keep the sauce refrigerated up to three days. 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.130
Bon Appetit.
