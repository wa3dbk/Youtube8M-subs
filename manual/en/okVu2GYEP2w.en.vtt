00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.670
I get around 4-5 hours sleep a night

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.150
5 hours of sleep. three to four hours of sleep. five hours a night

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.170
9-6

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.900
work then you go home and eat something then like

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.530
10-2 or three is a all the other stuff

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.100
I live far away so I get home late, I also like try to make time to workout

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.170
I just have really bad insomnia and I tend to over extend myself so when I do

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.550
do have the time to sleep a full night I just don't know how to even begin sleeping

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.120
to me, sleep is just something that you have to do so the quicker that

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.120
you get it over with, the better

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.770
I do worry it

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.090
at what point will the make up sort of stop covering up my lack of sleep

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.280
I think I look sort of exhausted under my eyes

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.140
baggy and my eyes look a little blood shot and my

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.560
skin kind of looks dull... there's definitely times when I wake up and

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.120
feel like look older... I noticed that I don't get enough sleep because the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.110
first thing I think of when I wake up

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.050
is coffee... I am trying to change my sleeping habits because I know

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.440
detrimental to my health and my appearance... I will never change my sleeping habits

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.090
I will just figure out more ways to ingest caffeine

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:27.090
OMG I'm so scared,  I don't want to open my eyes... I sort of I recognize myself

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.460
but I don't at all.... COOL!

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.790
Oh, close-up it's gross. I think it's more disturbing because I

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.810
look younger than expected but still terrible

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.070
my skin both looks and feels tired

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.180
definitely don't love how I look. I hate the under eyes, man

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.100
The under eyes are the worst... This is the first time I've ever seen myself with

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.410
wrinkles, I don't like it.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.470
I didn't expect the wrinkles under my eyes.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.570
 I look really pale, I don't like a happy healthy person right now

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.600
I said nothing would make me change my sleeping habits

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.380
I think I'm a little convinced.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.540
See myself with all those wrinkles above my eyelids.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.450
 I definitely feel less invincible

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.010
 I realized now that these bad habits are going to catch up to me at

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.830
some point... it definitely makes me want to change my sleeping habits

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.630
i'd don't know if I'm actually going to...it definitely makes me wanna sleep

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.860
more if this is what i'm gonna look like.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.600
A certain melancholy to the overall look that

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.600
off putting.. I think that's worse, that projection

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.430
to the world to look like someone who's sad that

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.350
startling, also makes me wanna sleep
