00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:15.070
Some time ago I did a video on rearranging
your time or fortune through rearranging the

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.070
planets.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.440
I want you to revisit that.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:30.680
One or two videos that I did had a big ceremony
in the Ashram wherein I called all these people

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:38.530
I live (in the ashram) to come and witness
the ceremony.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:46.200
The Siddhas are Enlightened Masters who have
always been interested in helping people to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.409
rearrange their time; rearranging the time
means rearranging your fortune.

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.600
How can you do that?

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.609
You can do that by rearranging the planets.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:09.140
The planets have been arranged in a certain
way within the Indian tradition of Astrology.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:19.880
You can now see the arrangement of the planets
within a temple in a certain way.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.530
What you see in there is that no planet is
looking at each other; they are all facing

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.300
different times.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:39.670
This arrangement was a technology by a Siddha
called Idai Kaadar who wanted to rearrange

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.760
the planets, so that they donâ€™t hurt the
human beings.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.300
I donâ€™t want to get into that because I
have talked about it earlier on and that 2

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.300
video clips.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:02:02.409
The best way of changing time, changing your
fortune is by arranging them, arranging all

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:15.180
the planets in just one row, beginning with
the Sun and ending with the 2 snake planets,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.720
and all the planets should be facing South.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.930
The moment you do that, then you find that
the planets have a different attitude towards

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.239
you; they cannot hurt you.

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:46.299
So I am going to add a few more details to
this arrangement and come up with a design

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:57.269
of planets that you all can use on a daily
basis.

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.340
So I am working on it.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.549
So, soon you will hear that through AstroVed
â€“ they have been working with me on this

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:07.549
subject.

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:13.930
So by doing something very simple, by putting
the planets in a row and making them to face

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:21.689
South, one can significantly alter oneâ€™s
own misfortune.

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:31.689
And this is really a great thing that the
Rishis, the Enlightened Masters have given

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:31.959
us.
