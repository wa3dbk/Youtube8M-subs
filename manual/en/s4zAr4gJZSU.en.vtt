00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.120
What's going on YouTube I'm Scott from Scotthermanfitness.com and I want first of all I wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.059
Hope you had a great time and if you're anything like me

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.120
You're going through the fridge every single hour because you're hungry

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.429
And you want to finish all those leftovers starting of course with the apple pie

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:24.119
And that looks great doesn't it I will eat this but gonna eat it after I do my Thanksgiving day workout now

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.150
I'm gonna roll out a new program

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.599
It's gonna be called be at 10 in 2010 and it's gonna start with the Thanksgiving day workout

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.119
Which is something you can do in your home all you need is a couple of small dumbbells or a couple things that are

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.549
relative to the weight of the small Dumbbells

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.969
I'm gonna use or a weight that you think you can use for your workout

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.359
So we're gonna do is 10 exercises each exercise

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.270
You're gonna do for a set amount of reps which I'll say during the exercise and you can also change that on your own depending

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.270
On what your level of fitness is so

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.080
First let's start off with is jumping jacks now jumping jacks are very easy

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.800
And you can do them one of three ways you can do them if you're a beginner

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.519
You can simply just go like this and get your feet you see my feet

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.099
Get your feet moving shoulder length apart like that and just bring your arms out a little bit like this, okay

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.589
So you can get your arms open and your legs moving

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.809
Now if you are pretty good at jumping jacks you bring your arms all the way up. You can come up like here

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.919
And bring them up like that and if you can do full range of motion

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.099
Come all the way up, and when you come all the way up keep your core tight

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.619
Keep your core tight during each exercise now I want you guys to start off with 30 jumping jacks

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.309
Okay, second thing you're gonna do is oblique twist

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.559
And you do them standing, what you want to do is get your feet about a little wider than shoulder length apart

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.049
And what you're gonna do is put your arms like this

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.129
twist side to side and breathe out as you twist, so

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.169
Now you gotta do 15 on each side, so you're Gonna go 1 1

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.589
2 2 3 3

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.389
Now if it's a little too easy for you to make them a little harder grab a weight

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.950
hold like this

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.179
And if you don't have a dumbbell just find something that weighs a lot in your house

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.169
You can use hold it on front your body keep hips and your head facing straight and twist

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.169
breathe out as you twist and again 1 1 2 2

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.170
That's how you count repetitions

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.408
Next I'm gonna do, I choose the same dumbbell is

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.239
squatting with a tricep extension hold the dumbbell over your head

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.869
get your feet shoulder length apart and

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.229
What you're gonna do is you're going to come down and as you come down

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.779
You're gonna bring the weight down as well, and you come to 90 degree angle with your elbow so down

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.549
90 degree angle with both your legs and your elbows and back up

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.720
down

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.529
Up and make sure you breathe out on the way up

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.309
And the same thing once you guys do that about 15 times

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.819
Next thing I want you guys to do is something called a hit now. It's very easy. All you gonna do is stand up straight

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.799
Come down like this

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.569
Put your feet up

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.708
Bring your feet back in and come straight back up

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.679
So down out and up

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.129
down, out, in, up

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.519
So basically go into a push-up position

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.489
And then back in and back up now as soon as you're done doing those you get right into your pushup

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.489
So do your last set come down

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.799
And as you do your push ups one of a couple different ways if you're a beginner, and you have a hard time doing push-ups

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.319
You can go on your knees

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.599
cross your legs if you want to and

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.150
then come down like this and

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.760
push straight up

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.959
Put your arms shoulder length apart and come down

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.509
Now if you think you have a hard time if those are too easy for you have a hard time doing them

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:07.379
Come up like this

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.000
Straight down and

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.690
Then go right up and do regular push-ups

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:14.659
And again you want to do about 15 repetitions

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.978
As soon as you're done doing those you're gonna roll right over and start doing some situps

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.680
So get on your back

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.989
Put your feet on the ground like this

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.290
Keep your head parallel with the ceiling arch your back, and you're gonna simply come up like this

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.590
And keep your core tight the whole time

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.919
And you want to do about 20 to 30 repetitions of sit-ups

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.310
Breathing out the way up

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.639
Basically doing 15 repetitions for every exercise

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.090
except for the sit-ups and jumping jacks

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.260
And now soon are you're done with those you're gonna come up, and then do some floor oblique twists

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.649
and you can do this without weight by simply sitting back and

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.169
going back and Forth like this and

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.880
Again you count 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 or if we make it a little harder

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.179
Grab your dumbbell again or whatever you have

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.740
Medicine balls can be used

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.740
Holding a dumbbell hold like this

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.709
Lean back and then cross side to side like that

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.149
Breathe out as you're twisting again you do these for fifteen reps one on each side

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.760
Next thing you're gonna do is something called a bicep lunge

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.039
And what you're gonna do is grab some dumbbells. It's gonna start like this

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.570
Hold your palms facing forward the whole time and as you lunge forward you're gonna do a curl so step

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.840
Come down 90 degrees

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.099
curl

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:58.099
up back

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.880
step

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.409
Down up never let your knee go past your toe

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.400
Boom just like this

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.800
15 each side

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.829
Actually, not do 15 in a row to make sure you alternate because you're lifting both arms at once

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:26.070
After you're done doing those you do something called mountain climbers mountain climbers mean come back on the floor

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:33.029
What a mountain climber, basically is is you have a push-up position again, and you're gonna do 15 on each side

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.840
Put one foot back and one foot forward to start

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:44.609
And simply go like this what 1 two 2 three 3 four 4 Five 5 six 6

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.040
Then keep doing that to get all the way to 15 now the last exercise you're gonna

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.040
do is gonna be a close grip bench

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.570
then you do a leg down on the ground and

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.140
You can use whatever you can find for a weight that you can do

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.440
You make sure you get 15 repetitions, so if you have a dumbbell, if you use the dumbbell and simply just bring it down

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.560
and push back up and

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.990
do 15 of these

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.859
3,4,5

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
just like this

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.160
And then when you get to 15, you're gonna simply stop

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.879
Rest a little bit and what I want you to try and do is

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:32.159
Do it at least two more times if you only can do it one more time, that's great

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:36.749
You're gonna wait like 20 minutes, and then do it again. That's awesome, too. If you want to wait till there's a commercial

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.070
While you're watching TV

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.279
That's great too as long as you do it

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.529
So this is going to be your Thanksgiving day workout

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.130
