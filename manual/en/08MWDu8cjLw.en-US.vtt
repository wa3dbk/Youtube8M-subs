00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
Hi everyone!

00:00:02.493 --> 00:00:06.753
I have made an UFO

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.440
It looks good.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.980
And it can fly.

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:38.953
It works thanks to two turbines

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.880
It works on rototrones.

00:00:58.581 --> 00:01:00.581
Here they are.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.020
It needs only electricity.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.740
There are also a lot of landing gears.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:35.940
They do not let UFO to crash.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.720
But there is a problem.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:54.020
You can't control rototrones. So you can only switch the engine on/off

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.300
It makes problems when you land.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:10.460
On the other hand, it's well controlled.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.260
Oh! Let's try to...

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.740
No, it wont work. No, no!..

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.980
I wanted to turn it upside down. 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:11.480
 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:28.340
It's engine work in both directions, so it's possible to fly upside down.

00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.651
Why it didn't crash?

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.760
I have cheated)

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:55.120
Because it's pretty difficult to land this thing without crashing.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.640
{The rest of talking is about nothing.}
