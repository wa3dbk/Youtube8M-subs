G'day there Drinking Buddies, Scotty Boxa
here for www.drinklab.org. Have you become

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.130
a drinking buddy? Because that's an excellent
idea, just like these excellent, extraordinary

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.560
Easter eggs, yes Jello / Jelly Shot Easter
eggs and this is how to make them.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.120
For this you will need:
1 Cup Vodka

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:38.340
1 Packet of Jello / Jelly
1 Cup of Hot Water

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.460
and some hollow Easter eggs

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.779
In a measuring jug pour in 1 cup of hot water
then add your Jello / Jelly Crystals and give

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:56.140
it a stir until dissolved.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:04.030
Once dissolved add in your 1 cup of Vodka
and give it a quick stir.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.100
Set your Jello / Jelly off to the site to
cool a little.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:18.870
With a knife drill a hole into each Easter
egg just off tot he site of the seam.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.519
Then make sure your syringe will fit inside
each hole.

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:25.880
Once your Jello / Jelly has cooled enough
not to melt the chocolate syringe it into

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.670
each Easter egg until they are full.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:41.490
Then seal up each egg so they don't dry our
when refrigerated

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.890
Place these in the fridge for a few hours
or until set

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.799
