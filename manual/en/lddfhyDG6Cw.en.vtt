00:00:03.965 --> 00:00:08.306
here are very welcome back to sort of a
bonus of the so the truth filemaker hair

00:00:08.306 --> 00:00:12.315
you prior recognize this is the frugal
and this is a divisive built a while

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:13.395
back

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:16.665
and essentially what it is a searcy
version of the manfrotto super quite

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:18.385
what that uh... that that clamped it

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:19.706
did and does

00:00:19.706 --> 00:00:22.796
the logic to clamp a recorder inched
running

00:00:22.796 --> 00:00:24.346
a tripod mount

00:00:24.346 --> 00:00:29.415
uh... more lighting round to any curved
surface such as uh... try parlay europeo

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:30.266
poll

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:34.215
or a light stand or whatever and this is
my version of the discuss about ten

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:35.706
dollars to make

00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:38.976
uh... the manfrotto versions about
twenty-five goodbye

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:42.836
uh... so use this for several things
uh... mostly for mounting a monitor my

00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:45.516
tripod two years of my frugal crane

00:00:45.516 --> 00:00:50.376
uh... one probably haven't this was this
chair to appear cacao holy eating and by

00:00:50.376 --> 00:00:52.006
the end of this group

00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:56.496
anyway putting that as mentioned in the
uh... the video through when the u_n_

00:00:56.496 --> 00:00:58.986
for nine months of the world some of the

00:00:58.986 --> 00:01:04.146
uh... friction protests it's still put
punch a hole is refuses to the bottom of

00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:05.556
this chair tip

00:01:05.556 --> 00:01:07.546
aswini new way to fix that

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:10.376
and uh... you know i didn't really come
up with anything on my own i got an

00:01:10.376 --> 00:01:14.736
email from uh... brian back house
earlier this year he suggested

00:01:14.736 --> 00:01:17.666
that they put a three h three-eighths
inch

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:20.526
uh... chair tip on the end of this crew

00:01:20.526 --> 00:01:24.366
this is a vital chair taking it easy for
her car restore for like the fact that

00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.486
got mine for uh...

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:29.766
for these for two dollars that
peacefully where

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:33.426
uh... and aldous just fits right on the
end

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:37.086
this crew here after member of the
previous video actually had to put your

00:01:37.086 --> 00:01:39.356
first date on the end of this the pad

00:01:39.356 --> 00:01:40.396
this group

00:01:40.396 --> 00:01:42.546
to only for the big chair tip on it

00:01:42.546 --> 00:01:45.906
uh... now brian just uses this by by
itself

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:49.176
but i still like having this larger
churches because the way the rubber

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:53.696
setup it just gives a little more flex
here in the union kinda conforms to

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:55.026
whatever uh...

00:01:55.026 --> 00:01:59.046
round object your elliott republic i
think it was so having just one point

00:01:59.046 --> 00:02:01.206
here this kind of bands around it

00:02:01.206 --> 00:02:05.686
is a little bit of absorption blue
padding star like that so i just show

00:02:05.686 --> 00:02:08.696
this on the enemy of the gaffer state
anymore

00:02:08.696 --> 00:02:12.835
and if it's perfectly so he knows a
great solution

00:02:12.835 --> 00:02:16.435
from brian has gone to pass that on do
you think it's important got approval

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:18.975
clinton you use it and i want to know
about this

00:02:18.975 --> 00:02:22.125
and i think i came up with an email
notice this in the fruit crane to bring

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:23.335
home video

00:02:23.335 --> 00:02:25.135
is that if you want to stand

00:02:25.135 --> 00:02:28.665
this uh... tripod mount on top here you
can get a couple are not

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:32.645
like this is just in longview not
basically and i put 'em some a

00:02:32.645 --> 00:02:34.355
quarter-inch thread

00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:38.545
threaded rod in the end here headed up a
few threads on the top so now i

00:02:38.545 --> 00:02:40.535
basically mimicking this

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:44.235
and now i can just give myself a little
bit more link

00:02:44.235 --> 00:02:48.535
device here missus gipper when i'm home
and monitors release on a previous video

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:51.635
but for anything else you know can
extend the top

00:02:51.635 --> 00:02:55.955
of the threat on the the uh... many ball
head right here so that that's basically

00:02:55.955 --> 00:03:01.295
all of those are some up we will clamp
one point five improvements and uh... if

00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:05.165
you use this device so you might be able
to use these ideas and it's not

00:03:05.165 --> 00:03:08.105
then i guess you can see it this video
but if you don't you know then something

00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:11.055
like this do to improve this something
else let me know

00:03:11.055 --> 00:03:15.215
but as i am i like to know about its
disposal review a full episode

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:16.065
but they are

00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:19.375
