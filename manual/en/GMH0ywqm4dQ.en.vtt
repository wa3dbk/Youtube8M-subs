00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.519
Alright, so we still got a little bit more
work to do on our abs.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:14.519
And I know what you are thinking.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.519
You're like, 'I'm tired.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:16.519
I'm tired.

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:17.519
I don't want to do any more.'

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:18.519
But you know what?

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:19.519
You got to get motivation.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.760
You know what your motivation's going to be?

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.760
Cash.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.349
I know, you're thinking the same thing.

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:25.349
You like, 'Yes!

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.650
That is the appropriate motivation that I
need Sea Breeze.'

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.970
So what you going to imagine is that there's
lots of cash on the floor.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.970
Somebody just dropped it, 'Arr, arr.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:34.970
I don't want the cash.'

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.550
And they dropped it on the floor.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.560
Now you got to be ready.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.560
You got to be in shape.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.680
You got to be ready to pick up that cash.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.250
So you're making sure your feet are shoulder
width apart, you're going to bend slightly

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.360
at the knee, tuck your belly button in towards
your spine as you contract, getting your abs

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.940
ready so you can pick up as much cash as possible.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.220
And I know everybody wants to be prepared
to pick up the cash and this is how you do

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.220
it.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.100
Get low, sweep, grab that cash, grab it!

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.540
Sweep, grab!

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.990
Sweep, grab!

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.600
You never know how much cash you need.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.130
Make sure you engage those abs.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.900
Tuck it in tight.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.130
Grab as much cash as you can.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.979
Hey, the economy is all out of whack and you
need as much money as you can.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:19.979
You know what I am talking about.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.560
I think we see eye to eye.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.030
So again, shoulder width apart.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.670
Get low, semi squat, knees over your toes.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.040
Reach down, grab that cash, engage those abs,
tuck it in to the spine, woo!

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.040
Get as much as you can.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.040
Woo!

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.270
You never know when you might need it for
a rainy day.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.270
Pick up the cash.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.270
Pick up the cash.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:02:02.159
I think I got enough cash for right now, until
I get the music, then I'll get me some more

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.560
cash.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:14.159
DJ, play the music.
