00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.000
(FROM JAVA TO BALI
A JOURNEY TO INSPIRE)

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.160
(Sri Lestari is travelling 1200km
from Jakarta to Bali

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.240
on her modified motorbike)

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.840
(This is the story
of her inspirational trip)

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.040
(Webisode 4: Bali!)

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.520
I'm on the final push
to Eastern Java.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.720
And it goes by fast.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.240
In Madium, a grandmother
with a disabled grandson

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.440
is moved by my story.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.800
Keep praying Sri.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.560
Pray so my grandson can walk.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.280
In Mojokerto,
I get an escort to town.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.800
And in Situ Pondok,
it rains all day.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.760
(DAY 19 Banyuwangi, East Java 140
km left to finish line in Bali)

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.360
On Day 19,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.120
I arrive in Banyuwangi
on the eastern tip of Java.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.480
The famous Indonesian
photographer, Rio Helmi

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.680
has joined me for a few days.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.960
Rio's been everywhere
in Indonesia.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.840
And has seen the situation
for disabled people first hand.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.600
In Indonesia, there's
legislation,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.240
you know, for access
and stuff like that,

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.800
but there's very little
implementation.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.080
When I was growing up,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.640
most disabled people just really
stayed at home.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.080
And even to this day,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.960
you know, and I'm like,
almost 60, you know,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.680
I mean that's a long time

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.200
you know,
for that to be still going on.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.720
(DAY 20 Ferry from Java to Bali
120 km left to finish line)

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.920
On board,
I feel like a celebrity.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.240
Everyone wants to say hello.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.640
Finally,
after 20 days on the road...

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.120
Bali!

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.680
It's exciting.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.320
I take the north route
along the course.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.000
It's beautiful.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.760
Finally, I arrived in Lovina.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.000
The locals are very curious.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.680
It's beautiful.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.200
On Day 21, I wake up early.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.360
We are going dolphin-watching.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.920
It's the first time
I've been in the small boat.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.440
And the first time
I've seen dolphins.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.400
On the way back to the beach...

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.160
another first.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.520
Swimming in the ocean.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.360
I like it.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.320
It feels amazing.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.040
All across Indonesia,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.560
small local NGOs help people
with disabilities.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.880
SO High 5 in Lovina
is one such NGO.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.640
There are many types
of modified motorbikes.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.840
Two of the staff are so inspired
by my trip,

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.880
they asked if they can join
for a few days.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.600
I've never been in a convoy
of modified motorbikes,

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.520
so I really want to try!

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.480
I'm happy to have them
come along.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.160
We hit the road together.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.480
(DAY 22 Ubud, Bali
25 km left to finish line)

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.440
Today is the official end
to my trip.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.480
I'm in Ubud,
heading to a finish line

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.240
and then Besar, Bali's capital.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.640
She is just doing something
so phenomenal.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.200
Joining me today
are over 50 others.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.720
People seem happy
to be coming along.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.000
For the first time,
I get emotional.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.640
Very happy. Makes me cry.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.640
- Go!
- Go!

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.520
In those dark and sad years,
after my accident,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.560
I never would have imagined

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.360
that I would do
what I'm doing today.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.360
(SRI THE BARRIER BREAKER)

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.600
I have done it.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.640
1,200 kilometres from Jakarta
to Bali.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.800
I hope other disabled people
can be inspired by my trip.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.840
I hope they too can feel
that anything is possible.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.080
But I'm not done yet.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.560
The next day, one of my sponsors
from the trip, Surfer Girl,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.280
has a surprise.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.000
Today, we're taking you surfing!

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.800
They're taking me surfing.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.560
(Foreign Language)

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.680
We head to the famous
Bali surf beach, Kuta.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.840
Relax.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.880
In the ocean on the surf board,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.120
I feel like I can jump.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.080
Something I haven't done
since my accident.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.080
The water gave me a kind
of freedom I don't have on land.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.920
It's so much fun.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.120
I feel this is all a dream.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.080
A dream come true.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.720
Looking back,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.120
these past four weeks have been
the best of my life.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.720
I set out to show what's
possible,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.040
to share my experience,
and to inspire others.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.720
I think I've done that.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.640
I can't wait until next year.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.840
Who knows what island
I will cross then?

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.600
