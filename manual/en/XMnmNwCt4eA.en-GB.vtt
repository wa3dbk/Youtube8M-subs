00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.670
&gt;&gt; NIRO SIVANATHAN: Leading teams for emerging
leaders is a new executive education programme

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.950
offering at the London Business School. It's
designed around two primary objectives the

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.560
first is around greater self-awareness and
the second is around and greater understanding

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.740
of team prostheses and team design.
This will be primarily done through evidence-based

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.760
discussions around leadership through influence,
communication and coordination and managing

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.820
conflict.
&gt;&gt; MARGARET ORMISTON: We deliver the programme

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.810
in a variety of ways, one of the key ways
is through presenting and discussing theory

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.950
and relevant research. Another key way is
through group work. Every day participants

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.630
are going to be discussing with one another
their key ideas, to better understand the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.680
concepts we discuss.
Finally they're going to be doing one to one

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.100
coaching, which will give them an opportunity
with an executive coach to discuss their career

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.760
goals and where they're heading.
Almost every day participants will be engaging

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.780
experiential exercises that will give them
hands on opportunity to think and practice

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.730
the ideas discussed in the course.
One of those exercises will take place at

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.950
Silverstone, the home of British racing.
This exercise really provides an opportunity

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.900
to get hands-on experience with some of the
key concepts we will be discussing in the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.440
course, such as team design, communication
and coordination.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.860
Teams are tasked with changing all four tires
on a car, up against the clock. Each team

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.020
has three attempts changing the tires, with
breakaways with lbs faculty and coaches to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:48.080
discuss challenges improve performance.
Success in this activity involves good communication,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.330
collaboration, project planning and delivering
results in a fast-paced ever-changing context.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.680
&gt;&gt; NIRO SIVANATHAN: The programme extends
well beyond your week at the London Business

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.390
School. You will leave with a tangible action
plan which you hope to execute with an organization

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.110
and this action plan will benefit from the
support the London Business School, primarily

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.450
your executive coach as well as your programme
colleagues.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.909
&gt;&gt; MARGARET ORMISTON: Leading teams for emerging
leaders is all about transformation through

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.969
experience.
&gt;&gt; NIRO SIVANATHAN: Developing an evidence-based

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.680
toolkit.
&gt;&gt; MARGARET ORMISTON: Building confidence

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.660
knowledge and capability.
&gt;&gt; NIRO SIVANATHAN: Unlocking your leadership

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.089
