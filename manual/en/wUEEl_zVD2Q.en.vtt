00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.200
Cherry pie pizza.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.090
Salty, sweet and saucy.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.770
Hey, don’t knock it until you try it, and
make sure you spit out the pits.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:51.030
It’s Cooking Mama 4: Kitchen Magic for the
Nintendo 3DS.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.450
And to be honest, as much as we...uh...love
Cooking Mama...there’s really no reason

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.130
for this game to be on this system.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.090
Cooking Mama 4 takes advantage of the 3DS
in the same way Cooking Mama 2 and 3 did...in

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.090
that it doesn’t.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.000
Yeah, it uses the 3D graphics, and it...fits
into the cartridge slot.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.320
But otherwise, don’t expect much 3DS here.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.520
That is to say, don’t expect much new here.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.729
Kitchen Magic is the fourth entry in the main
Cooking Mama series, to say nothing of its

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.030
other titles and spinoffs.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.240
And by now, the recipe is pretty stable.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.570
You choose from a ton of dishes, and you put
your chosen meal together step by step.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.810
Of course, this is done with very short minigames
that come in succession.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.840
In fact, Cooking Mama is like a WarioWare
game, but with a cooking theme and more logic.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.259
And less boogers.

00:01:49.259 --> 00:02:02.380
Of course, that’s a very broad description
of Cooking Mama, but it applies to Kitchen

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.829
Magic nonetheless.

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.450
And that’s kind of the problem.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.720
The dishes are different, and your ingredients
have changed...but that’s about it.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.750
Everything else about the game’s 50 recipes
or so is virtually unchanged from prior games

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.230
in the series.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.120
But on the same note, prior games in the series
have been good.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.470
And so is this one.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.600
Cooking Mama 4 has the same awesome touch-based
gameplay, split up into those manageably short

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.600
segments.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.930
This helps keep the inherent tedium at bay,
however slightly, and also helps all the touching

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.569
and tapping to stay fresh.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:49.480
You can choose a single dish to put together,
or you can combine recipes...like pizza and

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.470
cherry pie...or even dress up Cooking Mama,
which is just adorable.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.680
And fans are going to love it.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.120
But for those who haven’t stepped into Mama’s
kitchen before, there just isn’t much on

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.750
her menu to entice you.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.360
In fact, Cooking Mama 4 is like a greasy diner
hamburger.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.819
You know what it tastes like.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.640
You know if you’ll like it.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.610
Otherwise, keep driving.
