00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:03.186
(calm intro music)

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.640
- Hi everybody, welcome
to Aromahead Institute.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.840
I'm Andrea Butje

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.930
and I want to show you a
fabulous diffuser blend today

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.680
in this video called The
Energizing Diffuser Blend.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.490
And it's a recipe right from
my book, Essential Living:

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.280
Aromatherapy Recipes for Health
and Home and it's on page 49

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.280
in the Living Room section
and it is a phenomenal blend

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.300
to use, especially in the
morning to just awaken your mind

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.440
and create a beautiful
fresh aroma in the house.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.240
There's three essential oils.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.180
Rosemary essential oil, which
is invigorating and awakening

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.420
and clears your head and grapefruit,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.030
which is totally refreshing
and also a great antimicrobial.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.830
And then also lime, which
again, is just sweet

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.720
and refreshing and also helps
kills germs in the house.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.290
So it's a perfect combination

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.250
and we're going to add fifteen
drops of each essential oil

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.440
into a little stock bottle
and then I'll show you

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.390
how we're gonna put it in the diffuser.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.200
So here we go.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.900
I'm gonna start with the rosemary

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.340
and I have a little bottle here.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.340
It's actually a 5 mil size
bottle and I'm gonna put 15 drops

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.750
of each essential oil into the bottle.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.510
And the oil drops come out fast.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.880
So if I did get 15 but if
by chance you got 16 or 17,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.370
no worries, it's okay.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.060
And then I'm gonna add
15 drops of grapefruit.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.280
Okay and then lastly,
15 drops of the lime.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.930
I think I got 16 on that one.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.700
Okay and then I have a
little orifice reducer cap,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.740
which means that when I put it on

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.240
and tighten it and then I open it,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.160
there's this great little orifice reducer

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.110
which helps to get the
drops out one at a time.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.140
And then we're gonna put
them into the diffuser.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.030
I have a really special
diffuser here today.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.550
It's from a company called Puzhen

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.450
and it's called a yun diffuser.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.930
And what I love about this
diffuser, outside of the fact

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.990
that it's absolutely gorgeous,

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.650
is that it's got a big thick
glass top and a big opening.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.950
And you just simply take that off

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.240
and you fill this little container

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.250
that they give you with water.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.640
Put the water in, I
already put the water in.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.960
And then you take your essential oil drops

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.890
and this is that beautiful
mixture we just made

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.530
and I'm gonna put in some drops.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.060
I usually put about 10 in

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.580
and then I'm gonna put the cover back on.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.110
And it has a remote control.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.070
Oh and it has music and lights as well.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.740
Start some music.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.390
And you can see that it's
already starting to steam.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.700
There's no heat, just a fan

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.620
and it's gonna steam
out the essential oils.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.560
Oh my gosh, it smells amazing.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.510
And if you want you
can turn the music off.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.260
There we go.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.580
And you can change the colored lights.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.690
It's fun and you can
also turn the lights off

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.490
and you can set it to run
for one hour, two hours,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.940
or three hours, so that's pretty fun.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.360
And here's a great thing.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.390
The company has offered a
discount, 10% off to anyone

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.390
who saw this video and the
discount code is aromahead10.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.870
So if you put that discount
code in when you buy one

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.460
of their diffusers
they'll give you 10% off.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.470
Although I have to say that
any diffuser will work great

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.400
with this blend.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.560
This blend is uplifting and
invigorating, refreshing

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.900
and you can even just put it into a bowl

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.610
of steaming hot water.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.270
But I wanted to mention the diffuser

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.200
just because I think it's so beautiful

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.580
and it works really well.
