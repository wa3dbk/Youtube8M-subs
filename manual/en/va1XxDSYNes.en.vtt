00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:12.170
Hi and welcome to OUYA PRESENTS. Today we're recovering from PAX POX from last

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.549
week's PAX Prime

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.330
We brought along a bunch of cool games and a bunch of cool DEVS who developed said

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.090
cool games.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.650
In attendance in no particular order we
had Bob

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.189

neckbeard, fortunately

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.470
Mr. Tim Graupmann and Alex from Team OUYA Pro tip:

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.910
don't get a cold like me! Pax Pox is
serious business.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.030
several devs were able to make the
journey as well including but not

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.010
limited to

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.040
Nic Biondi of Hard Lander fame Hal and
Gaz the Amazing Frog aficionados

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.060

booths were Samantha from Sentris.

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.820
Matt Gilgenbach of Neverending Nightmares. Ryan, Josh and the team from  

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.259
That Dragon Cancer

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.899
and probably a bunch of other
super sweet in these were neglecting to

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:10.360
mention

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.679
go easy on us if we forgot your name it
was an intense con we'll make it up to you

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:18.179
PROTIP: Stay in touch with us via
office hours and twitch stream so we can

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.490
keep you involved in future OUYA dev-related

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.509
endeavors we heard over 70,000 people attended PAX this yearand  we believe it

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.079
six floors up we can hear the chaos
below as they openned the front gates

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.770
trampling footsteps rang through the
halls like a Balrog chasing hobbits

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.119
but everyone filed on and off the
escalators in an orderly fashion

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.359
which we thought was pretty swell kudos
to the hordes of gamer, devs and journalists

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:41.759
who traveled up to the 6th floor to hang out with
us

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.770
the booth was packed with interested
onlookers the entire time

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.579
so we stayed on our toes when we weren't  playing
with lightsabers or fixing broken

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.229
things, we were playing games,

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.099
meeting fans slash interesting gamers
and devs and generally just having a

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.740
good time
