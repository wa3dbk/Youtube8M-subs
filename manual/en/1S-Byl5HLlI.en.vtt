00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Begin with cotton pads and latex

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Cover the eye to create a missing eye effect  

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Dip cotton in latex to create a hollowed out effect

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Spread the cotton downwards, around the mouth as well

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The cotton creates a fleshy skin texture

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Use acrylic nail tips for teeth, make them bend a bit inwards like shown 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
To secure the teeth, cut small strips from cotton pads, place over the teeth edge

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Add an extra layer of latex 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Create an edge for the wound using sculpt gel

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If you don’t have sculpt gel you can use: paper/cotton and latex, or wax. Take what you have

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We use a lot of sculpt gel to create hanging, loose skin

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
That’s what you see here, the base for the ripped up skin

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Time for colours and foundation 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Cover up around the outside of the wound

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Add a little extra nose piece

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
One round of powder 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Start with black in the hollowed out eye, mix it out with red 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Fill the whole wound area with red

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
If you want you can change to colours to go full out zombie

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Add some blood

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Add more bruising and wound effects

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Use a darker tone around the wound 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Go on with the sponge using red colour and fake blood

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Fake blood in Swedish is låtsasblod 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Create muscle fibers with cotton dipped in fake blood, shape it in any way you want

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Outline the wound with more blood

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Continue with glass pieces in the wound

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:15.000
We use real movie effects breakaway glass but you can use another transparent material, and fasten it with latex

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Your car crash victim is done 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
