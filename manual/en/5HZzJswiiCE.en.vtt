00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.640
The very first time I played Super Mario Bros. I found out about the warp zone secret.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.760
This wasn't because I was clever or thorough

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.200
it was because I was playing with a friend who was excited to share the secret with me.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.600
I never had a whole lot of time to explore the game on my own back then because I didn't own a nintendo myself.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.810
I only played it with friends who did.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.890
I had a chance to visit the other worlds a few times

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.250
but for some reason it seemed standard practice just take the warp zones.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:37.170
Most of the time we would go straight to world eight after which the game became too hard for me and we'd stop playing pretty soon.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.410
Many years later I was in university and desperate to procrastinate from exam study

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.910
so I returned to Super Mario Bros.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.430
Sometime in between my attitude toward gaming had changed a lot,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.239
and now I was really interested in playing through it rather than just getting to the end.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.079
I found it surprisingly satisfying because it was a much better game than I had remembered.

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.539
The game has eight worlds of four levels with a consistent rhythm.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.990
The first level of each world is outdoor on the ground, an introduction.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.720
The second levels are where the most unusual things happen: worlds 1 and 4 go underground,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.590
2 and 7 go underwater.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.000
The third level of a world is usually a level with no ground beneath,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.689
jumping between treetops or giant mushrooms,

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.369
or after a water level they become long bridges bombarded by flying fish.

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.110
The final level of each world is a castle with fire traps and sometimes a maze puzzle.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.900
Some of the castle levels are designed in pairs

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.150
with an easy and hard version of the same layout

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.340
like world 1-4 versus 6-4 or 2-4 versus 5-4.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.600
Now, what about the secrets in the game?

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.020
Hidden secrets would become a dominant design feature in later Mario games

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.070
but it was a little different in the first game.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.100
It had hidden bonuses scattered throughout.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.390
Every first level of a world has a hidden 1-up.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.700
Many of the pipes lead to extra coins, or hidden mushrooms here and there,

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.979
but there's very little hinting that most of this is there.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.470
They are usually found randomly or by an exhaustive search.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.739
Furthermore, while these bonuses add to the game,

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.970
they are rather transient, like most arcade power-ups.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.980
You get to play a little longer, or take an extra hit,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.599
but they don't really alter the progress of the game.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.440
They are specifically designed to be missable.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.530
This game does however have one really exceptional hidden secret, which is the warp zones.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.739
A lot of games had level skip cheat codes in them,

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.930
probably put in by programmers to make it easier to test,

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.400
but this game is unusual because instead of just leaving in a debugging feature

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.650
they realized players could enjoy discovering and using it,

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.099
and integrated it directly into the game.

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.040
Unlike the other secrets which generally just make the game a little easier to play,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.280
the warp zones are a key that lets you quickly get to any part of the game you want to play.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.510
There are three warp zones.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.519
They are all contained in the two underground levels 1-2 and 4-2.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.500
The underground levels, unlike most levels, have a ceiling,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.739
but the ceiling has the non-obvious property but there's actually nothing above it, and you can walk on top.

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.180
The only gaps in the ceiling appear where there are moving elevators, which kind of draws attention away from them,

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.750
helping to keep the secret.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.769
Two of the warp zones are reached by running all the way to the right of the level, on top of the ceiling past the exit pipe.

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.390
You can discover this in world 1-2 first,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.129
but the way it's designed I think you're intended to find it in 4-2.

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.250
The hints in 4-2 are much stronger.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:48.120
The first hint that you can walk on the ceiling is this outcropping past the first elevator.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.890
The elevator is moving down, but if you're quick you can get up to this lowered platform.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.409
It sticks out very deliberately,

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.409
almost like a stair-step encouraging you to step up to the ceiling.

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.860
The second hint is this pair of elevators.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.099
This pair of moving platforms is similar to the ones in 1-2,

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.799
but instead of the dangerous wide gap surrounding the elevators in 1-2, these are very narrow,

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.689
and the second elevator goes up, so it's extremely easy to get from it to the ceiling on the right.

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:20.079
The third hint is at this last down elevator.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.590
This is not a way up to the ceiling, but here again the gap is very narrow.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:30.680
If you're already on the ceiling there's a great temptation to just jump across it and see what happens,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.040
and interestingly, if you do this there is now no way to finish the level normally.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.770
You have no choice but to find the warp zone.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.470
The fourth hint is one final chance just before the end of the level.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.160
There's a tall pipe that you have to stand on to get by.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.460
If you're big when you jump to it, it's very likely that you'll bash into the ceiling and break a part of it,

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.520
and it's very easy to be big here because this level actually has four mushrooms,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.290
which is the most you'll find in any level in the game.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.400
this is the last hint that you can get above.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.740
Once you're on that pipe you can easily break the blocks, and climb up.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.289
Not only does the design of this level lead you to find out that you can walk in the ceiling,

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.330
but it also makes it very easy to stay on the ceiling and reach the warp zone.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.289
In contrast, you can get to the ceiling easily in 1-2 early on,

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.630
but the hints that you can do this are relatively weak.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.320
There's only one gap in the ceiling,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.580
and it's the very wide gap around the two elevators at the end,

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.960
which is distractingly dangerous.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.590
There's a block missing at the top right of the gap to make extra space

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:40.050
which looks more like extra room to make the jump to the exit pipe safer, and less like an invitation to jump on top,

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.220
and even if you did discover that you could walk on the ceiling earlier,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.160
this large gap forces you to jump down at this point.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.530
On the other hand once you realize there's a secret you can reach by running along the ceiling of 4-2,

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.789
it's immediately apparent that the same could apply to 1-2,

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:00.050
and at that point it's pretty much unmissable.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.300
After this, the discovery of the final warp zone as the beanstalk is kind of obscure.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.539
The key is finding one of the hidden coin blocks under the early outcropping.

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:13.440
There's not much reason to try jumping here normally.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.090
A goomba or a turtle here would make them very easy to run into,

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.160
so I think this space is deliberately plain.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.919
Once you do find one of the coins, you're likely to find the rest pretty quickly,

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.050
and there's a little additional puzzle about choosing the right order to reveal the coin blocks,

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.069
but this is kind of "icing on the cake".

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:33.470
The hard part is finding one of those blocks to begin with,

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.289
and as a hidden secret this is more or less unrelated to the other two warp zones.

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:42.490
I think the only reason it's in 4-2 is to keep them together for convenient use.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.729
So, once this has been learned you can quickly get to any world in the game that you want to play.

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:51.000
You also get the satisfaction of knowing the game's biggest secret,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.009
and you might have fun sharing it with your friends.

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:58.139
For me world 4-2 is the most important level in the game.

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:02.710
It made it worthwhile to explore the edges of the world, giving you a secondary goal besides just getting to the end,

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.340
and this principle becomes an integral part of later Mario games.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.099
Thanks for listening.
