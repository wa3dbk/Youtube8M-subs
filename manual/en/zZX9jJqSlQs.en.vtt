00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.130
Let's say this person is
lying here in front of me.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.870
And I'm thinking
about how the air is

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.830
passing through their
nose and their mouth

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.840
and entering their lungs.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.260
And specifically I'm interested
this time in how much

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.390
oxygen is actually getting
to their alveolar sacs.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.580
So, deep inside their lungs
they have these branches,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.150
they're conducting in
respiratory bronchials.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.750
But at the end, of course,
they have these alveolar

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.430
sacs that we've talked about.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.010
And I'm interested in thinking
about how much oxygen is really

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.120
down there at the very ends.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.300
And you have to excuse
this alveolar sac.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.200
It really is that.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.380
It looks a little bit like a
three-leaf clover, I guess.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.100
But that's the issue.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.972
How much oxygen is deep
down in here where the x is?

00:00:48.972 --> 00:00:50.180
So how do we figure this out?

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.630
I want to first
think about the air

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.080
this gentleman is breathing in.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.860
He's breathing in air
from the atmosphere.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.120
So this is atmospheric
pressure air.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.710
And we say ATM for short.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.480
And we know that atmospheric
pressure at sea level

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.130
is 760 millimeters of mercury.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.520
It's going to be lower
at higher altitudes.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.430
So, if you're at the
top of a mountain,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.140
it would be less than that.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.540
And this pressure is made up of
many, many different molecules

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.680
bouncing around.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.290
So, I've got some
molecules of oxygen.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.380
Let's say this is about 21%.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.080
This is my oxygen.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.760
And before I move on,
I should mention FiO2.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.690
You might come across this.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.360
And FiO2 stands for the
fraction-- which in this case

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.170
was 21% or 0.21--
fraction of inspired,

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.140
meaning how much oxygen
you took in or air you

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.500
took in-- fraction
of inspired oxygen.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.690
And the fraction happens to be
21%, which is, of course, much,

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.904
much lower than the nitrogen.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:54.570
Now nitrogen-- when
I draw it this way--

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.550
it's pretty impressive.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.250
All the purple is nitrogen.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.810
This is about 78% of
what you're breathing in.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.790
And the last little
tiny little bit,

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.190
I'm going to draw
the green line.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.120
This is mostly argon.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.900
And argon is-- in
Greek, it actually

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.850
comes from the term lazy.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.320
But it basically reminds
me when I think of that,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.340
that argon is not
going to do much.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.171
It's not going to react with
anything that is in our body.

00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:22.420
And of course, you have other.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.210
You have less than 1%.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.970
And this would be things
like carbon dioxide.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.180
So, this is a
breakdown of the air

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.180
that my friend is breathing in.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.170
This is my friend breathing.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.530
And if I want to now think
about how much oxygen

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.180
they're taking in,
all I have to do

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.360
is a little tiny bit of math.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.560
I can say OK, pO2-- this is the
partial pressure of oxygen--

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:55.110
is just 0.21, or 21%, times
760 millimeters of mercury.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.930
And this turns out to be
160 millimeters of mercury.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.030
Now, that oxygen kind of
goes down in his lungs.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.740
And it goes through his
trachea and into his-- all

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.450
the little bronchials and
down into the alveolar sac.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.950
And when it gets there--
on the way over there,

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.200
an interesting thing happens.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.790
The body temperature here
is 37 degrees Celsius.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.260
He's got a normal
body temperature.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.220
And what that does
is-- the air is

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.640
going through these
bronchials and trachea.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.370
And as it does, there's
a lot of moisture

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.300
in the respiratory tree.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.425
There's moisture there.

00:03:33.425 --> 00:03:34.800
And that moisture,
when it starts

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.210
heating up-- and of
course, 37 degrees

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.340
is pretty warm-- It's going to
start leaving the liquid phase

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.180
and going into the gas phase.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.680
So all of a sudden you
have now little molecules.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.510
I'm going to draw them
as little dots of water.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.660
That's here.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.660
And it's going to start
entering and mingling

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.750
with the gas that's
going through.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.420
So, the gas that got
taken in, that he inhaled

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.650
is now mingling.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.850
And what happens as a
result, is that water

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.340
has what we call
a vapor pressure.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.420
And that vapor pressure
is going to change

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.740
depending on the temperature.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.540
But at 37 degrees,
that vapor pressure

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.140
ends up being 47
millimeters of mercury.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.760
In other words, if the
temperature is 37 degrees,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.010
then we can expect that some
of those water molecules

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.230
will leave the liquid
and enter the gas phase.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.050
And it turns out that
the amount of molecules--

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.680
or the number of
molecules-- that leave

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.400
are going to generate
a pressure that

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.270
is 47 millimeters of mercury.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.000
And this is pretty standard.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.842
This is known off of a table.

00:04:40.842 --> 00:04:42.300
And in fact, if
you think about it,

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.720
if you just generated
lots of heat-- let's say

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.290
you actually were
boiling water--

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.010
that would be 100
degrees Celsius.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.590
And the vapor pressure
there would be very high,

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.520
because it's boiling.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.970
And it would be 760.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.360
So boiling is actually 760.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.530
So just keep that in mind.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.620
Boiling water has a
vapor pressure of--

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.950
And what do you think
760 reminds you of?

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.417
That is atmospheric pressure.

00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:12.250
So it's interesting.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.510
Vapor pressure is going to
equal atmospheric pressure

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.830
when you are boiling water.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.760
And that's actually exactly
what's happening as you boil.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.610
But I don't want to
get too distracted.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.350
We're not boiling water inside
of our bodies or our lungs.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.120
We're actually much
cooler than that.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.120
But we are warm.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.150
We're at 37 degrees.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.280
And so you do have some of these
little water molecules that

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.050
have entered the gas phase.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.190
And so if overall it's got
to be-- this whole thing

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.720
has got to be 760.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.120
So, on average,
our lung pressures

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.290
are going to be the same
as atmospheric pressure.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.280
But now you've got
water taking up 47.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.720
So if water's taking up 47,
the rest of those little gas

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.070
molecules have got to be 713.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.180
So this is the rest.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.450
What was in that rest?

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.950
It's going to be
the same as before.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.845
It's going to be-- and I'm
going to try to sketch it

00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:09.303
as best as possible--
this is going

00:06:09.303 --> 00:06:11.930
to be my oxygen right here.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.310
This is 21% of 713.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.910
And then we have lots and
lots of nitrogen still.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.600
Same kind of break
down as before.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.142
And remember this is all
air that is being inhaled.

00:06:25.142 --> 00:06:26.850
So we're not talking
about breathing out.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.590
We're just talking
about breathing in.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.360
And this purple right
here-- and this is 78%.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.206
Again, this is 78%
percent of 713.

00:06:35.206 --> 00:06:37.080
And we still have a
little bit of that argon,

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.515
and those other gases--
I won't write it all out,

00:06:39.515 --> 00:06:40.390
but you get the idea.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.840
That basically now
because water is taking up

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.880
some of the overall pressure,
all of the other gases

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.690
are going to have a
lower partial pressure.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.710
So what is the partial
pressure of the air that's

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.750
entering into that alveolar sac?

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:00.850
It's going to be basically
FiO2, which is 21%.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.730
I'll write that here.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.890
And then we have the
atmospheric pressure.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.960
This is atmospheric
pressure over here.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.510
And we said that was 760.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.730
We can draw a little arrow so
we know what's pointing to what.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.210
760 millimeters of mercury.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.960
And then, from that to account
for the partial pressure

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.610
of water.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.550
Because now we have some
water vapor in there.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.230
We have to subtract out 47.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.620
So, so far, if you've
kept up with this math,

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.400
you see that we have-- what
does that work out to be?

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.150
About 150 millimeters
of mercury.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:43.336
Now this is the partial pressure
of oxygen, at this spot.

00:07:43.336 --> 00:07:45.210
Let me just make it very
clear with my arrow,

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.190
not at this orange x.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.700
So far, we've
figured out that we

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.030
have a partial pressure that's
a little bit lower than when

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.280
we started.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.600
And that was because of the
partial pressure of water.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.630
Let's pick up there
in our next video.
