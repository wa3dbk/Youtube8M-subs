Pottery barn Party Planner
How to Make Custard Battered French Toast

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:08.650
hey guys it's ryan scott for party planner
with pottery barn I'm showing you some quick easy tricks

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.059
to make a simple fun and delicious brunch
what I'm gonna show you today is my version of not your

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.869
mama's normal French toast I'm gonna show you

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.460
how quick and how simple

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.920
And I'm gonna call it, custard battered French toast

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.570
the strawberries, hazelnuts, and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.419
a little bit of lavender actually this morning
okay so this going to be

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.599
a farmhouse brunch we want these to be hearty pieces,

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.200
one slice of french toast is really adequate
for one person

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.640
so what we're gonna do is slice these through 
I'm gonna set them on our platter over here,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.200
we're gonna make anglaise

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.410
let's go ahead and turn on our stove top real quick

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.770
and that's gonna get it ready to go grab a kind of a higher
saucepan a little thick in case it boils over

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.879
you want to make sure you have a little bit of surface space

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.089
we're going to go ahead and add some cream here, this is the body
to our anglaise this is what's going to give it  that rich

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.209
creamy thickness

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:54.440
and a little bit of milk

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.890
inside there too

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.970
the kicker which is going to be a pinch
of salt a lot of people don't think that

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.310
you add salt in pastries but this is what's going
to round it out

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.470
some sugar goes inside there

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.370
and a little tab of butter

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.500
in my house a little tab of butter is about
that

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.530
we add this to the stovetop bring this up, let it melt,
let the sugar melt let the butter melt

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.110
but what I wanted to show you was we didn't 
add in there. This is a vanilla bean. The vanilla bean's

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.880
gonna add a really great amount of flavor if you
don't have it vanilla extract is just fine too

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.110
I have that here but I want to show you real quick how
to go ahead and take the meat all the beautiful

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.789
little pods out of the vanilla bean
take your knife, your chef's knife,

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.309
slide it right down the middle of this
vanilla bean I'm cutting right down the middle all the way to the end

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:42.250
turn it over, and scrape all this delicious
goodness vanilla pod that you paid a couple bucks for

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.530
and it's all right there that's the vanilla bean
that's in your ice cream all the time I want to take this

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.570
gonna put this inside our base over here

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.110
then slide it inside as our base is getting 
ready to boil so what I want to do is mix it and make sure I get all that

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.850
vanilla bean and now this has come to a boil
I'm gonna cut this off turn it off and I'm going to grab my emma

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.929
collection bowl over here from pottery barn we're
going to add our egg yolks inside here 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.090
and I'm gonna take our delicious mixture, I want to tease like 
a tablespoon inside our egg yolks

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.520
basically now the egg yolks are saying

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.379
oh my goodness that's cream, that's cream

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.430
okay I'm fine with it now and now you've tempered it,

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.699
now you're just gonna pour the rest of the cream
as you guys can see I'm going a little slow

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:18.759
not all at once

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:24.869
add a little cream to the eggs, we're delicious mixed together
now let's take this guy put it back into the

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:26.019
pot

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.720
take it back to the stove top, low and slow do
not leave this egg yolk mixture

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.709
so my anglaise has now come up

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.819
it's thickened just like this this mixture is creamy,
delicious, and good, and this is what we're going to dip our french toast into.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.099
the butter is telling me that it's ready it's crackling
it's ready for some French toast spattered

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.280
with a little bit of custard

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.540
we're gonna go dunk, gonna flip it over and go dunk

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.590
take this

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.129
put it right inside there

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.329
I'm not gonna peek

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.309
you know I'm not going to peek, is because it's going to tell you
the side of the bread is going to start getting a little caramelized

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.100
the color

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.039
and that's when it's time to flip it over

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:02.999
another trick of the trade, flip away from
you so it doesn't splatter I want to just finish

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:06.069
cooking this french toast right on top, and
then we're going to serve it.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.679
so we're going to finish off with a little lavender
and powdered sugar little bit of strawberries

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:14.999
I added some crushed hazelnuts,
this is a fun, easy, and inexpensive way of making brunch

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:15.689
Enjoy guys.
