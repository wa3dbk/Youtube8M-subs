00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.680
Unity is usually a good thing.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.680
Usually.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.720
There’s synergy between the PSP and the
PS3, between the DS and Wii (though not that

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.130
much outside of Pokemon Battle Revolution),
between the XBox 360 and the possibly fifteen

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.920
Zunes left out in the wild.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.510
But here’s where it blossomed: A hunk of
wire that connected your GBA or GBASP to a

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.500
controller port on your Cube.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.530
Because of the volatile memory capacity of
the GBA, it was possible to use this functionality

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.370
to download games and applications to the
device, and by the end of the sixth console

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.390
generation a total of fifty-eight games would
eventually make use of this connectivity.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.690
Animal Crossing just elevated it to a whole
new level, with an entire island that could

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:09.050
be visited on the Cube, and then maintained
on the GBA.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.120
This concept of a personal screen proved appealing,
as certain games like Final Fantasy Crystal

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.160
Chronicles used it as a way for players to
manage their own inventories and menus in

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.840
the context of a multiplayer console RPG,
a concept that hadn’t been breached since...

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.560
well, since Secret of Mana back on the Super
NES.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.200
Pac-Man Vs., a four-player interpretation
of the arcade classic (featuring vocal work

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.590
by Charles Martinet, the same guy who’s
done Mario’s voice since the mid-90’s),

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.540
allows the Pac-Man player to play a familiar
maze on the GBA’s screen, while the 3 human-controlled

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.990
ghosts on the actual television hunt him down.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.680
And, of course, what mention of this link
cable would be complete without the TINGLE

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.680
TUNER.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.119
That’s right, take control of everyone’s
favorite awkward fey-ish creature and CARPETBOMB

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.530
HYRULE.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.860
WITH LOVE.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.240
Of course, the data connection works two ways.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.390
The Able Sisters in Animal Crossing are willing
to issue you a design application, downloadable

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.880
to the GBA, that lets you take your ability
to make patterns to wherever your muse may

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.430
be hiding, and then upload those back into
your game.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.480
Similarly, the Pokemon titles of its generation
used the link cable extensively, culminating

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.670
in Pokemon Box, a monster-management tool
for the 3rd generation games.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.200
This title was offered only through the real-life
Pokemon Center in New York City and through

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.870
the website of same; used copies currently
sell for upwards of $120.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.230
(And don’t I wish I had one.)

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.340
There’s kind of a high barrier to entry
- you need the cable, two systems, and appropriate

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.430
software - but the concept proved successful,
so much so that Nintendo’s building an entire

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.469
system around it.
