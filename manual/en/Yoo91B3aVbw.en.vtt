00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.690
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ketchum: So now we move into the stomach.
Let’s look at just characteristics of the

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.799
stomach to begin with. So the empty volume
of your stomach is about 50 milliliters. The full volume

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:17.230
is about 1,000 milliliters, which is the same as saying
one liter. The stomach secretes gastric juice,

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.880
and we’re going to be talking about what
that gastric juice is here in just a little

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.920
bit. And you have contractile smooth muscle
that lines the wall of your stomach. And what

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.900
that does is it helps pulverize or break down
your food particles and then mixes it with

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.900
the juice to form a mixture called chyme.
So it no longer completely resembles food

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.430
that you actually ingested. So let’s take
a look in to the components of the stomach.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.160
So there’s the fundus of the stomach—so
that’s this upper part of your stomach here,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.590
and it has a thin wall that easily expands
and it contains gastric pits.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.650
Below the fundus is the body of the stomach.
It has a gastric mucosa and it folds into

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.360
what are called rugae. What I want you to
do is to figure out what is the function of

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.290
the rugae? The antrum is the thickest portion
of the stomach. When it contracts, it propels

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.280
the chyme into the small intestine. We’re
going to refer to this as gastric emptying.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.220
Now there is one more section to the stomach
that I’ve not listen here for you, and that’s

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.710
the pylorus. And so that’s the last region
of the stomach that the food will have to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.440
pass through before passing into the small
intestine. So let’s zoom in on these gastric

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.920
pits for just a moment. The gastric pits contain
secretory cells. Secretory cells, based on

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.450
the name, you could guess they’re going
to secrete something. So the gastric pits

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.960
then go down into the wall of the stomach,
and there are lots of different types of cells

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.870
that are associated with the gastric pit.
So we have the mucus neck cells in blue, and

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.780
what the neck cells do is they secrete mucus,
which may help protect the lining of the stomach.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.700
Then we have the gastric glands, and they
contain a couple or a few different—well

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.780
three different cell types, at least. The
chief cells secrete pepsinogen. So pepsinogen

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:23.600
is a pepsin precursor. Pepsin is an enzyme
and this enzyme is a type of protease enzyme

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.670
that breaks down protein. Parietal cells are
going to secrete hydrochloric acid, and also

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.880
something called intrinsic factor. Intrinsic
factor is a really important—is really important

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.740
in the absorption of vitamin B12, and we’ll
come back to that later. The G cells secrete

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.849
a hormone called gastrin. So again, gastrin
is a hormone, very important in the regulation

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:52.849
of the gastrointestinal system. Now one thing
we want to focus on is why is the lumen acidic?

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.630
Well the lumen has to be acidic in order to
convert pepsinogen, remember that this is

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.569
our pepsin precursor, over to pepsin. If the
lumen is not acidic, pepsinogen will not be

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.239
converted to pepsin, and therefore pepsin
will not be active and you will not be able

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.319
to break down protein. So that’s one reason
why the lumen is acidic. The second reason

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.430
why the lumen is acidic is because it’s
going to kill any foodborne bacteria that

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.120
you have ingested. So if there was 
bacteria on the food that you ingested, the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.739
bacteria gets down into the stomach and the
acidic environment kills it.
