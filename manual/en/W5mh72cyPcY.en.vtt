00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.100
I wave at them

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.140
Has it been a week?

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.720
No

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.535
Its not even a day yet.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.755
Its been like one day

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.540
Its literally been like one day since you guys left Waterdeep

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.720
WHOA I CRIT!

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.320
So if that's the case, I touch myself so I have resistance to thunder

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.760
Ok, what? You touch yourself?

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.020
Oh my God! Jesus.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.120
Why...

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.040
What the heck are you doing right?!

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.080
I just finish off that guy.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.360
29

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:41.435
Oh shit...

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.500
Whenever I sing you guys sexual healing you get another one

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.860
I'm going to go towards where the captain is

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.440
I'm going to sit by the ledge and look out far into the distance and sigh

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.460
And try and strike up a conversation.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.278
You do like fighting?

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.280
I like girls...

00:01:02.638 --> 00:01:04.318
I like fighting girls...

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.260
It's when I murdered that child...

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.120
I mean that's not me, I don't know what you are talking about...

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.140
And after a couple minutes you see a guy dressed up like a butler

00:01:16.267 --> 00:01:19.627
come to you guys like, what were you doing in there?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.120
I'm looking for the person who lives here

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.100
I cast light on Gouken's arm.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.820
And I walk 50 feet that way.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.780
Why my arm?

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.720
So that it'll go to you instead

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.020
I go F this, let's go

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.780
And I look for herbs as we go.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.580
You were at full health..

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.982
No I had 40 to start off with...

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.320
You said you were full!

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.600
I had 40.

00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:59.811
Why would you want to sneak up to that guy at 40 health...

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.900
To take armor off. I have +8 in stealth!

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.444
I mean you fully see the pirate flag hanging from their ship.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.234
You sure it's not one of their crewmates?

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.060
Please persuade him

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.540
Alright.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.980
[Magical sounds!]

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.520
Satsuu, you're going to die...

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.300
Why?

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.860
You'll see...

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.420
Ahhhhhhhhh, so you're the one who rang the bell...

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.400
I know you want me to say get to the alley everytime

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.420
GET TO TEH ALLEY!

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.620
OH YEA!

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.700
So the Dwarves respond back to you

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.800
Ah, we haven't seen any Dwarves...

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.760
Or... I don't know what I'm saying...
