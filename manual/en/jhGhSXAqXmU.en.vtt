00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.360
Later in the unit, we'll study a system
with three pucks.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.400
There are potentially six degrees
of freedom here,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.840
but keeping the displacements
to the line of the springs

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.520
means that the symmetry
of the system restricts this

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.560
to three degrees of freedom,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.440
for which there are three normal modes.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.720
Let's return to the behaviour
of water molecules

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.040
that were introduced at the beginning
of this video band,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.200
and examine the way in which they can
be excited

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.840
by three particular microwave
frequencies.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.720
A water molecule is composed of
two hydrogen atoms,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.400
together with a single oxygen atom,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.480
so each water molecule is called H2O
by chemists.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.640
Although quantum mechanics is the
only accurate description of molecules,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.560
insight can be gained by considering a
Newtonian mechanics model.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.840
You can represent the forces between
the atoms as springs.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.440
Chemists usually represent molecules
by what's called a ball and stick model.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.920
Now, although the water molecule has
nine degrees of freedom,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.680
which give rise to nine normal modes,
six of these are trivial,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.720
in which the particles move as if they're
part of a rigid body.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.080
But there are three non-trivial
normal modes.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.080
The smallest,
normal mode angular frequency,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.160
corresponds to the normal mode where
two hydrogen swing from side to side,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.520
each with a sinusoidal motion.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.680
Note that the oxygen atom
hardly moves,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.160
since it's about sixteen times
more massive

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.560
than each of the two hydrogens.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.320
A second normal mode

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.600
has the hydrogens oscillating in-step
with each other,

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.720
along the bonds, again,
at microwave frequencies.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.240
We should also say that,
in this animation,

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.160
these oscillations are not only being
slowed down,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.800
they're also being wildly exaggerated,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.480
and the movement would be minute
compared to the length of the bond.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.960
And, finally, there's a resonant
frequency in which the hydrogen atoms

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.640
again oscillate in and out, but, this time,
exactly out of step with each other.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.000
So, all three normal modes
are present in water.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.160
When it's irradiated by microwaves,
the molecules vibrate,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.880
and, as you saw in unit 10,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.080
this corresponds to an increase
in temperature.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.760
So, the water gets hotter and hotter
until it boils.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.440
Normal modes are one of the most
applicable areas studied in MST207.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.800
However, the mechanical systems
usually studied

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.160
are only accessible by a computer.
