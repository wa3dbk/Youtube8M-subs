Are QHD Smartphones Needed?

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.870
Hey what's up guys Keaton here so for awhile
I've wanted to make this video, "Is QHD necessary?"

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.390
just because we see a lot of smartphones out
on the market packing the QHD display also

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.439
know as a 2.5K display and I'll talk about
that a little bit more in the next bit.

00:00:19.439 --> 00:01:08.660
We see the LG G3, Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Nexus
6 and OPPO Find 7 all 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:57.530
packing this new technology and I just really
want to answer the question, "Is QHD 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:16.340
helpful 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:03:10.319
or harmful and if it's going to make 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:42.360
your experience 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:04:33.170
that 
much better?"

00:04:33.170 --> 00:06:31.069
So yeah, lets 
go 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:46.809
ahead 
and 

00:06:46.809 --> 00:07:03.529
get started!
