00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.570
This K&amp;N Air Intake System is designed to
increase power and acceleration by reducing

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.250
restriction in the intake path.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:30.050
K&amp;N 63-2578 Air Intake comes with a carbon
fiber lid for easy filter access.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.030
This air intake fits 2011 and 2012 Ford Mustang
GT models with 5.0 liter engines.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.370
The 63-2578 air intake is not legal for highway
use in California or other states adopting

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.970
California emission standards.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.020
Check KNFilters.com for an up to date list
of models this air intake fits and for a list

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.320
of other CARB adoption states.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.000
K&amp;N power testing showed an estimate of power
gain of 20 horse power at 5,400 rpm with the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.250
63-2578 Air Intake installed on a 2012 Ford
Mustang GT with a 5.0 liter engine.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.170
Actual results will vary depending on condition
of the vehicle, mileage, weather, and other

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.810
variables.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.000
With the air intake installed, we ran the
vehicle on the dyno to test the sound comparison

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:40.510
versus the stock intake.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.120
The intake system includes components that
have been designed or matched to the needs

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.590
of these vehicles to produce a safe horse
power increase.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.030
