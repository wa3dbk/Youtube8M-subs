00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.660
I'm coming! Coming!

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.940
What kind of monster knocks at 7 am like that!?

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.120
Hi Twilight!

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.440
Oh, hi girls! I'm so glad to see you at this hour that barely contained, not to squeal on your head!

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.420
Look at the street, Twilight! It's snowy! Isn't it wonderful? It's so beautiful and ... and cool!

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.940
Snow fell month ago, what are you talking about, Scoot?

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.260
If the purpose of your visit is to inform me about the snow, then...

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.800
NO! Am...It is Twilight time now isn,t it?

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.120
No. What a he...

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.980
Let's go to make a snowman!

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.800
A snowman?

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.480
Yeah! We wanna make a big cool snowman with you!

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.520
It's gonna be the best one!

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.380
If I agree,will you leave me alone?

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.340
Are we really a problem for you?

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.660
Let's deal with it.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.980
AAAAAAAND its done!

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.740
See? Told you that it's gonna be the best one.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.100
That was really fun! Hey, maybe we could hang out later?

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.180
Aaaam...suuure!

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.260
It is reeeaaady

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.080
Well,that was pretty fun. Gotta go. Bye Twilight!

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:35.140
 Sweetie Belle, what were you doing so long?! I thought that I will die of boredom. I hate making snowmen ...

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.520
Hey! Try to find youself something in her library! I actually risked my life: her crazy dragon could easily tear me if woke up!

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.600
Anyway, I got it!

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.560
Oooh yeaaah! Now we will definitely get our cutie marks!

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.140
Ð’ark magic never let anyone down!

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.720
Are you sure that selling our souls in exchange for the cutie marks is a good idea?

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.220
CMC- necromancers YAAY!
