00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.250
So

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.500
You've done well for yourself

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.640
What?

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.119
What are... what are you... doing here? Is that how you greet your mother Trevor? I-I-I-I didn't know they let you out.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.370
So you never wrote to me... you never visited...

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.140
Well...

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.769
I bet you never found a girl!

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.979
Tell me... Trevor...

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:10.149
Are you gay?

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:11.709
No.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.300
Is that what this is all about?

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.160
No...

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.660
I wouldn't care.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.360
In fact, I've always wanted a gay son.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.360
A son who wouldn't forget about his mother.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.260
But Ma!

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.100
But Ma, but Ma, but Ma! Nothing!

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.570
Not a peep!

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.500
Carried you in here...

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.580
I fed you,

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.840
I weaned you,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.618
now look at you.

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.589
You always were an ungrateful,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.250
wretched,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.860
Sniveling sack of shit of a boy you know it and I know it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.670
There was always something wrong with you

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.320
ashamed of yourself!

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.309
ashamed of me, of your own mother!

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.009
I've been here for hours, and have you gotten me a drink?

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.819
Or a cigarette?

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.670
Or massaged my feet?

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.309
I'm an old woman and you in the prime of life

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.850
Have you nothing inside?

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.840
I am so sorry!

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.400
There, there, it's okay, son.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.320
Oh, that's enough!

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.780
Here I am,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.540
old and tired and alone.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.700
I'm so sorry for everything.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.100
Exactly for everything

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.800
I'm an old woman, Trevor.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.820
I don't got no insurance.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.780
Oh, I got money!

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.200
I don't want your goddamn money. Is that what you think I am a prostitute

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.920
still

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.920
You're sick

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.780
What can I do?

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.920
I'm in a lot of pain

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.180
I Need you to get me some more Deludamol.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.980
I can do that.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.920
A lot of them!

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.780
A truck load, literally!

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.920
and not those weeny little ones the thousand milligram ones, and if you find me a gentleman

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.530
Well we both know

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.040
You need a father figure

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.900
I got the meds Mom!

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.820
Mom!

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.300
I got the meds!

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.680
Ma?

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.460
Ma?

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.220
No! Mother!

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.480
Damn you fine, baby.
