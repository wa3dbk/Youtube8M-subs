00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.460
Hello, and welcome to XeMODeX.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.380
My name is Meriam.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.980
Today I'll introduce to you, our Pre-Programmed Brake Control Module for Volvo.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:44.000
Our BCM is the direct replacement for your original unit with the part number 8671224 stamped right on it.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:52.500
It will fit any 2002 to 2004 Volvo model, with or without tracs or stc.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.020
Pre-Programmed BCM are not available for cars with DSTC.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.900
For cars equipped with this option, we do offer the repair and return service.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.540
The most unique feature in the XeMODeX BCM, is that it comes pre-loaded with software.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.740
Eliminating the need for software reload after the part is installed in the car.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.460
That's right! Simply provide us with your VIN number. 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.640
And we will download the appropriate software to the BCM at our facility prior to shipping the part over to you.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.420
Once our BCM is installed in your car, it will work right away. A true "Plug and Play"!

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.360
Pre-Programmed BCM are not available at your local Volvo dealer. 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.140
They can only supply you with blank units that require expensive software reload.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.360
Another unique feature in the XeMODeX Brake Control Module is the addition of the aluminium cover. 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:02.020
This heat dissipating device keeps the coil driver cool and ensures a long lasting part. We guarantee it for life.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:11.800
Along with pre-programmed versions of our BCM, we also offer a repair and return service on all Volvo BCM modules.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.240
Units are tested and repair in the same day.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.860
